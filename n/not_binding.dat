5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are <b>not</b> <b>binding</b> on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly as regards the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Breyer has {{consistently}} {{voted in favor}} of abortion rights, {{one of the most controversial}} areas of the Supreme Court's docket. He has also defended the Supreme Court's use of foreign law and international law as persuasive (but <b>not</b> <b>binding)</b> authority in its decisions. However, Breyer is also recognized to be deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Supreme Court's First Amendment rulings. Breyer has also demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Supreme Court justice since 1994.|$|E

5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was <b>not</b> <b>binding</b> on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Henry's {{coronation}} Gerard {{was appointed}} to the recently vacant see of York, and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the see of Canterbury concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure papal recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland, but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, Anselm, over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was <b>not</b> <b>binding</b> on his successors. In the Investiture Controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.|$|E
5|$|State Senator Richard Madaleno {{requested}} in 2009 {{that the}} Attorney General {{answer the question}} of whether same-sex marriages could be recognized by the state. In February 2010, Doug Gansler issued an opinion after a nine-month analysis of state laws stating that valid same-sex marriages performed in other states that permit same-sex marriage could be recognized under Maryland law. Gansler stated that the opinion was <b>not</b> <b>binding</b> on the courts and state agencies could begin immediately to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. He said that he expected the opinion to be quickly challenged in court.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is <b>not</b> <b>binding.</b> Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E

5|$|Despite Australia's greater {{representation}} in London after 1923, Bruce's hope for collective imperial decision-making was dashed once {{more with the}} British decision to recognise the Soviet Union in 1924. This act dismayed the fervently anti-communist Bruce, who disagreed with the decision ideologically and {{on the grounds that}} once again the dominions had not been consulted. Ultimately, though, the differences between Britain's and her dominions' opinions on the matter were too great to be reconciled. Instead, Britain signed the General Treaty with the Soviet Union only on her own behalf, marking the first major split between Britain and Australia on a matter of foreign policy. Despite its applicability solely to European security arrangements, Bruce had criticised Britain's signing of the Locarno Treaties in 1925 without dominion consultation; though the eventual treaty was <b>not</b> <b>binding</b> on the dominions.|$|E

5|$|The 1925 General Assembly {{faced the}} threat of schism over {{the actions of the}} Presbytery of New York. Attempting to deescalate the situation, General Assembly {{moderator}} Charles Erdman proposed the creation of a special commission to study the church's problems and find solutions. The commission's report, released in 1926, sought to find a moderate approach to solving the church's theological conflict. In agreement with the Auburn Affirmation, the commission concluded that doctrinal pronouncements issued by the General Assembly were <b>not</b> <b>binding</b> without the approval of a majority of the presbyteries. In a defeat for conservatives, the report was adopted by the General Assembly. Conservatives were further disenchanted in 1929 when the General Assembly approved the ordination of women as lay elders.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{differs from}} the other {{institutions}} in that it alone has legislative initiative in the EU. Only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, no legislative act is allowed {{in the field of}} the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the other fields the Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right in some respects. However, the Council and Parliament may request the Commission to draft legislation, though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions. Under the Lisbon Treaty, EU citizens are also able to request the Commission to legislate in an area via a petition carrying one million signatures, but this is <b>not</b> <b>binding.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{powerful}} British jurist of the century, his decisions reflected the Age of Enlightenment and moved England {{on the path}} to abolishing slavery and the slave trade. He advanced commercial law in ways that helped establish the nation as the world leader in industry, finance and trade. He modernised both English law and the English courts system; he sped up the system for submitting motions and reformed the way judgments were given to reduce time and expense for the parties. For his work in Carter v Boehm and Pillans v Van Mierop, he has been called the founder of English commercial law. He is perhaps best known for his judgment in Somersett's Case (1772), where he held that slavery had no basis in common law and had never been established by positive law (legislation) in England, and therefore was <b>not</b> <b>binding</b> law (although this did not end slave trafficking altogether).|$|E

5|$|The {{report of}} the Commissioners was <b>not</b> <b>binding,</b> and the rivalry between {{supporters}} of the two routes intensified. An independent Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway was proposed, to build from Carlisle to meet the GPK, and the GPK itself proposed several branches, mostly for tactical reasons, to weaken or exclude the Caledonian Railway (CR), as the dominant supporter of the Annandale route. Of these only an extension from Kilmarnock to Horsecleugh, south of the mining town of Old Cumnock was authorised, by Act of 21 July 1845. The CR case was strengthened by its intended branch to Edinburgh; moreover locomotive designs were being improved, {{and the capacity to}} haul trains over the steep gradients of the Annandale route was diminishing in importance. In Parliamentary hearings in 1845, the Caledonian Railway passed the Commons and despite the GPK fighting on in the Lords, the Caledonian Railway was authorised, in preference to the Nithsdale route, on 31 July 1845.|$|E
5|$|Clashes {{over the}} {{interpretation}} and {{legality of the}} Petition began almost immediately, with the Lords and Commons arguing with the King as early as 20 June 1628, leading to the prorogation of Parliament on the 26th. The Petition of Right was not a formal statute, and despite it being reaffirmed as a bill by the Long Parliament in 1641, {{the legal status of}} the initial Petition has been debated. It has been considered a declaratory act, a private bill, or simply a petition, which permitted an individual harmed by the government to take action against the crown. A petition is the oldest form of Parliamentary proceeding, and the one through which most early statutes were originally passed; the King would be petitioned to take action by Members of Parliament, and would assent to their request; laws passed in this way include Magna Carta and the Statute of Westminster. Whether or not this made it legally binding was debated. Modern historians have either taken two positions on the matter. Either the recognition of the Petition was a judicial matter and at best a private bill, and as such it was <b>not</b> <b>binding</b> on the King or on Parliament, or it had the strength of a public bill; it was a legislative act, and as such legally binding.|$|E
