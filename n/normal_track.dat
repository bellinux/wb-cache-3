5|$|Andres {{originated}} from a disturbance that slowly organized and formed into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm {{status as a}} second circulation formed north-northwest of the initial circulation. However, the former circulation became dominant, and Andres intensified slightly. After {{a brief period of}} a <b>normal</b> <b>track</b> to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten Central America. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the Caribbean Sea, Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since record-keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres then turned back to the northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near San Salvador on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Turnouts, {{also known}} as points and switches, are the means of {{directing}} a train onto a diverging section of track. Laid similar to <b>normal</b> <b>track,</b> a point typically consists of a frog (common crossing), check rails and two switch rails. The switch rails may be moved left or right, {{under the control of}} the signalling system, to determine which path the train will follow.|$|E
30|$|Given a {{threshold}} ξ, if C(k)[*]>[*]ξ, {{the target is}} considered as completely occluded or disappeared; if C(k)[*]<[*]ξ, the target is in the <b>normal</b> <b>tracking</b> state or partial occlusion state.|$|R
50|$|Troop G, 15th Cavalry Regiment {{arrived in}} Vietnam on 1971-12-15. For this {{security}} assignment, Troop G {{was equipped with}} M-551 Sheridan Assault Vehicles in place of their <b>normal</b> <b>Tracked</b> Vehicles.|$|R
30|$|The {{status of}} the target can be {{determined}} by dividing the sub-regions. When the target is in <b>normal</b> <b>tracking</b> or partially occluded, the classifier only updates the unblocked sub-region to avoid the error of the classifier updating occlusion information.|$|R
25|$|All New Haven Line {{electric}} trains {{change over}} between third rail and overhead catenary between Mount Vernon East and Pelham, at <b>normal</b> <b>track</b> speed. Inbound trains to Grand Central lower their pantographs in this area, while outbound trains raise them; the third rail shoes {{stay in the}} same position {{both in and out of}} third rail territory. Both catenary and third rail overlap for a quarter-mile between Mount Vernon East and Pelham to facilitate this changeover.|$|E

2500|$|In 1946 Lenmetroproyekt was created, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of M A Samodurov, to finish the construction of the metro first phase. A new version of the metro project, devised by specialists, identified two new solutions to the problems to be encountered during the metro construction. Firstly, stations were to be built at a level slightly raised above that of <b>normal</b> <b>track</b> so as to prevent drainage directly into them, whilst the average tunnel width was to be reduced from the [...] standard of the Moscow Metro to [...]|$|E
50|$|In a new {{innovation}} the BBC introduced interactive services, {{which enabled}} UK viewers to access {{features such as}} a statistical predictor, archive footage of previous Nationals and a split-screen view of the race itself to enable viewers to watch the race from the air {{as well as the}} <b>normal</b> <b>tracking</b> cameras.|$|R
50|$|Inbound trains {{switched}} {{back to the}} <b>normal</b> inbound <b>track</b> on July 1, 2014; outbound trains {{began using}} the <b>normal</b> outbound <b>track</b> on July 21. The station opened to passengers on September 2, 2014, although some final construction work lasted until November. On {{the first day of}} operations, the station platform flooded from a rainstorm.|$|R

5000|$|In {{this song}} Bushido uses single words that rhyme instead of {{complete}} sentences. Bushido confirmed {{in an interview}} that he wanted, besides twenty <b>normal</b> <b>tracks,</b> another track that sounde formd different. He also said that on paper, it doesn't make sense at first glance, but when people listen to it they will understand what's going on. [...] The song was featured on his album Von der Skyline zum Bordstein zurück.|$|R
40|$|We {{address a}} fault {{tolerant}} control (FTC) issue about an {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) under possible simultaneous actuator saturation and faults occurrence. Firstly, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models representing nonlinear flight control systems (FCS) for an UAV with unknown disturbances and actuator saturation are established. Then, a <b>normal</b> H-infinity <b>tracking</b> controller is presented using an online estimator, which is introduced to weaken the saturation effect. Based on the <b>normal</b> <b>tracking</b> controller, we propose an adaptive fault tolerant tracking controller (FTTC) to solve actuator loss of effectiveness (LOE) fault problem. Compared with previous work, this approach developed in our research need not rely on any fault diagnosis unit and is easily applied in engineering. Finally, these results in simulation indicate the efficiency of our presented FTC scheme...|$|R
5000|$|Roller coaster {{elements}} are the individual parts of roller coaster design and operation, {{such as a}} track, hill, loop, or turn. Variations in <b>normal</b> <b>track</b> movement that add thrill or excitement to the ride are often called [...] "thrill elements" [...] or [...] "thrill factor".|$|E
5000|$|Early review {{versions}} of the album sent by Accidental Records before the Rough Trade deal included an additional song called [...] "Worst Bastard" [...] (likely removed for being the only song containing obscenities) and listed [...] "Hardcore" [...] as a <b>normal</b> <b>track</b> rather than a bonus track.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>normal</b> <b>track</b> regime: {{the signals}} {{are located on}} {{the left of the}} track. However, in some cases, the {{configuration}} of the environment precludes placing signs on the left track. They are then placed on the right and have an arrow (white arrow on a blue disc).|$|E
30|$|Java Native Interface (JNI) {{is a kind}} of {{mechanism}} of Java program and native code library interaction. Through this mechanism, Java code can easily call other databases written with other languages (typically C and C++). For dynamic taint tracking, when carrying on the JNI call, the code would transfer from the Java layer to the C/C++ layer, it will affect the <b>normal</b> <b>tracking</b> of tainted data which needs to appropriate process to C/C++ library involved.|$|R
50|$|The ICE3 is a German {{high-speed}} {{train that}} runs between Amsterdam and Utrecht in the Netherlands, onto Frankfurt and Cologne in Germany. ICE trains require special high-speed tracks {{to run at}} high speeds, but can also run on <b>normal</b> <b>tracks</b> at <b>normal</b> speeds. The ICE 3M (class 406) is a multisystem variant of the ICE 3 that currently serves routes into the Netherlands and Belgium from the main ICE network in Germany.|$|R
5000|$|The Gemmenich Tunnel (Gemmenicher Tunnel, Tunnel de Botzelaer) passing {{under the}} [...] (Three country point) {{has a special}} track layout to enable the passage of wide {{military}} loads. The double-track tunnel has a third set of rails interlaced {{with one of the}} <b>normal</b> <b>tracks.</b> [...] Active points (switches) {{at each end of the}} tunnel allow a train to divert along the central track, whilst other trains are blocked by signalling. The third track is rarely in use, so there is no limitation of capacity through the tunnel for standard-sized trains.|$|R

5000|$|A {{non-removable}} RK05F {{was also}} produced. By [...] "fixing" [...] the otherwise removable cartridge in place, {{it was able}} to avoid the cartridge-to-cartridge compatibility problems that limited the capacity of the ordinary RK05. As a result, it could operate at twice the <b>normal</b> <b>track</b> density, doubling the capacity of the drive to about 5MB.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{suburban}} trains towards Gawler are cross to the southbound track at Salisbury Interchange, and use Platform 2 {{rather than the}} usual northbound Platform 1. This gives passengers more convenient cross-platform access to the bus stops and {{eliminates the need for}} alighting passengers to cross the rail tracks. Trains revert to their <b>normal</b> <b>track</b> on departure.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- A {{research}} {{has been carried out}} finalised to the definition of a methodology useful to detect and track moving targets in video sequences. Algorithms performing this task have been also developed for real time monitoring and surveillance purposes. Due to deformations occurring in the appearance of the target in the videos, a Hierarchical Artificial Neural Network (HANN) has been used to recognize target occlusion or masking, and to increase the <b>normal</b> <b>tracking</b> performance. Preliminary results are presented regarding both identification and tracking of animal moving at night in an open environment, and the surveillance of known scenes for unauthorized access control...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel (racked mechanism, called as "rotatory crawler", {{which can be}} applied to mobile robots in {{irregular}} environment. The foremost innovation in this crawler is that it adopts a planetary gear reducer and a triangular gear reducer as power transmission. The characters of the planetary gear reducer enable the crawler to provide two outputs in different form only by one actuator. The rotatory crawler can move on flat ground like a <b>normal</b> <b>tracked</b> vehicle, it also can overcome high obstacles such as steps or stairs by rotating its both sides of crawler units wholly.

50|$|The {{component}} <b>normal</b> to the <b>track</b> acts {{together with}} the much larger component of gravitational force <b>normal</b> to the <b>track</b> and is generally neglected. It can slightly increase the vertical load seen by the vehicle suspension {{but it does not}} create lateral acceleration as perceived by passengers or and does not cause lateral deflection of the vehicle suspension.|$|R
