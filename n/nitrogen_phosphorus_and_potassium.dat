500|$|Nepenthes rajah is a {{carnivorous}} plant and, as such, supplements nutrients {{gained from the}} soil with captured prey (especially insects) to alleviate deficiencies in important elements such as <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>and</b> <b>potassium.</b> Just as in nature, a cultivated plant's 'diet' may include insects and other prey items, although this is not necessary for successful cultivation. Crickets are recommended for their size and low cost. These can be purchased online or at specialist pet stores.

2500|$|NPK {{rating is}} a rating system {{describing}} {{the amount of}} <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>phosphorus,</b> <b>and</b> <b>potassium</b> in a fertilizer. NPK ratings consist of three numbers separated by dashes (e.g., 10-10-10 or 16-4-8) describing the chemical content of fertilizers. The first number represents the percentage of nitrogen in the product; the second number, P2O5; the third, [...] K2O. Fertilizers do not actually contain P2O5 or K2O, but the system is a conventional shorthand {{for the amount of}} the phosphorus (P) or potassium (K) in a fertilizer. A [...] bag of fertilizer labeled 16-4-8 contains [...] of nitrogen (16% of the 50 pounds), an amount of phosphorus equivalent to that in 2 pounds of P2O5 (4% of 50 pounds), and 4 pounds of K2O (8% of 50 pounds). Most fertilizers are labeled according to this N-P-K convention, although Australian convention, following an N-P-K-S system, adds a fourth number for sulfur, and uses elemental values for all values including P and K.|$|E

25|$|In all the studied cases, carnivory allows {{plants to}} grow and {{reproduce}} using animals {{as a source of}} <b>nitrogen,</b> <b>phosphorus</b> <b>and</b> possibly <b>potassium.</b> However, there is a spectrum of dependency on animal prey. Pygmy sundews are unable to use nitrate from soil because they lack the necessary enzymes (nitrate reductase in particular). Common butterworts (Pinguicula vulgaris) can use inorganic sources of nitrogen better than organic sources, but a mixture of both is preferred. European bladderworts seem to use both sources equally well. Animal prey makes up for differing deficiencies in soil nutrients.|$|R

In this sense, {{the aim of this}} study was to perform the mapping of the dry mass production, <b>nitrogen</b> accumulation, <b>phosphorus</b> <b>and</b> <b>potassium</b> in the Tifton 85, and evaluate their correlations with the chemical attributes in different layers of the soil profile. The study was carried out in an area of 4. 3 ha constituted of Tifton 85 in the city of Vista Gaucha - RS, Brazil, during the months from October to December in the year of 2012. The experimental area was georeferenced and divided into a sample mesh of 50 x 50 m, resulting in 16 sampling points. It was conducted two cuts on Tifton 85 to evaluate the dry mass production. Soil sampling was done in the layers from 0. 00 - 0. 10 m, 0. 10 - 0. 20 and 0. 20 - 0. 40 m. The data were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis and linear correlation matrix of Pearson, being the results specialized in thematic maps.
