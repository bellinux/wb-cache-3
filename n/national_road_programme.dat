Adopted by the government in 2005 Poland’s <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> Safety <b>Programme</b> GAMBIT 2005 was the response to the EU’s 3 rd <b>Road</b> Safety Action <b>Programme.</b> Despite extensive <b>road</b> safety efforts, the goal of Programme will not be fully met mainly due to lack of political and operational leadership and poor cooperation between road safety bodies. Work on a new <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> Safety <b>Programme</b> for the years 2013 - 2020 began in 2012 and were carried out by the <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> Safety Council. The authors of the paper supported the works, so that new strategy draws on the experience from the previous programme GAMBIT 2005 and addresses the challenges brought by European Union programmes and UN programmes. As a results this strategy follows several key principles like: system-based approach to road safety management setting final and interim targets road safety improvement based on “Vision Zero” and “Safe system” with strategic interventions comprising the basic pillars of safety: road safety management, safe road, safe vehicle, safe road users, post crash response focussing on the main road safety problems when identifying the priority interventions integrated approach to the selection of specific measures based on the 3 E principle...|$|R

In total, the creation and start of nine such systems has been proposed, namely: the Road Safety Management, the Integrated Road Rescue Service, the Personnel Continuing Education, the Hazardous Road Behaviour Monitoring, the Social Education for Safe Behaviour on Road, the Teaching Personnel Improvement, the Area Development and Planning Process Improvement, the Road Infrastructure Design Quality Improvement, and the Road and Traffic Management Process Efficiency Improvement.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} the road safety in Latin American developing countries, focusing mainly on Bolivia. To give the layman an overview, the general road traffic problem is explained. The factors on which road safety depends are described, {{as well as}} the degree in which the accident causes - human, vehicle and environment - are involved in a road crash. For the purpose of an uniform understanding of the term developing countries, they are defined from a traffic point of view. Thereafter, different definitions of the term crash are discussed. To make it possible to compare the countries with dissimilar crash definitions, the required adjustment factors are exposed. The countries are classified in three groups depending on the number of motor vehicles per 1000 inhabitants. Bolivia as the emphasis of the study is described in detail. First general facts are presented, so the reader knows what type of country Bolivia is. Secondly, the amplitude and sort of the network is explained. After this, the traffic incidents, i. e. number, type and cause, are summarised. To be able to propose some measures for the enhancement of the traffic situation it is essential to analyse the actual state. This is done in the next step. The most important existing regulations are described {{as well as the}} safety campaigns which were introduced in the past. Based on this, proposals to improve the safety are listed. As speeding and driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} are the main accident causes, countermeasures for them are proposed. These are classified into engineering, enforcement and education. The report ends with a discussion of implementation difficulties of such countermeasures. Eventually the conclusions from the paper are presented.
