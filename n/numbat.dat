5|$|Major {{populations of}} three nationally {{endangered}} species {{exist in the}} woodlands: the woylie, the red tailed phascogale, and over 50 {{percent of the total}} known population of <b>numbat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since 2006, Project <b>Numbat</b> {{volunteers have}} helped to save the <b>Numbat</b> from extinction. One of Project Numbat’s main {{objectives}} is to raise funds that go towards conservation projects, and to raise awareness through presentations held by volunteers at schools, community groups and events.|$|E
25|$|An {{intensive}} {{research and}} conservation program since 1980 {{has succeeded in}} increasing the <b>numbat</b> population substantially, and reintroductions to fox-free areas have begun. Perth Zoo is very closely involved in breeding this native species in captivity for release into the wild. Despite the encouraging degree of success so far, the <b>numbat</b> remains at considerable risk of extinction and is classified as an endangered species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Numbats</b> {{breed in}} February and March, {{normally}} producing one litter a year, although they {{can produce a}} second if the first is lost. Gestation lasts 15 days, and results in the birth of four young. Unusually among marsupials, female <b>numbats</b> have no pouch, although the four teats are protected by a patch of crimped, golden hair and by the swelling of the surrounding abdomen and thighs during lactation.|$|R
25|$|Today, <b>numbats</b> {{are found}} only in areas of {{eucalypt}} forest, but they were once more widespread in other types of semiarid woodland, Spinifex grassland, and even in terrain dominated by sand dunes.|$|R
50|$|Hollows in fallen timber {{are also}} very {{important}} for animals such as echidnas, <b>numbats,</b> chuditch and many reptiles. In streams, hollow logs may be important to aquatic animals for shelter and egg attachment.|$|R
25|$|Two {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{but one of}} these, {{the rusty}} <b>numbat</b> (M. f. rufus), has been extinct {{since at least the}} 1960s, and only the nominate subspecies (M. f. fasciatus) remains alive today. As its name implies, the rusty <b>numbat</b> was said to have a more reddish coat than the surviving subspecies. Only {{a very small number of}} fossil specimens are known, the oldest dating back to the Pleistocene, and no fossils belonging to other species from the same family have yet been discovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{two small}} Western Australia populations {{apparently}} {{were able to}} survive because both areas have many hollow logs that may serve as refuge from predators. Being diurnal, the <b>numbat</b> is much more vulnerable to predation than most other marsupials of a similar size: its natural predators include the little eagle, brown goshawk, collared sparrowhawk and carpet python. When the Western Australia government instituted an experimental program of fox baiting at Dryandra (one of the two remaining sites), <b>numbat</b> sightings increased {{by a factor of}} 40.|$|E
25|$|At night, the <b>numbat</b> {{retreats to}} a nest, {{which can be}} in a hollow log or tree, or in a burrow, {{typically}} a narrow shaft 1–2 m long which terminates in a spherical chamber lined with soft plant material: grass, leaves, flowers and shredded bark. The <b>numbat</b> is able to block the opening of its nest, with the thick hide of its rump, to prevent a predator being able to access the burrow. Numbats have relatively few vocalisations, but {{have been reported to}} hiss, growl, or make a repetitive 'tut' sound when disturbed.|$|E
50|$|Located in Koala Junction, Gum Leaf Hideout {{is home to}} the zoo's {{collection}} of <b>numbats,</b> koalas, Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos, and short-beaked echidnas. The exhibit also features interactive displays that teach visitors about the devastating effects of deforestation on Australian ecosystems.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor is {{probably}} {{best known for her}} sculptures of animals, such as birds, <b>numbats,</b> snakes, the echidna, and the perentie lizard. The animals all have spiritual [...] legends attached to them, and each represents a different creation ancestor from the Dreamtime.|$|R
50|$|The Numtums {{is about}} a group of 10 multicolored creatures who live in Gumnut Gorge called the Numtums with numbers on their tummies. The Numtums are based on <b>numbats,</b> hence their fondness for eating {{termites}} in their café, the Tasty Termite, and they are named after Australian towns, except Champer.|$|R
25|$|Until European colonisation, the <b>numbat</b> {{was found}} across {{most of the}} area from the New South Wales and Victorian borders west to the Indian Ocean, and {{as far north as}} the {{southwest}} corner of the Northern Territory. It was at home {{in a wide range of}} woodland and semiarid habitats. The deliberate release of the European red fox in the 19th century, however, wiped out the entire <b>numbat</b> population in Victoria, NSW, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and almost all numbats in Western Australia, as well. By the late 1970s, the population was well under 1,000 individuals, concentrated in two small areas not far from Perth, Dryandra, and Perup.|$|E
25|$|The <b>numbat</b> synchronises its {{day with}} termite activity, which is {{temperature}} dependent: in winter, it feeds from midmorning to midafternoon; in summer, it rises earlier, takes shelter during {{the heat of}} the day, and feeds again in the late afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Perth Zoo, {{located in}} South Perth, houses {{a variety of}} Australian and exotic animals from around the globe. The zoo is home to highly {{successful}} breeding programs for orangutans and giraffes, and participates in captive breeding and reintroduction efforts {{for a number of}} Western Australian species, including the <b>numbat,</b> the dibbler, the chuditch, and the western swamp tortoise.|$|E
50|$|The {{spread of}} the red fox {{population}} corresponds with declines {{in the distribution of}} several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbies, <b>numbats,</b> bridled nailtail wallabies and quokkas. Most of these species now only live in limited areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare.|$|R
5|$|Anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, {{echidnas}} and <b>numbats</b> {{have special}} adaptations for {{living on a}} diet of ants. These adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) {{have been found to}} feed on ants. About 12%, 16%, and 4% of their faecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is composed of ants.|$|R
25|$|Working {{with the}} Department of Environment and Conservation, Perth Zoo breeds {{threatened}} Western Australian animal species for release into managed areas of habitat {{in the wild}} {{as part of its}} Native Species Breeding Program. As of 2011, Perth Zoo breeds <b>numbats,</b> western swamp tortoises, dibblers, woylies and threatened Western Australia frog species including the sunset frog, the white-bellied frog and the orange-bellied frog.|$|R
25|$|The {{species is}} not {{closely related to}} other extant marsupials; the current {{arrangement}} in the order Dasyuromorphia places its monotypic family with the diverse and carnivorous species of Dasyuridae. A closer affinity with the extinct thylacine, contained in the same order, has been proposed. Genetic studies have shown the ancestors of the <b>numbat</b> diverged from other marsupials between 32 and 42 million years ago, during the late Eocene.|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>numbat</b> finds termite mounds {{primarily}} using scent, it has {{the highest}} visual acuity of any marsupial, and, unusually for marsupials, has {{a high proportion of}} cone cells in the retina. These are both likely adaptations for its diurnal habits, and vision does appear to be the primary sense used to detect potential predators. Numbats regularly enter a state of torpor, which may last up to fifteen hours a day during the winter months.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>numbat</b> has {{relatively}} powerful claws for its size, it is {{not strong}} enough to get at termites inside their concrete-like mounds, and so must wait until the termites are active. It uses a well-developed sense of smell to locate the shallow and unfortified underground galleries that termites construct between the nest and their feeding sites; these are usually only a short distance {{below the surface of the}} soil, and vulnerable to the numbat's digging claws.|$|E

50|$|Myrmecophagy {{is found}} {{in a number of}} land-dwelling {{vertebrate}} taxa, including reptiles and amphibians (horned lizards and blind snakes, narrow-mouthed toads of the family Microhylidae and poison frogs of the Dendrobatidae), a number of New World bird species (Antbirds, Antthrushes, Antpittas, flickers of genus Colaptes), and several mammalian groups (anteaters, aardvarks, aardwolves, pangolins, sloth bears, and many armadillos, <b>numbats</b> and echidnas, for instance).|$|R
50|$|The reserve protects {{one of the}} few {{remaining}} remnants of Wandoo woodland in the south-west of the state. Mammals recorded from the reserve include the western grey kangaroo, common brushtail possum and western brush wallaby, and there is evidence that <b>numbats</b> are present. Many woodland birds have been recorded, including scarlet, red-capped and western yellow robins, jacky winter and regent parrot.|$|R
25|$|The numbat(Myrmecobius fasciatus) Western Australia's mammal emblem {{and one of}} {{only two}} diurnal marsupials, the <b>numbat</b> is the only Australian mammal to feed {{exclusively}} on termites. Despite the establishment of several populations by the Department of Environment and Conservation, it is still classified as endangered by the IUCN. Perth Zoo has been breeding numbats for release into the wild since 1986. The first successful birth was in 1993. By early 2011, 165 numbats had been provided by the zoo for release into protected habitat.|$|E
25|$|The Australia Bushwalk takes {{visitors}} on {{a journey}} through the Australian landscape where they can see dingoes, emus, koalas, red-legged pademelons, numbats, quokkas, red kangaroos, short-beaked echidnas, southern hairy-nosed wombats, tammar wallabys, Tasmanian devils, and western grey kangaroos. A detour takes visitors to the Western Australian Black Cockatoo exhibit, planted with cockatoo food trees and home to Baudin's cockatoo, Carnaby's cockatoo, Major Mitchell's cockatoo, Muir's corella, red-tailed black cockatoo, and red-capped parrot. Another detour takes visitors to the Numbats Under Threat exhibit, which showcases the endangered Australian <b>numbat</b> along with rufous whistlers.|$|E
25|$|Like many ant-eating animals, the <b>numbat</b> has {{an unusually}} long, narrow tongue, coated with sticky saliva {{produced}} by large submandibular glands. A further {{adaptation to the}} diet {{is the presence of}} numerous ridges along the soft palate, which apparently help to scrape termites off the tongue so they can be swallowed. The digestive system is relatively simple, and lacks many of the adaptations found in other entomophagous animals, presumably because termites are easier to digest than ants, having a softer exoskeleton. Numbats are apparently able to gain a considerable amount of water from their diets, since their kidneys lack the usual specialisations for retaining water found in other animals living in their arid environment. Numbats also possess a sternal scent gland, which may be used for marking their territories.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the spatial defecation patterns of <b>numbats</b> within captivity and tested the efficacy of a food colorant as a fecal marker in this species. Rather than randomly distributing scats throughout their environment, the <b>numbats</b> aggregated their feces at specific sites forming latrines. It is unclear whether the strong inclination for latrine formation was due to this species 2 ̆ 7 inherent behavior or {{is a direct result}} of captivity. Males were found to have a higher daily defecation rate, different defecation time, larger number of latrines, and greater number of scats per quadrant, as compared to females. In this study, the majority of scats were deposited along enclosure boundaries and for both sexes there was a higher probability of latrines being placed along enclosure fencing shared with a female neighbor. The high concentration of latrines along boundaries suggests that they may play a role in territorial defense. The results also indicated that captive <b>numbats</b> tend to choose defecation points away from food and refuge sites. Transit and total retention time of the marker through the GIT was ≤ 3 hr and between 24 and 27 hr, respectively. A marker dose of 3 gtts feed- 1 × 2 feeds day- 1 was required to reach a steady and detectable state of marker output, which enabled accurate identification of individual samples during the breeding season. Reliable labeling was obtained using blue and red colored food dye, and there was no evidence that incorporation of the marker into the diet had any negative effects on food intake...|$|R
25|$|Adult <b>numbats</b> are solitary and territorial; an {{individual}} {{male or female}} establishes a territory of up to 1.5 square km (370 acres) early in life, and defends it from others of the same sex. The animal generally remains within that territory from then on; male and female territories overlap, and in the breeding season, males will venture outside their normal home ranges to find mates.|$|R
25|$|Australia has a rich {{mammalian}} fossil history, {{as well as}} {{a variety}} of extant mammalian species, dominated by the marsupials,currently however there is limited taxonomic research into Australia’s mammals. The fossil record shows that monotremes have been present in Australia since the Early Cretaceous 145–99 MYA, and that marsupials and placental mammals date from the Eocene 56–34 MYA, when modern mammals first appeared in the fossil record. Although marsupials and placental mammals did coexist in Australia in the Eocene, only marsupials have survived to the present. The placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Miocene, when Australia moved closer to Indonesia, and bats and rodents started to appear reliably in the fossil record. The marsupials evolved to fill specific ecological niches, and in many cases they are physically similar to the placental mammals in Eurasia and North America that occupy similar niches, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. For example, the top predator in Australia, the Tasmanian tiger, bore a striking resemblance to canids such as the gray wolf; gliding possums and flying squirrels have similar adaptations enabling their arboreal lifestyle; and the <b>numbat</b> and anteaters are both digging insectivores. For the most part, mammals are not a highly visible part of the faunal landscape, as most species are nocturnal and many arboreal. Furthermore, there are few extant large ground-dwelling species.|$|E
2500|$|Numbats are {{insectivores}} and eat {{an exclusive}} diet of termites. An adult <b>numbat</b> requires up to 20,000 termites each day. The only marsupial fully active by day, the <b>numbat</b> {{spends most of}} its time searching for termites. [...] It digs them up from loose earth with its front claws and captures them with its long, sticky tongue. Despite its banded anteater name, it apparently does not intentionally eat ants; although the remains of ants have occasionally been found in <b>numbat</b> dung, these belong to species that themselves prey on termites, so were presumably eaten accidentally, along with the main food. Known predators on numbats include carpet pythons, introduced red foxes, and various falcons, hawks, and eagles.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>numbat</b> (Myrmecobius fasciatus), {{also known}} as the banded anteater, {{marsupial}} anteater, [...] or walpurti, is a marsupial native to Western Australia and recently re-introduced to South Australia. Its diet consists almost exclusively of termites. Once widespread across southern Australia, its range is now restricted to several small colonies, and it is listed as an endangered species. The <b>numbat</b> is an emblem of Western Australia and protected by conservation programs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Numbats</b> were {{formerly}} found across southern Australia from Western Australia {{across as}} far as northwestern New South Wales. However, their range has decreased significantly since the arrival of Europeans, and the species has survived only in two small patches {{of land in the}} Dryandra Woodland and the Perup Nature Reserve, both in Western Australia. In recent years, however, it has been successfully reintroduced into a few fenced reserves, including some in South Australia (Yookamurra Sanctuary) and New South Wales (Scotia Sanctuary).|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{insectivores}} include {{different kinds}} of species of carp, frogs, lizards (e.g. chameleons), nightingales, swallows, echidnas, <b>numbats,</b> anteaters, armadillos, aardvarks, pangolins, aardwolfs,bats, and spiders. Even large mammals are recorded as eating insects; the sloth bear is perhaps the largest insectivore. Insects also can be insectivores; examples are dragonflies, hornets, ladybugs, and praying mantises. Insectivory also features to various degrees amongst primates, such as marmosets, tamarins, tarsiers, galagos and aye-aye. There is some suggestion that the earliest primates were nocturnal, arboreal insectivores.|$|R
