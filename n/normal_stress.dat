25|$|Solids, liquids, and gases have stress fields. Static fluids support <b>normal</b> <b>stress</b> {{but will}} flow under shear stress. Moving viscous fluids can support shear stress (dynamic pressure). Solids can support both shear and <b>normal</b> <b>stress,</b> with ductile {{materials}} failing under shear and brittle materials failing under <b>normal</b> <b>stress.</b> All materials have temperature dependent variations in stress-related properties, and non-Newtonian materials have rate-dependent variations.|$|E
25|$|A {{free surface}} is {{the surface of}} a fluid that is subject to both zero {{perpendicular}} <b>normal</b> <b>stress</b> and parallel shear stress, such as the boundary between, e.g., liquid water and the air in the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{glucocorticoid}} {{family of}} hormones is synthesized {{in the middle}} layer of the adrenal cortex known as the zona fasciculata. These hormones regulate the processing of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates by the human body. They {{also play a role}} in maintaining a <b>normal</b> <b>stress</b> response cycle.|$|E
25|$|In the Mohr-circle-space sign convention, <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> {{have the}} same sign as <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> in the physical-space sign convention: {{positive}} <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> act outward to the plane of action, and negative <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> act inward to the plane of action.|$|R
5000|$|Thus, the upper-convected Maxwell model predicts for {{the simple}} shear that shear stress to be {{proportional}} to the shear rate and the first difference of <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> (...) {{is proportional to the}} square of the shear rate, the second difference of <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> (...) is always zero. In other words, UCM predicts appearance of the first difference of <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> but does not predict non-Newtonian behavior of the shear viscosity nor the second difference of the <b>normal</b> <b>stresses.</b>|$|R

25|$|R. H. Campbell did a {{study on}} shallow {{landslides}} on Santa Cruz Island, California. He notes that if permeability decreases with depth, a perched water table may develop in soils at intense precipitation. When pore water pressures are sufficient to reduce effective <b>normal</b> <b>stress</b> to a critical level, failure occurs.|$|E
25|$|The abscissa, , and ordinate, , of {{each point}} on the circle, are the {{magnitudes}} of the <b>normal</b> <b>stress</b> and shear stress components, respectively, acting on the rotated coordinate system. In other words, the circle is the locus of points that represent the state of stress on individual planes at all their orientations, where the axes represent the principal axes of the stress element.|$|E
25|$|Soil is an {{assemblage}} of particles that have little to no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective <b>normal</b> <b>stress</b> on that plane. The {{angle of internal friction}} is thus closely related to the maximum stable slope angle, often called the angle of repose.|$|E
25|$|In the physical-space sign convention, {{positive}} <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> are outward to {{the plane}} of action (tension), and negative <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> are inward {{to the plane}} of action (compression) (Figure 5).|$|R
50|$|Usually {{quadratic}} {{behavior of}} the first difference of <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> and no second difference of the <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> is a realistic behavior of polymer melts at moderated shear rates, but constant viscosity is unrealistic and limits usability of the model.|$|R
40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{experiments}} showing that stiff biopolymer gels exhibit highly unusual negative <b>normal</b> elastic <b>stresses,</b> we develop a computational model for stiff polymer networks subject to large strains. In all cases, {{we find that}} such networks develop <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> that are both negative and of magnitude comparable to the corresponding shear stress. We find that these <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> coincide with other nonlinearities in our networks, and specifically with compressive bucking of the individual filaments. Our results suggest that negative <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> are a characteristic feature of stiff (bio) polymer gels that {{have been shown to}} exhibit strong nonlinear elastic properties.

25|$|Emphasis and {{contrast}} may override <b>normal</b> <b>stress.</b> Pronouns frequently take stress because of this. In {{a simple question}} like Ĉu vi vídis? ('Did you see?'), the pronoun hardly {{needs to be said}} and is unstressed; compare Né, dónu al mí and ('No, give me). Within a word, a prefix that wasn't heard correctly may be stressed upon repetition: Né, ne tíen! Iru máldekstren, mi diris! ('No, not over there! Go left, I said!'). Because stress doesn't distinguish words in Esperanto, shifting it to an unexpected syllable calls attention to that syllable, but doesn't cause confusion as it might in English.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{large-scale}} direct shear strength {{tests were conducted}} to evaluate the effect of shear displacement rate on the internal shear strength of reinforced GCLs. Specifically, the tests were conducted using shear displacement rates ranging from 0. 0015 to 1. 0 mm/min and using <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> ranging from 50 to 520 kPa. The peak internal shear strength was found to increase with decreasing shear displacement rates for high <b>normal</b> <b>stresses,</b> while the opposite trend was observed for low <b>normal</b> <b>stresses.</b> Interpretation of these results, involving indirect evaluation of shear-induced pore water pressures, is proposed to explain this apparently counterintuitive trend. In addition, a decreasing large-displacement shear strength was noted with increasing shear displacement rate for tests at all <b>normal</b> <b>stresses.</b> Future research is geared toward the verification of the trends in peak and large-displacement for other GCLs over {{a wider range of}} shear displacement rates...|$|R

40|$|When {{viscoelastic}} bulk phases are sheared, the {{deformation of}} the sample induces not only shear <b>stresses,</b> but also <b>normal</b> <b>stresses.</b> This is a well known and well understood effect, that leads to phenomena such as rod climbing, when such phases are stirred with an overhead stirrer, or to die swell in extrusion. Viscoelastic interfaces share many commonalities with viscoelastic bulk phases, {{with respect to their}} response to deformations. There is however little experimental evidence that shear deformations of interfaces can induce in-plane <b>normal</b> <b>stresses</b> (not to be confused with <b>stresses</b> <b>normal</b> to the interface).
