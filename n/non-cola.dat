40|$|AbstractAim: To {{evaluate}} pH, {{titratable acidity}} and in vitro enamel solubility potential of different commercially available {{soft drinks and}} fruit juices in Saudi Arabia. Methods: Thirty two popular soft drinks and juices were tested for their enamel solubility potential. In addition, bottled drinking water {{was used as the}} control. Each drink was evaluated for its pH, titratable acidity which was measured by adding 0. 1 N NaOH (sodium hydroxide) to a chosen end point. In addition, one enamel slice was immersed in each test beverage and percentage weight loss in the enamel slice was calculated after intervals of 6 and 24 h. Results: The pH of all the test drinks ranged from 1. 64 to 3. 89. Mean pH of 2. 84 in soft drinks was significantly lower than in the fruit juices. There was a significant difference between them for percentage weight loss after 6 and 24 h immersion with carbonated beverages causing greater enamel loss than the fruit juices. Colas and <b>non-colas</b> did not differ statistically for pH, titratable acidity and percentage weight loss of enamel slices. Conclusions: The pH of all the test drinks was below the critical pH of 5. 5 for enamel dissolution. Carbonated drinks were observed to have more enamel solubility potential than fruit juices while regular or diet variants and colas or <b>non-colas</b> had comparable solubility potential...|$|R

40|$|Wage {{changes in}} a sample (1979 - 86) of Canadian wage {{contracts}} are analyzed. The sample is split into cost-of-living allowance (COLA) and <b>non-COLA</b> contracts. Econometric estimation corrects for sample selectivity bias. In <b>non-COLA</b> contracts, the unemployment rate and a proxy for expected inflation are significant. Expected industry price changes and productivity changes exert smaller but significant effects. In COLA contracts, ex ante inflation coverage ranges between 60 percent and 100 percent of expected inflation.

40|$|Background. Since {{nutritional}} {{factors may}} affect bone mineral density (BMD), we have investigated whether BMD {{is associated with}} an index estimating the intake of soft drinks, fruits, and vegetables. Methods. BMD was measured in distal forearm in a subsample of the population-based Oslo Health Study. 2126 subjects had both valid BMD measurements and answered all the questions required for calculating a Dietary Index = the sum of intake estimates of colas and <b>non-cola</b> beverages divided by the sum of intake estimates of fruits and vegetables. We did linear regression analyses to study whether the Dietary Index and the single food items included in the index were associated with BMD. Results. There was a consistent negative association between the Dietary Index and forearm BMD. Among the single index components, colas and <b>non-cola</b> soft drinks were negatively associated with BMD. The negative association between the Dietary Index and BMD prevailed after adjusting for gender, age, and body mass index, length of education, smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity. Conclusion. An index reflecting frequent intake of soft drinks and rare intake of fruit and vegetables was inversely related to distal forearm bone mineral density...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the erosive {{potential}} of some soft drinks commonly consumed in Nigeria. A range of popular carbonated drinks (cola and <b>non-cola)</b> and fruit juices were selected. On two occasions, the followings were determined; (1) the pH, measured by a digital pH meter on opening of the packaging can or bottle. (2) The volume of 1. 0 M sodium hydroxide required to raise the pH of 50 ml of the drinks to pH 5. 5 and pH 7. 0. The pH before titration ranges from 2. 70 to 4. 48 for the carbonated drinks and 3. 54 - 3. 91 for the fruit juices. The soft drinks and the fruit juices investigated had pH before titration lower than the critical pH 5. 5 for enamel dissolution. The volume of 1. 0 M sodium hydroxide required to bring the drinks to pH 5. 5 ranged from 0. 5 to 6. 1 mls and 1. 8 to 8. 2 mls of the base needed to neutralize the drinks to pH 7. 0. The fruit juices needed the most base to neutralize its acidity. Despite having a lower pH than the fruit drinks, the carbonated drinks required a relatively lower base to neutralize. This study concludes that all the popular soft drinks in Nigeria selected for this study had significant erosive potential. They had pH below the critical pH of enamel dissolution. The erosive potential of the fruit juices was more than the carbonated cola and <b>non-cola</b> drinks. This information will be of use to clinicians when counseling patients with tooth surface loss.

40|$|NRC Research PressSoft drinks {{can be a}} {{major source}} of sucrose, which may {{influence}} serum lipid concentration. We have examined the association between intake frequency of various types of soft drinks and the concentration of serum triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the cross-sectional Oslo Health Study. A total of 14 188 subjects of the altogether 18 770 participants of the study had data on intake frequency of colas and non-colas, with or without sugar. The population sample consisted of both sexes and 3 age groups: group 1 (30 years of age), group 2 (40 and 45 years of age), and group 3 (59 – 60 years of age). In both sexes, HDL decreased and TG increased significantly (p < 0. 001) with increasing intake frequency of colas. In contrast, no consistent associations were found between the reported intake of <b>non-cola</b> soft drinks and the serum lipids. We found no significant differences related to the reported presence or absence of sugar in the soft drinks. In multiple linear regression analyses, the colas vs. serum lipid associations prevailed (p < 0. 001) after including 13 possible confounders: sex; age group; time since last meal; physical activity; intake of alcohol, coffee, cheese, fruit and (or) berries, and fatty fish; smoking; length of education; use of cholesterol-lowering drugs; and intake of non-colas. Thus, the self-reported intake frequency of colas, but not other soft drinks, was negatively associated with serum HDL, and positively associated with TG and LDL...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{concentrates on}} understanding the dynamic choice behavior of households using econometric models; specifically {{the influence of}} promotional campaigns and cross-category dependencies on purchase incidence outcomes. In the first section, we empirically estimate the expected basket-level demand effects and, therefore, the expected store profit effects of three different types of retailer targeted coupon campaigns used by a national supermarket retail chain. The three types of campaigns differ in terms of household-level personalization. One campaign employs a one-to-one approach by targeting a set of selected households with a unique bundle of coupons personalized to that household’s preferences (high personalization). Another campaign promotes a bundle of brands around a theme (i. e., back-to-school) relevant to the household (medium personalization). The third type provides {{a limited number of}} coupons for one brand in a single category relevant to the consumer (low personalization). We build and estimate an econometric model of a household’s contemporaneous purchase incidence outcomes in 28 product categories, together with a household-level store choice model. In terms of relative efficacy, we find that theme-based coupons (medium personalization) lead to more incremental expected retailer profits for a small number of coupons (e. g. 5 - 7) when dropped in a single category (e. g. fresh vegetables). However, due to higher degrees of freedom, one-to-one coupons (high personalization) generate an even greater expected retailer profit when bundling coupons across a large number of categories (e. g. 20). In the second section, we attempt to advance the literature on multi-category demand models by modeling cross-category dependencies in households’ purchase incidence outcomes. We propose an extended version of the Multivariate Logit Model of Russell and Peterson (2000) that enables the estimation of higher-order cross-category dependencies. We document both positive and negative higher order cross-category dependences in consumer demand. This systematic demand structure analysis allowed us to find a counterintuitive bundle of hot dogs, <b>non-cola</b> beverages and toilet paper which generated the highest expect revenues. The results from our studies provide insights to retailers about the value of investing in more personalized promotional efforts, and with a detailed cross category glimpse of where such value is gained...|$|E
