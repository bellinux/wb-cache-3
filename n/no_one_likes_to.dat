25|$|I suppose <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be {{compelled}} to exonerate himself from connections he has never acquired. I have sometimes wondered why I must file papers showing I did not steal my car before I can get a license for it. But experience shows there are thieves among automobile drivers, {{and that there are}} Communists among labor leaders. The public welfare, in identifying both, outweighs any affront to individual dignity.|$|E
500|$|Yagan asked Moore whether Midgegooroo {{was dead}} or alive. Moore gave no reply, but a servant {{answered}} that Midgegooroo {{was a prisoner}} on Carnac Island. Yagan warned, [...] "White man shoot Midgegooroo, Yagan kill three." [...] Moore reported the encounter but {{made no attempt to}} restrain Yagan. He later wrote, [...] "The truth is, every one wishes him taken, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be the captor... there is something in his daring which one is forced to admire." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{seemed to}} {{everybody}} present rather unfair, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> {{be the first}} to say so, and Jesper had to put the best face he could on the matter, and begin his story.|$|R
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> {{tell a story}} {{better than}} Colonel Zane. Briefly and {{graphically}} he related {{the circumstances of the}} affair leading to the attack on Helen's father, and, as the tale progressed, he became quite excited, speaking with animated face and forceful gestures.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not taken}} up, for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> {{pronounce}} the obvious inference. Besides, the Admiral was in haste, not thinking it well that Mr. Foxholm should be longer kept under surveillance in the shop, among the bread, bacon, cheeses, shoes, and tins of potted meat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but since}} Hopkins {{defeated}} them last term {{they seem to}} be terrified, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> offer himself as a possible sacrifice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, my dear," [...] {{he replied}} gratefully. [...] "I {{always feel like}} a new man when I'm freshly stuffed. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> get musty, you know, and even good straw may be spoiled by age." ...|$|E
60|$|Prickly Porky scowled, and a {{few more}} little spears peeped out of his long coat. You know <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be laughed at, and it {{certainly}} did look as if old Mr. Toad was laughing at him.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hebblethwaite was {{a strong}} man. He {{was a man of}} immense self-control. Yet in that moment the arteries of life seemed as though they had ceased to flow. He sat at the head of his table, and his eyes never left those pencilled words. His mind fought with them, {{discarded}} them, only to find them still there hammering at his brain, traced in letters of scarlet upon the distant walls. War! The great, unbelievable tragedy, the one thousand-to-one chance in life which he had ever taken! His hand almost fell to his side. There was a queer little silence. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> ask him a question; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> speak. It was the Duchess at last who murmured a few words, when the silence had become intolerable.|$|R
6000|$|The banquet was not hurried. Though all {{wished it}} finished, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> appear urgent. It was over at last, {{and they walked}} up-stairs, where the tables were {{arranged}} for all parties, and all play. Tom Cogit went up {{a few minutes before}} them, like the lady of the mansion, to review the lights, and arrange the cards. Feminine Tom Cogit! ...|$|R
60|$|William held in {{his hand}} the Pope's banner, and called for the standard-bearer of Normandy; but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> take the charge, fearful of being {{hindered}} from gaining distinction by feats of personal prowess. Each elder knight of fame begged to be excused, and at last it was committed to Tunstan the White, a young man probably so called because {{he had yet to}} win an achievement for his spotless shield.|$|R
60|$|Griffin colored, and he bit his lip. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be outdone, in the {{appearance}} of generosity, at least; and he felt vexed {{that he should have}} ventured on a proposition that his superior treated as unbecoming.|$|E
6000|$|Nurse winked knowingly at the housemaid. 'Yes, yes, my darling, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> hear {{who is to}} {{come after}} them. Don't you say nothing about it; ain't becoming; but, by and by, see if it don't come so, and if my boy ain't master here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{one of his}} men who {{was near}} him said, [...] "Good master, thou wottest not the force that Robin Hood has about him and how little he cares for warrant of king or sheriff. Truly, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> go on this service, for fear of cracked crowns and broken bones." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2014, {{her husband}} Shlomo Kalo died {{while his wife}} near him all along. Zohar said about him thatthere is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>like</b> him <b>to</b> show you your path.|$|R
60|$|A man {{lay on a}} pile of new-made hay, in a great barn, {{looking up}} at the {{swallows}} who darted and twittered above him. He envied the cheerful little creatures; for he wasn't a happy man, though he had many friends, much money, and the beautiful gift of writing songs that everybody loved to sing. He had lost his wife and little child, and would not be comforted; but lived alone, and went about with such a gloomy face that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> speak to him. He took no notice of friends and neighbors; neither used his money for himself nor others; found no beauty in the world, no happiness anywhere; and wrote such sad songs it made one's heart ache to sing them.|$|R
60|$|We all knew, of course, that Uncle William is the {{greatest}} artist in the world, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> suggest that he should sell his pictures for money, a thing that no prince was ever capable of doing. Yet I could not but feel glad when Uncle decided yesterday that he would stoop to make his living by art. It cost him a great struggle to make this decision, but he talked it over very fully last night with Uncle Henry, after Uncle Henry came home from work, and the resolution is taken.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is one of}} {{the things}} that teach the {{futility}} of strikes," [...] the professor made haste to interpose, as if he had not quite liked to appear averse to the interests of the workman; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> do that. [...] "If there were anything at all to be hoped from them, it would be another matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, of course, {{it is all}} different. Monsieur is a Huguenot, and {{therefore}} so am I. It is the Catholic bullets that will be shot at me and, as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be shot at, I shall soon hate the Catholics cordially, and shall be ready to do them any ill turn that you may desire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was talking}} rubbish," [...] Julien asserted. [...] "You see, I was in rather an unfortunate {{position}} myself that day, wasn't I? <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> {{feel like a}} discarded lover. I can understand your chucking Harbord all right, but I can't quite see why {{it was necessary for}} you to run away from home to come and stay with a little milliner." ...|$|E
60|$|Aloysius. He {{has such}} holy {{thoughts}} and visions <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> trouble him. He {{ought not to}} be in the world at all, or to do the world's work.|$|R
60|$|Of course {{all this}} aroused {{a great deal}} of talk and curiosity, and those who had the most courage began to make visits to the hill where Prickly Porky lives {{to see if they could}} see for {{themselves}} anything out of the ordinary. But they always found that part of the Green Forest just as usual and always, if they saw Prickly Porky at all, he seemed to be fast asleep, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> wake him to ask questions. Little by little they began to think that Jimmy Skunk was right, and that Peter Rabbit's terrible creature existed only in Peter's imagination.|$|R
60|$|Exclamations and {{inquiries}} arose, and Mrs. Lyddell certified {{herself by}} several questions that Lionel {{had not been}} hurt, but {{not one of them}} was addressed to Marian. It was as if this was only one among many injuries, too frequent for a reproach more or less to be needed. Mr. Lyddell did not take it half so much to heart, and no prohibition against future rides was issued, for the truth was that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> mortify Lionel. It was exactly one of the cases in which the whole danger is not conquered, because it melts at the very aspect of moral courage.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{refused to}} give him {{so much as a}} glance. He just grunted and kept right on about his business. All the little meadow people and forest folks began to giggle and then to laugh. Reddy knew that they were laughing at him and he grew very angry, for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be laughed at, least of all Reddy Fox.|$|E
6000|$|The poet meant, no doubt, {{and thus}} appeals [...] To {{the good sense}} and senses of mankind, [...] The very thing which every body feels, [...] As all have found on trial, or may find, [...] That <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be disturb'd at meals [...] Or love.--I won't say more about 'entwined' [...] Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before, [...] But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course you}} know what a glutton is. It is one who is very, very, very greedy and eats and eats as if eating were the only thing in life worth while. It is one who is all the time {{thinking}} of his stomach. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be called a glutton. So when Honker the Goose happened to mention Glutton, it caused Peter to prick up his ears at once.|$|E
60|$|The whole {{countryside}} was {{now taking}} a deep interest in the affair. The aged {{did not wish to}} die without beholding the consummation of the love they had seen bud in their youth; and the young did not wish to die at all. But <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> interfere; it was feared that counsel to the woman would be rejected, and a thrashing to the man would be misunderstood. At last the parson took heart of grace to make or mar the match. Like a reckless gambler he staked his fee upon the cast of a die. He went one day and removed the two stools--now worn extremely thin--to another corner of the milking-yard.|$|R
5000|$|Poynter died June 15, 1978, of a Cerebral hemorrhage. In a memo beforehand, he {{instructed}} the The Times staff not to overplay {{news of his}} death and insisted there be no memorial service because [...] "I have observed <b>no</b> <b>one</b> really <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> go a funeral." ...|$|R
60|$|Grace {{suggested}} {{communication with}} the clergyman of the parish; but the North Hill {{turned out not to}} belong to St. Norbert's proper, being a part of a great moorland parish, whose focus was twelve miles off. A district was in course of formation, and a church was to be built; but in the meantime the new houses were practically almost pastorless, and the children and their matron must take their chance on the free seats of one of the churches of St. Norbert's. The staff of clergy there were so busy that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> add extra parochial work to their necessary duties, and there was not sufficient acquaintance with them to judge how they would view Mr. Mauleverer's peculiarities. Clerical interference was just what Rachel said she did not want; it was an escape that she did not call it meddling.|$|R

6000|$|... "You young men," [...] he declared, [...] "are so imaginative. Mr. Guest {{has simply}} been removed {{to the part}} of the hotel which is {{reserved}} for sick people. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> know that they have anybody next door to them who is seriously ill. As for the doctor, he is a highly qualified practitioner, and visits the hotel every day by arrangement with the manager; and the nurse was sent from the nearest nurses' home." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Peter {{does not}} like the water, and though he can swim, he doesn't feel at all at home in it. He paddled for the shore {{as fast as he}} could, and in his heart was {{something}} very like anger. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be laughed at. Peter intended to start for home the very minute he reached the shore. But just before his feet touched bottom, he heard the great, deep voice of Grandfather Frog.|$|E
