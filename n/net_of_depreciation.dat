50|$|The {{value of}} asset-based {{analysis}} of a business {{is equal to the}} sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation orted on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, <b>net</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> where applicable. These values must be adjusted to fair market value wherever possible.The value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall enterprise value. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the fair market value of the business.In considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell {{all or part of the}} assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.|$|E

40|$|Valuation {{of public}} utility {{property}} for rate-making purposes has been controversial {{since the beginning of}} public regulation. Despite much academic research and practical experience, there is no consensus of academicians or practitioners concerning the appropriate value of physical property used for providing service to customers. In public utility rate making, the value of this physical property, <b>net</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation,</b> is called the rate base. An important question is how well regulatory processes adjust the rate base for price level changes during periods of inflation. Statutes of the individual states determine how public utility property will be valued for rate-making purposes. Three basic methods are employed. Original cost jurisdictions set the rate base at the value of the property when it was first installed in a public utility application; the fair value method attempts to adjust the base to a level that more correctly reflects its current value; and the reproduction cost approach tries to establish a value that would permit reproduction of the property. Because the reproduction cost approach is not now being used by any state, this study focuses on the original cost and fair value methods. ...|$|E

40|$|Data on {{physical}} capital are an indispensable part {{of economic growth}} and efficiency studies. In the case of China, economy-wide fixed asset series are usually derived by aggregating gross fixed capital formation (<b>net</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation)</b> over time, and sectoral/ownership-specific series by correcting the limited official fixed asset data available. These procedures, to varying degrees, ignore that (i) gross fixed capital formation does not equal investment, (ii) investment does not equal the value of fixed assets newly created through investment, (iii) depreciation is an accounting measure that bears no necessary relation {{to changes in the}} production capacity of fixed assets, (iv) official fixed asset data, where available, incorporate significant revaluations in the 1990 s, and (v) "net fixed assets" do not measure the contribution of fixed assets to production. This paper derives economy-wide fixed asset values for 1953 - 2003, correcting for these shortcomings. It uses both the traditional, cumulative approach and a new, so far unexplored method of combining economy-wide depreciation values and an economy-wide depreciation rate to directly yield economy-wide fixed assets. The derived fixed asset time series are evaluated in a comparison with each other as well as with series in the literature, leading to the recommendation of a specific choice of fixed asset time series.

40|$|The paper {{contrasts}} {{the pattern}} of returns to human capital in different economic sectors. As job mobility, especially across sectors, is limited, {{it is argued that}} coefficients of experience in earnings regressions may capture or be interpreted as the growth rate – <b>net</b> <b>of</b> <b>depreciation</b> – of earnings ability propitiated by schooling when years of education are also included in the right hand-side of the equation. As a consequence, under long-term contracts, labor market equilibrium is compatible with different “gross” rates of return to schooling, provided initial earnings levels allow for the same accumulated present value. That implies a special relation between the intercept and experience coefficient of earnings regressions performed for different sectors. Additionally, implications of (log-stable) nonstationary environments for rate of return inference from log-earnings regressions – appropriate for pooled (or panel) estimation and nominal earnings information - are also investigated. Then, the trend coefficient measures the (steady-state) nominal productivity growth; the experience coefficients approximate individuals’ earnings profiles growth rates net of the human capital depreciation rate; schooling’s, the nominal rate of return in the economy net of the nominal productivity growth rate. Tests of the hypothesises are provided, along with the inspection of the determinants – including financial ratios and productive organization indicators, calculated from aggregate balance sheet information - of the observed differences across industries. A study of the estimated variances of rate of return estimates was also conducted, as an attempt to capture features of financial risk in human capital investment.

Our hypothesis on the gain function is as follows, (2) [numerical formula] A firm will determine the values of its endogenous variables so as to maximize its gain Λ, being subject to the relation (1). Our hypothesis on the gain function is as follows, (2) A = n-￡l, where II stands for the present values of "gross" profit which is expected to be gained from (money) capital invested during one unit of time (the term "gross" is used here to show that this profit contains interest cost) and Ω represents the appraised money term value of psychological resistance which the firm may feel when employing that amount of capital during one unit of time. II can be divided into two kinds of gross profit, profit from the capital invested into the productive operation, II_ 1 and profit from the capital invested into the capital assets, II_ 2.

The marginal productivity (dX) /(dq) can be calculated from "operating production function," which is the technological relation between output X and input q operating: the given equipment. In this paper we adopted two alternative methods in order to get the value s/P・(dq) /(dX). One way is to take the slope of the line connecting: two points, namely, the point (C_t, y^^～_ and the point (C_,y^^～_), in the space of (C,. y^^～_) as the approximate value of s/P・(dq) /(dX). But in this case price change must be taken into account (the change of capital equipments was assumed to be negligible). This price modification was done by the following formula. (6) [numerical formula] The other method is to estimate the operating production functions directly. Generally speaking, they can not be estimated without data of the capital assets, the measurement of which is notoriously difficult. Fortunately the data of productive capacity are available in the iron and steel industry, and we assume that the productive capacity Q is this output level corresponding to the operating degree which produces the maximum value of q/X. We specified the operating production function by and using the above assumption about the productive capacity we could estimate the values of two parameters α and β at each period of each firm. (dq) /(dX) is given by αβ・sinβq.
