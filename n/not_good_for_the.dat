25|$|While the BLM rates horses by {{animal unit}} (AUM) {{to eat the}} same amount of forage as a cow-calf pair, 1.0, {{multiple}} studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM. Modern rangeland management also recommends removing all livestock during the growing season to maximize recovery of the forage. Allowing livestock to graze year-round is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> range, and so mismanagement of feral herds can also degrade the range for the wildlife that shares the same area.|$|E

It {{was designed}} by Loïc Bigois, in similar respects {{to all the other}} cars on the grid with a moulded carbon fibre and honeycomb composite monocoque and a front and rear wishbone and pushrod activated suspension system. Remarkably, it was revealed that the modifications made to the car to accommodate its Mercedes engine saw six inches removed from the rear end, severely compromising the car's center of gravity {{and by the time the}} team realized how much the car's balance had changed, there was no time to commission a new design. Ross Brawn also admitted that there were fundamental problems with the car, stating that it was too heavy, and that some of the parts were <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> car.|$|E

500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Soulmates" [...] {{demonstrates}} how Parks and Recreation {{is superior to}} other comedy shows because it [...] "invests in its characters and really allows the audience {{time to get to}} know them" [...] rather than depending solely on gags. Alan Sepinwall said he [...] "laughed louder and more frequently at it than any episode so far this season" [...] except for [...] "Flu Season" [...] and called the Ron and Chris subplot as [...] "predictable as hell but perfectly-executed". Sepinwall objected to the introduction of a no-dating policy simply to slow the budding romance between Leslie and Ben, and said [...] "so much of this season has been so perfect that the rare imperfections stand out even more than they would on a weaker overall comedy". Joel Keller of TV Squad said the no-dating policy felt like a plot contrivance meant strictly to keep Ben and Leslie apart, which he felt was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> story. However, he complimented Leslie and Tom's scenes together, and said the subplot was even funnier, which he called a [...] "Ron Swanson classic". Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said the episode was [...] "a little too disjointed for me", particularly because the two plots were barely associated with each other. However, she said the show included funny individual jokes, and enjoyed the moment when Leslie kissed Tom.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was against}} Derby County at the newly built Pride Park Stadium. They were awarded a penalty {{kick in the}} first half after Patrick Vieira was fouled by Lee Carsley; Wright hit the penalty, which ricocheted off the goal crossbar. Two goals by Paulo Wanchope and a late strike by Dean Sturridge {{condemned}} Arsenal to their first defeat of the league season. Arsenal played Manchester United on 9 November 1997 and needed a win to stay one point behind the league leaders. Wenger admitted in his pre-match comments that a second successive defeat would make it [...] "difficult" [...] for them to catch Manchester United, but not [...] "impossible". Striker Nicolas Anelka, standing in for Bergkamp, scored his first goal for Arsenal and Vieira added a second, leaving goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel rattled. Although Teddy Sheringham scored twice for Manchester United to level the score, midfielder David Platt headed into the far corner with seven minutes left of the match to score the winner for Arsenal. Wenger said of the win: [...] "This result is good for the English game because it will stimulate interest in the Premier League" [...] and opposing manager Alex Ferguson half agreed: [...] "A one-horse race is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game." [...] Arsenal failed to capitalise on the result, losing to Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool, in a period where the team were depleted due to injuries.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{a number}} of reasons for the dislike of the system. First, any of the ten men in each rote could be picked to serve in case of war, which made it hard for the generals to {{estimate}} the knowledge and level of practice their soldiers would have. Secondly, the richest {{of the men in the}} rote could buy their way out, which in turn sometimes led to the [...] "10th man" [...] being the poorest or weakest in the rote, which of course was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> army.

2500|$|In 1890, Indians named [...] "No Neck" [...] and [...] "Black Heart" [...] {{testified in}} an inquiry before the Office of Indian Affairs. [...] The hearing weighed the {{morality}} of Indian employment in show business. [...] "You are engaged in the exhibition or show business," [...] observed the acting commissioner, A.C. Belt. [...] "It is not considered among white people a very helpful or elevating business. [...] I believe that which is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> white people is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Indians, and what is bad for the white people is bad for the Indians." [...] The Indians defended their work as adamantly as any white performer, and they turned the inquiry into a pointed denunciation of the Indian policy by comparing conditions in the show {{with those of the}} Pine Ridge Agency. [...] The contrast reflected poorly on the Office of Indian Affairs. Rocky Bear began by pointing out that he long had served the interests of the federal government (Great White Father) by encouraging the development of Indian reservations. [...] He worked in a show that fed him well; [...] "that is why I am getting so fat," [...] he said, stroking his cheeks. [...] It was only in returning to the reservation that [...] "I am getting poor." [...] If the Great [...] Father wanted him to stop appearing in the show, he would stop. [...] But until then, [...] "that is the way I get money." [...] When he showed his inquisitors a purse filled with $300 in gold coins, saying [...] "I saved this money to buy some clothes for my children," [...] they were silenced. [...] Black Heart, too, denounced the allegations of mistreatment. [...] "We were raised on horseback; that is the way we had to work."

The strike denied Matt Williams a chance to beat Roger Maris's single season home run record: he had 43 HR in 115 team games, and was thus on pace for 60 when the strike hit with 47 games left to play (Bonds had 37, on pace for 52). But {{the rest of the team}} wasn't as good as their two sluggers, with no other player having even 10 home runs or even 40 RBI that late into the season although they were still in contention, not far from the division lead, when the strike ended play in mid-August.

Jerome {{told them the}} President was offering individual homesteads, and offering to take the resulting surplus land off their hands. Chief William Tohee stood firm that the Iowa preferred to keep their entire reservation for future generations. Jerome warned that failure to acquiesce would force the government to employ the Dawes Act [...] The Iowa felt that allotment and money was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tribe, and they were still awaiting past government monies owed them. Many Iowa expressed concern about their children's forced assimilation in white schools, and were distrusting of the government. The Commission reiterated the threat of forced Congressional allotments. Jefferson White Cloud announced that the Iowa would sign the agreement.|$|E
2500|$|Chaudhry {{also spoke}} {{in favour of}} {{bringing}} more ethnic Fijians into the economic mainstream. [...] He attacked {{what he called the}} [...] "divide and rule" [...] policies of Fiji's former British colonial rulers, saying that indigenous Fijians had been isolated from other communities and marginalized economically. This colonial legacy had remained the status quo in society, even since independence in 1970, he maintained. [...] "The status quo is <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ordinary Fijians. It is good for the elites in society but not for the ordinary Fijians," [...] Chaudhry said. Positive discrimination programs would not achieve much without a dismantling of the traditional communal mindset, he said. He called for a more individualistic approach to society, based on incentives and appropriate training. [...] He did not believe that modernization would threaten the communal structure of Fijian society. [...] "No you can still fulfil your traditional obligations but the contradiction in the system between the communal approach and the free market approach needs to be addressed," [...] he said. He also insisted that culture could not be allowed to be stagnant.|$|E

2500|$|In 637, Ma {{submitted}} another petition considered {{important enough}} {{to be included in}} its entirety in the Old Book of Tang. He noted that at the time, even though Emperor Taizong had reigned for over a decade, the empire was still, overall, a fraction of the strength of the Sui dynasty at its prime, in terms of population and wealth. He pointed out that the population was therefore ill-equipped to deal with the construction projects that Emperor Taizong was then carrying out for his own palaces and for mansions for his sons and daughters. He advocated frugality, and further pointed out that Emperor Taizong's favors for his sons were creating competition between them, which was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> long term, either for his sons or for their descendants.

[...] This was the same man who had overseen the disastrous FA Cup Fourth Round match with Crawley Town, the team who, ironically, had prevented Torquay from making an earlier trip to Old Trafford. [...] Like the Crawley match, the kick off was delayed by fifteen minutes (due to traffic congestion on the M6 motorway) and like the Crawley match, Torquay fell behind to a goal late in the first half, this time a 41st-minute strike from Stevenage midfielder John Mousinho. [...] And just like the Crawley match, the Gulls failed to find a reply which meant that Mousinho's goal was enough to see the Hertfordshire side promoted to League One while ensuring Torquay would remain in League Two for another season.|$|E

In 1921, Henri Desgrange wrote in his newspaper: [...] "Pélissier doesn't know how to suffer.

The Tour de France had been dominated by Belgian cyclists in the last years, which was <b>not</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> popularity of the race in France. The organiser knew that Pélissier in the race would increase the interest in the race, but did not want to apologize to Pélissier. Therefore, Desgrange wrote in l'Auto that Henri Pélissier was too old to win the Tour de France, and that Pélissier would therefore probably never start in the Tour de France. This was the reason for Pélissier to enter the race the same day.|$|E
