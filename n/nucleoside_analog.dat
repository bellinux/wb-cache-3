25|$|BCX4430 is a broad-spectrum <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analog</b> {{antiviral}} drug developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals. A Phase 1 trial started in December 2014. The drug {{was effective in}} Ebola-infected monkeys.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include headaches, fever, and nausea. Serious side effects include liver problems, muscle damage, {{and high blood}} lactate levels. It is {{commonly}} used in pregnancy {{and appears to be}} safe for the baby. ZDV is of the <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analog</b> reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class. It works by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase that HIV uses to make DNA and therefore decreases replication of the virus.|$|E

Coexpression of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase and HIV reverse transcriptase rendered Pol Its cells sensitive to dideoxycytidine.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) encodes a {{thymidine}} kinase (TK) that markedly differs from mammalian nucleoside kinases {{in terms of}} substrate specificity. It recognizes both pyrimidine 2 '-deoxynucleosides {{and a variety of}} purine <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs.</b> Based on a computer modeling study and in an attempt to modify this specificity, an HSV- 1 TK mutant enzyme containing an alanine-to-tyrosine mutation at amino acid position 167 was constructed. Compared with wild-type HSV- 1 TK, the purified mutant HSV- 1 TK(A 167 Y) enzyme was heavily compromised in phosphorylating pyrimidine nucleosides such as (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine and the natural substrate dThd, whereas its ability to phosphorylate the purine <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs</b> ganciclovir (GCV) and lobucavir was only reduced approximately 2 -fold. Moreover, a markedly decreased competition of natural pyrimidine nucleosides (i. e., thymidine) with purine <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs</b> for phosphorylation by HSV- 1 TK(A 167 Y) was observed. Human osteosarcoma cells transduced with the wild-type HSV- 1 TK gene were extremely sensitive to the cytostatic effects of antiherpetic pyrimidine [i. e., (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine] and purine (i. e., GCV) <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs.</b> Transduction with the HSV- 1 TK(A 167 Y) gene sensitized the osteosarcoma cells to a variety of purine <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs,</b> whereas there was no measurable cytostatic activity of pyrimidine <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs.</b> The unique properties of the A 167 Y mutant HSV- 1 TK may give this enzyme a therapeutic advantage in an in vivo setting due to the markedly reduced dThd competition with GCV for phosphorylation by the HSV- 1 TK. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Since many tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes are}} silenced by DNA methylation during carcinogenesis, {{there have been}} attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is a <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analog</b> that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation. However, for decitabine to be active, it must {{be incorporated into the}} genome of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have {{led to the development of}} antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their mRNAs and preventing their translation. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.|$|E

Initially treatment is typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analog</b> reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Typical NRTIs include: zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC).

With the recent cloning of a purine-selective, Na 1 -dependent, nucleoside transporter (hSPNT 1, also termed hCNT 2) from human kidney, {{it is now possible}} to study the inter-action of <b>nucleosides</b> and <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs</b> with this transport protein and gain a more detailed knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of nucleoside transport in the human kidney. In this study we examined the substrate selectivity of hSPNT 1 for <b>nucleosides</b> and <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs.</b> We determined that the naturally occurring nucleosides adenosine, inosine, and uridine are substrates for this carrier, whereas thymidine is not.

However, the use of HSV- 1 thymidine kinase is limited in part by the toxicity of the <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs.</b> We have used random sequence mutagenesis to create new HSV- 1 thymidine kinases that, compared with wild-type thymidine kinase, render cells much more sensitive to specific <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs.</b> A segment of the HSV- 1 thymidine kinase gene at the putative nucleoside binding site was substituted with random nucleotide sequences. Mutant enzymes that demonstrate preferential phosphorylation of the <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs,</b> ganciclovir or acyclovir, were selected from more than one million Escherichia coli transformants. Among the 426 active mutants we have isolated, 26 demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to ganciclovir, and 54 were more sensitive to acyclovir. Only 6 mutant enzymes displayed sensitivity to both ganciclovir and acyclovir when expressed in E. coli.

Since the efficacy of antiretroviral agents can be impacted by interactions between virus, host cell, and drug, five commonly used antiretroviral drugs were evaluated for their abilities to inhibit the replication of a murine leukemia virus (MLV) -derived RCR in human cells. The results obtained indicate that the combination of <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs</b> zidovudine and dideoxyinosine with the protease inhibitor indinavir effectively inhibits MLV-derived RCR replication in three human cell lines. In addition, MLV-derived RCR was found to be inherently resistant to the <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs</b> lamivudine and stavudine, suggesting that mutations conferring resistance to <b>nucleoside</b> <b>analogs</b> in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 have the same effect even in an alternative viral backbone...|$|R
