40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the impact of nontraditional teaching methods on <b>nontraditional</b> college <b>students.</b> The study took place at a small junior college in north central Indiana. Two anatomy and physiology classes with high <b>nontraditional</b> (70 %) <b>student</b> enrollment were examined. A mixed method design was used for data collection. Results indicated that no statistically significant differences were found in post-test scores; however, there were practical differences with respect to grades. The average post-test score for students receiving the intervention or nontraditional delivery was 80 % while those in the traditional class had an average score of 73 %. These scores translate into a difference of an entire letter grade between <b>students</b> receiving the <b>nontraditional</b> treatment and those engaged in the traditional instruction.

The environmental science curriculum at UWT {{is based on an}} experiential learning model that enhances undergraduate education by involving students in ongoing research projects that extend beyond the classroom into the broader scientific community. During the summers of 2001 and 2002, undergraduate students from UWT participated in two very different marine research courses designed by environmental science faculty. By comparing these two course designs, the authors identified two primary issues of importance when setting up a field research program at sea. First, learning outcomes are dependent on the platform chosen for the research cruise, and thus the vessel to be used must be considered when designing a curricular model. Second, planning and implementation considerations need to be addressed regardless of the platform chosen. Educational levels: Graduate or professional...|$|R

40|$|College {{educators}} {{continue to}} find {{an increasing number of}} students over age 25 in their classrooms. Faculty and students alike report that age heterogeneity creates a unique atmosphere for learning. This paper reports select results of a three-year study of students and faculty at two branch campuses of a medium-size midwestern university. The branch campuses provide {{the first two years of}} a bachelor's degree, various associate's degree programs, and select upper level and graduate courses. Like most community colleges, the students attending the branch cam-pus substantially vary in their motivations, abilities, and ages. The campuses studied have a high <b>nontraditional</b> <b>student</b> population with an average student age of 25. Consistent with the literature, in this paper the terms younger student or traditional student refer to students age 25 and under, and the terms older <b>student</b> or <b>nontraditional</b> <b>student</b> refer to students over age 25. The research described in this report was designed to investigate similarities and differences in student and faculty attitudes toward age diversity in several areas. Three themes guided the study: student professor relationships, the mixed-age classroom, and attitudes towards younger students.
