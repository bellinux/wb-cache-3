25|$|Sometimes {{macroscopic}} objects contain ions {{distributed throughout}} the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements, {{can more or less}} easily (depending on the element) take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as static electricity. This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing amber with fur or glass with silk. In this way <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials</b> can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of conservation of charge always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge is taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopes {{operating in}} conventional high-vacuum mode usually image conductive specimens; therefore <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials</b> require conductive coating (gold/palladium alloy, carbon, osmium, etc.).

50|$|Extreme caution must {{be taken}} when using AWPs in the {{vicinity}} of overhead power lines, as electrocution may result if the lift comes in contact with energized wiring. <b>Non-conductive</b> <b>materials,</b> such as fiberglass, may be used to reduce this hazard.|$|E
50|$|Glow {{discharges}} {{may also}} be operated in radio-frequency. The use of this frequency will establish a negative DC-bias voltage on the sample surface.

50|$|Electrically {{insulate}} the two metals {{from each}} other. If {{they are not}} in electrical contact, no galvanic coupling will occur. This can be achieved by using <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials</b> between metals of different electropotential. Piping can be isolated with a spool of pipe made of plastic materials, or made of metal material internally coated or lined. It is important that the spool be a sufficient length to be effective. For reasons of safety, this should not be attempted where an electrical earthing system uses the pipework for its ground or has equipotential bonding.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, Quate {{read about}} {{a new type of}} {{microscope}} able to examine electrically conductive materials. Together with Gerd Binnig and Christoph Gerber, he developed a related instrument that would work on <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials,</b> including biological tissue, and the Atomic Force Microscope was born. AFM traces surface contours using a needle to maintain constant pressure against the surface to reveal atomic detail. AFM is the foundation of the $100 million nanotechnology industry. Binnig, Quate and Gerber were rewarded with the Kavli-Prize in 2016 for developing the Atomic Force Microscope.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the sensor for measuring thickness of <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials</b> {{can be thought of}} as two capacitors in series, with each having a different dielectric (and dielectric constant). The sum of the thicknesses of the two dielectric materials remains constant but the thickness of each can vary. The thickness of the material to be measured displaces the other dielectric. The gap is often an air gap, (dielectric constant = 1) and the material has a higher dielectric. As the material gets thicker, the capacitance increases and is sensed by the system.|$|E
50|$|In telecom {{applications}} like punch-down {{terminal blocks}} and cell phone repair, the spudger {{is made of}} a <b>non-conductive</b> <b>material</b> to prevent transmission of a static shock or direct short to sensitive electrical components' inputs or outputs.

5000|$|Cascade method: Some EDDs have a platen that is {{hinged on}} one edge to permit {{it to be}} tilted. A mixture of toner and small carrier beads (made of glass or similar <b>non-conductive</b> <b>material)</b> is then poured {{over the surface of}} the {{document}} {{from one side to the}} other.

50|$|A {{benefit of}} {{transferred}} DC torches {{is that the}} plasma arc is formed outside the water-cooled body, preventing heat loss — {{as is the case}} with non-transferred torches, where their electrical-to-thermal efficiency can be as low as 50%, but the hot water can itself be utilized. Furthermore, transferred DC torches can be used in a twin-torch setup, where one torch is cathodic and the other anodic, which has the earlier benefit of a regular transferred single-torch system, but allows their use with <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials,</b> as there is no need for it to form the other electrode. The electrodes of non-transferred torches are larger, because they suffer more wear by the plasma arc.|$|E
50|$|Spark or arc atomic {{emission}} spectroscopy {{is used for the}} analysis of metallic elements in solid samples. For <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials,</b> the sample is ground with graphite powder to make it conductive. In traditional arc spectroscopy methods, a sample of the solid was commonly ground up and destroyed during analysis. An electric arc or spark is passed through the sample, heating it to a high temperature to excite the atoms within it. The excited analyte atoms emit light at characteristic wavelengths that can be dispersed with a monochromator and detected. In the past, the spark or arc conditions were typically not well controlled, the analysis for the elements in the sample were qualitative. However, modern spark sources with controlled discharges can be considered quantitative. Both qualitative and quantitative spark analysis are widely used for production quality control in foundry and metal casting facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Dielectric heating at low frequencies, as a {{near-field}} effect, {{requires a}} distance from electromagnetic radiator to absorber of less than [...] ≈ [...] of a wavelength. It is thus a contact process or near-contact process, since it usually sandwiches the material to be heated (usually a non-metal) between metal plates taking {{the place of the}} dielectric in what is effectively a very large capacitor. However, actual electrical contact is not necessary for heating a dielectric inside a capacitor, as the electric fields that form inside a capacitor subjected to a voltage do not require electrical contact of the capacitor plates with the (non-conducting) dielectric material between the plates. Because lower frequency electrical fields penetrate <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials</b> far more deeply than do microwaves, heating pockets of water and organisms deep inside dry materials like wood, {{it can be used to}} rapidly heat and prepare many non-electrically conducting food and agricultural items, so long as they fit between the capacitor plates.|$|E
50|$|Because of this feature, {{railroad}} cars {{intended for}} three-rail operation {{will not work}} on two-rail track unless their wheels are first insulated from each other. Cars intended for two-rail track will operate on three-rail track, {{but they will not}} activate controls wired to an insulated rail. Conversion of three-rail cars for two-rail operation, or vice versa, is thus a common practice among hobbyists. It requires either replacing the bogies (wheel assemblies) on the car, or replacing metal axles with axles made of a <b>non-conductive</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Faraday {{generator}} {{is named}} after the man who first looked for the effect in the Thames river (see history). A simple Faraday generator would consist of a wedge-shaped pipe or tube of some <b>non-conductive</b> <b>material.</b> When an electrically conductive fluid flows through the tube, {{in the presence of}} a significant perpendicular magnetic field, a voltage is induced in the field, which can be drawn off as electrical power by placing the electrodes on the sides at 90 degree angles to the magnetic field.|$|R

5000|$|Imamio Thunder, {{commonly}} known as lightening bombs, are what the Motorheads fear the most, for they are bewildered by its nature and have little defense against it in their ships made of steel and conductive metals. The Imamio {{is the most powerful}} weapon in Silverhead's arsenal, and therefore your most effective weapon against the forces of the Steel Empire. A large black orb which is fired from the player's ship vertically upwards, expanding and transforming rapidly to reveal a skull-and-lightning symbol, the Imamio quickly explodes a few dozen feet above. The explosion of the Imamio causes hundreds of extremely high-temperature, high-energy streaks of lightning to rain down that heavily damage any aircraft or ground-based enemy in the vicinity which is composed of conductive metals; the Silverhead crafts are designed with <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials</b> to withstand such a bombardment. The Imamio can be used to clear almost all typical Steel Empire enemies from the screen, and is capable of wiping out entire Motorhead squadrons at once. However, it does not destroy entirely the more heavily armored bosses and mini-bosses, although it does still cause them significant damage. Due to the rarity of lightning bombs, they are best used with strategy, and sparingly.|$|E

40|$|The paper gives {{overview}} {{of the results of}} using narrow-aperture electron beam generated by a forevacuum plasma electron source as a tool for treatment of electrically <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials,</b> such as technical glass. Effectiveness of electron beam treatment of <b>non-conductive</b> <b>materials</b> is caused by almost complete neutralization of target charge on the treated surface. Charge neutralization occurs due to ion flow from beam plasma generated while transporting the beam through forevacuum pressure area. The study demonstrates the possibility to control depth and form of milling by changing modes of electron beam treatment. Combined use of electron beam and automated system for beam deflection and sweep makes possible to perform dimensional processing, particularly cutting and milling with complex trajectory. Milling rates were experimentally found depending on treatment time and mode. The suggested method of silica glass treatment represents an alternative for traditional treatment methods...|$|E

The antenna may be a flat disc, with conductors resembling a pair of loosely nested clock springs, or the spirals may extend in a three-dimensional shape like a screw thread.

Usually the spiral is cavity-backed, that {{is there is a}} cavity of air or <b>non-conductive</b> <b>material</b> or vacuum, surrounded by conductive walls; the cavity changes the antenna pattern to a unidirectional shape. The output of the antenna is a balanced line. If one input or output line is desired, for example a coaxial line, then a balun or other device is added to so transform the signals.|$|R
