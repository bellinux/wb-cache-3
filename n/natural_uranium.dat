5|$|Szilárd {{teamed up}} with Fermi {{to build a nuclear}} reactor from <b>natural</b> <b>uranium</b> at Columbia University, where they were {{fortunate}} in having a sympathetic head of the physics department in George B. Pegram. At the time there was disagreement about whether it was uranium-235, which made up less than 1% of <b>natural</b> <b>uranium,</b> or the more abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained, that was primarily responsible for fission. Fermi and Szilárd conducted a series of experiments, and concluded that a chain reaction in <b>natural</b> <b>uranium</b> could be possible if they could find a suitable neutron moderator. They found that the hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons, but tended to capture them. Szilárd then suggested using carbon as a moderator. They now needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szilárd was convinced that they would succeed if only they could get the materials.|$|E
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of <b>natural</b> <b>uranium,</b> so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from <b>natural</b> <b>uranium.</b> The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E

5|$|Niels Bohr and John Archibald Wheeler {{applied the}} liquid drop {{model of the}} atomic nucleus to explain the {{mechanism}} of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both fast and slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies {{was due to the}} uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. The former makes up just 0.714 percent of the uranium atoms in <b>natural</b> <b>uranium,</b> about one in every 140; <b>natural</b> <b>uranium</b> is 99.28 percent uranium-238. There is also a tiny amount of uranium-234, which accounts for just 0.006 percent.|$|E
5|$|Conventional fission {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when fission events release thermal neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in U-235 releases two or three neutrons with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various absorber materials, designers can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as criticality. <b>Natural</b> <b>uranium</b> is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the fission of either of the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in <b>natural</b> <b>uranium</b> to reach criticality. Commercial light water nuclear reactors, the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E

5|$|Production of the fissile {{isotopes}} uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings {{given the}} technology of the 1940s, and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project. Uranium enrichment was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult to scale to industrial levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of <b>natural</b> <b>uranium</b> was uranium-235, and {{it was estimated that}} it would take 27,000 years to produce a gram of uranium with mass spectrometers, but kilogram amounts were required.|$|E

5|$|The {{second line}} of {{development}} {{pursued by the}} Manhattan Project used the fissile element plutonium. Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, {{the best way to}} obtain large quantities of the element is in a nuclear reactor, in which <b>natural</b> <b>uranium</b> is bombarded by neutrons. The uranium-238 is transmuted into uranium-239, which rapidly decays, first into neptunium-239 and then into plutonium-239. Only a small amount of the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from fission products.|$|E
5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I.

Starting in 1964, a connection between Teller and Israel was made by the physicist Yuval Ne'eman, who had similar political views.

5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than <b>natural</b> <b>uranium,</b> {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E
5|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>uranium</b> {{consists}} of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that {{all three of these}} isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay, which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the gaseous {{diffusion}} process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of <b>natural</b> <b>uranium.</b> The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} {{fluorine}} {{arose from the}} need to separate the isotope235U from 238U because the former, present in <b>natural</b> <b>uranium</b> at a concentration of less than 1% is fissile (capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons), whereas the latter is not. Members of the MAUD Committee (especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti) proposed the use of gaseous diffusion for isotope separation, since, according to Graham's law the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular mass. After an extensive search, uranium hexafluoride, UF6, {{was determined to be}} the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the gaseous diffusion process. Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF6.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} atomic bombs were {{developed}} concurrently during the war: {{a relatively simple}} gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon.
