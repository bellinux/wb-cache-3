5|$|In 1978, Nixon {{published}} his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, {{the first of}} ten books he was to author in his retirement. The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response. Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. Carter had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Orioles signed {{free agent}} shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base permanently. General manager Pat Gillick {{said that the}} move was made not because of {{problems}} by Ripken but because more defensive options were available at shortstop than at third base. Had Ripken <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> move back to third base, the Orioles likely would have signed Tim Naehring instead.|$|E
5|$|Over Ross's protests, {{the men of}} the Sixth Regiment {{elected him}} colonel in 1862. He did not want the {{responsibility}} of the position and had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General Charles W. Phifer, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to brigadier general. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit {{was the only one of}} the 810 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.|$|E

5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
5|$|The family {{received}} the video from Capaldi on 3 November 2014. After viewing the video, Thomas felt encouraged to attend his grandmother's funeral. In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Ross Goodall explained that Capaldi's mention of sadness resonated with the child due to his experience of grief over his grandmother's death. He discussed {{the manner in which}} Thomas perceived emotions as a strict dichotomy between positive and negative without a middle ground. Thomas interpreted from the video that it was all right to feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred. Ross Goodall told The Guardian that before viewing the video from Capaldi, his son had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> attend the funeral.|$|E
5|$|Lenin had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{return to}} the Russian Empire, fearing arrest. He changed his opinion when Tsar Nicholas II {{accepted}} a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, with Lenin believing that these would protect him from the Okhrana. Thus, Lenin and his wife returned to Russia in cognito via Sweden and Finland, moving between different safe houses in St. Petersburg, from which he monitored events and wrote up many of his ideas {{on the progress of}} the revolution. He was invited to join the editorial board of Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maxim Gorky's wife M.F. Andreyeva, and used this as a vehicle to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and also advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for the revolution to succeed. However, after the armed Moscow Uprising failed, Lenin began to urge the party to stand in elections for the Duma, believing that this would raise the party's public profile. At a Bolshevik Congress in Tampere, Finland, Lenin first met young Bolshevik Joseph Stalin. He also changed his mind {{on the issue of the}} Mensheviks, and began calling for reconciliation between the party's two factions. Members of both groups met at the 4th Party Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in April 1906 where the Mensheviks condemned Lenin for supporting bank robberies and encouraging violence. The Congress resulted in the election of a new Central Committee comprising 7 Mensheviks and 3 Bolsheviks.|$|E

As Dilshan said after his retirement in ODIs, he did <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take captaincy, but Sri Lanka Cricket asked him to take the captaincy for six moths until found one. He accepted the task, but many troubles in the team, retirements and injuries led him to reduce performances.|$|E
25|$|In Allen's opinion, {{the problem}} with Funny Lady was that Barbra Streisand had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do a sequel to Funny Girl and was {{determined}} to give the director, Herbert Ross, a hard time. Ray Stark had her cross-collateralized on three films and she was, figuratively speaking, escorted to the set every day {{by a team of}} lawyers. The picture does, however, contain some of Allen's most satisfying work, some of which she doesn't remember writing and just seems to have come out of nowhere.|$|E
25|$|By 1966, however, it {{was clear}} that Hartnell's health was {{affecting}} his performances, and {{that he would not be}} able to carry on playing the Doctor for a long period of time. By this point Savory had moved on as Head of Serials and his successor, Shaun Sutton, was more agreeable to change, allowing Wiles' replacement, Innes Lloyd, to make many of the very changes that Wiles had been barred from. Lloyd discussed the situation with Hartnell and the actor agreed that it would be best to leave, although later in life he would claim that he had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|E

25|$|Somba Opu {{proved a}} strong fort to be defeated. The attackers {{suffered}} 50 dead and 68 wounded, {{among them were}} several Dutch and native officers. On 22 June, after a 6 days of continuous rain, Arung Palakka decided to led his Bugis, Bacan and Ambon soldiers to enter the breach in the wall. The attack by Arung Palakka was fierce, forcing the Somba Opu warriors to abandon the breach as the Bugis and their allies breached in. Despite the rain, the Bugis managed to set up fire to force the Makassar soldiers to retreat from the eastern and western bastions of the citadel. The Makassar soldiers reestablish their defenses at the southern half of Somba Opu. During the retreat, the Makassar soldiers utilized the largest cannon of Somba Opu, the Anak Mangkasar ("Child of Makassar"), which was heaved {{over the side of}} the northwestern bastion. As the Dutch-Bugis army advanced from the west, a report came mentioning that the Makassar forces had fled and abandoned Somba Opu. Sultan Hasanuddin of the Makassar force had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> leave but the flames, fanned by a strong northwesterly wind, forced him to leave. The only Makassarese within the fort were Karaeng Karunrung who remained in the palace surrounded by his kris-wielding followers. The people inside the mosque had also been driven out, only the Malay wife of Datu Soppeng, and all her children, plus 80 of her retinue remained.|$|E
25|$|The most {{well-known}} of his literary jabs at Boulstred is his âEpigram on the Court Pucell,â which many critics call a âdisturbingly âpersonalâ {{attack on a}} woman.â Jonson supposedly wrote this poem {{as a response to}} a criticism Boulstred made of his play draft Epicoene: the Silent Woman. He claimed that his epigram was stolen out of his pocket when he was drunk and given to Boulstred, which he had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> happen. Regarding the title of the poem, âpucellâ was the early modern term for prostitute, so Jonson seems to be calling Boulstred a prostitute in this poem. He also accuses Boulstred of being promiscuous, bisexual, pretentious, hypocritical, and much more. His accusation of bisexuality stems from her close relationship with Lucy Russell, the countess of Bedford. However, another reading of the poem is that rather than a direct criticism of Boulstred, the work was meant to be one of a âgeneric court pucelle, and by that means, an image of the false world.â Yet another reading is that the poem is a representation of Jonsonâs frustration with having to rely on a woman, like the countess of Bedford, for literary success. Lucy Russell was the matron of many writers, such as John Donne, and Jonson attempted to gain her matronage for many years. Jonson may have been frustrated by this apparent âinversion of traditional gender codes,â so he used the âtrope of prostitutionâ in this poem to reassert his position of power as a male.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its first {{recorded}} appearance, Xu was already a powerful Yi state that was probably located in southeastern Shandong or northwestern Jiangsu. Besides this state, a number of small Xu enclaves existed in western Shandong. Like the Dongyi states at Pugu and Yan, Xu participated in the Rebellion of the Three Guards against the Duke of Zhou, although it had no known direct relation to the three competing parties. Ralph D. Sawyer speculates that Xu joined the rebels because it did <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> alienate its neighboring states that had co-founded the rebel alliance. The rebels eventually lost the war, and as result the Huai River valley was invaded and subjugated by the Zhou royal army in 1039 BC. To what extent Xu was also defeated during that campaign remains unclear; reports in the Zuo Zhuan and the Bamboo Annals make it likely that Xu forces continued to resist the implementation of Zhou power in southeastern Shandong. After the foundation of Lu, Xu and other Huaiyi statelets reportedly attacked the new Zhou state until Bo Qin defeated them. Afterwards, the Xu state appears to have been largely pacified and became a vassal of the Zhou dynasty. In this position, it was strongly influenced by the Zhou culture and also served as link to the dynasty's southernmost ally, Wu. Despite that, Xu remained somewhat defiant, and moved its core area further south into northern Anhui in order to escape the constant pressure from the Zhou dynasty in the north. The Xu enclaves in western Shandong even continued to openly resist, but most of them were destroyed by Lu and Song over time.|$|E
