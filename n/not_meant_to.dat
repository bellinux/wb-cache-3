5|$|In {{matters of}} self-defence, {{different}} interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not {{protected by the}} rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures {{support the use of}} violence against an armed attacker. Ahimsa is <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> imply pacifism.|$|E
5|$|The funerary cult of Djedkare Isesi {{enjoyed a}} revival during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1077 BC). For {{the early part}} of this period, this is best attested by the Karnak king list, a list of kings {{commissioned}} by pharaoh Thutmose III. The list was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be exhaustive, rather it gave the names of Thutmose's forefathers whom he wanted to honor by dedicating offerings.|$|E

5|$|Across the series, Sora is {{depicted}} as a cheerful teenager who cherishes his friendships and relies on them for his strength. As a result, several of Sora's enemies use his friends as bait to use the Keyblade for their purposes. During the first game, it is discovered that Sora was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> wield the Keyblade, which only chooses him {{in the absence of}} its intended owner, Riku. However, Sora's greater strength of heart causes the Keyblade to reject Riku in favor of Sora.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that {{the citizens of the}} Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
5|$|As {{the series}} became popular, {{students}} in two schools {{were barred from}} wearing South Park-related T-shirts, while several parent councils in the United Kingdom expressed concern when eight- and nine-year-old children voted the South Park character Cartman as their favorite personality in a 1999 poll. Parker and Stone assert that the show is <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be viewed by young children, and the show is certified with TV ratings that indicate its intention for mature audiences.|$|E

5|$|Goffman {{uses the}} metaphor of {{conversation}} being a stage play. A plays tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they’re often <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{longtime}} Sarasota-resident sculptor Frank Colson {{was commissioned}} {{to create a}} copy {{for the city of}} Sarasota, Florida, and again in 2002, for the city of Columbia, South Carolina. These were new copies in their own right, <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> replace any existing Doughboys as Sarasota never had an original Viquesney Doughboy. An original does exist in another part of Columbia, SC, giving that city two; an original and a copy. Colson and his son also worked on the restoration of the Doughboy in Clearwater, Florida, along with its companion statue, Spirit of the American Navy.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace are usually <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be drunk young, {{but many are}} still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up {{the sweetness of the}} wine.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, 2017, {{a heavily}} {{modified}} version of Petya was used for a global cyberattack primarily targeting Ukraine. This version had been modified to propagate using the same EternalBlue exploit that was used by WannaCry. Due to another design change, it is also unable to actually unlock a system after the ransom is paid; this led to security analysts speculating that the attack was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> generate illicit profit, but to simply cause disruption.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{also sent}} diplomats to other Italian states. In August 1451, along with Venice he sent {{messages}} to Francesco Sforza, then duke of Milan, and Siena to inform them of his {{victory over the}} Turks and of the desperate need for supplies to continue combating the Ottoman armies, but no aid was received. Venice responded that she wished to see the Albanians and the Turks settle for peace, whereas Sforza's response hinged upon the excuse that his state was not financially sound and that his soldiers were <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> help an Albanian prince. Only Ragusa offered {{a large amount of}} ducats.|$|E

I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange.

5|$|Casino Royale (2006) is {{the twenty-first}} spy {{film in the}} Eon Productions James Bond film series, and is the third screen {{adaptation}} of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name. Directed by Martin Campbell and written by Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, {{it is the first}} film to star Daniel Craig as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, and was produced by Eon Productions for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, making it the first Eon-produced Bond film to be co-produced by the latter studio. Following Die Another Day, Eon Productions decided to reboot the film series, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> precede or succeed any previous Bond film, with the first film of the reboot allowing them to show a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond than in previous entries.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E

5|$|Kyo's appears {{repeatedly}} in the series {{at the insistence of}} the marketers and the main planners. Iori, and other SNK regulars also appear in every game, making it a challenge to decide the storyline for each title. Along with his rival Iori, it has been noted by several of the series' designers that Kyo {{is one of the most}} difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity among fans. Originally, Kyo's girlfriend, Yuki, was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be conceptualized, since her first mention ever in the story was in Kyo's profile as one of his most cherished possessions. Her addition to his profile was done by one of the programmers mostly as a joke since Kyo was more popular with female gamers.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked by}} {{the staff of the}} {{magazine}} Animerica if the anime was influenced by Western superheros like Spider-Man or Batman, Taniguchi denied that influence. Instead, he said his inspirations for s-CRY-ed were other works he had produced for Sunrise. The society shown in the series was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be another take on classic superheroes but instead investigate how everyone can adapt to their own situation. While the series is known for the extensive action in its episodes, the director believes everything he wanted viewers to see was presented. To distinguish the HOLY members, the Sunrise staff researched the costumes they could design. Taniguchi said their outfits are meant to resemble prison uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Gods were {{combined}} {{with each other}} as easily as they were divided. A god could be called the ba of another, or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and iconography. Local gods were linked with greater ones, and deities with similar functions {{were combined}}. Ra was connected with the local deity Sobek to form Sobek-Ra; with his fellow ruling god, Amun, to form Amun-Ra; with the solar form of Horus to form Ra-Horakhty; and with several solar deities as Horemakhet-Khepri-Ra-Atum. On rare occasion, even deities of different sexes were joined in this way, producing combinations like Osiris-Neith and Mut-Min. This linking of deities is called syncretism. Unlike other situations for which this term is used, the Egyptian practice was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> fuse competing belief systems, although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones. Instead, syncretism acknowledged the overlap between deities' roles and extended the sphere of influence for each of them. Syncretic combinations were not permanent; a god {{who was involved in}} one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities. But closely connected deities did sometimes merge. Horus absorbed several falcon gods from various regions, such as Khenty-irty and Khenty-khety, who became little more than local manifestations of him; Hathor subsumed a similar cow goddess, Bat; and an early funerary god, Khenti-Amentiu, was supplanted by Osiris and Anubis.|$|E
