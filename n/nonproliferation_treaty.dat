We are focusing recent efforts on the Middle East and North Africa to complement our previous work in Europe and Central Asia. We are locating and digitizing published crustal thickness, depth to basement, and crustal velocity and density structures, primarily as interpreted from seismic refraction and reflection, gravity and drill hole datasets. We have also digitized some gravity maps and key geologic features for the Middle East. All data are being stored in Arc/Info Geographic Information System (GIS), the most widely used full-featured GIs We are also maintaining a comprehensive bibliography of all the relevant references in a computer database. The results of ongoing efforts are essential for a successful global monitoring system, such as the one tested by the GSETT- 3 experiment.

40|$|The {{threat of}} nuclear warfare is an ongoing global concern. The {{reduction}} of this threat is an international effort that is aided by numerous technologies aimed at the detection, localization, and characterization of special nuclear material (SNM). Radiation imaging systems have a distinct advantage over more traditional systems {{in that they are}} designed to provide localized information of the observed the radiation field. Accurate characterization of detected sources requires robust reconstruction algorithms with well characterized uncertainties that are capable of delivering consistently reliable information. This work presents a versatile detection system and powerful reconstruction algorithm that, when combined, are well-suited to meeting many present challenges in the nuclear <b>nonproliferation</b> and <b>treaty</b> verification fields. The detection system, known as the Dual-Particle Imager (DPI), is a single device capable of performing both imaging and spectroscopy with photons and fast neutrons. The reconstruction algorithm leverages maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) and a robust system matrix, simulated in MCNPX-PoliMi, to perform image reconstruction and simultaneously unfold localized energy spectra for each pixel in the image. The localized energy spectra make it possible to analyze multiple detected sources simultaneously and the spectrum unfolding capabilities significantly improve the information available for characterizing the sources. Combining this algorithm with the DPI allows for localized spectra to be computed for photons and neutrons, which is particularly useful for the localization and characterization of SNM. The capabilities of this algorithm have been demonstrated through series of experiments and a detailed analysis of the uncertainties associated with the reconstruction process has been performed. The algorithm was used to analyze two complex environments, measured by the DPI, that each contained an SNM sample in a field of multiple shielded and unshielded sources. An in-depth analysis of the localized photon and neutron spectra show that not only can all present radioactive materials be identified, but also that some determinations can be made regarding the presence and nature of shielding material. The presented results demonstrate the relevance of this work to the nuclear <b>nonproliferation</b> and <b>treaty</b> verification field...|$|R

40|$|Since 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{has worked}} to ensure the safe and {{responsible}} promotion of nuclear technology throughout the world. The IAEA operates {{at the intersection of}} the Nuclear <b>Nonproliferation</b> <b>Treaty’s</b> (NPT) fourth and third articles, which guarantee Parties to the Treaty the right to peaceful uses of nuclear technology, provided those activities are placed under safeguards verified by the IAEA. However, while the IAEA has enjoyed substantial success and prestige in the international community, there is a concern that its resources are being stretched to a point where it may no longer be possible to execute its multifaceted mission in its entirety. As noted by the Director General (DG) in 2008, demographics suggest that every aspect of the IAEA’s operations will be in higher demand due to increasing reliance on non-carbon-based energy and the concomitant nonproliferation, safety, and security risks that growth entails. In addition to these nuclear energy concerns, the demand for technical developmental assistance in the fields of food security, resource conservation, and human health is also predicted to increase {{as the rest of the}} world develops. Even with a 100 % value-for-money rating by the U. S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and being described as an “extraordinary bargain” by the United Nations Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, real budget growth at the Agency has been limited to zero-real growth for a better part of the last two decades. Although the 2012 regular budget (RB) received a small increase for most programs, the 2013 RB has been set at zero-real growth. As a result, the IAEA has had to defer infrastructure investments, which has hindered its ability to provide the public goods its Members seek, decreased global security and development opportunities, and functionally transformed the IAEA into a charity, dependent on extrabudgetary (EB) contributions to sustain its mission and capabilities. To resolve these resource constraints, we recommend the creation of an endowment, funded entirely through private contributions. Our initial estimates for the endowment are that a € 2 B principal. This level of capitalization could provide significant support to all aspects of the IAEA’s mission, including Capital Investment and Innovation; Technical Cooperation; as well as incentivizing the policy and technology entrepreneurship that will be necessary for the future health of the nonproliferation regime. Given this potential, our future efforts will focus on a more rigorous assessment of the financial requirements, while simultaneously creating the beginnings of a functional organization. These include: organizational structure, metrics for grant-making and performance evaluation, and outreach and fundraising strategies. At the end of this process, there should be sufficient information and engagement to begin to operationalize the endowment through external funding sources...|$|R
