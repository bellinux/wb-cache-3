40|$|Interest in {{the role}} {{embodied}} energy plays in international trade and its subsequent impact on energy security has grown. As a developed nation, the UK's economic structure has changed {{from that of a}} primary producer to that of a primary consumer. Although the UK's energy consumption appears to have peaked, it imports a lot of energy embodied in international trade alongside the more obvious direct <b>energy</b> <b>imports.</b> The UK has seen increasing dependency on <b>imported</b> fossil <b>energy</b> since the UK became a <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> importer in 2005. In this paper an energy input-output model is established to calculate not only the amount of fossil energy embodied in UK's imports and exports, but also the sector and country distributions of those embodied fossil energy. The research results suggest the following: UK's embodied fossil <b>energy</b> <b>imports</b> have exceeded embodied fossil energy exports every year since 1997, UK embodied <b>energy</b> <b>imports</b> through the so-called 'Made in China' phenomena are the largest accounting for 43 % of total <b>net</b> fossil <b>energy</b> <b>imports.</b> If <b>net</b> embodied fossil <b>energy</b> <b>imports</b> are considered, the gap between energy consumption and production in UK is much larger than commonly perceived, with subsequent implications to the UK's energy security...|$|R

40|$|International {{trade is}} a growing share of {{economic}} activity in the United States and a determinant of economic growth. Over the last three decades, exports and imports {{have more than doubled}} as a share of gross domestic product. Moreover, the contribution of net exports to economic growth has also increased from a small drag from 2002 to 2005 to a positive contributor from 2006 to the end of 2013. Energy net exports were a substantial part of this change, as their con-tribution to annual real GDP growth increased from- 0. 1 percentage point (a drag) to 0. 2 percentage point in the same periods. Over the last two decades, two new technologies—hydraulic frac-turing and horizontal drilling—brought significant structural change to the energy sector. After declining or holding steady from 1975 to 2005, energy production—including crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids—increased starting in 2006.

40|$|The energy {{embodied}} in internationally traded commodities is estimated {{for the year}} 1967 by employing United States input-output energy coefficients expressed in physical units. In this year and under the assumption of USA technology and industrial structure, this "hidden" world trade in energy probably exceeded 40 per cent of the directly observed world trade in energy. As a ratio to aggregate energy consumption, the importance of embodied energy flows is smaller, but <b>net</b> embodied <b>energy</b> <b>imports</b> are positively correlated with per capita GDP, and their inclusion in aggregate energy consumption would increase measured income (per capita GDP) elasticities. A country's <b>imports</b> of embodied <b>energy</b> are approximately proportional to the imports of all commodities.

The analyses {{are based on a}} long-term energy system model of Bangladesh using the MARKAL framework. The analysis shows that Bangladesh {{will not be able to}} meet the future energy demand without importing energy. However, alternative policies on CO 2 emission constraints reduce the burden of imported fuel, improve energy security and reduce environmental impacts. The results show that the introduction of the CO 2 emission reduction targets and carbon taxes directly affect the shift of technologies from high carbon content fossil-based to low carbon content fossil-based and clean renewable energy-based technologies compared to the base scenario. With the cumulative CO 2 emission reduction target of 10 - 20 % and carbon tax of 2500 Â Taka/ton, the cumulative <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> <b>imports</b> during 2005 - 2035 would be reduced in the range of 39 - 65 % and 37 %, respectively, compared to the base scenario emission level.

30|$|The supply {{status of}} fossil fuel {{resources}} can be measured from two perspectives: the physical perspective (i.e. physical supply; the volume or weight of physical production of the fuel), and the <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> perspective (i.e. <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> output of the fuel).

40|$|The People's Republic of China (PRC) {{had been}} a <b>net</b> <b>energy</b> {{exporter}} since the 1960 s. In 1993, however, China became a net oil importer. Largely {{as a result of}} China's capitalist transition, China's thirst for energy resources has continued to grow massively in recent years. This is deepening the country's <b>energy</b> <b>import</b> dependence, which in turn is changing many aspects of China's energy markets and accelerating China's integration {{with the rest of the}} world. However, with higher dependence on <b>energy</b> <b>imports,</b> particularly <b>imports</b> of oil, <b>energy</b> security has emerged as a top issue for the Chinese leadership. Indeed, the exigencies of energy security have come to influence the conduct of China's foreign relations. There are in general four dimensions of energy security. The first is the economic dimension. Energy security means smoothly securing adequate supplies of energy efficiently and at the lowest cost. This requires governments to have an energy policy that is transparent and reduces barriers to the efficient operation of markets. The second is the geopolitical dimension. Promoting energy security means that oil or energy diplomacy plays a key role in a country's foreign policies. The third is the national security and military dimension. Energy security can be an important component in formulating a country's national security and defense policies. The final is the environmental dimension. To manage energy consumption while simultaneously protecting the environment and avoiding ecological degradation, any country, particularly a large and fast growing developing country like China, faces huge challenges. The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, we will analyze the nature and seriousness of China's energy vulnerabilities, especially rising dependence on <b>energy</b> <b>imports.</b> Second, we will examine the economic, geopolitical, and, to a lesser extent, military dimensions of the dilemmas shaping China's energy security.
