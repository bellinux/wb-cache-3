A cynic might claim that the overriding message was that “a plan was made to make a plan” and that no real progress was made.

Conversely, the key negative messages were that: - There was little progress on how we might close the gap between countries’ emissions levels and what is required to maintain the planet within 2 °C of warming. - Proposed funding levels are probably too low to facilitate the proper implementation of the Cancun Agreements, especially in terms of assisting developing nations to deal with the effects of climate change. - There is still no agreed common accounting framework for carbon emissions; without this, meeting the “within 2 °C goal” will be extremely difficult...|$|E
40|$|Inter{{national}} trade law is very clear: {{national security}} concerns take precedent over any commitments in trade agreements. In {{response to the}} terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11, 2001, the United States and other countries have been putting in place new anti-terrorist measures, many of which will act to inhibit international trade. As with any measure that inhibits international trade, these new measures will provide an economic benefit to domestic vested interests in importing countries. Guarding against the possibility of terrorist acts is by nature a speculative activity, {{and it is difficult}} to refute the need for the anti-terrorist measures put in place by governments. As a result, trading partners may be frustrated by what they perceive as protectionist measures and tempted to reply with trade-restricting measures of their own, imposed under the guise of national security. Thus, governments have a vested interest in being willing to listen to the comments of their trading partners and ensuring that the policies put in place achieve their goal in the least-trade-distorting manner Â– even if they are not obliged to do so. It is particularly important that the measures put in place have either sunset clauses or automatic reviews pertaining to their efficacy in achieving anti-terrorist goals. These provisions will help ensure that anti-terrorist measures are not captured by those who benefit from the economic protection they provide. agents, capture, cost, essential security interests, homeland security, <b>national</b> security, <b>protectionism,</b> terrorism, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ East Asian economies {{have been}} subject to {{theoretical}} debates, especially regarding the principal factors that have contributed to their impressive development performance. Many economists familiar with the region’s institutional particularities believe that their catching-up process {{has much to do with}} the role of the neo-mercantilist state, often embedded in the concept of the developmental state. On the other hand, the recent phenomenon of regional industrial dynamism, most clearly after the mid- 1980 s, has drawn attention to the concept of the Flying Geese paradigm. The question at hand is compatibility between the neo-mercantilist concept of the developmental state based on nationalist sentiment on the one hand, and the neo-liberal concept of the Flying Geese (FG) paradigm based on market rationalism on the other. In a sense, this resembles the old state vs. market debate. The paper contemplates an outlook of the developmental state in the light of growing regionalist drive in East Asia. More specifically, it explores the possibility of developmental regionalism. Developmental regionalism, in our framework, upholds a hybrid of limited liberalism at the <b>national</b> level and <b>protectionism</b> at the regional level. It is also a hybrid of North-South and South-South cooperation for achieving agreed specialization. While our discussion is at the exploratory stage with respect to concrete policy implications, developmental regionalism could contribute to bridging the aforementioned two contending concepts. ...|$|R

This approach becomes questionable {{in the light of}} economic globalization and the emergence of transnational social spaces. The article argues that the value of resources depends on the environments in which they are put to use. The (dis-) advantages of the concepts 'inclusion/ exclusion' and 'social closure' for grasping spatial relations are discussed. Some resources connect exclusively to highly specialized and/ or subdued social spaces. The position of people relative to welfare states is a major dimension of global inequalities. Global upper classes transcend national border regulations. Their social position differs objectively from that of lower class migrants and the citizens of welfare states who suffer from or depend on <b>national</b> <b>protectionism</b> respectively. Locals in the periphery are exposed to global economies without the mediation of a strong state.

40|$|Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs), as {{they have}} come to be known, are a hybrid type of foreign investor. They invest beyond their own borders with an aim to {{maximize}} returns as a foreign investor is expected to. At the same time, they are closely associated with governments, by ownership, source of funding, and/or investment objectives. Even as within this group, individual SWFs take various forms and may have divergent investment priorities and risk approaches. There is not even a universal definition of SWFs. As a result, they are often not viewed as typical foreign investors. The association of a SWF with a foreign government has raised various issues such as <b>national</b> security, trade <b>protectionism</b> and nationalism in the recipient countries. At the same time, due to the government ownership of some SWFs, they may fall into the group of business entities known as state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Given that SOEs are highly influential in some states, some recipient states have sought to subject SOEs to greater disciplines, such as in ensuring competition law and transparency principles apply to them, in order {{to level the playing field}} for other enterprises. Such disciplines have begun to appear in trade and investment treaties, and are coupled with the usual broad definitions of “investor” in such treaties. It is perhaps too early to state that there is a trend of greater legal and cross-border scrutiny over SOEs, and along with them, SWFs, in treaties. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement that is under negotiation is an example of a potentially game-changing treaty which could affect SWFs qua SOEs. The challenge for SWFs is to carve a distinct identity in the twenty-first century, as more treaties that impose binding requirements arise. This article examines some recent developments, how SWFs may need to forge a unique identity and challenges of recipient states in balancing investment openness and the above concerns...|$|R
40|$|Increased deregulation, {{cross-border}} {{activities of}} non-financial companies and improved information communications technology {{led to an}} increased consolidation of financial institutions across borders. Commercial banking sector in particular, have witnessed trenmendous amount of cross-border bank merger and acquisitions’ (M&As) deals through out the recent years. The reasons behind cross-border bank M&As are examined from different theoritical perspectives, such {{as a mode of}} entry into a foreign market, as a value-creating strategy and/or way of maximizing shareholder value either by achieving efficiency gains or by increasing the market power. It is not entirely clear however if any of these motives take into account the consumer perspective on the subject matter; in fact it seems that consumer perspectives or attitudes towards the increasingly globalized banking sector has been left out of discussion. Furthermore, while globalization has accelerated cross-border merger activities around the world, another global force recently has been creating a counterweight to cross-border deals. Concerns over nationalism, feelings of <b>national</b> security and <b>protectionism</b> have delayed several cross-border banking deals. The {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to explore the Swedish consumer attitudes on the issue of internationalization of banks. Through literature studies we have identified relevant threories of consumer perspectives on the general concept of globalization; the consumer nationalism and consumer worldmindedness. Based on the previously developed scale of these two opposing concepts, the study measures the consumer attitudes towards the subject matter by examining to what extent they accept the highly globalized world and more importantly, greatly internationalized banking sector. The study took a quantitive approach where the survey was handed out to the general public in Jönköping in order to apply our researched theories and to see for an association between their general attitude on globalization and their specific attitude towards internationalization of banking sector. The result showed the average consumer has a nationalistic attitude towards internationalization of banks. Thus we can argue that although the future seems to bring us an increasingly globalized financial market, the nationalistic or protectionist attitude may always exist at some level within the individual consumer. It is hard to predict how broad or influential the impact of this ‘attitude’ would be, yet it is certain that this will be a never-ending counterforce to the globalized banking sector we are looking at in the future. Foreign banks who are merging with or acquiring Swedish banks therefore should focus not only on the gains that they will achieve from entering Sweden, but also how these gains can be transferred as a benefits to consumers or government of the country to manage challenges related to consumer nationalism...|$|R
