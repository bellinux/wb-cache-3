25|$|Sesame seed is {{a common}} {{ingredient}} in various cuisines. It is used whole in cooking for its rich, <b>nutty</b> <b>flavour.</b> Sesame seeds are sometimes added to breads, including bagels and the tops of hamburger buns. Sesame seeds may be baked into crackers, often {{in the form of}} sticks. In Sicily and France, the seeds are eaten on bread (ficelle sésame, sesame thread). In Greece, the seeds are also used in cakes.|$|E
25|$|Cheddar {{can be a}} deep to {{pale yellow}} (off-white) colour, or a yellow-orange colour when certain plant {{extracts}} are added. One commonly used spice is annatto, extracted from seeds of the tropical achiote tree. Originally added to simulate the colour of high-quality milk from grass-fed Jersey and Guernsey cows, annatto may also impart a sweet, <b>nutty</b> <b>flavour.</b> The largest producer of Cheddar cheese in the United States, Kraft, uses a combination of annatto and oleoresin paprika, an extract of the lipophilic (oily) portion of paprika.|$|E

25|$|Bogor Laksa (Indonesian: Laksa Bogor) {{perhaps is}} the most famous Laksa variant in Indonesia from Bogor city, West Java. The thick {{yellowish}} coconut milk based soup {{is a mixture of}} shallot, garlic, kemiri (candlenut), kunyit (turmeric), ketumbar (coriander), sereh (lemongrass), and salt. Laksa Bogor has a distinct earthy and <b>nutty</b> <b>flavour</b> acquired from oncom (orange-colored fermented beans cake, similar to tempe but different fungi). The hot soup runs, drained, and filled several times into the bowl contains bihun (rice vermicelli), ketupat (glutinous rice cake), smashed oncom, tauge (bean sprout), kemangi (basil leaves), yellow tofu (colored with turmeric) and boiled egg, until all the ingredients is soft and cooked. The authentic and complete Bogor laksa would include cooked shredded chicken and ground dried prawn, the cheaper street-side version however is entirely vegetarian, without any chicken or prawn, since oncom is traditionally regarded as a meat-substitute. Usually Laksa Bogor is served with sambal cuka (ground chilli in vinegar).|$|E

The common guavas are rank and harsh, but the 'strawberry guava,' as it is locally called, has a delicate, subacid flavour not easily equalled. The aguacáte, or alligator-pear (Persea gratissima), which was not 'introduced by the Basel missionaries from the West Indies,' is inferior to the Mexican. Connoisseurs compare its <b>nutty</b> <b>flavour</b> with that of the filbert, and eat it with pepper, salt, and the sauce of Worcester, whose fortune was made by the nice conduct of garlic. The papaw [Footnote: The leaves are rubbed on meat to make it tender, and a drop of milk from the young fruit acts as a vermifuge.] should be cooked as a vegetable and stuffed with forced meat; the flesh of the granadilla, which resembles it, is neglected, while the seeds and their surroundings are flavoured with sherry and sugar. There is an abundance of the Eriobotrya Japonica, in Madeira called the loquat and elsewhere the Japanese medlar: it grows wild in the Brazil, where the people distil from it.

30|$|Tiger nut is a {{perennial}} grass-like plant with spheroid tubers, pale yellow cream kernel {{surrounded by a}} fibrous sheath, which grows to about 90 [*]cm (3.0 [*]ft.) tall, with solitary stems growing from a tuber. It {{is also known as}} yellow nut sedge, earth or ground almonds, “souchet” in French, “ermandeln” in German and “chufa” in Spanish (TTSL 2005). In many countries, Cyperus esculentus is considered a weed (Adejuyitan 2011; Ukwuru and Ogbodo 2011). In Ghana, it grows in the wild, along rivers and are cultivated on a small scale by rural farmers mostly in the Eastern region of the country and parts of central region especially Awutu Obrakyire, Okuse Nkwanta and Bawjiase areas. The planting season in Ghana is between April and May and is mostly irrigated every week. Tubers develop about 6 – 8 [*]weeks after seedling emergence and grow quickly during July and August. Maturity is around 90 – 110 [*]days. The average yield ranges between 10 and 19 [*]t/ha (Pascual-Seva et al. 2016). The nuts are locally called “aya” in Hausa; “atadwe” in Twi and “atangbe” in Ga in the Ghanaian parlance. Tiger nuts are edible, sweet, <b>nutty,</b> <b>flavoured</b> tubers which contain protein, carbohydrate, sugars and lots of oil and fibre. Despite its name and its chemical composition which comprises characteristics of both tubers and nuts, tiger nut is a tuber (Pascual et al. 2000). It has been reported to be a “health” food since its consumption can help prevent heart diseases and thrombosis and is said to activate blood circulation and reduce the risk of colon cancer. The nut or tuber, when processed into milk, comes with varying nutritional and medicinal values similar to chemical compositions contained in nuts and tubers (Kampman et al. 1994; Arafat et al. 2009). Also, according to Mason (2008), tiger nut juice has been recognized for its additional health benefits as they are high in fibre, protein and natural sugars. The milk contains almost twice the quantity of starch as potato or sweet potato tubers (Arafat et al. 2009). It has also been found to possess good therapeutic properties since its consumption is found to be positively related to healthier cholesterol levels (Moore 2004).|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Msc Food Sc (Food Science)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Carob (Ceratonia silliqua) is an evergreen, drought {{resistant}} tree of Mediterranean origin. Popularly {{known as}} St John’s bread, the carob pod {{has a long}} history of use in food (over 4 000 years). Carob has a good nutritional value, a long shelf-life (2 - 3 years) and it is relatively cheap. Due to its high sugar content, carob is naturally sweet. It also has a <b>nutty</b> chocolate-like <b>flavour,</b> but unlike chocolate or cocoa, carob does not contain any caffeine, thiobromine or oxalic acid. In addition, carob is normally regarded as a healthy food because of its low fat content (0. 2 – 2. 3 %). Carob trees are also found in South Africa, especially in the Western Cape Province. Locally, carob trees have been used mainly ornamentally or as a source of animal fodder, with minimal use of the pods as a nutritious food source. Knowledge of the nutritional composition and the overall nutritional potential of locally (South African) grown carob cultivars is also limited. Carob could potentially be used as an alternative food source in South Africa as currently, most of this nutritious product goes to waste each year. In this study, the feasibility of using carob pods as an alternative source of food in South Africa was investigated. This was done by firstly, analysing the cultivars for proximate composition (moisture, carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fibre, protein, polyphenols, fat and ash) as well as for amino acids, fatty acids and minerals, in order to determine and compare their nutritional contents. Five cultivars (Tylliria, SFax, Aaronsohn, Santa Fe and an “Unknown” cultivar) were examined. The average proximate composition of raw carob pods was 8. 17 – 9. 56 % moisture, 89. 57 – 91. 12 % carbohydrates, 40. 69 – 54. 74 % total sugars (33. 70 – 45. 09 % sucrose, 1. 79 – 4. 95 % glucose and 1. 80 – 5. 19 % fructose), 29. 88 – 36. 07 % dietary fibre, 3. 07 – 4. 42 % protein, 2. 58 – 3. 08 % polyphenols, 0. 45 – 0. 86 % fat and 2. 13 – 2. 69 % ash. Seven essential amino acids were present in all the cultivars, except for methionine which was not detected in the Single unknown cultivar. This study has shown that all the cultivars had good long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) proportions in terms of the saturated to polyunsaturated fatty acid (SFA: PUFA) and n- 6 to n- 3 ratios. The short-chain fatty acid content of the cultivars was low. All nine minerals (calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, sodium, manganese, iron, copper and zinc) analysed for in this study were detected in all five carob cultivars and all cultivars were very low in sodium. The impact of various roasting times (45, 60 and 75 min) at 150 ºC, on the temperature sensitive components such as sugars, protein and fat, was also examined. Roasting had no significant (P> 0. 05) effect on the fat content. Although roasting significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the sugar and protein content from 54. 74 to 32. 53 % and 3. 59 to 3. 18 %, respectively, levels in both raw and roasted carob still represented a potentially nutritious food source and alternative to cocoa. A variety of food products targeted at the various food market sectors were developed with carob as an ingredient. The formulations for five new food products (bread, porridge, breakfast cereal, mousse and milk-based drink) were developed where carob had successfully been incorporated as an ingredient. Microbiological and consumer sensory analyses carried out showed that all products developed were safe and acceptable. The findings of this study provide useful scientific evidence towards the fact that carob could potentially be used as an alternative food source in South Africa...|$|R
