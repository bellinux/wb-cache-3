5|$|A charter {{purporting}} {{to be from}} King Æthelberht, dated 28 April 604, survives in the Textus Roffensis, {{as well as a}} copy based on the Textus in the 14th-century Liber Temporalium.

Among the witnesses is Laurence, Augustine's future successor, but not Augustine himself. The text turns to two different addressees. First, Æthelberht is made to admonish his son Eadbald, who had been established as a sub-ruler in the region of Rochester. The grant itself is addressed directly to Saint Andrew, the patron saint of the church, a usage parallelled by other charters in the same archive.|$|E
