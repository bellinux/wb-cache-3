50|$|The {{agency was}} {{previously}} tasked with archaeological commission operations. This was Sweden's largest archaeological operations organization with several regional offices, {{among those in}} Stockholm, Linköping, Gothenburg and Lund. On 1January 2015, the archaeological operations were transferred to the <b>National</b> <b>Historical</b> <b>Museums.</b> The National Heritage Board's previous double functions - as government agency and outsourcer - had been questioned as early as in the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|The Antikvarisk-topografiska arkivet (ATA) ("Antiquarian Topographic Archive") and the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities' Library {{are also}} part of the National Heritage Board. These {{departments}} are housed in the Eastern Stable at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm. The functions of the Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities and the National Heritage Board were separated in 1975 while they were still under the aegis under the newly formed government agency the [...] "National Heritage Board and National Historical Museums". These were separated into two agencies, the National Heritage Board and the <b>National</b> <b>Historical</b> <b>Museums,</b> in 1998.|$|E
40|$|More {{and more}} {{contemporary}} art exhibitions are {{finding their way}} into institutional spaces such as large and small-scale museums: whether they are <b>national</b> <b>historical</b> <b>museums</b> or independent micromuseums, contemporary art seems to be increasingly welcome in these spaces. What makes contemporary art so appealing to these institutions? What can contemporary art contribute to a museum whose primary focus is not art? Is the purpose of contemporary art to raise matters or questions that are otherwise repressed in these sites? Or does contemporary art simply become complicit with the museum’s status quo? Can a contemporary art exhibition make a lasting incursion, {{or is it a}} temporary hiatus in the museum’s otherwise normative practices? By considering the Freud Museum London’s extraordinary history of contemporary art exhibitions, this talk will open up these questions for discussion...|$|E

40|$|Climate and {{environmental}} change are global challenges which require global data and infrastructure to investigate. These challenges also require a multi-proxy approach, integrating evidence from Quaternary science and archaeology with information from studies on modern ecology and physical processes among other disciplines. The Strategic Environmental Archaeology Database (SEAD [URL] is a Swedish based international research e-infrastructure for storing, managing, analysing and disseminating palaeoenvironmental data from an almost unlimited number of analysis methods. The system currently makes available raw data from over 1500 sites (> 5300 datasets) and {{the analysis of}} Quaternary fossil insects, plant macrofossils, pollen, geochemistry and sediment physical properties, dendrochronology and wood anatomy, ceramic geochemistry and bones, along with numerous dating methods. This capacity will be expanded {{in the near future}} to include isotopes, multi-spectral and archaeo-metalurgical data. SEAD also includes expandable climate and environment calibration datasets, a complete bibliography and extensive metadata and services for linking these data to other resources. All data is available as Open Access through [URL] and downloadable software.   SEAD is maintained and managed at the Environmental Archaeology Lab and HUMlab at Umea University, Sweden. Development and data ingestion is progressing in cooperation with The Laboratory for Ceramic Research and the National Laboratory for Wood Anatomy and Dendrochronology at Lund University, Sweden, the Archaeological Research Laboratory, Stockholm University, the Geoarchaeological Laboratory, Swedish <b>National</b> <b>Historical</b> <b>Museums</b> Agency and several international partners and research projects. Current plans include expanding its capacity to serve as a data source for any system and integration with the Swedish National Heritage Board's information systems.   SEAD is partnered with the Neotoma palaeoecology database ([URL] and a new initiative for building cyberinfrastructure for transdisciplinary research and visualization of the long-term human ecodynamics of the North Atlantic funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Abstract will be published in conference abstracts volume. </p...|$|E
