The USA invented it, the ATTC tested it, the FCC accepted it, everyone is talking about it, soon we will all get it in our homes-but what is 8 -VSB anyway? Simply put, 8 -VSB is the RF modulation format utilized by the DTV (ATSC) digital television standard to transmit digital bits over the airwaves to the home consumer. Since any terrestrial TV system must overcome numerous channel impairments such as ghosts, <b>noise</b> <b>bursts,</b> <b>signal</b> fades, and interference {{in order to reach}} the home viewer, the selection of the right RF modulation format is critical. The 8 -VSB format is the cornerstone upon which the DTV standard is based; developing a basic understanding of 8 -VSB is imperative for those who will be working around DTV in the future. In the alphabet soup world of digital communications, there are two big names to remember when thinking about the complete DTV system: 8 -VSB and MPEG-II. 8 -VSB is the RF modulation format and MPEG-II is the video compression/packetization format. To convert high definition studio video into a form suitable for over-the-air broadcast, according to DTV standards, two stages of processing are needed: MPEG-II encoding and 8 -VSB modulation. Accordingly, two major pieces of equipment are required: an MPEG-II encoder and an 8 -VSB exciter. The MPEG-II encoder takes baseband digital video and performs bit rate compression using the techniques of discrete cosine transform, run length coding, and bi-directional motion prediction- all of which are {{beyond the scope of this}} article. The MPEG-II encoder then multiplexes this compressed video information together with pre-coded Dolby AC- 3 audio and any ancillary dat...|$|R

One {{hypothesis is that}} interlaminar cortical processing might be dedicated to analyzing temporal properties of sounds; if so, then there should be systematic depthdependent changes in cortical sensitivity to the temporal context in which a stimulus occurs. We recorded neural responses simultaneously across cortical depth in primary auditory cortex and anterior auditory field of CBA/Ca mice, and found systematic depth dependencies in responses to second-and-later <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> in slow (1 – 10 bursts/s) trains of <b>noise</b> <b>bursts.</b> At all depths, responses to <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> within a train usually decreased with increasing train rate; however, the rolloff with increasing train rate occurred at faster rates in more superficial layers. Moreover, in some recordings from mid-to-superficial layers, responses to <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> within a 3 – 4 bursts/s train were stronger than responses to <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> in slower trains. This non-monotonicity with train rate was especially pronounced in more superficial layers of the anterior auditory field, where responses to <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> {{within the context of}} a slow train were sometimes even stronger than responses to the <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> at train onset. These findings may reflect depth dependence in suppression and recovery of cortical activity following a stimulus, which we suggest could arise from laminar differences in synaptic depression at feedforward and recurrent synapses...|$|R

Typical applications which are sensitive against <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> are adaptive beamforming for audio signal acquisition or acoustic echo cancellation, where <b>noise</b> <b>bursts</b> are frequent due to undetected double-talk. In this paper, we apply double-talk resistant adaptive filtering [2] using a non-linear optimization criterion to adaptive beamforming in the discrete Fourier transform domain for bin-wise adaptation controls.

At tropical latitudes, the principal source of interference in the frequency range from 0. 1 to 10 MHz is the burst form of atmospheric radio noise. The structure of a burst shows several approximately rectangular pulses of random amplitude, duration and frequency of recurrence.

40|$|The {{perception}} of modulation of a tone {{interrupted by a}} <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> was investigated. The tone and its modulation were perceived as continuing through the noise. In experiment 1, subjects rated the similarity of an uninterrupted tone and a tone interrupted by noise, {{in terms of the}} perceived level and modulation depth of the sinusoidal carrier. The values of these parameters in the central portion of the uninterrupted tone were systematically varied. Both amplitude and frequency modulation (AM and FM) were used. The results indicated that the perceived level and modulation depth of the carrier did not change greatly during the <b>noise</b> <b>burst.</b> When the modulation rate differed before and after the <b>noise</b> <b>burst,</b> the modulation-rate transition was perceived to occur {{near the end of the}} <b>noise</b> <b>burst</b> for the FM stimuli. Hence, for these stimuli, the continuity illusion appears to be dominated by the portion of the tone before, rather than after, the interruption. Results for the AM stimuli showed a non-significant trend in the same direction. Experiment 2 used forced-choice tasks to evaluate the ability to detect a change in the ongoing phase of AM and FM following interruption by a <b>noise</b> <b>burst.</b> The results confirmed earlier findings for FM tones, and extended them to AM tones, showing that listeners lost track of the phase of the modulation, even though the modulation was perceived as continuous. © 2005 Elsevier B.

The alarm process is divided into two stages. The first stage is to detect the weak <b>burst</b> <b>signal</b> for reducing the missed detection rate.
