25|$|The use of <b>nifedipine</b> {{and related}} calcium channel antagonists was much reduced in {{response}} to 1995 trials that mortality was increased in patients with coronary artery disease who took <b>nifedipine.</b> This study was a meta-analysis, and demonstrated harm mainly in short-acting forms of <b>nifedipine</b> (that could cause large fluctations in blood pressure) and at high doses of 80mg a day and more.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nifedipine</b> is a {{calcium channel}} blocker. Although <b>nifedipine</b> and other dihydropyridines are {{commonly}} regarded as {{specific to the}} L-type calcium channel, they also possess nonspecific activity towards other voltage-dependent calcium channels.|$|E
25|$|Sublingual <b>nifedipine</b> has {{previously}} been used in hypertensive emergencies. It was once frequently prescribed as needed to people taking MAOIs for real or perceived hypertensive crises. This {{was found to be}} dangerous, and has been abandoned. Sublingual <b>nifedipine</b> causes blood-pressure lowering through peripheral vasodilation. It can cause an uncontrollable decrease in blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, and a steal phenomenon in certain vascular beds. There have been multiple reports in the medical literature of serious adverse effects with sublingual <b>nifedipine,</b> including cerebral ischemia/infarction, myocardial infarction, complete heart block, and death. As a result of this, the FDA reviewed all data regarding the safety and efficacy of sublingual <b>nifedipine</b> for hypertensive emergencies in 1995, and concluded that the practice should be abandoned because it was neither safe nor efficacious. An exception to the avoidance of this practice is in the use of <b>nifedipine</b> in the treatment of hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury.|$|E
25|$|Raynaud's {{phenomenon}} is often treated with <b>nifedipine.</b> A 2005 meta-analysis showed modest benefits (33% decrease in attack severity, 2.8-5 reduction in absolute number of attacks per week); it does conclude that most included studies used low doses of <b>nifedipine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Nifedipine</b> rapidly lowers blood pressure, and {{patients}} are commonly warned {{they may feel}} dizzy or faint after taking the first few doses. Tachycardia (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of <b>nifedipine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Extended release {{formulations}} of <b>nifedipine</b> {{should be taken}} on an empty stomach, and patients are warned not to consume anything containing grapefruit or grapefruit juice, as they raise blood <b>nifedipine</b> levels. There are several possible mechanisms, including the lowering of CYP3A4 activity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nifedipine</b> is {{also used}} in high-altitude {{medicine}} to treat high altitude pulmonary edema.|$|E
25|$|Topical <b>nifedipine</b> {{has been}} shown to be as {{effective}} as topical nitrates for anal fissures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nifedipine</b> is {{effective}} {{only in a}} minority, and dose is often limited by hypotension.|$|E
25|$|Other topical agents such as amitriptyline, gabapentin, Citrullus colocynthis extract, <b>nifedipine,</b> and {{pentoxifylline}} {{are also}} under investigation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nifedipine</b> has {{additionally}} {{been found}} {{to act as an}} antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nifedipine</b> (initially BAY a1040) was {{developed}} by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer, with most initial studies being performed in the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Several medications, {{including}} verapamil and <b>nifedipine,</b> {{as well as}} ergot derivatives such as bromocriptine and pergolide, {{have been}} associated with medication-induced erythromelalgia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nifedipine,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Adalat among others, is a {{medication}} used to manage angina, high blood pressure, Raynaud's phenomenon, and premature labor. It {{is one of}} the treatments of choice for Prinzmetal angina. It may be used to treat severe high blood pressure in pregnancy. Its use in preterm labor may allow more time for steroids to improve the baby's lungs and time to transfer the mother to a well qualified medical facility before delivery. <b>Nifedipine</b> is taken by mouth and comes in fast and slow release formulations.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin {{receptor}} blockers or ACE inhibitors may aid {{blood flow}} to the fingers, and {{there is some evidence that}} angiotensin receptor blockers (often losartan) reduce frequency and severity of attacks, and possibly better than <b>nifedipine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{calcium channel}} blocker <b>nifedipine</b> prolongs {{cardiovascular}} event- and procedure-free survival in patients with coronary artery disease. New overt heart failures were reduced by 29% compared to placebo; however, the mortality rate {{difference between the two}} groups was statistically insignificant.|$|E
25|$|In pregnancy, this sign {{normally}} disappears {{owing to}} increased surface blood flow. Raynaud's has also occurred in breastfeeding mothers, causing nipples to turn white and become extremely painful. <b>Nifedipine,</b> a {{calcium channel blocker}} and vasodilator, was recommended to increase {{blood flow to the}} extremities and noticeably relieved pain in the breast in an extremely small study group.|$|E
25|$|As a β2 agonist, {{salbutamol}} {{also has}} use in obstetrics. Intravenous salbutamol {{can be used}} as a tocolytic to relax the uterine smooth muscle to delay premature labor. While preferred over agents such as atosiban and ritodrine, its role has largely been replaced by the calcium channel blocker <b>nifedipine,</b> which is more effective, better tolerated, and administered orally.|$|E
25|$|At initial diagnosis, {{hypoglycemia}} is corrected with intravenous glucose {{to normalize}} plasma glucose concentration and prevent brain damage. Long-term medical management includes {{the use of}} diazoxide, somatostatin analogs, <b>nifedipine,</b> glucagon, recombinant IGF-I, glucocorticoids, human growth hormone, dietary intervention, or combinations of these therapies. In individuals in whom aggressive medical management fails to maintain plasma glucose concentration within safe limits, or in whom such therapy cannot be safely maintained over time, pancreatic resection is considered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nifedipine</b> {{has been}} used {{frequently}} as a tocolytic (agent that delays premature labor). A Cochrane review has concluded that it has benefits over placebo or no treatment for prolongation of pregnancy. It has also benefits over beta-agonists and may also have some benefits over atosiban and magnesium sulphate, although atosiban results in fewer maternal adverse effects. No difference {{was found in the}} rate of deaths among babies around the time of birth, and data on longer-term outcomes were limited.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} persons have {{developed}} toxicity due to acute overdosage with <b>nifedipine,</b> either accidentally or intentionally, and via either oral or parenteral administration. The adverse effects include lethargy, bradycardia, marked hypotension and loss of consciousness. The drug may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Analytical methods usually involve gas or liquid chromatography and specimen concentrations are usually in the 100-1000 μg/L range.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nifedipine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1969 and approved {{for use in the}} United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale price in the developing world for the slow release form is about 1.90 to 3.80 USD per month. In the United States it is about 40 to 60 USD a month depending on the dose.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} for mild cases is simply reassurance and topical treatment with calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem, <b>nifedipine)</b> ointment, salbutamol inhalation and sublingual nitroglycerine.For persistent cases, local anesthetic blocks, clonidine or Botox injections can be considered. Supportive treatments directed at aggravating factors include high-fiber diet, withdrawal of drugs which have gut effects (e.g., drugs that provoke or worsen constipation including narcotics and oral calcium channel blockers; drugs that provoke or worsen diarrhea including quinidine, theophylline, and antibiotics), warm baths, rectal massage, perineal strengthening exercises, anti-cholinergic agents, non-narcotic analgesics, sedatives or muscle relaxants such as diazepam.|$|E
25|$|Vasodilators – {{calcium channel}} blockers, {{such as the}} dihydropyridines <b>nifedipine</b> or amlodipine, preferably slow release {{preparations}} – are often first line treatment. They have the common side effects of headache, flushing, and ankle edema; {{but these are not}} typically of sufficient severity to require cessation of treatment. The limited evidence available shows that calcium channel blockers are only slightly effective in reducing how often the attacks happen. Peoples whose RP is secondary to erythromelalgia often cannot use vasodilators for therapy as they trigger 'flares' causing the extremities to become burning red due to there being too much blood.|$|E
25|$|Very rarely, nipple {{pain can}} be caused by {{vasospasm}} of the nipple. In essence, blood does not flow properly to the nipple which causes the nipple to blanch. This {{can be caused}} by trauma to the nipple through early breastfeeding or candidal infection of the nipple. The pain is intense during the latch stage and in between breastfeeding sessions there is a throbbing pain when the nipple is blanched. The nipple can be massaged to help blood flow return to reduce pain, as well as avoiding cold. In some instances, heart medication, <b>nifedipine,</b> is used to help the blood flow return to the nipple.|$|E
25|$|Medical therapy {{of chronic}} aortic {{insufficiency}} that is stable and asymptomatic {{involves the use}} of vasodilators. Trials have shown a short term benefit in the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, <b>nifedipine,</b> and hydralazine in improving left ventricular wall stress, ejection fraction, and mass. The goal in using these pharmacologic agents is to decrease the afterload so that the left ventricle is somewhat spared. The regurgitant fraction may not change significantly, since the gradient between the aortic and left ventricular pressures is usually fairly low at the initiation of treatment. Other rather conservative medical treatments for stable and asymptomatic cases include low sodium diet, diuretics, digoxin, calcium blockers and avoiding very strenuous activity.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as <b>nifedipine</b> (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E
500|$|For {{women with}} {{injuries}} above T6, a risk during labor and delivery that threatens {{both mother and}} fetus is autonomic dysreflexia, in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. Drugs such as <b>nifedipine</b> and captopril {{can be used to}} manage an episode if it occurs, and epidural anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI. [...] Anesthesia is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation, who may only experience contractions as abdominal discomfort, increased spasticity, and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery; in fact, they may fail to realize when they go into labor. If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine caesarian section may be necessary. Babies of women with SCI {{are more likely to be}} born prematurely, and, premature or not, they are more likely to be small for their gestational time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{autonomic}} {{effects of}} tetanus {{can be difficult}} to manage (alternating hyper- and hypotension hyperpyrexia/hypothermia) and may require IV labetalol, magnesium, clonidine, or <b>nifedipine</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Branded {{preparations}} are {{now available}} of topical nitroglycerine ointment (Rectogesic (Rectiv) as 0.2% in Australia and 0.4% in UK and US), topical <b>nifedipine</b> 0.3% with lidocaine 1.5% ointment (Antrolin in Italy since April 2004) and diltiazem 2% (Anoheal in UK, although still in Phase III development). [...] A common side effect drawback of nitroglycerine ointment is headache, caused by systemic absorption of the drug, which limits patient acceptability.|$|E
2500|$|Topical {{treatment}} for the skin changes of scleroderma do not alter the disease course, but may improve pain and ulceration. A range of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) {{can be used to}} ease painful symptoms, such as naproxen. There is limited benefit from steroids such as prednisone. Episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes respond to <b>nifedipine</b> or other calcium channel blockers; severe digital ulceration may respond to prostacyclin analogue iloprost, and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan may be beneficial for Raynaud's phenomenon. The skin tightness may be treated systemically with methotrexate and ciclosporin. and the skin [...] thickness treated with penicillamine.|$|E
2500|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} {{that women with}} severe hypertension during pregnancy should receive treatment with anti-hypertensive agents. Severe hypertension is generally considered systolic BP of at least 160 or diastolic BP of at least 110. Evidence {{does not support the}} use of one anti-hypertensive over another. The choice of which agent to use should be based on the prescribing clinician's experience with a particular agent, its cost, and its availability. Diuretics are not recommended for prevention of preeclampsia and its complications. Labetolol, Hydralazine and <b>Nifedipine</b> are commonly used antihypertensive agents for hypertension in pregnancy. [...] ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are contraindicated as they affect fetal development.|$|E
2500|$|In DIGO, {{improved}} {{oral hygiene}} and plaque control is still important {{to help reduce}} any inflammatory component that may be contributing to the overgrowth. Reversing and preventing gingival enlargement caused by drugs {{is as easy as}} ceasing drug therapy or substituting to another drug. [...] However, this is not always an option; in such a situation, alternative drug therapy may be employed, if possible, to avoid this deleterious side effect. [...] In the case of immunosuppression, tacrolimus is an available alternative which results in much less severe gingival overgrowth than cyclosporin, but is similarly as nephrotoxic. [...] The dihydropyridine derivative isradipidine can replace <b>nifedipine</b> for some uses of calcium channel blocking and does not induce gingival overgrowth.|$|E
2500|$|The drug {{acetazolamide}} (trade name Diamox) {{may help}} some people making a rapid ascent to sleeping altitude above , {{and it may}} also be effective if started early in the course of AMS. Acetazolamide can be taken before symptoms appear as a preventive measure at a dose of 125mg twice daily. The Everest Base Camp Medical Centre cautions against its routine use as a substitute for a reasonable ascent schedule, except where rapid ascent is forced by flying into high altitude locations or due to terrain considerations. The Centre suggests a dosage of 125mg twice daily for prophylaxis, starting from 24 hours before ascending until a few days at the highest altitude or on descending; with 250mg twice daily recommended for treatment of AMS. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest the same dose for prevention of 125mg acetazolamide every 12 hours. Acetazolamide, a mild diuretic, works by stimulating the kidneys to secrete more bicarbonate in the urine, thereby acidifying the blood. This change in pH stimulates the respiratory center to increase the depth and frequency of respiration, thus speeding the natural acclimatization process. An undesirable side-effect of acetazolamide is a reduction in aerobic endurance performance. Other minor side effects include a tingle-sensation in hands and feet. [...] Although a sulfonamide; acetazolamide is a non-antibiotic and has not been shown to cause life-threatening allergic cross-reactivity in those with a self-reported sulfonamide allergy. Dosage of 1000mg/day will produce a 25% decrease in performance, on top of the reduction due to high-altitude exposure. The CDC advises that Dexamethasone be reserved for treatment of severe AMS and HACE during descents, and notes that <b>Nifedipine</b> may prevent HAPE.|$|E
