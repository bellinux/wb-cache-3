In the 19th century, {{sisters of}} the Poor Clare convent introduced <b>needlepoint</b> <b>lace</b> to the women and girls of the locality. It {{was a response to}} the poverty that followed the Great Famine. The initiative was of immeasurable help {{to the people of the}} area in those difficult years.|$|E

5000|$|... "Kenmare lace" [...] is a {{needlepoint}} Irish lace {{based on}} the detached buttonhole stitch. (It is sometimes called needle-lace to distinguish it from canvas needlepoint.) Linen thread was used by nuns to make <b>needlepoint</b> <b>lace.</b> Suitable linen thread is no longer available so today cotton thread is used.|$|E
50|$|Point is a flat <b>needlepoint</b> <b>lace</b> {{with rows of}} knotted {{buttonhole}} stitches worked over stretched threads. Simple {{designs are}} created by holes left in otherwise plain cloth work formed by the buttonhole stitches. Noted for its appearance in baby clothes in the 18th and early 19th century, particularly in caps, the shoulder seams of shirts, bibs and detachable sleeves worn over babies swaddling bands.|$|E
5000|$|Kenmare <b>needlepoint</b> <b>lace</b> {{begins with}} {{two pieces of}} cloth. Over this is layered a pattern and a matt contact. Thread is laid over top in {{the outline of the}} design and secured with a fine {{detached}} buttonhole stitch in a process called [...] "couching". The pattern is filled in by working in from the outline. The tension makes the pattern. How tightly the stitches are pulled determines whether the pattern's stitches are open or tight. When the work is finished, the thread holding down the outline is cut thus releasing the lace from the cloth backing.|$|E
