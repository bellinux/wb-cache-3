5|$|There are a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> on the {{potential}} uses of Type I and II fluids. The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than the holdover time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid {{may result in a}} temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E
