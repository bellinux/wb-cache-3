"The {{whole idea}} {{is that you have}} that nostalgic night out, so people who are older can listen to it too. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> naive enough not to know what kids do.

2500|$|A lot {{of people}} say, [...] "I'm it. I'm the divine incarnation. I'm here and let me hip you." [...] … But Prabhupada was never like that … I always liked his humility and his simplicity: [...] "the servant of the servant of the servant" [...] is really what it is, you know. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> God – [...] just His servants.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930 Stout said: [...] "Aviation in the U.S. {{has been}} stagnating for two years. We are all copying.

2500|$|Bono also {{received}} the NAACP Image Award's chairman's Award in 2007. On 24 May 2007, the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia announced that Bono would receive the Philadelphia Liberty Medal on 27 September 2007 {{for his work}} to end world poverty and hunger. On 28 September 2007, in accepting the Liberty Medal, Bono said, [...] "When you are trapped by poverty, you are not free. When trade laws prevent you from selling the food you grew, you are not free ... When you are a monk in Burma this very week, barred from entering a temple because of your gospel of peace ... well, then <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> truly free". Bono donated the $100,000 prize to the organisation. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala accepted the award for the Washington-based Debt AIDS Trade Africa.|$|E
2500|$|The band plays music more {{oriented}} towards '70s guitar-driven {{rock bands}} because, as Wood stated, [...] "etal just becomes {{the same thing}} over and over. Anyway, I'm not really a metal dude. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are.</b> I'm sure if you studied pictures of 3 Inches of Blood you could pick us out as not really belonging there". Sunny and Bobby were replaced by Justin Hagberg, who had previously played with Pipes in Allfather, a black metal band, and Shane Clark. Roadrunner put out an advertising blitz, and the track [...] "Deadly Sinners" [...] from the band's second release Advance and Vanquish appeared on numerous sampler CDs, compilations, and even three video games (Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Saints Row 2, and Brütal Legend), creating a huge press hype for the band that caused their popularity to skyrocket, with a slot on 2005's Road Rage tour in August (with bands like Machine Head and Chimaira) gaining them many new fans.|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{most public}} seminaries {{textbooks}} are prescribed {{to each of}} the several schools, as the norma docendi in that school; and this is generally done by authority of the trustees. I should not propose this generally in our University, because I believe <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> so much at the heights of science in the several branches as to undertake this, and therefore that it will be better left to the professors until occasion of interference shall be given. But there is one branch in which we are the best judges, in which heresies may be taught of so interesting a character to our own State and to the United States, as to make it a duty in us to lay down the principles which are to be taught. It is that of government... one of that school of quondam federalism, now consolidation. It is our duty to guard against such principles being disseminated among our youth and the diffusion of that poison, by a previous prescription of the texts to be followed in their discourses."—Thomas Jefferson to -----, 1825.

60|$|Fortunately <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>was</b> injured, {{and when}} we had disentangled {{ourselves}} from the wreckage, and the lesser moon had burst again from below the horizon, we found that {{we were at the}} foot of a mighty ice-barrier, from which outcropped great patches of the granite hills which hold it from encroaching farther toward the south.|$|R
