40|$|Understanding of the {{three-dimensional}} shock wave-vortex loop interaction phenomena {{plays a key}} role in noise reduction. This study focuses on {{the three-dimensional}} shock wave distortion and propagation phenomena in a near-field supersonic jet. Shock-square vortex loop interaction was experimentally investigated in a square cross-sectional open-end shock wave generating tube at an incident shock Mach number of 1. 39  ±  0. 05. A square vortex loop impinged on a reflected shock wave from a wall located in front of the nozzle end. The planar reflected shock wave transforms into either a concave or convex distorted shape due to the opposing high-speed flow emitted from the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner.</b> The convex shaped shock wave scatters towards the outside of the vortex loop, whereas the concave one converges towards the centre of the vortex loop. The concave shaped shock wave results in shock wave focusing. In shock-square vortex loop interaction, the shock wave is locally focused along the axis of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner...</b>|$|E

40|$|Saving {{energy has}} gained an {{increased}} importance both for economical and environmental reasons. For trains, the lowering of the aerodynamic drag {{is an important}} aspect for energy efficiency. A strategy is to use passive control devices that interact with the flow and thereby reduces the drag. The {{purpose of the present}} thesis has been to evaluate the drag reducing effects of two different passive control devices, namely vortex generators and <b>corner</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The aerodynamic drag is partly developed from skin friction on the surface and partly from the pressure difference between the front and rear end of a train. The focus in this thesis has been on reducing the pressure difference. The evaluation was performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with PANS to simulate the flow around train models. The simulations were done on three different cases; one for a simple train model without control devices, one for a train model with vortex generators and one for a train model with <b>corner</b> <b>nozzles</b> attached. The dimensions of the train model were chosen similar to a previous wind tunnel study, which was also used for comparison of the results. The Reynolds number used in the simulations was 50, 000, significantly lower than in the experiments, due to the demanded computational time and computer power. From the simulation results there was an increase in pressure behind the train in the wake when using both control devices, but it was no decrease in CD for the total train geometry including devices. The CD value for the vortex generators and <b>corner</b> <b>nozzles</b> were increased 11. 2 % and 0. 4 % respectively.

40|$|The {{brittle failure}} {{assessment}} for the {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) of a 1300 MW pressurized water reactor (PWR) was revised according to the advanced state of the art. The RPV steel is 22 NiMoCr 37 (A 508 Cl. 2). The expected neutron fluence at End of License (EOL) after 32 years of full operation is Φ < 2. 31018 cm- 2. The assessment followed a multi-barrier concept to prove independently exclusion of crack initiation, crack arrest and exclusion of the load necessary to advance the arrested cracks through the RPV wall. For operational conditions, a combination of shut-down and anomalous operation was proven as the leading transient. This transient follows a load path decreasing with temperature and thus producing a warm pre-stressing for flaws in the RPV. Therefore, a warm pre-stress (WPS) effect is to be considered. For {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) conditions, a leak size screening was performed to find the leading transients. Enveloping transients were determined and used for the brittle failure assessment. As covering crack postulates circumferential cracks in the flange joint to the vessel and axial cracks in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner</b> were investigated both under the assumption of a broken clad. For the LOCA loads, the leading leak size was determined by finite element analyses and fracture mechanics based assessment of different combinations of cold/hot leg leak position and cold/hot leg injection of emergency core cooling (ECC). Leading situations are in the flange joint for the cylinder and in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner</b> for the flange. In the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner,</b> high thermal loading from cross corner cooling produces large plastic deformation and loss of constraint. In this situation, the fracture toughness KIC as determined from deeply cracked fracture mechanics specimens is not representative for the component. Thus, loss of constraint in the component was considered by the application of a constraint modified master curve to determine the constraint representative fracture toughness. For the investigated load cases the relevant part of the load paths is at upper shelf temperatures, {{with the exception of the}} anomalous operation starting at 50 °C to lower temperatures. The results of the investigation demonstrate preclusion of initiation for normal and anomalous operation as well as for LOCA loads. For LOCA, two further barriers were proven with crack arrest for postulated crack extension well within allowable depth in the RPV wall and with the preclusion of the load necessary to advance the arrested crack through the wall...|$|E
40|$|The {{brittle failure}} {{assessment}} for five {{pressurized water reactor}} pressure vessels (RPV) of German nuclear power plants (NPP) has been revisited according to an advanced state of the art. Besides of recent innovation in fracture toughness curves and reference temperatures being already in the codes, also the effect of loss of constraint had to be considered when fracture toughness values determined from deep cracks in fracture toughness specimen with high multi-axial state of stress were transferred to crack configurations in the component. Thus, the available concepts were compared for their fitness for purpose, i. e. {{for their ability to}} give a fracture toughness representative to the crack configuration or flaw postulate in the component. The results of the investigation reveal a significant lower constraint in the component resulting in increased fracture toughness and showing that the brittle failure assessment based on the high constraint fracture toughness from the standard specimens can be very conservative. For consideration of the constraint conditions in the component besides the deterministic T-stress parameter also probabilistic local approach concepts based on the Weibull model were used which have the advantage of considering both the local stress strain field and the material volume under high loading. The loss of constraint was determined for several flaw postulates in the leading situations on the RPV being the coolant inlet <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner</b> and the flange joint. A considerable loss of constraint was demonstrated for flaw postulates with broken clad in the ferritic <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner.</b> Also in the flange joint the loss of constraint is evident for small flaws. In addition, for flaw postulates under the intact cladding the loss of constraint is remarkably higher than with broken postulated cladding. In summary, with the measured material toughness and the significant loss of constraint a considerable inherent margin against brittle failure can be demonstrated for the investigated load cases...|$|E
40|$|The inner blend {{regions of}} some {{pressure}} vessel nozzles are examined ultrasonically {{from the outside}} surface of the nozzle or of the vessel.

40|$|A {{shear-stress}} [...] sensitive {{liquid crystal}} coating (LCC) {{was used to}} visualize the surface shear stress distribution on the flat sidewall of the MSU quiet supersonic tunnel {{as a function of}} flow stagnation pressure. Under conditions of quiet operation, the LCC color-change response indicated the existence of a nonuniform surface shear stress distribution. This shear pattern was characterized by an elongated, down st ream-point ing triangular region of relatively low shear, with its apex on and its axis coincident with, the sidewall centerline. This low-shear zone was bounded symmetrically by two regions of relatively higher shear; these high-shear zones originated within the concave-curvature portion of the <b>nozzle,</b> in the <b>corners</b> between the flat sidewall and the contoured upper and lower nozzle surfaces. A 3 -D Navier-Stokes code was used to compute the pressure and surface shear distributions on the sidewall. Flow-expansion-induced transverse pressure gradients on the nozzle sidewall generated symmetric inflows from the corners towards the sidewall centerline; these inflows caused a thickening of the sidewall boundary layer along the centerline, resulting in lower shear stresses consistent with the liquid crystal results. Peripherally nonuniform laminar boundary layer development, and the associated stability of such complex 3 -D flows, must be considered in quiet-tunnel applications using rectangular nozzles.

40|$|The {{brittle failure}} {{assessment}} for the {{reactor pressure vessel}} (RPV) of a 1300 MW pressurized water reactor was revised {{according to the state}} of the art. The RPV steel is 22 NiMoCr 37 (A 508 Cl. 2). The expected neutron fluence at the end of license (EOL) after 32 years of full operation is Phi < 2. 3 x 10 (18) neutrons/cm(2). The assessment followed a multibarrier concept to independently prove the exclusion of crack initiation, crack arrest, and exclusion of the load necessary to advance the arrested cracks through the RPV wall. Thermal and structural analyses of the RPV were performed both for the reactor shutdown with postulated upset conditions, as the most severe load case at operation, and for loss of coolant accident (LOCA) conditions. For LOCA transients, a leak size screening of different combinations of cold/hot leg injection of emergency core cooling was performed, and the leading leak size was determined. A fracture mechanics based assessment was carried out for extended circumferential flaws in the weld joint between the RPV shell and the flange, as well as for axial flaws in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner.</b> These flaw geometries postulated at locations of the highest principal stresses and lowest temperatures under the respective transient conditions are representative for the brittle failure assessment of the whole vessel. For a normal operation, the maximum crack driving force takes place at high temperatures preceding the upset conditions. The transient follows a load path decreasing with temperature, producing a warm prestressing effect, which is considered in the assessment. Thus, a large safety margin against crack initiation can be demonstrated. At LOCA, the most severe conditions are determined for postulated cracks in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner.</b> Here, applying the constraint modified master curve, which takes account of the low stress triaxiality in the component, the exclusion of crack initiation is proven. Furthermore, two additional safety barriers are proven, the crack arrest after postulated crack initiation well within the allowable depth, as well as the preclusion of the load necessary to advance the arrested crack through the RPV wall...|$|E

It is found that the buoyant jet is unstable to the positive buoyancy forces, which promote the inflow motion near the nozzle exit. The surrounding low temperature fluid moves into the nozzle along the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner</b> and mixes with the high temperature fluid deep into the nozzle. Then, the flow pattern inside the nozzle becomes highly complex to promote the laminar to turbulent transition of the vertical buoyant jet.

40|$|The project 'Strength and {{fracture}} behaviour of branch {{connections and}} elbows under internal pressure load and superimposed external bending moment' (BV IV) {{was carried out}} at MPA Stuttgart from 1989 to 1993. The objective of the project BV IV was to extend the foundations for a safety-relevant assessment of the main coolant pipes (MCP) of primary systems of pressurized water reactors (PWR). This was made by enhancing the state of knowledge of the load bearing behaviour (stress state) {{as well as the}} failure and fracture behaviour (crack initiation, crack propagation, leak-before-break) of degraded branch connections (T-branches) and elbows. The manufacture and design of the T-branches and elbows was performed according to the conditions in the plants KWO, KKS, KWB A, GKN- 1, KKU and KWB B. The dimensions corresponded to those of the main coolant pipe, resp. to the T-branch of the surge line. The T-branches and Elbows were on the one hand made of the material 20 MnMoNi 5 5 (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e > 150 J) {{and on the other hand}} of a MnMoNiV-special melt (upper shelf impact energy C_v, _t_r_a_n_s_v_e_r_s_e #approx# 50 J). Both materials dispose of comparable strength properties. The loads applied during the tests covered the loading types and levels occurring in the plants as well as those postulated for accidents. In the case of the T-branches the flaws were applied on the inside of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner</b> shaped as a quarter-elliptical <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner</b> flaw longitudinal to the run pipe axis, in the case of the elbows the flaws (spark eroded notches, prefatigue cracks) were applied longitudinally on the inside in the area of the bend flanks. The flaw size was chosen in a way to be definitely found by nondestructive examination methods. Five tests with T-branches consisting of a run pipe with set-on nozzle and six tests with 90 elbows were carried out. An external bending moment (in the case of elbows in-plane bending moment with opening mode, in the case of T-branches in-plane at the branch pipe) was applied reaching maximum load resp. until occurrence of leakage (quasistatic load, in the case of elbows also pulsating load). This took place in the tests after attaining the test temperature (temperature of the upper shelf impact energy, for one T-branch made of the special melt the test temperature corresponded to the transitional range of the C_v-T-curve with T 30 C) as well as the static internal pressure (operational pressure, exception one test with T-branch with p_i = 11 MPa).

Clad thicknesses between 5 and 9 mm on samples that vary in thickness from 45 to 200 mm were studied. The samples were taken from flat plates, from a spherical head of a pressure vessel, from a ring-segment of a nozzle bore, and from the transition radius between a nozzle and a pressure vessel shell. A layer removal method was used to measure the residual stresses. The effects of uncertainties in elastic constants (Young`s modulus and Poisson`s ratio) as well as experimental error are assessed. All measurements were done at room temperature. The results of this work indicate that curvature plays a significant role in cladding residual stress and that tensile residual stresses as high as the yield stress can be measured in the cladding material. Since the vessel from which the spherical and <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner</b> samples were taken was hydrotested, and the flat plate specimens were taken from specimens used in mechanical fatigue testing, these results suggest that rather high tensile residual stresses can be retained in the cladding material even after some mechanical loading associated with hydrotesting and that higher levels of hydrotest loading would be required to alter the cladding residual stresses...|$|E
40|$|The brittle {{fracture}} {{assessment of the}} reactor pressure vessels (RPV) of the EON Kernkraft (EKK) pressurized water reactors has been updated {{to the state of}} the art. The reference temperatures of the RPV for the design fluence of 5 E 18 n/cm² are at or below 0 °C. The weld joint between vessel flange and cylinder as well as the hot and the cold leg nozzle corners proved to be the prominent and covering situations for the RPV. The fracture mechanics results for these configurations for operational and loss of coolant transients (LOCA) were produced rerunning the assessment procedure established for the licensing of the RPV and additionally with the application of state of the art procedure. Big margin inherent to the older procedure was disclosed with the more realistic but still conservative input. Most of the margin resulted from the application of the fracture toughness based reference temperature RTTo in place of RTNDT, from the constraint representative fracture toughness applied in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner</b> situation and from taking into account the results of the non destructive evaluation (NDE) during the manufacture and the in-service inspection (ISI) with defect postulates of allowable size. The results show the load paths with large distance to thefracture toughness curve, in the upper shelf temperature region of fracture toughness and/or with negligible values far below the lower shelf, both demonstrating an excessive inherent safety of the older procedure. In addition, for the LOCA, a multi barrier concept is applied. Besides the flawless state of the vessel and the preclu sion of initiation from postulated flaws, with the arrest of postulated crack initiation and break preclusion for crack extension from postulated rising load after crack arrest two additional barriers against failure were proven.

40|$|The {{brittle failure}} safety of reactor {{pressure}} vessels (RPV) {{has to be}} demonstrated for all load cases. According to the ASME code and the German KTA standard the crack driving force for defined crack postulates has to {{be compared with the}} fracture toughness of the RPV material. Depending on crack size and local stress strain condition the material in the component behaves quite different than the material characterized in standard fracture mechanics tests. Due to the lower constraint in the component, the brittle failure assessment based on these standards can be very conservative. For consideration of the constraint conditions in the component the deterministic quantities as the T-stress or the Q-parameter are often applied. But they consider neither the volume of material under high loading nor the out-ofplane stress state ahead of the postulated crack nor the effect of transient loading. These difficulties can be overcome using local approach models based on the weakest link principle in which the failure probability can be described by quantities based on the local stress state and the affected volume. In order to demonstrate the effect of transient loading on the loss of constraint and to validate the local approach model experiments on bend specimens with shallow cracks under transient loading have been performed. These tests show an enormous shift of the master curve reference temperature of - 100 °C compared to the reference temperature from C(T) tests. This shift is caused by the shallow crack effect and even more by the effect of the transient loading. For the assessment of different flaw postulates in the leading location of the RPV the loss of constraint was quantified using the classical Beremin model as well as the enhanced model developed at Fraunhofer IWM. For flaw postulates in the ferritic <b>nozzle</b> <b>corner</b> with flaw depths up to 75 mm (quarter of wall thickness acc. to ASME Code) and with the assumption of broken clad a considerable loss of constraint was determined. In addition, for flaw postulates under the intact cladding the loss of constraint is remarkably higher than with cladding postulated as broken. In summary, with the measured material toughness and the significant loss of constraint a considerablemargin against brittle failure can be demonstrated...|$|E
