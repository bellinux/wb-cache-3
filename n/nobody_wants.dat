During the end credits, Andy sings a song he wrote for April called [...] "November," [...] which includes the lyrics, [...] "Let's spread our wings and fly on a date." [...] This is also a reference to [...] "Woman of the Year," [...] in which Andy explained every song he writes includes either the lyrics, [...] "Spread your wings and fly" [...] or [...] "You deserve to be a champion."

500|$|The Immaculate Collection, Madonna's first greatest-hits {{compilation}} album, {{was released}} in November 1990.

[...] "Justify My Love" [...] reached {{number one in the}} U.S. becoming her ninth number-one Its music video featured scenes of sadomasochism, bondage, same-sex kissing, and brief nudity. The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network. Madonna responded to the banning: [...] "Why is it that people are willing to go and watch a movie about someone getting blown to bits for no reason at all, and <b>nobody</b> <b>wants</b> to see two girls kissing and two men snuggling?" ...|$|E

Darabont credited Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC. [...] "Gale was tremendously instrumental in jump-starting it at a point where it felt like it was languishing, [...] "he asserted. [...] "I'd gotten turned down enough times, which is no reflection on the material, but no matter what you're trying to sell in Hollywood, you're Willy Loman and it's Death of a Salesman.

500|$|Townsend's {{restraint}} {{reaches a}} breaking point on [...] "Heaven's End", which Jon Wiederhorn of Revolver described as [...] "a groovy pop song that morphs into a violent, acid-drenched nightmare." [...] It {{is followed by}} [...] "Ain't Never Gonna Win", a live studio jam by the album's four musicians which was described by David E. Gehlke of the online magazine Blistering as [...] "trippy". [...] "Trainfire", a classic country–style song inspired by Elvis Presley's cover of [...] "Mystery Train", addresses Townsend's former addiction to pornography, which he described as [...] "this crazy, crack cocaine on the internet that <b>nobody</b> <b>wants</b> to talk about." [...] The song continues the album's theme of honesty and self-acceptance, both about pornography and musical tastes. Townsend explained the song's musical style, saying [...] "yes, I like heavy music and am good at making it, {{but that is not}} all that I listen to, and that is not all that I want to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Mansukhani later {{added the}} gay storyline {{because he thought}} it was an issue that needed to be touched on. However, the {{director}} did not want the film to be serious or preachy: [...] "I also realise that when you preach via cinema <b>nobody</b> <b>wants</b> to hear it". [...] "The film has a message, if you get it, great. If you don’t, no problem, sit back, relax and enjoy the film", he said about making Dostana a romantic comedy. In February 2008, Johar announced the film's title; the producer named it after a 1980 film produced by his father, Yash Johar. Asked if his film was also a love triangle, he replied: [...] "Well, yes and no. Though it's a love story, there's a never-before twist in the tale. All I can say on record is that we've never had a love triangle like this before." [...] The gay storyline was not disclosed until the trailers were released. Manan Sagar was hired to edit the film, and the duo Salim–Sulaiman composed the background score.|$|E

Tracy realizes he needs to be with Angie, but changes his mind and goes to a strip club. After returning home and in order to stay there, Tracy decides to wear his dog's shock collar on himself. Tracy then sends Kenneth to take his place at Liz's party. Unbeknownst to Kenneth, Tracy's dog has followed him to the bachelorette party. Kenneth bursts in Liz's home with Tracy's dog right behind him, resulting in the staff hiding from the dog after it attacks them.

500|$|It {{had also}} been some time since a Copland piece had been {{appreciated}} widely by audiences. His opera The Tender Land had not fared well, either in its original or revised forms. Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland's ballet Dance Panels, {{despite the fact that}} he had commissioned it. None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s—Connotations, Music for a Great City, Emblems and Inscape—made much of an impact with audiences. Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland's compositional output. [...] Copland was aware that dodecaphonism did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes, [...] "By the sixties, serialism had been around for over fifty years; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore." [...] Nonetheless, he did not want to be pigeonholed. He told American composer Walter Piston in 1963, [...] "People always want to shove me into the American idea more than I really want. <b>Nobody</b> <b>wants</b> to be an 'American' composer now as they did." [...] He told another friend, [...] "Young composers today wouldn't be caught dead with a folk tune!" [...] He heard a considerable amount of new music through his association with Tanglewood and might not have wanted to be left behind. At the same time, he might not have become totally at home with serialism. He confided to Verna Fine, [...] "I don't feel comfortable with the twelve-tone system, but I don't want to keep repeating myself." ...|$|E
500|$|In early {{planning}} stages of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith {{was to be}} one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. <b>Nobody</b> <b>wants</b> to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, the McNair and {{the band}} parted ways, with neither party giving a {{definitive}} rationale. Hopper explained [...] "We {{had a hard time}} recording Hot Boxing, because our drummer had {{a lot of things in}} the way... <b>Nobody</b> <b>wants</b> to hurt anyone, or to cut them out, but it was just like four adults getting a divorce, and their child is the band." [...] She has alternately explained that the split was due to the [...] "alternative lifestyles" [...] of McNair and the rest of the group and that McNair's musicianship was not as competent as the other members. The remaining trio recruited session drummer Josh Freese and engineers Sandy Solomon and Bernie Zwass to record a cover of Tom Waits' [...] "Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis" [...] at Plus Four Recordings Studios, in Sherman Oaks, California in June 1995 for the compilation album [...] Freese joined the group in November–December of that year in Los Angeles, California to record Rubbing Doesn't Help. Mould was unavailable, so the band relocated to Los Angeles and worked with producer Geza X at his home studio in attempt to make a more [...] "eclectic" [...] album that would represent the diversity of their songwriting. After hearing some demos, the band decided to hire him to produce the actual album and moved to Los Angeles for recording. The album produced the singles [...] "Open the Door" [...] and [...] "This Family" [...] (the former also had a music video), as well as the EP Fire All Your Guns at Once. The band immediately set out to tour in promotion.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the other}} effects ILM had to produce were the {{transporter}} beam and the warp speed effect. Mullen {{noted that the}} effects' look changed depending on who was directing the film; [...] "everyone wants something distinctive, but <b>nobody</b> <b>wants</b> to get {{far enough away from}} the TV series to startle the Trekkies." [...] The effect was produced by cutting out or rotomatting the individual to be transported, then making a vertical slot through which a high-intensity light was positioned. A computer-controlled move would cause the light to spread from the center and fade away, then reset its position and repeat the movement on the opposite side. Handmade acetate filters and gels were applied to give the transporter beam color and patterns, followed by small flickering animated highlights called [...] "bugs" [...] which appeared after the character had dematerialized. The Klingons' transporters were given a harsh red look to differentiate them from the smooth blue Federation effect. Whereas many of the multicolored rainbow warp trail shots from The Wrath of Khan were stock footage taken from the first film, the producers of the third film wanted something new. A streak effect, in which a beauty pass of the ship was combined with blurred passes for each light intensity, was tried first. The result was disappointing; as the Enterprise grew larger the streaks became distorted and out of place. Mullen rejected a straight animation of the warp drive as too bouncy, but the footage was cut in for editing while ILM went through six more approaches to the problem. The final effect, a [...] "vaporous, colorful trail", came together only weeks before the film's release.|$|E
