40|$|For {{conducting}} {{a comparison of}} Voyager photometric measurements of individual areas on the Jovian satellite Io to laboratory data, {{it is necessary to}} reduce the two sets of information to a comparable format. In this connection, more accurate <b>normal</b> <b>reflectance</b> spectra for regions on Io are derived by means of a two-step process. The near-opposition limb-darkening characteristics are obtained for areas on the surface of Io. The new limb-darkening results are employed to determine the near-opposition phase behavior of selected regions on the satellite, taking into account also the effects of the opposition surge. A combination of the phase and limb-darkening data makes it possible to obtain improved <b>normal</b> <b>reflectance</b> spectra for regions on Io. These spectra can be readily compared with laboratory spectra of candidate materials...|$|E

40|$|My goal in {{this work}} {{is to improve the}} {{performance}} of multilayer x-ray mirrors at wavelengths below 124 Å. My work includes three main tasks: identifying the materials to use, attempting epitaxy and studying interfaces by molecular beam epitaxy, and producing mirrors by sputtering. First, I identified material pairs which would likely form high-performance mirrors at wavelengths spanning 10 - 124 Å. Material pairs containing well behaved elements were considered in detail, while pairs containing compounds are also included. Attempts to grow epitaxial boron for use in superlattice mirrors were frustrated by the tendency of the boron to form a nearly amorphous structure even at the upper limit of substrate temperatures possible with our system. I studied the prospects for producing high performance mirrors from boron layered with silicon, palladium, and silver, by producing multilayers and performing XPS growth studies. Within our limits of detection, I saw no mixing or reactions at the silicon boron interface. Si/B multilayers, therefore, should produce narrow bandpass mirrors with reasonable reflectance while offering better long wavelength rejection than Mo/Si mirrors. Silver/boron mirrors have rough interfaces probably caused by the island growth mode of silver on boron. Without some way of reducing the interfacial roughness inherent in the system, silver/boron multilayers show little promise as x-ray mirrors. Palladium/boron mirrors should have a layered structure containing an alloy layer consisting of approximately 13 atomic percent boron and relatively sharp interfaces. Calculations indicate that multilayers containing boron layered with the alloy could produce high performance mirrors. Palladium/B₄C sputtered multilayers were deposited, and provided a near <b>normal</b> soft x-ray <b>reflectance</b> of 11. 5 % at 89 Å. Work continues on Si/B₄C multilayers. Sputtered Mo/Y multilayers achieved near <b>normal</b> <b>reflectances</b> of 19. 4 % at approximately 115 Å. The measured reflectance was reduced by oxygen contamination. Our collaborators have since been able to produce mirrors with near <b>normal</b> <b>reflectances</b> of 34 % at 115 Å and 22 % at 81 Å.

Images of the entire illuminated surface of Pluto and Charon obtained by the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) camera provide a global map of Pluto that reveals surface albedo variegations larger than any other Solar System world except for Saturn's moon Iapetus. <b>Normal</b> <b>reflectances</b> on Pluto range from 0. 08 - 1. 0, and the low-albedo areas of Pluto are darker than any region of Charon. Charon exhibits a much blander surface with <b>normal</b> <b>reflectances</b> ranging from 0. 20 - 0. 73. Pluto's albedo features are well-correlated with geologic features, although some exogenous low-albedo dust {{may be responsible for}} features seen {{to the west of the}} area informally named Tombaugh Regio. The albedo patterns of both Pluto and Charon are latitudinally organized, with the exception of Tombaugh Regio, with darker regions concentrated at the Pluto's equator and Charon's northern pole The phase curve of Pluto is similar to that of Triton, the large moon of Neptune believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), while Charon's is similar to that of the Moon.

Derived Minneart parameters, while generally consistent with previous limb darkening determinations, show that: (1) for the white regions, k rises linearly with increasing B(0), which is the trend to be expected for normal materials; (2) the white regions are slightly limb brightened (k 0. 5) at low wavelengths (low values of B(0)); and (3) k appears to drop with rising B(0) for the orange regions, contrary to the trend expected for most materials.

40|$|Viking Orbiter 1 close {{encounter}} {{pictures of}} Phobos reveal unusual dark patches {{on the floors}} of many craters. Photometry of these features indicates {{that they have a}} similar <b>normal</b> <b>reflectance</b> but a phase coefficient 30 % larger than the average surface. These facts suggest that the 'dark' material has a similar composition but a much rougher texture than the average surface of Phobos. By analogy with terrestrial impact, explosion and laboratory craters, the dark patches are interpreted as impact generated melt pools which remain visible on Phobos due to the low value of g and consequent small amount of fallback ejecta and slumping. Since blanketing by ejecta from subsequent impacts and micrometeoroid erosion should eventually obliterate such features, they should be more conspicuous in the fresher craters. Similar features should be visible on small asteroids and other low g bodies. However, they are not prominent on the surface of Deimos - possibly because most of the craters imaged at high resolution on the outer satellite appear to have been blanketed by several meters of fine-grained material...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{considers}} {{the problem of}} estimating the thickness and the optical constants (extinction coefficient and refractive index) of thin films from the spectrum of <b>normal</b> <b>reflectance</b> R.

The idea behind the choice of this particular spectral range is to compare the film characteristics retrieved from transmittance T and from reflectance data. In {{the first part of the}} paper a compact formula for R is deduced. The approach to deconvolute the R data is to use well-known information on the dependence of the optical constants on photon energy of semiconductors and dielectrics and to formulate the estimation as a nonlinear optimization problem. Previous publications of the group on the subject provide the guidelines for designing the new procedures. The consistency of the approach is tested with computer-generated thin films and also with measured R and T spectral data of an a-Si:H film deposited onto glass. The algorithms can handle satisfactorily the problem of a poor photometric accuracy in reflectance data, as well as a partial linearity of the detector response. The results on gedanken films and on a-Si:H indicate a very good agreement between expected and retrieved values. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
