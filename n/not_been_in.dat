The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts {{a struggle for}} resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934tonnes.|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters.

5|$|By 1100, {{there were}} several Crusader states, {{including}} the Principality of Antioch, founded by Bohemond in 1098. It was argued that Antioch {{should be returned to}} the Byzantines, despite Alexios's supposed betrayals, but Bohemond claimed it for himself. Alexios, of course, disagreed; Antioch had an important port, was a trade hub with Asia and a stronghold of the Eastern Orthodox Church, with an important Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. It had only been captured from the empire a few decades previously, unlike Jerusalem, which was much farther away and had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Byzantine hands for centuries. Alexios therefore did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, believing it should be returned to the Empire according to the oaths Bohemond had sworn in 1097. He therefore set about trying to evict Bohemond from Antioch.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{was still}} working at the coke works in Selby when his ban was imposed, but by Christmas 1920 the company was sold up and he was laid off. Soon after, however, he was {{approached}} by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, {{who had been a}} former team-mate of Herbert Chapman's brother Harry at The Wednesday. Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had been working at the factory in Barnbow during the war, he had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were paid. The ban was overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley's assistant on 1 February 1921.|$|E

The New York State Militia and some federal troops were returned to New York, including the 152nd New York Volunteers, the 26th Michigan Volunteers, the 27th Indiana Volunteers and the 7th Regiment New York State Militia from Frederick, Maryland, after a forced march. In addition, the governor sent in the 74th and 65th regiments of the New York State Militia, which had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> federal service, and {{a section of the}} 20th Independent Battery, New York Volunteer Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throgs Neck. The New York State Militia units were the first to arrive. By July 16, there were several thousand Federal troops in the city.|$|E

His mother then took him to The Bronx to live with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi, who, coincidentally, had come from a town in Sicily named Corleone. His father, who was from San Fratello of Sicily, moved to Covina, California to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur, and had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> his life since then.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} people of Scots descent who sought {{adventure}} and success at that time, Tod joined the British East India Company and initially spent some time studying at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He left England for India in 1799 {{and in doing so}} followed in the footsteps of various other members of his family, including his father, although Tod senior had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Company but had instead owned an indigo plantation at Mirzapur. The young Tod journeyed as a cadet in the Bengal Army, appointment to which position was at the time reliant upon patronage. He was appointed lieutenant in May 1800 and in 1805 was able to arrange his posting {{as a member of the}} escort to a family friend who had been appointed as Envoy and Resident to a Sindian royal court. By 1813 he had achieved promotion to the rank of captain and was commanding the escort.|$|E

5|$|DiMaggio {{returned}} from injury on June 28 after missing 65 games. He hit four {{home runs in}} three games to help sweep Boston and extend the Yankees' league lead. Despite DiMaggio's return, the lineup remained plagued with injuries. After consulting with Stengel, Weiss obtained Johnny Mize from the Giants, but he was soon sidelined with a separated shoulder. Twelve games behind on the Fourth of July, the Red Sox steadily gained ground on the Yankees, and tied them by sweeping a two-game set at Fenway September 24 and 25, {{the first time the}} Yankees had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> sole possession of first place since the third game of the season. The Red Sox took the lead the following day with a comeback win in a makeup game, as Stengel lost his temper at the umpire {{for the first time in}} Yankee uniform; although he was not ejected, he was fined by the league.|$|E
5|$|First, {{the waves}} of Norse {{colonisation}} of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. However the centre of norsified English {{seems to have been}} in the Midlands around Lindsey, and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> intense contact with Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).|$|E
5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 steerage passengers. On board Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E

5|$|Miler {{started his}} {{campaign}} for Test selection when the servicemen arrived in Perth and played their first match against Western Australia. Miller put in his best batting performance {{of the season with}} an 80 in a drawn match, before being rested in the match against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, which again ended in a draw. Miller finally returned to his home town on 2 January 1946 and was reunited with family and friends before taking on Victoria. Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59 as the military men fell to an innings defeat, troubled by the off spin of Ian Johnson. Miller and the servicemen had another difficult time against New South Wales, as their opponents made 7/551 and Miller went wicketless. Miller faced his biggest challenge in Australian conditions in his quest for Test selection when he went out to bat. The Australian selectors had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> England for the Victory Tests to witness his ability and Miller had not played to his potential on Australian soil. Local Australian opinion was that because the Services had played poorly in Australia, their achievements in England must have been against poor opposition.|$|E
5|$|The two {{escape the}} {{warehouse}} and retrieve the Mayan stone from Lobineau. Afterwards, {{they go to}} Quaramonte City in hopes of finding Condor Transglobal. They find the city under dictatorial rule by 'Madame La Presidente' Grasiento, and learn that the town contains no Condor Transglobal offices. The two meet Professor Oubier, who is talking to the chief of police, Raoul 'The General' Grasiento, about a mysterious chart. George confronts Oubier about his girlfriend's abduction, but the professor claims he knows nothing, {{and that he has}} <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Paris recently. George decides to help a CIA agent, Duane, free a local agitator, Miguel, from jail by distracting General Grasiento. Afterwards, he prepares to detonate the jail wall but is arrested in the process. George gets Duane to tie a rope to the bars and pull the wall down with his truck, alerting General Grasiento. Miguel escapes, and Nico and George flee down river on a boat. However, the boat sinks after being attacked by a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene was}} the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45meter tank, 4.5meters deep, containing 548,000gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would {{be able to use the}} tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the water since. She suggested using a body double, but knew that it would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.|$|E
