40|$|Abstract [...] Samples of <b>nacrite,</b> dickite, kaolinite, and {{halloysite}} {{were investigated}} using X-band {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) and Mbssbauer spectroscopy. Fe 3 + gave rise to EPR signals at g = 4 which differed with the individual polytype. Only <b>nacrite</b> had no resonance in this region of the spectrum, but it had one at g ~ 2. Dickite had a quadruple line, kaolinite a triple line, and halloysite a single line in this region. The EPR spectra of these minerals are apparently dependent also on the orientation of adjacent layers in the structures. Other resonances were attributed to (1) clusters of ferric ions giving rise to broad resonance near g = 2, (2) trapped holes, and (3) free radicals linked with organic matter. The Mbssbauer spectroscopic results suggest that iron occurs in the ferric state (except in <b>nacrite</b> where Fe 2 + is present also) as an ionic substitution (IS) in octahedral layers. This suggestion follows from the difference is the IS values between octahedral and tetrahedral symmetry sites occupied by Fe a+ equal to- 0. 4 mm/sec.

40|$|Intercalation and deintercalation {{of neutral}} organic {{molecules}} in the interlayer space of phyllosilicates represent an important {{interest in the}} development of new materials with desirable properties (catalysts, sorbents, [...] .) or in environmental protection and rehabilitation (waste deposits, polluted soils, [...] .). To analyse these mechanisms several approaches are usually profitable. The small dimensions and the high dipolar momentum value of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) give it a high ability to be intercalated in 1 : 1 phyllosilicates and initialize the intercalation of other larger organic molecules. The aim of this work is to show the interest of FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) to characterise the deintercalation process of the DMSO-nacrite complex. The DMSO-nacrite complex was prepared by heating <b>nacrite</b> in a 92 / 8 wt % DMSO/H 2 O solution at 60 °C. In order to localize the interaction between DMSO molecule and the clay mineral, infrared absorption spectroscopy has been performed. Spectra of pure <b>nacrite,</b> freshly prepared DMSO-nacrite complex, and thermally-treated complex were recorded. The presence in the freshly prepared complex of OH bands at about 3400 cm- 1, 3500 cm- 1 et 3580 cm- 1 is characteristic of the interaction between DMSO and <b>nacrite.</b> These results allow to conclude that organic molecules are fixed by H-bonding between a DMSO oxygen and a <b>nacrite</b> surface hydrogen. These bands disappear after heating at 360 °C. The intercalated sample has been studied by high-temperature X-ray diffraction to follow the deintercalation. Samples have been heated from room temperature to 360 °C, with a heating rate of 100 °C/hour. The XRD patterns showed that (i) the deintercalation occurs at 120 °C, (ii) the reticular distances (001) and (002) are not in the expected 2 / 1 ratio, (iii) from T = 200 °C a strong and sharp reflection near 25 ° (in 2 Θ Cu KΑ) and a broad one around 12 ° appear. In this range, the peak intensities are temperature dependent. This analysis indicates the presence of non-homogenous phases during the structural transformations. To quantify the structural evolution upon heating, a simulation method has been used. The model is based on the comparison between experimental and calculated XRD patterns. The model is obtained with a weighted sum of different contributions. Each contribution corresponds to a random interstratified phase formed with the two end-member phases (the intercalated complex and the deintercalated <b>nacrite)</b> in variable proportion. For example, a fair agreement between experimental and calculated intensities is obtained at 300 °C with the parameters given in the table.

In the dioctahedral minerals, the octahedral sites are occupied by aluminium, while in the trioctahedral minerals, these sites are occupied by magnesium and iron. Kaolinite and halloysite are single-layer structures. Kaolinite, dickite and <b>nacrite</b> occur as plates; halloysite, which can have a single layer of water between its sheets, occurs in a tubular form.

The existence at moderate pressure of two new translations -a/ 3 and (a + b) / 3, not possible at zero or low pressure, leading to five-fold coordination for Si was correctly predicted. Two newly and independently observed kaolinite polytypes (kaolinite II and III) were also correctly predicted. The existence of a still unobserved (SU) kaolinite IV phase is predicted at a pressure not higher than 60 GPa. Finally, transformations of dickite II into SU dickite III and <b>nacrite</b> into SU <b>nacrite</b> II are predicted to occur around 10 GPa. Optimized crystal structures predicted by ab initio modeling for the most likely low enthalpy polytypes are printed, which should simplify their identification when they will be observed, as they did for kaolinite II and III. Concepts developed here for kaolin minerals are generally applicable to hydrogen-bonded phyllosilicate polytypes or other hydrogen-bonded layered systems. This series of papers then implements {{a new way of}} expanding knowledge about experimentally difficult systems: inexpensive and relatively fast quantum computations can bring support to experimental results when conflicting reports exist in the literature, as well as produce predictions that are easily falsifiable experimentally, thus pointing to fruitful directions for new experiments. This loop of quantum computation followed by critical experiments results in faster and cheaper scientific progress as seen here on the kaolin system. 9 2011 E.

40|$|URL] T aliwang {{conservation}} forest, West Nusa Tenggara, {{is particularly}} covered by volcanic rocks consisting of alternated breccia and tuff. The breccia {{is composed of}} andesitic – dioritic clasts and matrix of fine-grained to lapilli tuff which had partially been hidrothermally altered and invaded by gold bearing quartz veins. Outc r op s of quartz veins are commonly limonitized, trending nearly east-west and north-south with respectively dip of 70 o and 85 o. Identification of quartz veins originated from people mining’s waste leads to a prediction that there are quartz stockworks beneath the earth surface (50 – 100 m depth) in the conservation forest area, from which quartz veins penetrated the illite-paragonite-calcite-siderite- <b>nacrite</b> altered country rock. Textures of quartz veins were identified such as comb with some coarse- grained euhedral crystals, sugary/saccharoidal/fine grained crystalline quartz and ghost-bladed. Veins and host rocks generally contain disseminated and spotted pyrites. Evaluation of quartz textures, altered rocks analysis (PIMA method), fluid inclusion studies and chemical analysis (AAS method) of selective altered rocks/quartz vein samples exhibits that the alteration and mineralization processes might occur in an epithermal system, connecting with a change of hydrothermal fluids from near neutral into acid conditions at a temperature ranging from 231 to 185 o C. Alteration of illite-paragonite-kalsit-siderite is suggested {{as a result of}} reaction between host rock and a near neutral fluid, whilst <b>nacrite</b> (kaolin group) or argillic is a result of reaction between host rock and an acid fluid, within a mixing zone of meteoric fluid and condensed acid gas released during boiling process of hydrothermal fluid in the depth. On the basis of salinity ranging from 0. 9 to 2. 2 equivalent wt. % NaCl of fluid inclusion, it is predicted that the deposition of gold bearing quartz and associated ore minerals takes place in a depth ranging from 293 to 120 m beneath paleosurface.  </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{infrared}} absorption method {{has been used}} to identify the minerals in dust collected from some parts of Coimbatore, Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu without grinding. The KBr pellet technique was employed. The results obtained from the IR spectra show the presence of quartz, asbestos, kaolinite, calcite, haematite, montmorllonite, <b>nacrite</b> and coal. The hazardous effect of inhalation of these minerals are explained. The results show Pollachi main road is more contaminated with hazardous minerals.
