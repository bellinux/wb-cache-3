5|$|After <b>nearly</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> as a major, Berryman was {{promoted}} to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1935. Promotion to substantive rank, which carried the rank's pay as well as status, occurred on 1 July 1938, when he became Assistant Director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters. From December 1938 to April 1940 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the 3rd Division. The slow rate of promotion of regular officers in the inter-war years fostered a sense of injustice and frustration among officers with good war records who found themselves outranked by Militia officers who had enjoyed faster promotion.|$|E

5|$|Charles Edward Evans {{purchased}} Nailsea Court in 1906. He {{then started}} a restoration programme which took seven years. He employed Arthur James Stratton, {{an expert on}} Tudor architecture to reconstruct the west wing. The restoration included the use of materials from Over Langford Manor. The panelling was installed in his new withdrawing room. Consequently this room was called the Langford Parlour but {{is now known as}} the Langford Room. The Latch porch from Langford was at Nailsea Court for <b>nearly</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years,</b> before being returned by Charles Evans to Upper Langford in 1923. The rebuilding included the erection of a tower. The first version looked similar to a lighthouse and was changed to one of Tudor appearance which was incorporated into the south wing. During World War I, in an effort to conserve coal, brick insets were built into the fireplaces to reduce their size.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{writes that}} McKinley's low rating is undeserved, {{and that he}} should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at {{building}} an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under Coolidge. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained <b>nearly</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years,</b> and William Howard Taft, whom McKinley had made Governor-General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.|$|E

5|$|Bulgarian {{resistance}} revived {{under the}} rule of the Cometopuli dynasty, but the new emperor Basil II (r. 976â€“1025) made the submission of the Bulgarians his primary goal. Basil's first expedition against Bulgaria, however, resulted in a humiliating defeat at the Gates of Trajan. For the next few years, the emperor would be preoccupied with internal revolts in Anatolia, while the Bulgarians expanded their realm in the Balkans. The war dragged on for <b>nearly</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years.</b> The Byzantine victories of Spercheios and Skopje decisively weakened the Bulgarian army, and in annual campaigns, Basil methodically reduced the Bulgarian strongholds. At the Battle of Kleidion in 1014 the Bulgarians were annihilated: their army was captured, and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men were blinded, with the hundredth man left with one eye so he could lead his compatriots home. When Tsar Samuil saw the broken remains of his once formidable army, he died of shock. By 1018, the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered, and the country became part of the Empire. This victory restored the Danube frontier, which had not been held {{since the days of the}} emperor Heraclius.|$|E
5|$|Hamidiye was {{a unique}} ironclad warship built for the Ottoman Navy in the 1870s, the last vessel of the type {{completed}} for the Ottomans. She was a central battery ship, mounting most of her armament in a central casemate. The ship, built by the Ottoman Imperial Arsenal took <b>nearly</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> to complete; she was laid down in December 1874, launched in 1885, and completed in 1894. Due to her lengthy construction period, she was already obsolete {{by the time she}} was launched. Her poor handling and low quality armor contributed to a short career, spent almost entirely as a stationary training ship. She was briefly activated in 1897 during the Greco-Turkish War, but she was already in bad condition just three years after she entered service, as was the rest of the ancient Ottoman fleet. The Ottomans embarked on a reconstruction program after the incident humiliated the government, but Hamidiye was in too poor a state by 1903 to warrant rebuilding, and she was accordingly decommissioned that year, placed for sale in 1909, and sold to ship breakers in 1913.|$|E
40|$|For {{several years}} the Pambamarca Archaeology Project has been {{investigating}} a dynamic frontier in the northern Ecuadorian highlands {{at the edge of}} the PaÃ­s Caranqui: a confederation of small-scale, autonomous, inter-warring pre-Inkan polities whose <b>nearly</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>year</b> resistance to Inka conquest resulted in the largest concentration of military fortresses in the Inka Empire. In addition to its violent past, Pambamarca is located within 25 km of high quality obsidian sources, making it an important region for understanding obsidian production when it is part of local, non-elite exchange. This study analyzes obsidian, non-obsidian flaked lithics, and ceramics to elucidate patterns of obsidian production and site function at five of the Pambamarca sites ranging chronologically from the Early Integration period to the early Colonial Period. Directions for future research which would better clarify these patterns are also proposed...|$|R

5|$|In 1905, {{three years}} after the Apperson {{brothers}} split from Haynes, Haynes-Apperson was renamed the Haynes Automobile Company and Haynes launched a series of publicity campaigns. A parade of 2,000 cars was organized in New York City during 1908 and Haynes, whom many recognized as the inventor of the American automobile, led the parade down Broadway riding in the Pioneer. He was followed by ten Haynes cars, a model from each year to display the advancement in technology. On his way to the parade, Haynes was unaware of the city's newly established speeding laws and was arrested for driving too fastin a car with a top speed of 15mph (17km/h)and taken to jail. He was soon able to see a magistrate who released him after learning that he was Elwood Haynes and had come to lead the parade. The celebration was intended to be a ten-year commemoration of the invention of the automobile, although earlier self-vehicles dated back <b>nearly</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> in Europe. Haynes donated the Pioneer to the United States Government in 1910 to be placed in the Smithsonian Institution where it is still on display in the National Museum of American History as the second oldest motorized vehicle in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's {{rule was}} not universally popular; {{early in his}} reign he nearly lost his throne during the Nika riots, and a {{conspiracy}} against the emperor's life by dissatisfied businessmen was discovered as late as 562. Justinian {{was struck by the}} plague in the early 540s but recovered. Theodora died in 548 at a relatively young age, possibly of cancer; Justinian outlived her by <b>nearly</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years.</b> Justinian, who had always had a keen interest in theological matters and actively participated in debates on Christian doctrine, became even more devoted to religion during the later years of his life. When he died on 14 November 565, he left no children, though his wife Theodora had given birth to a stillborn son several years into his reign. He was succeeded by Justin II, who was the son of his sister Vigilantia and married to Sophia, the niece of Empress Theodora. Justinian's body was entombed in a specially built mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles until it was desecrated and robbed during the pillage of the city in 1204 by the Latin States of the Fourth Crusade.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{is known}} for {{borrowing}} plots and characters from other stories, but the source of A Midsummer Night's Dream has proved difficult to trace. There is no clear parallel to its plot {{in the literature of}} his time. However, many of its characters' names and relationships are borrowed from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Philostrate is no exception. His name is the pseudonym adopted by Arcite upon covertly returning to Athens in The Knight's Tale to work for Theseus. (A Knight's Tale was dramatised <b>nearly</b> <b>twenty</b> <b>years</b> later by Shakespeare and Fletcher as The Two Noble Kinsmen.) Chaucer himself took the name Philostrate from Boccaccio's poem Il Filostrato, a story about Troilus and Criseyde. Because Chaucer's Arcite adopts this identity to become a servant at Theseus' court, {{it is possible that the}} Midsummer Night's Dream character is meant to be the same person in a continuation of the story. However, the two characters have little else in common. Another candidate for the source of Philostrate's character is Philostratus the Elder, the author of Comus, a play which has similarities to Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
