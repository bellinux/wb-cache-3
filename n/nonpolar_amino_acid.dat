40|$|AbstractThe {{packaging}} motor of bacteriophage T 4 translocates DNA {{into the}} capsid {{at a rate}} of up to 2000 bp/s. Such a high rate would require coordination of motor movements at millisecond timescale. Designing a cysteine-less gp 17 is essential to generate fluorescently labeled motors and measure distance changes between motor domains by FRET analyses. Here, by using sequence alignments, structural modeling, combinatorial mutagenesis, and recombinational rescue, we replaced all nine cysteines of gp 17 and introduced single cysteines at defined positions. These mutant motors retained in vitro DNA packaging activity. Single mutant motors translocated DNA molecules in real time as imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We discovered, unexpectedly, that a hydrophobic or <b>nonpolar</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> next to Walker B motif is essential for motor function, probably for efficient generation of OH− nucleophile.

In this study, crystal structures of both native and PLP-complex forms of this racemase are presented at 2. 6 and 2. 15 Å resolution, respectively. Both structures show that the protein belongs to the fold-type I subgroup of PLP-dependent enzymes and is very close to aminobutyrate aminotransferases family, as it has been suspected because of their sequence homology. The extensive structural comparison with fold-type I enzymes with known amino acid racemization activities, including the α-amino-ε-caprolactam racemase from Achromobacter obae and the cystathionine β-lyase from Escherichia coli, allows us to identify the active site residues responsible for its <b>nonpolar</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> recognition and reactivity specificity. Our observations also suggest that the racemization reaction by the fold-type I racemases may generally occur thanks to a revised two-base mechanism.

However, these were based on the analysis of only a few simple cases, with no direct mean to correlate binary patterns with the limits of RSS. Here, HCA-derived hydrophobic clusters (HC) which are conditioned binary patterns whose positions fit well those of RSS, were considered. All the HC types, defined by unique binary patterns, which were commonly observed in three-dimensional (3 D) structures of globular domains, were analyzed. The 180 HC types with preferences for either α-helices or β-strands distinctly contain basic binary units typical of these RSS. Therefore a general trend supporting the “binary pattern preference” assumption was observed. HC for which observed RSS are in disagreement with their expected behavior (discordant HC) were also examined. They were separated in HC types with moderate preferences for RSS, having “weak” binary patterns and versatile RSS and HC types with high preferences for RSS, having “strong” binary patterns and then displaying <b>nonpolar</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> at the protein surface. It was shown that in both cases, discordant HC could be distinguished from concordant ones by well-differentiated <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> compositions.

Studies of substrate specificity revealed that skin constituents, such as the stratum corneum, and appendages such as nail but not hair, feather, and wool were efficiently hydrolyzed by the P. marquandii keratinase and about 40 % less by the D. microsporus keratinase.

We find that UGG or GGG, at either position + 4 or + 5, without a following stop codon, is associated with an erythromycin resistance phenotype upon gene induction. Our results suggest that, while a stop codon at + 4 gives a tripeptide product (MIL) and erythromycin sensitivity, UGG or GGG codons at the same position give a tetrapeptide product (MILW or MILG) and phenotype of erythromycin resistance. Thus, the drop-off event on GGG or UGG codons occurs after incorporation of the corresponding amino acid into the growing peptide chain. Drop-off gives rise to a peptidyl-tRNA where the peptide moiety functionally mimics a minigene peptide product of the type previously associated with erythromycin resistance. Several genes in Escherichia coli fulfill the requirements of high mRNA expression and an E-peptide sequence followed by UGG or GGG at position + 4 or + 5 and should potentially be able to give an erythromycin resistance phenotype...|$|E

Hydration drives various biological processes, including protein folding, ligand binding, macromolecular assembly, enzyme kinetics, and signal transduction. The changes in hydration and packing, both when proteins fold correctly or when folding goes wrong, leading to PFDs, are examined through several biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches. Although in many cases the binding of a ligand such as a nucleic acid helps to prevent misfolding and aggregation, there are several examples in which ligands induce misfolding and assembly into amyloids.

Here, we describe the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme from Escherichia coli determined and refined to 2. 0 Å resolution. Protein employed {{for this study was}} that of a site-directed mutant protein, Cys 1 Ala. Large crystals were grown in the presence of both glutamine and AMP. Each subunit of the dimeric protein folds into two distinct domains. The N-terminal region contains two layers of antiparallel â-sheet with each layer containing six strands. Wedged between these layers of sheet is the active site responsible for the hydrolysis of glutamine. Key side chains employed for positioning the glutamine substrate within the binding pocket include Arg 49, Asn 74, Glu 76, and Asp 98. The C-terminal domain, responsible for the binding of both Mg 2 +ATP and aspartate, is dominated by a five-stranded parallel â-sheet flanked on either side by R-helices. The AMP moiety is anchored to the protein via hydrogen bonds with Oç of Ser 346 and the backbone carbonyl and amide groups of Val 272, Leu 232, and Gly 347.

Resistance to vancomycin, the principal drug {{used to treat}} MRSA infections, has only recently emerged, is mainly low level, and characteristically appears during vancomycin therapy (vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA] and hetero-resistant VISA). This phenomenon suggests the adaptation of MRSA through mutation, although defining the mutations leading to resistance in clinical isolates has been difficult. We studied a vancomycin-susceptible clinical MRSA isolate (MIC of 1 μg/ml) and compared it with an isogenic blood culture isolate from the same patient, despite 42 days of vancomycin treatment (MIC of 4 μg/ml). A whole-genome sequencing approach allowed the nearly complete assembly of the genome sequences of the two isolates and revealed only six nucleotide substitutions in the VISA strain compared with the parent strain.

The results are shown to be in agreement with recent experimental results. 1 INTRODUCTION Prediction of three-dimensional structure of proteins, which determine their biological functions, solely from their <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence remains one of the unsolved problems in bioscience (for a recent review, see, for example, Ref. [1]). The difficulty with the conventional methods such as molecular dynamics {{lies in the fact that}} simulations strongly depend on the initial conditions and cannot reach thermal equilibrium within the presently available computer resources. To alleviate the above difficulty we recently proposed the application of the multicanonic [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Stachybotrys chartarum is a toxigenic fungus {{that has}} been {{associated}} with human health concerns, including pulmonary hemorrhage and hemosiderosis. This fungus produces a hemolysin, stachylysin, which in its apparent monomeric form has a molecular mass of 11, 920 Da as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry. However, it appears to form polydispersed aggregates, which confounds understanding of the actual hemolytically active form. Exhaustive dialysis or heat treatment at 60 °C for 30 min inactivated stachylysin. Stachylysin is composed of about 40 % <b>nonpolar</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and contains two cysteine residues. Purified stachylysin required more than 6 h to begin lysing sheep erythrocytes, but by 48 h, lysis was complete. Stachylysin also formed pores in sheep erythrocyte membranes...|$|R
40|$|An Escherichia coli {{genomic library}} was {{constructed}} {{in order to facilitate}} selection for genes which confer bacitracin resistance through amplification. One of the plasmids from the library, plasmid pXV 62, provided a high level of bacitracin resistance for E. coli. Deletion and nucleotide sequence analyses of bacitracin resistance plasmid pXV 62 revealed that a single open reading frame, designated the bacA gene, was sufficient for antibiotic resistance. The bacA gene mapped to approximately 67 min on the E. coli chromosome by proximity to a previously mapped locus. The deduced <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> sequence of the bacA-encoded protein suggests an extremely hydrophobic protein of 151 <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> approximately 65 % of which were <b>nonpolar</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> E. coli cells containing plasmid pXV 62 have increased isoprenol kinase activity. The physical characteristics of the deduced protein and enhanced lipid kinase activity suggest that the bacA gene may confer resistance to bacitracin by phosphorylation of undecaprenol...|$|R
