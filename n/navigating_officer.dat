5|$|During {{the initial}} {{stage of the}} voyage to Antarctica from Buenos Aires, he was kept busy {{with a number of}} routine tasks. He worked on the pram dinghy Nancy Endurance; made a small chest of drawers for Shackleton; {{specimen}} shelves for the biologist, Robert Clark; instrument cases for Leonard Hussey, the meteorologist; and put up wind screens to protect the helmsman. He constructed a false deck, extending from the poop-deck to the chart-room to cover the extra coal that the ship had taken on board. He also acted as the ship's barber. As the ship pushed into the pack ice in the Weddell Sea it became increasingly difficult to navigate. McNish constructed a six-foot wooden semaphore on the bridge to enable the <b>navigating</b> <b>officer</b> to give the helmsman directions, and built a small stage over the stern to allow the propeller to be watched in order to keep it clear of the heavy ice.|$|E

A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as Prince of Wales manoeuvred through {{the wreckage of}} Hood. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck the starboard side of the compass platform and killed {{the majority of the}} personnel there.

5000|$|The large {{superstructure}} {{which was}} octagonal in plan, {{was known to}} its crew as the [...] "Octopoidal" [...] and was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Queen Anne's Mansions" [...] due to its similarity to a 14-storey brick residential development opposite St. James's Park tube station in London.

This innovative bridge design was subsequently copied by the French in the Dunkerque-class battleships, as was the all-forward main armament orientation, both features which were repeated in the Richelieu-class designs. Except for the emergency conning tower at its base, and the trunking for the main gun directors mounted on top, the superstructure was lightly armoured against splinters only, to save weight. Additional weight-saving design measures included the use of light materials such as aluminium for fittings, and fir instead of teak for deck planking, although subsequently, teak decks were fitted in the late 1920s, following concerns that the ships could not fire a full broadside without causing structural damage to the decks.|$|R

The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea contains the rules which deal with traffic situations at sea, but despite the regulations collisions occur. The study has focused on two questions: What situations are perceived as the most difficult by the <b>navigating</b> <b>officers?</b> How are these situations solved by the navigation officers? The study has been carried out by using in-depth interviews with five Swedish watchkeeping officers. The officers have been asked about which factors make a traffic situation difficult and has described how they perceive specific difficult situations. To interpret the results, the study has a background chapter which complements the interviews. The circumstances the officers’ addresses which make a situation difficult are factors they cannot influence. It can be space limitations, the number of vessels in the area or vessels which do not follow the rules. The specific situations contain {{one or more of these}} factors and the officers describe how they solved the situations in the interviews. Several of the specific situations are within a traffic separation scheme were the space is limited.

All the aircrews of the squadron concerned volunteered for the operation, and, after five crews had been selected by drawing lots, the attack was delivered at low altitude against this vital target. Orders were issued that this bridge was to be destroyed at all costs. As had been expected, exceptionally intense machine-gun and anti-aircraft fire were encountered. Moreover, the bridge area was heavily protected by enemy fighters. In spite of this, the formation successfully delivered a dive-bombing attack from the lowest practicable altitude. British fighters in the vicinity reported that the target was obscured by the bombs bursting on it and near it. Only {{one of the five}} aircraft concerned returned from this mission. The pilot of this aircraft reports that besides being subjected to extremely heavy anti-aircraft fire, through which they dived to attack the objective, our aircraft were also attacked by a large number of enemy fighters after they had released their bombs on the target. Much of the success of this vital operation must be attributed to the formation leader, Flying Officer Garland, and to the coolness and resource of Sergeant Gray, who in most difficult conditions <b>navigated</b> Flying <b>Officer</b> Garland's aircraft in such a manner that the whole formation was able successfully to attack the target in spite of subsequent heavy losses.

Later, the squadron conducted small arms practice at Yorktown, Virginia, after arriving at Hampton Roads.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} place of the college and university business officer in institutions of higher education across the U. S. South. In 1927, George Howell Mew, newly minted business officer at Emory University, was {{the driving force behind the}} creation of the Southern Association of College and University Business Officers [SACUBO]. Over the next fifty years members of SACUBO succeeded in creating an institution which transformed the business officer from a functionary who reported bookkeeping numbers to the board of trustees into an administrator and vice-president of the university. In the process, business officers helped transformed the college and university from an individual institution working with hundreds of students into campuses enrolling tens of thousands students and managing billions of dollars. A number of forces pushed college and university business officers into a position of responding to external pressures: philanthropy in the 1920 s, research grants in the 1930 s and 1940 s, the need to train military personnel for wars from World War I into the 1980 s and the accompanying regulations, the alliance of research universities with industry, and social pressures such as race relations and student protests.

40|$|In {{order to}} respond to the concern about the {{relevance}} of auditor reporting when a firm is financially distressed, we examine whether the perceived quality of the signing audit firm (i. e. Big 4 or non-Big 4 auditor) and going-concern modification affects professional loan officers’ information search behavior. Rather than focusing on the final loan granting decision, it is of interest to examine how loan <b>officers</b> <b>navigate</b> through and integrate the information presented in the related audited financial statements and annual report. Using eye-tracking technology, we are able to thoroughly scrutinize information search of professional loan officers. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} not only does the going-concern modification affect lenders’ information search behavior, but also the credibility of the audit report source. Specifically, the results of the first analysis indicate that the presence of going-concern modification significantly increases the attention to the audit report, and especially when it is signed by a Big 4 auditor. Moreover, the information most explicitly mentioned in the going-concern paragraph is accessed quickly, indicating an attention directing effect of going-concern paragraph, and this effect is the most evident when the audit report is signed by a Big 4 auditor. Finally, the analyses of this study provide evidence on extensive versus superficial information search, which depends on the source credibility in addition to the presence of the going-concern modification. Information search appears to be most extensive when the lender has read a “clean” report signed by a non-Big 4 auditor, suggesting that lenders try to gather more information about the seriousness of the financial problems when the perceived quality of the signing audit firm is perceived low and they do not have the guidance from auditor’s going-concern modification. On the contrary, lenders search information more superficially after reading an audit report with going-concern modification signed by a Big 4 audit firm, implying that the credibility of the source together with the information provided in the going-concern modification are considered higher. However, differences in extensive and superficial information search appear only in the beginning of the search pattern. The effect of audit report content and the signing audit firm on information search is diluting during the search and participants' overall search patterns are converging...|$|R
