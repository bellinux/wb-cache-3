25|$|In 1972 NBC {{imposed a}} {{standard}} poppy red colour with white relief, but from 1979 Devon General buses {{started to be}} painted in leaf green and white, the same colours as the parent Western <b>National</b> <b>fleet.</b> Six months after the operation became independent of Western National in 1983 a red livery was again adopted. The first minibuses were painted in bright red and yellow colours with a black skirt.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of south}} west England is rural {{in nature and}} many narrow roads mean that Western National needed a large fleet of small buses. In 1969 the {{associated}} Southern <b>National</b> <b>fleet</b> was merged with Western National. The coach services of both companies were mostly operated under the Royal Blue brand. Neighbouring Devon General was also brought under Western National control in 1971, having just placed their first order for 6 LHs (88–93).|$|E
2500|$|From 1971 Devon General {{became part}} of Western National but {{services}} around Torbay continued {{to operate in the}} old name and buses were sometimes moved between the fleets for short term loans or on a more permanent basis. Two rare Bristol LDLs in the Western <b>National</b> <b>fleet</b> had their tops removed from 1972/3 for operation at Penzance and one of these was swapped in 1975 for Sir Francis Drake, and the other in 1977 for Admiral Blake. When the nine [...] "Warship" [...] VRTs were ordered for Devon General, two more were ordered for Western National. Both Atlanteans and VRTs also operated seasonal services at Weymouth. Western National's usual livery for open top buses was white and green, although Sir Francis Drake retained its red and white scheme.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fleet of}} 17 two-coach [...] Sprinter units was {{inherited}} from Wessex Trains {{as part of}} the Greater Western franchise shuffle. The fleet had been refurbished by Wessex Trains in 2003, with 2+2 seating arranged in a mixture of 'airline' (face to back) and table seating. The fleet is widespread throughout the former Wessex area, and carried a maroon livery with advertising vinyls for South West Tourism. Each unit was sponsored by a district, town or attraction and carried a unique livery. Most received names of attractions, places and branch lines. Two units were repainted into the new First 'Local' livery, but all units are now due to receive the new green GWR livery. As part of a <b>national</b> <b>fleet</b> shuffle, eight units went to Arriva Trains Wales on 10 December 2006, and were replaced with 8 Class 158 units.|$|E
6000|$|The waters around Fortress Monroe were thronged with a gallant {{array of}} ships {{of war and}} transports, wearing the Union flag,--"Old Glory," [...] as I hear it called in these days. A little {{withdrawn}} from our <b>national</b> <b>fleet</b> lay two French frigates, and, in another direction, an English sloop, under that banner which always makes itself visible, like a red portent in the air, wherever there is strife. In pursuance of our official duty (which had no ascertainable limits), we went on board the flag-ship, and were shown over every part of her, and down into her depths, inspecting her gallant crew, her powerful armament, her mighty engines, and her furnaces, where the fires are always kept burning, as well at midnight as at noon, {{so that it would}} require only five minutes to put the vessel under full steam. This vigilance has been felt necessary ever since the Merrimack made that terrible dash from Norfolk. Splendid as she is, however, and provided with all but the very latest improvements in naval armament, the Minnesota belongs to a class of vessels that will be built no more, nor ever fight another battle,--being as much {{a thing of the past}} as any of the ships of Queen Elizabeth's time, which grappled with the galleons of the Spanish Armada.|$|E
60|$|Philip, King of Spain, however, {{threatened}} to do greater things than ever {{had been done}} yet, {{to set up the}} Catholic religion and punish Protestant England. Elizabeth, hearing that he and the Prince of Parma were making great preparations for this purpose, in order to be beforehand with them sent out ADMIRAL DRAKE (a famous navigator, who had sailed about the world, and had already brought great plunder from Spain) to the port of Cadiz, where he burnt a hundred vessels full of stores. This great loss obliged the Spaniards to put off the invasion for a year; but it was none the less formidable for that, amounting to one hundred and thirty ships, nineteen thousand soldiers, eight thousand sailors, two thousand slaves, and between two and three thousand great guns. England was not idle in making ready to resist this great force. All the men between sixteen years old and sixty, were trained and drilled; the <b>national</b> <b>fleet</b> of ships (in number only thirty-four at first) was enlarged by public contributions and by private ships, fitted out by noblemen; the city of London, of its own accord, furnished double the number of ships and men that it was required to provide; and, if ever the national spirit was up in England, it was up all through the country to resist the Spaniards. Some of the Queen's advisers were for seizing the principal English Catholics, and putting them to death; but the Queen--who, to her honour, used to say, that she would never believe any ill of her subjects, which a parent would not believe of her own children--rejected the advice, and only confined a few of those who were the most suspected, in the fens in Lincolnshire. The great body of Catholics deserved this confidence; for they behaved most loyally, nobly, and bravely.|$|E
