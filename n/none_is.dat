5|$|The Delphinidae are {{characterized}} by having distinct beaks (unlike the Phocoenidae), two or more fused cervical vertebrae and 20 or more pairs of teeth in their upper jaws. <b>None</b> <b>is</b> more than 4m long.|$|E
5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable {{because it seems}} to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; {{because it seems to}} attribute the action of a conscious mind when <b>none</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E
5|$|All Assay Commission medals are {{extremely}} rare. Except for the 1977 medal, <b>none</b> <b>is</b> {{believed to have}} been issued in a quantity of greater than 200, and in most years fewer than 50 were struck. Additional copies of several 19th-century issues are known to have been illicitly struck; the Mint ended such practices in the early 20th century. The obverse of the 1909 issue, depicting Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, was reused as Cortelyou's entry in the Mint's series of medals honoring Secretaries of the Treasury. The later pieces were struck with a blank reverse, but in the early 1960s, the reverse design from the Assay Commission issue was used with the Cortelyou obverse, and an unknown number sold to the public. The restrikes are said to be less distinctly struck than the originals.|$|E

25|$|Because Hygrocybe species {{cannot be}} {{maintained}} in culture, <b>none</b> <b>is</b> cultivated commercially. Fruit bodies {{of a few}} species are considered edible in eastern Europe, south-east Asia, and Central America and are collected and consumed locally.|$|E
25|$|Since about 1990 several {{companies}} have {{claimed to be}} developing compressed air cars, but <b>none</b> <b>is</b> available. Typically the main claimed advantages are: no roadside pollution, low cost, use of cooking oil for lubrication, and integrated air conditioning.|$|E
25|$|A medium peach, {{weighing}} , contains {{small amounts}} of essential nutrients, but <b>none</b> <b>is</b> {{a significant proportion of}} the Daily Value (DV, right table). Nectarines have similar low content of nutrients. The glycemic load of an average peach (120 grams) is 5, similar to other low-sugar fruits.|$|E

"My dear boy," [...] {{said his}} uncle, the catechist, [...] "do not {{complain}} about your fetter, {{for it is}} the only thing that makes life worth living. <b>None</b> <b>are</b> happy, <b>none</b> <b>are</b> good, <b>none</b> <b>are</b> respectable, that are not gyved like us. And I must tell you, besides, it is very dangerous talk. If you grumble of your iron, you will have no luck; if ever you take it off, you will be instantly smitten by a thunderbolt." ...|$|R
25|$|The main {{critique}} of formalism {{is that the}} actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are {{far removed from the}} string manipulation games mentioned above. Formalism is thus silent on the question of which axiom systems ought to be studied, as <b>none</b> <b>is</b> more meaningful than another from a formalistic point of view.|$|E
25|$|While many {{medications}} treat Parkinson's, none actually {{reverses the}} effects of the disease or cures it. Furthermore, the gold-standard treatment varies with the disease state. People with Parkinson's, therefore, often must take a variety of medications to manage the disease's symptoms. Several medications currently in development seek to better address motor fluctuations and nonmotor symptoms of PD. However, <b>none</b> <b>is</b> yet on the market with specific approval to treat Parkinson's.|$|E
25|$|Houtman Abrolhos has an {{extremely}} high diversity of echinoderms, with 172 species having been recorded there. 63% {{of these are}} tropical species, 14% are temperate, and 22% are endemic to Western Australia. <b>None</b> <b>is</b> endemic to the Houtman Abrolhos. Published surveys have not included observations of the crown-of-thorns starfish (Ananthaster planci), but individuals have occasionally been observed there.

25|$|Intermittent urinary {{catheterization}} is used {{to relieve}} the bladder in people with urinary retention. Self-catheterization is an option in BPH when the bladder is difficult or impossible to completely empty. Urinary tract infection {{is the most common}} complication of intermittent catheterization. Several techniques and types of catheter are available, including sterile (single-use) and clean (multiple use) catheters, but <b>none</b> <b>is</b> superior to others in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infection based on current information.|$|E
25|$|POWs {{operated}} a system whereby {{newcomers to the}} camp were vetted, to prevent German agents from infiltrating their ranks. Any POW {{who could not be}} vouched for by two POWs who knew the prisoner by sight was severely interrogated and afterwards escorted continually by other prisoners, until such time as he was deemed to be a genuine Allied POW. Several infiltrators were discovered by this method and <b>none</b> <b>is</b> known to have escaped detection in Luft III.|$|E
25|$|Perique was {{developed}} in 1824 through the technique of pressure-fermentation of local tobacco by a farmer, Pierre Chenet. Considered the truffle of pipe tobaccos, it {{is used as a}} component in many blended pipe tobaccos, but is too strong to be smoked pure. At one time, the freshly moist Perique was also chewed, but <b>none</b> <b>is</b> now sold for this purpose. It is typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice, strength, and coolness to the blend.|$|E

25|$|Census {{figures in}} Ireland {{do not provide}} a {{breakdown}} of religions outside of the major Christian denominations and other major world religions. A total of 22,497 people stated Other Religion in the 2006 census; and a rough estimate {{is that there were}} 2,000–3,000 practicing pagans in Ireland in 2009. Numerous pagan groups – primarily Wiccan and Druidic – exist in Ireland though <b>none</b> <b>is</b> officially recognised by the Government. Irish Paganism is often strongly concerned with issues of place and language.|$|E
25|$|A new {{generation}} of IGCC-based coal-fired power plants has been proposed, although <b>none</b> <b>is</b> yet under construction. Projects are being developed by AEP, Duke Energy, and Southern Company in the US, and in Europe by ZAK/PKE, Centrica (UK), E.ON and RWE (both Germany) and NUON (Netherlands). In Minnesota, the state's Dept. of Commerce analysis found IGCC to have the highest cost, with an emissions profile not significantly better than pulverized coal. In Delaware, the Delmarva and state consultant analysis had essentially the same results.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} ways of defining terrorism {{and all are}} subjective. Most define terrorism as 'the use or threat of serious violence' to advance some kind of 'cause'. Some state clearly the kinds of group ('sub-national', 'non-state') or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with an act that involves innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. <b>None</b> <b>is</b> satisfactory and grave problems {{with the use of}} the term persist.|$|E
