The restorations {{were evaluated}} yearly for retention and marginal discoloration. After five years, the overall retention rate was 96 %.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} the envelope theorem for the geometric design of a cycloidal speed reducer. Specifically, it proposes two designs for a mathematical model with tooth differences: a pin wheel epitrochoid meshing- which is a cycloidal wheel (internal rotor) profile equidistant to an epitrochoid (or extended epicycloid) curve and a cycloida! wheel is generated by a pin wheel (external rotor) - and a pin wheel hypotrochoid meshing. These two contrasting structures differ in their equidistance to the epitrochoid (or extended epicycloid) curve and hypotrochoid (or extended hypocycloid) curve. Using the design result parameters, the analysis also compares contact forces and assesses curvature to determine whether the cycloidal wheel has a <b>non-undercutting</b> or continuous condition...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the retention of}} restorations placed in <b>non-undercut,</b> noncarious cervical lesions using One-Up Bond F and Palfique Estelite resin composite. Materials and Methods: Fifty-one <b>non-undercut,</b> noncarious cervical lesions were restored with One-Up Bond Fand Palfique Estelite in 15 patients (mean age 57. 7 years). Teeth were cleaned with pumice and water and restored following the manufacturer's instructions. Restorations were evaluated at 6 months, 1 and 2 years for presence or absence, and for the degree of marginal staining using standardized colour photographs for comparison. Results: At 1 year, 42 restorations were evaluated, and all were intact. Slight marginal staining was observed in three restorations. At 2 years, 37 restorations were evaluated from 11 patients, and all were intact. Marginal staining was observed around nine restorations. ANOVA for marginal staining showed a significant increase of staining at both the enamel and cervical margins over the 2 years of the study. No caries was detected in association with any restoration. Conclusion: Although a number of restorations could not be evaluated, the retention of 100 % at 2 years showed very good promise {{for the treatment of}} noncarious cervical lesions. The marginal staining was limited to a small number of patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{evaluation}} of an ‘all-in-one ’ bonding system to non-carious cervical lesions — results at one year MF Burrow, * MJ Tyas† Background: The recent trend in using dentine adhesives is {{to simplify the}} number of steps required for bonding. The simplest are now the so-called ‘all-in-one ’ products which combine the etching, priming and bonding steps into a single application. However, few clinical trials have been reported using this type of material. The current study reports the one-year results of a clinical trial with One-Up Bond F and Palfique Estilite resin composite.

40|$|Combining the {{advantages}} of layered manufacturing and material removal processes, additive/subtractive solid freeform fabrication (A/S SFF) can build parts with complex shapes without compromising precision requirements. However, preparing material removal operations requires special expertise, which has in fact {{become one of the}} bottlenecks of the A/S SFF manufacturing process. To achieve automated planning, a shaping process planner is being developed based on 3 D solid representation and a surface classification scheme. This planner can generate numeric control (NC) codes for CNC milling in an automatic fashion on <b>non-undercut</b> features of arbitrary 3 D input geometry. Planning approaches are also presented in order to shape parts accurately and efficiently. The proposed shaping planner thus delivers on the promise of fully automated process planning in A/S SFF...|$|E

The simplest are now the so-called 'all-in-one' products which combine the etching, priming and bonding steps into a single application.

The current study reports the one-year results of a clinical trial with One-Up Bond F and Palfique Estilite resin composite. Methods: Fifty-one <b>non-undercut</b> non-carious cervical lesions were restored with One-Up Bond F and Palfique Estilite in 15 patients (mean age 57. 5 years). Restorations were evaluated at six months and one year for presence or absence and for marginal staining using standardized colour photographs for comparison. Results: At one year, 42 restorations could be evaluated and all were intact. Slight marginal staining was observed around three restorations but {{was considered to be}} of no clinical significance.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} dentine bonding agents {{currently on the}} market, the majority of which adhere by means of infiltration of a hydrophilic polymerizable diacrylate into dentinal collagen exposed by acid treatment. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the clinical performance of one such product, EBS dentine bonding, in <b>non-undercut</b> caries-free cervical lesions. Forty cavities were restored in eight patients of mean age 53 years. The manufacturer's instructions were followed, which involved essentially etching the enamel and dentine for 20 seconds with 32 per cent phosphoric acid, application and evaporation of EBS Primer, followed by placement and curing of EBS Bond, and restoring the cavity with Pertac II (ESPE) hybrid resin composite. Restorations were photographed at base line and one year for evaluation of marginal discolouration on a continuous linear rating scale. At six months, one patient with four restorations was not available; the remaining 36 restorations were all present. At one year, one restoration was missing, giving a cumulative retention rate of over 97 per cent. One of the 36 restorations exhibited very mild marginal discolouration. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of stope performance data from the narrow vein Kundana Gold mine in Western Australia has been made using the extended Mathews stability graph method and comparative statistics. For these Kundana stopes, a poor correlation was found between stope stability and both the Mathews stability number N and hydraulic radius HR. Given that both N and HR correlate well with stability {{in the vast majority}} of Mathews method case histories, this suggested that there is an overriding influence on stability at Barkers not accounted for in the Mathews method. Drill and blast issues were isolated as the most likely cause of this poor correlation. Blast pattern was found to have a statistically significant effect on overbreak. In terms of the drill and blast patterns used at the mine, the inline pattern performed significantly better than both the 2 ̆ 7 staggered 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 dice- 52 ̆ 7 patterns for the vein geometries at the time. Undercut footwalls were found to behave in a similar manner to <b>non-undercut</b> hangingwalls. There was no evidence that backfill abutments behave differently from solid rock abutments in terms of determination of stable stope dimensions. Drillhole accuracy was indirectly examined by considering the effect of stope heights within the limits of 13 - 20 m. Within these limits, stope height did not affect the magnitude of overbreak...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the retention and marginal staining of restorations placed in non-carious cervical lesions using the all-in-one self-etching system, One-Up Bond F and Palfique Estelite resin composite. Methods: Fifty-one <b>non-undercut</b> non-carious cervical lesions received restorations with One-Up Bond F and Palfique Estelite in 15 subjects (mean age 57. 7 years) by one operator. Teeth were cleaned with pumice and water, restored following the manufacturer's instructions and evaluated at 6 months, 1, 2, 4 and 5 years for retention and presence of marginal staining. Results: At 1 year, 42 restorations were evaluated, {{and all were}} intact with three restorations showing slight marginal staining. At 2 years, 37 restorations were evaluated from 11 subjects, and all were intact. Marginal staining was observed around nine restorations. At 4 years, 27 restorations and at 5 years, 24 restorations could be evaluated. Marginal staining showed a significant increase at the enamel and cervical margins over the 5 years of the study, with two restorations showing severe, nine mild and 13 no staining. Although a number of restorations could not be evaluated, the retention rate of 92 % at 5 years showed One-Up Bond F/Palfique Estelite resin composite {{for the restoration of}} non-carious cervical lesions produced an excellent outcome. Marginal staining was limited to a small number of subjects and is unlikely to be a problem if margins are refurbished at recall visits. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
