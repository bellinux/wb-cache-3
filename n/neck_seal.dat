25|$|Surface {{dry suits}} do not {{normally}} have exhaust valves, but the wearer may vent excess air by crouching down and hugging the legs while slipping a finger under the <b>neck</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
25|$|An over-tight <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> can put {{pressure}} on the carotid artery, causing a reflex which slows the heart, resulting in poor oxygen delivery to the brain, light-headedness and eventual unconsciousness. For this reason, neck seals should be stretched or trimmed to the correct size.|$|E
25|$|To {{provide more}} {{protection}} {{to the head}} against impact, to secure the airway, and to permit easy communication with the surface and between divers, a rigid metal or fibre-reinforced plastic diving helmet may be worn with the dry suit. This can be separate from the dry suit with its own watertight <b>neck</b> <b>seal,</b> {{or it can be}} clamped onto a neck ring attached to the suit, so that air can flow between the helmet and the suit.|$|E
25|$|Attachment rings allow {{separate}} <b>neck</b> <b>seals,</b> gloves, and (less commonly) {{boots to}} be joined to the suit with a watertight seal. The older style attachment ring system uses a support ring inside the suit and a clamping band outside the suit to tightly hold the suit and the separate hood/boot/glove together. They were also used with the <b>neck</b> <b>seals</b> of some old British frogman-type dry suits.|$|R
25|$|The BCD is {{more robust}} than a dry suit. Dry suits are not {{designed}} to be buoyancy compensators and more prone to failure than BCDs, they have multiple points of failure and can completely flood when a seal tears or a zip breaks or leaks. Wrist and <b>neck</b> <b>seals</b> can vent accidentally; annoying if wearing a BCD, possibly fatal without.|$|R
40|$|Relative {{advantages}} and dis{{advantages and}} important design criteria for various exposure methods are presented. Five types of exposures are discussed: whole-body chambers, head-only exposures, nose or mouth-only methods, lung-only exposures, and partial-lung exposures. Design considerations covered include: air cleaning and conditioning; construction materials; losses of exposure materials; evenness of exposure; sampling biases; animal observation and care; noise and vibration control, safe exhausts, chamber loading, reliability, pressure fluctuations; <b>neck</b> <b>seals,</b> masks, animal restraint methods; and animal comfort. Ethical considerations in use of animals in inhalation experiments are also discussed...|$|R
25|$|The Siebe-Heinke Frogman {{dry suit}} for {{professional}} and recreational use {{was introduced in}} 1963. It was available in stockinette proofed with black rubber, or proofed fawn twill. The suit consisted {{of a set of}} booted trousers with reinforced soles or optional ankle seals, and a jacket with cuff seals and an option between a <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> or integral hood. The two parts were connected by a rolled waist seal held in place by a rubber cummerbund. Sizes available were small, medium, large short and large.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1950s, C.E. Heinke & Co. Ltd., an {{established}} manufacturer of Standard diving equipment, had diversified into recreational underwater swimming equipment, including the Delta dry suit, made from natural rubber on a stockinette base. The basic Delta was a two piece suit {{made up of}} a jacket with <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> and trousers with ankle seals which could be worn over woolen undergarments. The full suit included integral hood and feet. The overlapped and rolled waist seal was held in place by a cummerbund.|$|E
25|$|The helmet may be {{of metal}} or {{reinforced}} plastic composite (GRP), and is either connected to a neck dam or clamped directly to a drysuit. The neck dam is {{the lower part of}} the helmet, which seals against the neck of the diver in the same way that the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> of a dry suit works. Neck dams may have neoprene or latex seals, depending on diver preference. Attachment to the neck dam is critical to diver safety and a reliable locking mechanism is needed to ensure that it is not inadvertently released during a dive. When using a dry suit, the neck dam may be permanently omitted and {{the lower part of the}} helmet assembly attached directly to the suit.|$|E

50|$|Witch balls {{sometimes}} measure {{as large}} as seven inches (18 cm) in diameter. The witch ball is traditionally, but not always, green or blue in color and made from glass (others, however, are made of wood, grass, or twigs instead of glass). Some are decorated in swirls and brilliant stripes of various colors. Witch balls normally have {{a hole in the}} top where a peg can be inserted; string is then attached to the peg so the ball can be hung in a chimney or over a window. Early witch balls often had a short <b>neck</b> <b>sealed</b> by a stopper. The gazing balls found in many of today's gardens are derived from the silvered witch balls that acted as convex mirrors, warding off evil by reflecting it away.|$|R
5|$|All {{parallel}} thread valves are sealed using an O-ring at {{top of the}} <b>neck</b> thread which <b>seals</b> in a chamfer or step in the cylinder neck and against the flange of the valve.|$|R
25|$|Dressing into a {{dry suit}} is usually more {{time-consuming}} than a wet suit, and may require {{the assistance of}} another person to check the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time {{on the deck of}} a boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment as far as possible before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand-by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze are the usual solution to this problem.|$|E
2500|$|Separate (non integral) hoods are of two types: {{one which}} extends {{only to the}} base of the neck, and the other a {{standard}} wetsuit hood with a large flange. Hoods are never tucked into the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> as they would be tucked into a wetsuit, as this would compromise the watertight integrity of the seal. Some suits are designed with a second (non-watertight) [...] "warm neck collar" [...] around the <b>neck</b> <b>seal,</b> which allows the flange of a standard wetsuit hood to tuck in around the outside of the seal. This can keep the neck significantly warmer, since the seal itself provides little insulation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recommended}} solution in all such [...] "inversion accidents", {{is for the}} wearer to bend at the knees and powerfully flap the arms to do a backward or forward roll to the upright position and then vent the suit, if needed, by manually opening the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> (sometimes called [...] "burping the suit") by breaking the seal-neck contact with a finger.|$|E
25|$|The iron lung, {{also known}} as the Drinker and Shaw tank, was {{developed}} in 1929 {{and was one of the}} first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation. It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the polio epidemic that struck the world in the 1940s. The machine is, in effect, a large elongated tank, which encases the patient up to the neck. The <b>neck</b> is <b>sealed</b> with a rubber gasket so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vent valves}} of a BCD are more secure and have backups, often via the {{inflator}} hose, the left shoulder valve, the right shoulder valve {{and sometimes the}} bottom. The dry suit has none, other than manipulating the <b>neck</b> and wrist <b>seals,</b> the wrist seals may not be available if wearing certain types of gloves.|$|R
60|$|They {{made the}} tour of the room in silence after this; but Bardo's lip-born maxims were as {{powerless}} over the passion which had been moving him, {{as if they had}} been written on parchment and hung round his <b>neck</b> in a <b>sealed</b> bag; and he presently broke forth again in a new tone of insistance.|$|R
2500|$|The helmet may be {{described}} {{by the number of}} bolts which hold it to the suit or to the corselet, and the number of vision ports, known as lights. For example, a helmet with four vision ports, and twelve studs securing the suit to the corselet, would be known as a [...] "four light, twelve bolt helmet", and a three-bolt helmet used three bolts to secure the bonnet to the corselet, clamping the flange of the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> between the two parts of the helmet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exhaust valve}} lets the diver vent {{expanding}} {{gas from the}} suit during the ascent. On ascent {{the air in the}} suit expands making buoyancy control difficult or impossible. [...] This may cause an uncontrolled ascent resulting in missed decompression stops, decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism or pulmonary barotrauma. The manual exhaust allows the diver to control the suit volume; this may incorporate an automatic, adjustable exhaust or there may be a separate automatic, auto dump, valve on the shoulder. [...] Automatic valves can be set to release at a pre-set pressure and in most situations, the diver can leave the automatic valve at a constant setting throughout the dive so that it releases {{with a small amount of}} over-pressure venting as needed automatically as the diver ascends. There are many different configurations but automatic vents are generally at the left shoulder, and manual vents are at the wrist. Environmentally sealed suits used for diving in contaminated water have no dump valve, but are clamped to the helmet with a watertight seal, so the exhaust valve of the helmet functions as a dump valve. Some, now rare, older dry suits may have no vents, requiring the diver to lift one of the wrist seals or the <b>neck</b> <b>seal</b> open to vent the suit.|$|E

They are made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the trapped gas bubbles in the neoprene foam compress at depth. Semi-dry suits are usually made as a one piece full suit with slick inside surface neoprene wrist, cuff and <b>neck</b> <b>seals</b> [...] Two-piece sets {{tend to be a}} one piece full length suit, sometimes described as [...] "long johns", plus accessories to be worn over, under or with the one-piece suit, such as a shortie tunic, which may be worn separately in warm water, but has no flush-limiting seals at the openings. Semi dry suits do not usually include hoods, boots or gloves, so separate insulating hoods, boots and gloves are worn.|$|R
50|$|Polar bears, caribou, and {{waterfowl}} are {{the three}} main keystone species that occupy the hudson plain ecoregion. Several hundred polar bears that migrate through this area every year to the ice back formation {{along the coast of}} the Hudson Bay. Being in such a desolate area with little or no human interaction, polar bears have little to worry about for human contact, as well a no known natural known predators. With an abundant population of deer and caribou, polar bears seldom go hungry on their migration towards the sea ice in search of their main prey, ring <b>neck</b> <b>seals,</b> and bearded seals. The caribou, which is a species of deer, are also extremely abundant in this region. Caribou primarily feed on lichens, moss, grasses, and birches. Many people consider them to be a keystone species due to the amount of other animals, mostly carnivores that depend on the caribou as a primary food source. With the large population of caribou that life in this area and the lack of human contact or hunting, large amounts of fawns are born each spring. The most dominant animal species that inhabits the ecoregion is unquestionably waterfowl. Because of the poorly drained and flat surface of the wetlands this allows for ideal nesting habitat in the summer months for thousand of waterfowl. The waterfowl eat mostly grass roots, water plants, and seeds. Canada geese, snow geese, mergansers, scoters and black ducks are the most abundant species of waterfowl in region.|$|R

60|$|Sea Catch knew that, {{and every}} spring would swim from {{whatever}} place {{he happened to}} be in--would swim like a torpedo-boat straight for Novastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good place on the rocks, as close to the sea as possible.

When he heaved himself up on his front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground, and his weight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was nearly seven hundred pounds. He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights, but he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head on one side, as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face; then he would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were firmly fixed on the other <b>seal's</b> <b>neck,</b> the other <b>seal</b> might get away if he could, but Sea Catch would not help him.|$|R
25|$|For a {{few years}} after C.E. Heinke & Co. Ltd. was taken over by Siebe-Gorman and Company in 1961, dry suits were marketed under the Siebe-Heinke label. The Siebe-Heinke Dip Suit for {{recreational}} diving, swimming, yachting and fishing, was advertised in Lillywhites’ 1964 underwater catalogue. The standard Dip Suit was a set of seamless black dipped-latex jacket with <b>neck</b> and cuff <b>seals,</b> and trousers with separate yellow latex waist-seal cummerbund. A yellow hood and black protective over-bootees were optional extras. Small, medium and large sizes were available.|$|R

25|$|Seals at {{the wrists}} and neck prevent water {{entering}} the suit by a close contact fit against {{the skin around}} the wrists and <b>neck.</b> The <b>seals</b> are not absolutely watertight, however, and the wearer may experience some seepage during use. The wearer will also get damp due to sweat and condensation. The seals are typically made from latex rubber or foam neoprene, but are also available in silicone rubber. Latex seals are supple but easily damaged and deteriorate with exposure to oils, oxygen, and other materials, so they must be replaced periodically, every two years or more often. Latex also causes an allergic reaction in some users. Neoprene seals last longer and are non-allergenic, but, being less elastic, let more water enter {{because they do not}} seal as effectively as latex seals to the contours of wrist and neck. They are also typically glued and sewn together to form a tube, and may leak along that seam.|$|R
50|$|Another {{version was}} {{designed}} by Dr. Gales, an apothecary at the Hospital St. Louis in Paris, in 1812 or shortly thereafter. It had the naked subject seated on a chair in a wooden box, with the patient's entire head exposed through an opening at the box's top. The opening around the patient's <b>neck</b> was <b>sealed</b> so fumes could not escape. There were three chambers {{at the bottom of}} this box, the top one containing sulfur which was heated by a fire in a chamber below. A bottom chamber caught the ashes. The sulfurous fumes rose through many small holes drilled through the floor of the patient compartment. If necessary, fumes could be applied directly to the head or face by means of a flexible hose attached to the main compartment. The purpose of this type of fumigatory box was curative or palliative rather than prophylactic, used as a treatment for ailments including rheumatism and psoriasis, not {{to prevent the spread of}} disease.|$|R
