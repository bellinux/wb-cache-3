There are a number of techniques for integrating testability into system design, but many of these traditional testing methods used for synchronous circuits are not directly applicable to <b>non-clocked</b> asynchronous circuits. As a result, many asynchronous circuits do not employ design for testability techniques. A method of using the familiar model of scan paths modified to test self-timed systems are presented.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Phased {{logic is}} a synthesis/mapping {{methodology}} {{that allows a}} standard clocked netlist (combinational gates + DFFs) to be automatically mapped to a <b>non-clocked</b> netlist that uses special gates called phased logic gates.

Since the input to the phased logic synthesis/mapper tool is a standard clocked netlist, any standard synthesis tool can be used to produce the clocked netlist. Our methodology starts with behavioral VHDL and produces a simulateable phased logic netlist. It is shown that optimizations and architectural approaches that produce a fast clocked design results in a fast phased logic design. Se...|$|R

The analysis of average suppression and of individual trials was performed during Probe CS-alone trials and when a short gap was inserted during the CS. The pattern of suppression followed the classical temporal rules: (1) scalar property, (2) a shift in peak suppression due to a gap, compatible with a Stop rule, (3) a three-state pattern of lever-pressing in individual trials, with abrupt start and stop of suppression. The peak of the average suppression curve, but not the middle time, was anticipatory to the programmed US time. The pattern of lever-pressing in individual trials unraveled two types of start of suppression behavior: a clock-based biphasic responding, with a burst of lever-pressing before suppression, and a <b>non-clock</b> based monophasic reduction of lever-pressing close to the CS onset.

40|$|The {{serotonin}} and circadian {{systems are}} two important interactive regulatory {{networks in the}} mammalian brain that regulate behavior and physiology {{in ways that are}} known to impact human mental health. Previous work on the interaction between these two systems suggests that serotonin modulates photic input to the central circadian clock (the suprachiasmatic nuclei; SCN) from the retina and serves as a signal for locomotor activity, novelty, and arousal to shift the SCN clock, but effects of disruption of serotonergic signaling from the raphe nuclei on circadian behavior and on SCN function are not fully characterized. In this study, we examined the effects on diurnal and circadian behavior, and on ex vivo molecular rhythms of the SCN, of genetic deficiency in Pet- 1, an ETS transcription factor that is necessary to establish and maintain the serotonergic phenotype of raphe neurons. Pet- 1 ⁻/⁻ mice exhibit loss of rhythmic behavioral coherence and an extended daily activity duration, as well as changes in the molecular rhythms expressed by the clock, such that ex vivo SCN from Pet- 1 ⁻/⁻ mice exhibit period lengthening and sex-dependent changes in rhythmic amplitude.

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster is {{a common}} model used to study {{circadian}} rhythms in behavior and circadian clocks. However, numerous circadian rhythms have also been detected in <b>non-clock</b> neurons, especially in the first optic neuropil (lamina) of the fly's visual system. Such rhythms have been observed {{in the number of}} synapses and in the structure of interneurons, which exhibit changes in size and shape in a circadian manner. Although the patterns of these changes are known, the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of the TOR signaling pathway and autophagy in regulating circadian rhythms based on the behavior and structural plasticity of the lamina L 2 monopolar cell dendritic trees. In addition, we examined the cyclic expression of the TOR signaling pathway (Tor, Pi 3 K class 1, Akt 1) and autophagy (Atg 5 and Atg 7) genes in the fly's brain. We observed that Tor, Atg 5 and Atg 7 exhibit rhythmic expressions in the brain of wild-type flies in day/night conditions (LD 12 : 12) that are abolished in per 01 clock mutants. The silencing of Tor in per expressing cells shortens a period of the locomotor activity rhythm of flies. In addition, silencing of the Tor and Atg 5 genes in L 2 cells disrupts the circadian plasticity of the L 2 cell dendritic trees measured in the distal lamina. In turn, silencing of the Atg 7 gene in L 2 cells changes the pattern of this rhythm.

40|$|Navigation {{technology}} has evolved {{to the use of}} the microchip as its main building block. A car-GPS is a popular example of a commercial navigation (or localization) application taking advantage of this technology. The CMOS fabrication process is a frequently used method for fabrication of these microchips, especially when targeting high production volumes and low unit cost. A lot of research has been going on to optimize this CMOS process for digital circuits. This has strong implications for existing analog circuit topologies, to which this CMOS process becomes more and more incompatible. An emerging way to resolve this incompatibility is using the continuous-time digital domain where it can replace analog signals. This domain is especially interesting for design of data converters (e. g. digitizers). Moreover, it can have special advantages in the field of time-of-arrival-based (ToA) localization. This work is on the design of digitizers for short-range, ToA-based, localization systems using the CMOS technology. Moreover, it closes the gap between high-level specifications for localization systems and design of the digitizer itself. Covering a high bandwidth is a good method to create a high performance localization system. The way it is allocated has implications on design of the digitizer. The idea is allocate a bandwidth as high as possible to get the best performance over the highest range at the lowest amount of power and the shortest signal durations. This idea is fixed in a figure-of-merit. Two strategies are considered regarding the bandwidth. These are a single-carrier approach and a multi-carrier approach. A prototype digitizer for both types will be studied, implemented and tested. They both exploit a different method to take advantage high bandwidths. The first prototype is based on a multiple-TDC-based core. This multiple-TDC concept is elaborately discussed in terms of its abilities to perform edge detection for ToA estimation. One of the drawbacks of this approach is the dispersion caused by the <b>non-clocked</b> comparators. These <b>non-clocked</b> comparators are an indispensible part of the digitizer's implementation. An approach how to deal with this dispersion while estimating the ToA is introduced and tested. The joint circuit-algorithmic approach makes this topology interesting for single-carrier ranging systems operating in good signal strength conditions. Precisions in the cm-range can be obtained using this approach. The second prototype implements two differential VCO-based A/Ds to enable full digitization of an I/Q decomposed baseband signal. The IC features a reconfigurable sub-sampling operation, designed to reduce the bandwidth of the received signals for localization. The IC stores the digitized samples in an integrated SRAM algorithm, making it available to a back-end. In contrast to the multiple-TDC-based first prototype, the ranging system for which this digitizer is designed uses multiple carriers. The VCO-based A/D is validated in a prototype millimeter-wave ranging system. The ranging system achieves a state-of-the-art sub-centimeter precision by means of the sub-sampling approach carried out by the VCO-based A/D. Next, considerations on how to step towards a three-dimensional localization system are provided. One of the drawbacks of the continuous-time domain is the computing resources it takes to simulate a circuit using it. Classic spectral analysis techniques require a big set of simulation data to conclude on the performance of the design. Least-squares spectral analysis can provide a reliable prediction on the expected performance even when simulation data is limited. The least-squares technique is explained and applied to the field of design of VCO-based A/Ds. A useful estimate is introduced, giving insights to the designers in the trade-off between simulation duration and design precision. status: publishe...|$|R

The location of two excess electrons located within four or five quantum dots on a particular cell can transmit the binary information. These dots are located in the corner of a square cell, {{and if there is a}} fifth dot it is located in the center. The electrons are allowed to tunnel freely among the dots, but are restricted from tunneling between neighboring cells. Because of the interaction between the electrons, they will anti-align within the cell giving one of two particular configurations. This configuration can be transmitted to neighboring cells. In other words, data is flowing. We present a numerical study of the fabrication defect's influence on Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) operation.

40|$|ORTHO {{is part of}} the Global Positioning System (GPS) being {{developed}} by the U. S. Air Force, a navigational system that will use 18 NAVSTAR satellites to broadcast navigation messages and achieve worldwide coverage. The normal positioning technique uses one receiver which receives signals from at least four GPS satellites. For higher accuracy work it is often necessary to use a differential technique in which more than one receiver is used. The geodetic measurement has all receivers on the ground and allows the determination of the relative locations of the ground sites. The main application of the ORTHO program is in the elimination of clock errors in a GPS based tracking system. The measured distance (pseudo-range) from a GPS receiver contains errors due to differences in the receiver and satellite clocks. The conventional way of eliminating clock errors is to difference pseudo-ranges between different GPS satellites and receivers. The Householder transformation used in this program performs a function similar to the conventional single differencing or double differencing. This method avoids the problem of redundancy and correlation encountered in a differencing scheme. It is able to keep all information contained in the measurements within the scope of a least square estimation. For multiple transmitter and receiver GPS tracking network, this method is in general more accurate than the differencing technique. This program assumes that the <b>non-clock</b> measurement partial derivatives for the particular application are computed earlier by another program. With the partial derivatives and information to identify the transmitters and receivers as the input, the program performs the Householder transformation on the partial derivatives. The transformed partials are output by the program and may be used as an input to the filter program in the subsequent estimation process.

40|$|Adult {{neurogenesis}} creates new neurons and glia from {{stem cells}} in the human brain throughout life. It is best understood in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Circadian rhythms {{have been identified in}} the hippocampus, but the role of any endogenous circadian oscillator cells in hippocampal neurogenesis and their importance in learning or memory remains unclear. Any study of stem cell regulation by intrinsic circadian timing within the DG is complicated by modulation from circadian clocks elsewhere in the brain. To examine circadian oscillators in greater isolation, neurosphere cultures were prepared from the DG of two knockout mouse lines that lack a functional circadian clock and from mPer 1 ::luc mice to identify circadian oscillations in gene expression. Circadian mPer 1 gene activity rhythms were recorded in neurospheres maintained in a culture medium that induces neurogenesis but not in one that maintains the stem cell state. Although the differentiating neural stem progenitor cells of spheres were rhythmic, evidence of any mature neurons was extremely sparse. The circadian timing signal originated in undifferentiated cells within the neurosphere. This conclusion was supported by immunocytochemistry for mPER 1 protein that was localized to the inner, more stem cell-like neurosphere core. To test for effects of the circadian clock on neurogenesis, media conditions were altered to induce neurospheres from BMAL 1 knockout mice to differentiate. These cultures displayed unusually high differentiation into glia rather than neurons according to GFAP and NeuN expression, respectively, and very few BetaIII tubulin-positive, immature neurons were observed. The knockout neurospheres also displayed areas visibly devoid of cells and had overall higher cell death. Neurospheres from arrhythmic mice lacking two other core clock genes, Cry 1 and Cry 2, showed significantly reduced growth and increased astrocyte proliferation during differentiation, but they generated normal percentages of neuronal cells.

40|$|The {{skull of}} the polydolopimorphian marsupialiform Epidolops ameghinoi is {{described}} in detail for the first time, based on a single well-preserved cranium and associated left and right dentaries plus additional craniodental fragments, all from the early Eocene (53 - 50 million year old) Itaboraí fauna in southeastern Brazil. Notable craniodental features of E. ameghinoi include absence of a masseteric process, very small maxillopalatine fenestrae, a prominent pterygoid fossa enclosed laterally by a prominent ectopterygoid crest, an absent or tiny transverse canal foramen, a simple, planar glenoid fossa, and a postglenoid foramen that is immediately posterior to the postglenoid process. Most strikingly, {{the floor of the}} hypotympanic sinus was apparently unossified, a feature found in several stem marsupials but absent in all known crown marsupials. "Type II" marsupialiform petrosals previously described from Itaboraí plausibly belong to E. ameghinoi; in published phylogenetic analyses, these petrosals fell outside (crown-clade) Marsupialia. "IMG VII" tarsals previously referred to E. ameghinoi do not share obvious synapomorphies with any crown marsupial clade, nor do they resemble those of the only other putative polydolopimorphians represented by tarsal remains, namely the argyrolagids. Most studies have placed Polydolopimorphia within Marsupialia, related to either Paucituberculata, or to Microbiotheria and Diprotodontia. However, diprotodonty almost certainly evolved independently in polydolopimorphians, paucituberculatans and diprotodontians, and Epidolops does not share obvious synapomorphies with any marsupial order. Epidolops is dentally specialized, but several morphological features appear to be more plesiomorphic than any crown marsupial. It seems likely Epidolops that falls outside Marsupialia, as do morphologically similar forms such as Bonapartherium and polydolopids. Argyrolagids differ markedly in their known morphology from Epidolops but share some potential apomorphies with paucituberculatans. It is proposed that Polydolopimorphia as currently recognised is polyphyletic, and that argyrolagids (and possibly other taxa currently included in Argyrolagoidea, such as groeberiids and patagoniids) are members of Paucituberculata. This hypothesis is supported by Bayesian <b>non-clock</b> phylogenetic analyses of a total evidence matrix comprising DNA sequence data from five nuclear protein-coding genes, indels, retroposon insertions and morphological characters: Epidolops falls outside Marsupialia, whereas argyrolagids form a clade with the paucituberculatans Caenolestes and Palaeothentes, regardless of whether the Type II petrosals and IMG VII tarsals are used to score characters for Epidolops or not.

40|$|AbstractTemporal {{perception}} encompasses several timing properties, including {{duration and}} temporal rate. If temporal perception were a unified mechanism, one might predict {{that differences in}} perception would apply across properties; thus, a stimulus that seems to persist for a longer duration might also seem to flicker more slowly. Moreover, effects {{that seem to be}} largely unisensory for duration might also be expected to be sensory specific for rate. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the mechanisms that underlie perception of temporal rate work quite differently from those that underlie duration perception, which has important implications for models of time perception. In a series of experiments, Johnston, Arnold, and Nishida (2006) showed that they could manipulate perceived duration of a visual stimulus using an adaptation paradigm. They found that their adaptation was specific to particular locations and that the effect on duration could be dissociated from perception of the rate of flicker of their stimuli. They argued that the neural mechanisms involved in duration and temporal frequency must be different. This contention is further supported from results using a chronostasis paradigm. With chronostasis, under certain conditions, a perceptual expansion of time occurs and the duration of certain stimuli are overestimated. For instance, when streams of stimuli are presented, an “oddball” stimulus that differs from a set of identical standards (e. g., altered in shape, motion, color, or size) is perceived to last longer than the standard stimuli (Tse, Intriligator, Rivest, & Cavanaugh, 2004). While these oddball effects are robust for duration, judgments of flicker rate are unchanged by oddball status (Pariyadeth & Eagleman, 2007). Although the cause of chronostasis is still under debate, the difference between the duration and rate experimental results again suggests a separability between the types of tasks. Newer evidence for this separability of rate and duration perceptual tasks comes from examining adaptation studies that looked for transfer from one sensory modality to another. Exposure to auditory or visual adaptors of a particular duration leads to an aftereffect such that short adaptors lead to a perceived expansion of duration, whereas long adaptors lead to compression. This aftereffect is tuned such that the expansion and contraction occur only for durations in a limited range. This duration aftereffect is not due to temporal frequency adaptation and is sensory-specific; an adaptor in a particular modality has no effect on test stimuli in the other modality (Heron et al., 2012). Studies of temporal rate adaptation have also demonstrated a negative aftereffect such that adaptation stimuli pulsing quickly lead to subsequent stimuli seeming to pulse more slowly, and slow adaptors lead to later stimuli seeming to pulse more quickly (Levitan, Ban, Stiles, & Shimojo, 2012). This aftereffect shows tuning similar to that found for duration (Levitan et al., 2013), but unlike the duration results, the effect of adaptation transfers across modalities – auditory adaptors change the perception of visual test stimuli, and visual adaptors change the perception of auditory test stimuli. Taken together, these findings suggest that mechanisms underlying duration perception are modality-specific, while mechanisms involved in rate perception apply across modalities. At the neural level, a pair of recent electrophysiological studies further support the notion for a distinction between duration and frequency mechanisms. For duration discrimination, the neural circuitry involved in auditory processing is distinct from the circuitry involved in somatosensory processing (Butler et al., 2011). This result argues for unisensory representation of duration. However, the same research group used a similar paradigm to probe rate perception, and found significant multisensory coupling, suggesting that for rate, the modalities interact early on, even in a task that does not require directed attention (Butler et al., 2012). These neural results are consistent with the psychophysical evidence for sensory-specific duration perception but cross- modal mechanisms for rate. These results provide some constraints upon possible models of temporal perception. Early models of temporal perception posited a clock-like mechanism, in which a pacemaker generates “ticks” that are counted by an accumulator (e. g., Treisman, 1963; see also Buhusi & Meck, 2005, for further discussion of such models). Such models cannot provide a reasonable account for the discrepancies between duration and rate; if temporal adaptation changes a multisensory tick rate, then this should influence the final assessment of duration. <b>Non-clock</b> models of temporal perception that consider the roles of sensory modalities in encoding time (e. g., van Wassenhove, 2009) must account for this divergence between duration and rate...|$|E
