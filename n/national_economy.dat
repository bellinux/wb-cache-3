In August 2011, Moody's rating has cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 inline {{with the size of}} the country's deficit and borrowing level. The large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global recession and followed by the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the rating downgrade.

After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side {{as a result of}} its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories, at Doiran and Dobrich, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses, and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars, placing additional strain on the already ruined <b>national</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E

Although the world is divided into more than 200 nations with unequal power, there is less than half a dozen key currencies to go round to facilitate the international financial transactions.

5|$|In 1870, few Brazilians opposed {{slavery and}} even fewer openly {{condemned}} it. PedroII, who did not own slaves, {{was one of the}} few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. PedroII wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the <b>national</b> <b>economy.</b> With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.|$|E

40|$|The central {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the competitiveness of European Union through the prism of its influence factors: public debt, budget deficit, competitiveness of <b>national</b> <b>economies,</b> credit default swap. Based on these factors were obtained three regression functions for EU competitiveness. The results of the analysis reveal that the EU competitiveness is influenced by two main factors: sovereign risk and competitiveness of <b>national</b> <b>economies.</b> In the current economic situation, sovereign risk rate of 48. 52 % influences on EU competitiveness, and competitiveness of <b>national</b> <b>economies</b> at a rate of 33. 63 %. Among the three risk variables underlying the sovereign risk, public debt ratio is most important, thus showing that any sovereign debt crisis would adversely affect the competitiveness of the European Union, followed by the value of the CDS and by the budgetary equilibrium. The second factor, the competitiveness of <b>national</b> <b>economies</b> is mainly determined by the global competitiveness index. The model proposed in this study identifies the factors underlying the central {{objective of}} the Lisbon Strategy, namely to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world...|$|R
5|$|After Napoleon's total {{defeat in}} 1815, the Congress of Vienna merged the French {{territory}} in Belgium with the Netherlands {{to form the}} United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a buffer state against the French. It was ruled by William I of Orange. The synergy of combining the manufacturing centers in Belgium with the important exporting ports in the Netherlands encouraged growth of the industrial cloth manufacturing and metallurgic centers in Wallonia. Keen to promote the economic development of the southern provinces as well, William I founded the Société Générale des Pays-Bas in 1822 to provide businesses with capital to invest in machinery. The Société Générale served as a driving force behind Belgian industrialization in the 19th century, and at its height controlled large swathes of the <b>national</b> <b>economy.</b> William I also encouraged the creation of educational facilities in the Southern Provinces, founding the State University of Leuven, the University of Liège and Ghent University in 1817.|$|E

As a proportion of the <b>national</b> <b>economy,</b> the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast.
