5|$|A <b>natural</b> <b>experiment</b> {{permitted}} extensive {{study of}} attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
25|$|In another {{paper with}} Simon Johnson at Massachusetts Institute of Technology called The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors use a <b>natural</b> <b>experiment</b> {{in history to}} show that {{different}} institutions result in different levels of economic growth. The paper examines institutional choices {{during the colonial period}} of several nations in relation to the same nations' economic development today. It found that in countries where the disease environment meant that it was hard for colonizers to survive (high mortality rate), they tended to set up extractive regimes, which resulted in poor economic growth today. In places where it was easier for colonizers to survive (low mortality rates), however, they tended to settle down and duplicate institutions from their country of origin—especially from Britain, as {{we have seen in the}} colonial success of Australia and United States. Thus, the mortality rate among colonial settlers several hundred years ago has determined the economic growth of today's post-colonial nations by setting institutions on very different paths.|$|E

In diverse applications, <b>natural</b> <b>experiments</b> {{have been used}} to verify underlying assumptions of conventional models, quantify specific model parameters, and identify mechanisms that have major effects on macroeconomic quantities but are absent from conventional models. We discuss and compare the use of <b>natural</b> <b>experiments</b> across these different applications and summarize what they have taught us about such diverse subjects as the validity of the Permanent Income Hypothesis, the size of the fiscal multiplier, and about the effects of institutions, social structure, and culture on economic growth.

Thus, the observations of postglacial rebound provide a <b>natural</b> <b>experiment</b> to measure mantle rheology.

6000|$|And, finally, even on {{that great}} scale {{we are able}} to verify the result. The case is one of those rare cases, as we have shown them to be, in which nature works the {{experiment}} for us in the same manner in which we ourselves perform it; introducing into the previous state of things a single and perfectly definite new circumstance, and manifesting the effect so rapidly that there is not time for any other material change in the pre-existing circumstances. “It is observed that dew is never copiously deposited in situations much screened from the open sky, and not at all in a cloudy night; but if the clouds withdraw even for a few minutes, and leave a clear opening, a deposition of dew presently begins, and goes on increasing... Dew formed in clear intervals will often even evaporate again when the sky becomes thickly overcast.” The proof, therefore, is complete, that {{the presence or absence of}} an uninterrupted communication with the sky causes the deposition or non-deposition of dew. Now, since a clear sky is nothing but the absence of clouds, and it is a known property of clouds, as of all other bodies between which and any given object nothing intervenes but an elastic fluid, that they tend to raise or keep up the superficial temperature of the object by radiating heat to it, we see at once that the disappearance of clouds will cause the surface to cool; so that nature, in this case, produces a change in the antecedent by definite and known means, and the consequent follows accordingly: a <b>natural</b> <b>experiment</b> which satisfies the requisitions of the Method of Difference.(141) ...|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "experiment" [...] usually {{implies a}} {{controlled}} experiment, but sometimes controlled experiments are prohibitively difficult or impossible. In this case researchers resort to <b>natural</b> <b>experiments</b> or quasi-experiments. [...] <b>Natural</b> <b>experiments</b> {{rely solely on}} observations of the variables of the system under study, rather than manipulation of just {{one or a few}} variables as occurs in controlled experiments. To the degree possible, they attempt to collect data for the system {{in such a way that}} contribution from all variables can be determined, and where the effects of variation in certain variables remain approximately constant so that the effects of other variables can be discerned. The degree to which this is possible depends on the observed correlation between explanatory variables in the observed data. When these variables are not well correlated, <b>natural</b> <b>experiments</b> can approach the power of controlled experiments. Usually, however, there is some correlation between these variables, which reduces the reliability of <b>natural</b> <b>experiments</b> relative to what could be concluded if a controlled experiment were performed. Also, because <b>natural</b> <b>experiments</b> usually take place in uncontrolled environments, variables from undetected sources are neither measured nor held constant, and these may produce illusory correlations in variables under study.|$|R

However, even when natural interventions are randomly assigned, some of the treatment–control comparisons made available by <b>natural</b> <b>experiments</b> may not be valid. We offer a framework for clarifying the issues involved, which are subtle and often overlooked. We illustrate our framework by examining four different <b>natural</b> <b>experiments</b> used in the literature.

The different identification assumptions we consider suggest testable implications, which we use to establish their plausibility.

Helena is geographically isolated and served by only one hospital. It was observed {{that the rate of}} heart attacks dropped by 40% while the smoking ban was in effect. Opponents of the law prevailed in getting the enforcement of the law suspended after six months, after which the rate of heart attacks went back up. [...] This was a good {{example of a}} <b>natural</b> <b>experiment</b> (called a case-crossover experiment, where the exposure is removed for a time and then returned), but also an example of how confounding variables in a <b>natural</b> <b>experiment</b> can lead to false conclusions. Heart-attack rates were already on the decline before the smoking ban, and the population size was small enough (a reduction of 16 heart attacks from 40 in the period before the ban) that the large-percentage fluctuation was likely due to chance. The Helena study's conclusion that 40% of pre-ban heart attacks were caused by passive smoking is actually implausible, since only 10-15% of coronary heart-disease cases are thought to be caused by active smoking.|$|E

50|$|A <b>natural</b> <b>experiment</b> is an {{empirical}} {{study in which}} individuals (or clusters of individuals) exposed to the experimental and control conditions are determined by nature or by other factors outside {{the control of the}} investigators, but the process governing the exposures arguably resembles random assignment. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment. Natural experiments are most useful when there has been a clearly defined exposure involving a well defined subpopulation (and the absence of exposure in a similar subpopulation) such that changes in outcomes may be plausibly attributed to the exposure. In this sense, the difference between a <b>natural</b> <b>experiment</b> and a non-experimental observational study is that the former includes a comparison of conditions that pave the way for causal inference, but the latter does not.|$|E
