Aflaq was a strong believer in pluralism of thought, but paradoxically, against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party knew what was right.|$|E

He also argues that the one reading on which Uthman united the Muslims was the one in circulation among most Muslims, and that it reached them through uninterrupted transmission from Muhammad.|$|E

25|$|To Freud {{sexuality}} {{is composed of}} partial drives (i.e. the oral or the anal drives) each specified by a different erotogenic zone. At first these partial drives function independently (i.e. the polymorphous perversity of children), {{it is only in}} puberty that they become organized {{under the aegis of the}} genital organs. Lacan accepts the partial nature of drives, but 1) rejects the notion that partial drives can ever attain any complete organization: the primacy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always precarious; and 2) he argues that drives are partial in that they only represent sexuality partially <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that they are a part of the whole. Drives do not represent the reproductive function of sexuality but only the dimension of jouissance.|$|E

He told his {{collaborators}} to do a remake of his previous single, [...] "Cry Me a River". Danja, a protégé of Timbaland, stated: [...] "We had no direction at all other than 'Cry Me a River,' and <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of mimicking the track, but in how big the song was. There was no direction for how he wanted the song to sound, because there was no direction for how he wanted [...] to sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Distinctive {{styles of}} American popular music emerged {{early in the}} 19th century, and in the 20th century the American music {{industry}} developed a series of new forms of music, using elements of blues and other genres of American folk music. [...] These popular styles included country, R, jazz and rock. [...] The 1960s and 1970s saw {{a number of important}} changes in American popular music, including the development of a number of new styles, such as heavy metal, punk, soul, and hip hop. [...] Though these styles were <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of mainstream, they were commercially recorded and are thus examples of popular music as opposed to folk or classical music.|$|E

For the image by means of which, each time, each opens a world and precedes himself in it (s'y prédède) is not pregiven (donnée toute faite) (as are those of dreams, phantasms or bad films): it is to be invented, cut and edited.

500|$|Some sources {{describe}} {{the subjects of}} Lichtenstein's tragic girls series as heroines (in {{the sense that they}} are the counterparts to the heroes), and others do <b>not</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that they are not heroic). Drowning Girl is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in {{to the power of the}} ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Because Lichtenstein only presents a single frame, the viewer does not know what happened before this moment and what is going to happen after it. [...] Furthermore, the viewer has no way to know who Brad is and why she is so reluctant to call him.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} almost universally well {{received}} by the music press upon release, with Jon Landau in the newly launched Rolling Stone magazine noting that [...] "When the Byrds get it together on record they are consistently brilliant." [...] Landau went on to praise the Byrds' musical eclecticism, before stating: [...] "Their music is possessed by a never-ending circularity and a rich, child-like quality. It has a timelessness to it, <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that you think their music will always be valid, but {{in the sense that}} it is capable of forcing you to suspend consciousness of time altogether." [...] Crawdaddy! magazine was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, with Sandy Pearlman describing it as [...] "enchantingly beautiful". Pete Johnson, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, summed up the album as [...] "11 good songs spiked with electronic music, strings, brass, natural and supernatural voices, and the familiar thick texture of McGuinn's guitar playing".|$|E
500|$|The title Christ, or Messiah, {{indicates}} that Jesus' followers believed {{him to be}} the anointed heir of King David, whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as [...] "the Messiah" [...] or, equivalently, [...] "the Christ". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as [...] "his Messiah". The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his eschatological role as that of the Messiah. The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not. Based on the Christian tradition, Gerd Theissen advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title [...] "Messiah". Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit {{in the sense that he}} would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in, <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that most people today think of the term.|$|E

500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. And the same thing is happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E
