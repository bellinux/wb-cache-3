5|$|Porosity, {{often not}} visible {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} <b>nondestructive</b> <b>testing</b> methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode.|$|E
40|$|The {{compressive}} strength of concrete {{is an important}} factor in the design of concrete structures and pavements. To assure the quality of the concrete placed at the project, concrete compressive cylinders are made at the jobsite. These cylinders undergo a destructive test to determine their {{compressive strength}}. However, the determination of concrete compressive strength of the concrete actually in the structure or pavement is frequently desirable. For this reason, a <b>nondestructive</b> <b>test</b> of the concrete is required. A <b>nondestructive</b> <b>test</b> of concrete compressive strength should be economical, easily performed by field personnel, and capable of producing accurate, reproducible results. The <b>nondestructive</b> <b>test</b> should be capable of detecting the extent of poor concrete in a pavement or structure due to improper handling, placement, or variations in mixing or materials...|$|R

5|$|Launched in January 2013, {{the project}} {{is part of the}} Interministerial Fund program of Aerospace Valley, a {{business}} cluster in southwestern France. With a budget of over one million euros, Air-Cobot aims to develop an innovative collaborative mobile robot, autonomous in its movements and able to perform the inspection of an aircraft with <b>nondestructive</b> <b>testing</b> sensors during preflight or during maintenance operations in a hangar. Testing has been performed at the premises of Airbus and Air France Industries.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, in an {{interview}} given to the French weekly magazine Air et Cosmos, Jean-Charles Marcos, CEO of Akka Research, explained that once developed and marketed the Air-Cobot should cost between 100,000 and 200,000 euros. He could meet civilian needs in <b>nondestructive</b> <b>testing</b> and also military ones. A possible continuation of the project could be {{the use of the}} robot on aircraft larger than the Airbus A320. The CEO also revealed that Akka Technologies plans to work on a duo of robots for inspection: the same mobile platform for the lower parts, and a drone for the upper parts. If funding is allocated then this second phase would take place during the period 2017–2020.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or <b>nondestructive</b> <b>testing</b> methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
40|$|Constantly {{there is}} a {{necessity}} for carrying out tests on hardened concrete to determine the parameters of concrete strength in structure. Nowadays for concrete control quality <b>testing</b> <b>nondestructive</b> <b>test</b> methods are widely used. For this purpose mostly used methods are ultrasonic pulse velocity and rebound hardness by applying portable devices ultrasonic tester and Schmidt rebound hammer. Although, many such tests have been carried out, they all still lead to difficulties in interpretation of the results, because they are affected {{by a number of}} factors. During the inspections of different building objects, comprehensive information on technical condition of concrete and reinforced concrete constructions have collected, simultaneously applying the <b>nondestructive</b> <b>test</b> methods and testing specimens taken from constructions of buildings until failure. It has been defined some novelties by working with two aforesaid <b>nondestructive</b> <b>test</b> methods in conformity with determination of concrete actual strength. And namely, there are comparing dispersions of the measurement data by ultrasonic tester and Schmidt rebound hammer. Besides, compli-ance of the groups of measurement data for these testing methods to the normal distribution nature is to be related. Simultaneously it is established also how the amount of measurements affected to correlation relations between re-sults of the concrete <b>nondestructive</b> <b>test</b> methods and the strength destructive testing data. Finally, obtained test re-sults are compared to the interpretation of measuring data for concrete strength theoretical calculation by other scien-tists from countries outside the Europ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the <b>nondestructive</b> elastic-wave <b>testing</b> of {{post-tensioned}} concrete girders in a five-span road bridge built in Poland in the early 1960 s. The tests were carried out to assess the technical condition of the girders and to take a decision about the range of repairs {{to be done to}} the girders or about their strengthening. The Impact-Echo technique and ultrasonic and electromagnetic techniques (in a support role) were used in the tests. All the bridge’s 20 girders were tested. The main aim of the tests was to detect voids in the grout filling the tendon sheaths, air voids between the tendons, and zones of air gaps in concrete due to its poor compaction. The <b>nondestructive</b> <b>test</b> results and the analyses carried out on their basis, corroborated by exposures, have not been published before.

5|$|Iridium has two {{naturally}} occurring, stable isotopes, 191Ir and 193Ir, {{with natural}} abundances of 37.3% and 62.7%, respectively. At least 34 radioisotopes {{have also been}} synthesized, ranging in mass number from 164 to 199. 192Ir, which falls between the two stable isotopes, is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 73.827days, and finds application in brachytherapy and in industrial radiography, particularly for <b>nondestructive</b> <b>testing</b> of welds in steel in {{the oil and gas}} industries; iridium-192 sources have been involved in a number of radiological accidents. Three other isotopes have half-lives of at least a day—188Ir, 189Ir, and 190Ir. Isotopes with masses below 191 decay by some combination of β+ decay, α decay, and (rare) proton emission, with the exceptions of 189Ir, which decays by electron capture. Synthetic isotopes heavier than 191 decay by β− decay, although 192Ir also has a minor electron capture decay path. All known isotopes of iridium were discovered between 1934 and 2001; the most recent is 171Ir.|$|E

The first flight took place on June 12, 1994, under the command of chief test pilot John E. Cashman. This marked the start of an 11-month flight test program that was more extensive than testing for any previous Boeing model. Nine aircraft fitted with General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce engines were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at Edwards Air Force Base in California to frigid conditions in Alaska, mainly Fairbanks International Airport. To satisfy ETOPS requirements, eight 180-minute single-engine test flights were performed. The first aircraft built was used by Boeing's <b>nondestructive</b> <b>testing</b> campaign from 1994 to 1996, and provided data for the -200ER and -300 programs.
