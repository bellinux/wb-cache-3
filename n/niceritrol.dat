50|$|<b>Niceritrol</b> is a niacin {{derivative}} {{used as a}} hypolipidemic agent. It is an ester of pentaerythritol and nicotinic acid, has general properties {{similar to}} those of nicotinic acid (Nicotinamide), to which it is slowly hydrolysed. <b>Niceritrol</b> {{has been used as a}} lipid regulating drug in hyperlipidaemias and as a vasodilator in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease.|$|E
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of <b>niceritrol</b> as a lipid-lowering agent {{is limited by}} a prostaglandin-mediated flushing reaction after each dose occurring {{in the early stages}} of treatment. We have tested the effect of premedication with aspirin on the reaction to 250 mg <b>niceritrol</b> in 30 healthy male volunteers using both subjective and observed assessments of severity. Both 300 mg and 600 mg of aspirin significantly reduced the severity of flushing when compared with placebo. No significant difference was seen between the two dose levels. Prior dosing with aspirin may increase acceptability of <b>niceritrol</b> and hence improve compliance...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five hypercholesterolaemic {{patients}} from three centres in the UK were investigated {{in an open}} study of the efficacy and side effects of <b>niceritrol.</b> Five patients {{dropped out of the}} study at an early stage and had insufficient data for analysis. There were 13 males and 7 females (mean age 49. 2 years, range 18 - 69). Fourteen patients had heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, and six polygenic hypercholesterolaemia. <b>Niceritrol</b> was started at a dose of 750 mg/day and this was increased at weekly intervals over 4 weeks to the maximum tolerated dosage up to 3 g/day. This was then maintained for a further 8 weeks. There were statistically significant decreases in total plasma cholesterol, total triglyceride, LDL cholesterol and VLDL triglyceride; HDL cholesterol remained unchanged after 12 weeks of treatment (Wilcoxon matched pairs, signed ranks test). The 14 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia showed a 13. 9 % fall in total cholesterol and a 19. 8 % fall in LDL cholesterol. All patients reported flushing and some had gastrointestinal symptoms but 19 would have been prepared to continue with the therapy at doses up to 3 g/day. Thus <b>niceritrol</b> {{has been found to be}} beneficial in the treatment of both familial and polygenic hypercholesterolaemia...|$|E
40|$|Effects of lipid-lowering {{drugs on}} intermediate-density {{lipoprotein}} in uremic patientsBackgroundPatients with {{chronic renal failure}} often have alterations in lipoprotein profile including elevated very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Among these changes, raised IDL has been shown as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. There are {{a limited number of}} studies reporting pharmacological approaches to IDL reduction in a uremic population. MethodsWe therefore summarize the effects of lipid-lowering drugs on IDL levels in patients with chronic renal failure treated by hemodialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). ResultsFirst, a nicotinic acid analog <b>niceritrol</b> was given to hemodialysis patients. The drug increased HDL-cholesterol by 11 %, but the reductions in VLDL-, IDL- and LDL-cholesterol were not significant. Second, CAPD patients were treated with a fibric acid derivative clinofibrate, which was excreted mainly into bile unlike other drugs in this class. The fibrate resulted in a remarkable reduction in VLDL-triglycerides, although it did not reduce IDL-cholesterol. Finally, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) pravastatin was used in HD and CAPD patients. Pravastatin reduced IDL- and LDL-cholesterol to the same extent (by 31 %). None of these treatments caused serious adverse effects. ConclusionsWe propose that IDL is an important target in the management of uremic dyslipidemia. To date, statins {{have been shown to be}} suitable for this purpose, although it remains to be clarified whether such an intervention reduces the risk for atherosclerotic vascular events in the uremic population...|$|E
