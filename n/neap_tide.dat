25|$|The tide {{components}} with {{a period}} near twelve hours have a lunar amplitude (earth bulge/depression distances) {{that are a}} little more than twice the height of the solar amplitudes, as tabulated below. At new and full moon, the Sun and the Moon are aligned, and the lunar and the solar tidal maxima and minima (bulges and depressions) add together for the greatest tidal range at particular latitudes. At first- and third-quarter phases of the moon, lunar and solar tides are perpendicular, and the tidal range is at a minimum. The semi-diurnal tides go through one full cycle (a high and low tide) about once every 12 hours and one full cycle of maximum height (a spring and <b>neap</b> <b>tide)</b> about once every 14 days.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} what {{the profile of a}} beach looks like, one method for determination is the Emory Beach Profiling Method. Initiating a benchmark, the researcher establishes a control point to start the surveys at. Typically this is far enough away from the swash zone that large changes in elevation will not occur during the sampling time. Once the initial benchmark is established, the researcher will take the Emory sampling device and measure the change in elevation over the distance the device is covering. Then, they will pick up the device and move it to the end point of their last survey, and so on. Until they reach the shoreline.

40|$|Zooplankton {{abundance}} and community structure were recorded across small thermo-haline fronts forced by tides in {{summer in the}} subtropical Bahía Magdalena, Mexico, during spring and <b>neap</b> <b>tides.</b> During spring tides, significantly greater plankton biomass occurred along the 300 m width of the tidal front as compared to locations over the continental shelf and the inner part of the bay. Hydrographic records indicate that the tidal front was more intense during spring <b>tides</b> than during <b>neap</b> <b>tides,</b> transporting zooplankton from the continental shelf to ~ 6 km inside the bay, based on a hydroacoustic survey. Dense surface aggregations, < 15 m deep, of the temperate zone copepod Calanus pacificus occurred along the front during spring tides, which attracted zooplankton predators from throughout the water column, seabirds, and marine mammals. During <b>neap</b> <b>tides,</b> the front was weak. Contrary to expectations, zooplankton communities during <b>neap</b> <b>tides</b> along the front were similar to zooplankton in the lagoon and were composed mostly of Paracalanus spp. and Clausocalanus spp. Multivariate non-parametric analysis showed that variability of the zooplankton community was primarily related to a gradient across {{the mouth of the}} bay (continental shelf to tidal front to bay), followed by a secondary mode of variability of semi-diurnal and spring-neap tide time scales.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} phases of semidiurnal and spring-neap tidal cycles on phytoplankton and environmental drivers were evaluated in a tidal, freshwater {{location of a}} mesotidal estuary (Guadiana estuary, SW Iberia). An Eulerian approach was used and sampling covered different seasons during 2008. Samples were collected during spring and <b>neap</b> <b>tides,</b> at high tide, mid-ebb, low tide and mid-flood. Several physical-chemical variables were measured, as well as phytoplankton abundance and biomass. Salinity was higher at high-tide and suspended particulate matter was higher during spring tides and flood, due to higher vertical mixing and resuspension of bottom sediments. Chlorophyll a concentration during winter and summer <b>neap</b> <b>tides</b> was higher than during spring tides, whilst the abundance of pennate diatoms was higher during winter and Spring spring <b>tides</b> than during <b>neap</b> <b>tides,</b> probably reflecting differences in river discharge.

Steady (subtidal) vertical shear dispersion, resulting from the estuarine exchange flow, was the dominant mechanism driving the downgradient salt flux, and varied by over an order of magnitude over the spring–neap cycle, with maximum values during <b>neap</b> <b>tides</b> and minimum values during spring tides. Corresponding longitudinal dispersion rates were as big as 2500 m 2 s 1 during <b>neap</b> <b>tides.</b> The salinity intrusion was not in a steady balance during the study period. During spring tides, the oceanward advective salt flux resulting from the net outflow balanced the time rate of change of salt content landward of the study site, and salt was flushed out of the estuary. During <b>neap</b> <b>tides,</b> the landward steady shear dispersion salt flux exceeded the oceanward advective salt flux, and salt entered the estuary. Factor-of- 4 variations in the salt content occurred at the spring–neap time scale and at the time scale of variations in the net outflow. On average, the salt flux resulting from tidal correlations between currents and salinity (tidal oscillatory salt flux) was an order of magnitude smaller than that resulting from steady shear dispersion. During <b>neap</b> <b>tides,</b> this flux was minimal (or slightly countergradient) and was due to correlations between tidal currents and vertical excursions of the halocline. During spring tides, the tidal oscillatory salt flux was driven primarily by oscillatory shear dispersion, with an associated longitudinal dispersion rate of about 130 m 2 s 1. 1...|$|R
