If one phosphoserine cluster consisted of 3 phosphoserine residues, the theoretical molecular weight and volume for the <b>nanocluster</b> were estimated to be 4, 898 g/mol and 2. 88 nm 3, respectively.

40|$|Ras-induced {{senescence}} mediated through ASPP 2 {{represents a}} barrier to tumour formation. It is initiated by ASPP 2 's interaction with Ras at the plasma membrane, which stimulates the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. Ras to Raf signalling requires Ras to be organized in nanoscale signalling complexes, called <b>nanocluster.</b> We therefore wanted to investigate whether ASPP 2 affects Ras <b>nanoclustering.</b> Here we show that ASPP 2 increases the nanoscale clustering of all oncogenic Ras isoforms, H-ras, K-ras and N-ras. Structure-function analysis with ASPP 2 truncation mutants suggests that the <b>nanocluster</b> scaffolding activity of ASPP 2 converges on its α-helical domain. While ASPP 2 increased effector recruitment and stimulated ERK and AKT phosphorylation, it did not increase colony formation of RasG 12 V transformed NIH/ 3 T 3 cells. By contrast, ASPP 2 was able to suppress the transformation enhancing ability of the <b>nanocluster</b> scaffold Gal- 1, by competing with the specific effect of Gal- 1 on H-rasG 12 V- and K-rasG 12 V-nanoclustering, thus imposing ASPP 2 's ERK and AKT signalling signature. Similarly, ASPP 2 robustly induced senescence and strongly abrogated mammosphere formation irrespective of whether it was expressed alone or together with Gal- 1, which by itself showed the opposite effect in Ras wt or H-ras mutant breast cancer cells. Our results suggest that Gal- 1 and ASPP 2 functionally compete in <b>nanocluster</b> for active Ras on the plasma membrane. ASPP 2 dominates the biological outcome, thus switching from a Gal- 1 supported growth-promoting setting to a senescence inducing and stemness suppressive program in cancer cells.

Furthermore, <b>nanoclusters</b> {{can be used for}} sensing and detection applications. They are able to detect copper and mercury ions in an aqueous solution based on fluorescence quenching. Also many small molecules, biological entities such as biomolecules, proteins, DNA, and RNA can be detected using <b>nanoclusters.</b> The unique reactivity properties and the ability to control the size and number of atoms in <b>nanoclusters</b> have proven to be a valuable method for increasing activity and tuning the selectivity in a catalytic process.

50|$|Thiols. Thiol-containing small {{molecules}} {{are the most}} commonly adopted stabilizers in metal nanoparticle synthesis owing to {{the strong interaction between}} thiols and gold and silver. Glutathione {{has been shown to be}} an excellent stabilizer for synthesizing gold <b>nanoclusters</b> with visible luminescence by reducing Au3+ in the presence of glutathione with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Also other thiols such as tiopronin, phenylethylthiolate, thiolate α-cyclodextrin and 3-mercaptopropionic acid and bidentate dihydrolipoic acid are other thiolated compounds currently being used in the synthesis of metal <b>nanoclusters.</b> The size as well as the luminescence efficiency of the nanocluster depends sensitively on the thiol-to-metal molar ratio. The higher the ratio, the smaller the <b>nanoclusters.</b> The thiol-stabilized <b>nanoclusters</b> can be produced using strong as well as mild reductants. Thioled metal <b>nanoclusters</b> are mostly produced using the strong reductant sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Gold nanocluster synthesis can also be achieved using a mild reducant tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium (THPC). Here a zwitterionic thiolate ligand, D-penicillamine (DPA), is used as the stabilizer. Furthermore, <b>nanoclusters</b> can be produced by etching larger nanoparticles with thiols. Thiols can be used to etch larger nanoparticles stabilized by other capping agents. Dendrimers. Dendrimers are used as templates to synthesize <b>nanoclusters.</b> Gold <b>nanoclusters</b> embedded in poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM) have been successfully synthesized. PAMAM is repeatedly branched molecules with different generations. The florescence properties of the <b>nanoclusters</b> are sensitively dependent on the types of dendrimers used as template for the synthesis. Metal <b>nanoclusters</b> embedded in different templates show maximum emission at different wavelengths. The change in florescence property is mainly due to surface modification by the capping agents. Although gold <b>nanoclusters</b> embedded in PAMAM are blue-emitting the spectrum can be tuned from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared (NIR) region and the relative PAMAM/gold concentration and the dendrimer generation can be varied. The green-emitting gold <b>nanoclusters</b> can be synthesized by adding mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) into the prepared small gold nanoparticle solution. The addition of freshly reduced lipoic acid (DHLA) gold <b>nanoclusters</b> (AuNC@DHLA) become red-emitting fluorophores.|$|E

40|$|Currently several {{combination}} {{treatments of}} mTor- and Ras-pathway inhibitors are {{being tested in}} cancer therapy. While multiple feedback loops render these central signaling pathways robust, they complicate drug targeting. Here, we describe a novel H-ras specific feedback, which leads to an inadvertent rapalog induced activation of tumorigenicity in Ras transformed cells. We find that rapalogs specifically increase nanoscale clustering (<b>nanoclustering)</b> of oncogenic H-ras but not K-ras on the plasma membrane. This increases H-ras signaling output, promotes mammosphere numbers in a H-ras-dependent manner and tumor growth in ovo. Surprisingly, also other FKBP 12 binders, but not mTor- inhibitors, robustly decrease FKBP 12 levels after prolonged (> 2 days) exposure. This leads to an upregulation of the <b>nanocluster</b> scaffold galectin- 1 (Gal- 1), {{which is responsible for}} the rapamycin-induced increase in H-ras <b>nanoclustering</b> and signaling output. We provide evidence that Gal- 1 promotes stemness features in tumorigenic cells. Therefore, {{it may be necessary to}} block inadvertent induction of stemness traits in H-ras transformed cells by specific Gal- 1 inhibitors that abrogate its effect on H-ras <b>nanocluster.</b> On a more general level, our findings may add an important mechanistic explanation to the pleiotropic physiological effects that are observed with rapalogs...|$|R
