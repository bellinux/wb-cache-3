The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to develop new cereal-based products with increased nutritional quality by using chia and ground chia seeds (whole chia flour, semi-defatted chia flour and low-fat chia flour) in order to evaluate its potential as a bread-making ingredient. The samples with chia addition significantly increased the levels of proteins, lipids, ash and dietary fibre in the final product compared to the control sample. Breads with seeds or ground seeds showed similar technological quality to the control bread, except for the increase in specific bread volume, decrease in crumb firmness and change in crumb colour. Sensory analysis showed that the inclusion of chia increased overall acceptability by consumers. The thermal properties of the starch did not alter substantially with the inclusion of chia. However, the incorporation of chia inhibited the kinetics of amylopectin retrogradation during storage, which would be directly related to the delay in bread staling.

40|$|Novel {{microbes}} {{are either}} newly isolated genera and species from natural sources or bacterial strains derived from existing bacteria. Novel microbes are gaining increasing attention {{for the general}} aims to preserve and modify foods and to modulate gut microbiota. The use of novel microbes to improve health outcomes {{is of particular interest}} because growing evidence points to the importance of gut microbiota in human health. As well, some recently isolated microorganisms have promise for use as probiotics, although in-depth assessment of their safety is necessary. Recent examples of microorganisms calling for more detailed evaluation include Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Akkermansia muciniphila, fructophilic lactic acid bacteria (FLAB), and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. This paper discusses each candidate's safety evaluation for novel food or <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> <b>ingredient</b> approval according to European Union (EU) regulations. The factors evaluated include their beneficial properties, antibiotic resistance profiling, history of safe use (if available), publication of the genomic sequence, toxicological studies in agreement with novel food regulations, and the qualified presumptions of safety. Sufficient evidences have made possible to support and authorize the use of heat-inactivated B. xylanisolvens in the European Union. In the case of A. muciniphila, the discussion focuses on earlier safety studies and the strain's suitability. FLAB are also subjected to standard safety assessments, which, along with their proximity to lactic acid bacteria generally considered to be safe, may lead to novel food authorization in the future. Further research with F. prausnitzii will increase knowledge about its safety and probiotic properties and may lead to its future use as novel food. Upcoming changes in EUU Regulation 2015 / 2283 on novel food will facilitate the authorization of future novel products and might increase the presence of novel microbes in the food market. </p...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked {{to carry out the}} {{additional}} assessment for ‘Rooster Combs Extract’ (RCE) as a food ingredient in the context of Regulation (EC) No 258 / 97, taking into account the comments and objections of a scientific nature raised by Member States. Rooster combs extract results from a production process involving enzymatic hydrolysis of rooster combs and subsequent filtration, concentration and precipitation steps. The principle constituents of RCE are the glycosaminoglycans hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate A and dermatan sulphate. The applicant intends to add RCE to a number of dairy products with a recommended maximum intake of 80 mg RCE per portion and per day. The target population is the general population, with the exception of pregnant women, children and people with adverse reactions to sodium hyaluronate and/or avian protein. In the high intake scenario for “consumers only”, the highest daily intake would occur in adults in Belgium (0. 788 g). The highest intake scenario for “all subjects” was estimated for adolescents in Denmark (0. 427 g/day). The Panel notes that no adverse effects were observed at the highest tested dose of 600 mg/kg bw per day in a 90 -day oral toxicity study in rats. Considering the nature, the natural occurrence and previous consumption of RCE constituents, the Panel is of the opinion that the margin between the intended as well as the estimated maximum possible intake of RCE in relation to the highest dose administered to rats without adverse effects in a subchronic oral toxicity study is sufficient. The Panel concludes that the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> <b>ingredient,</b> Rooster Comb Extract, is safe under the proposed uses and use levels...|$|E
40|$|Biologically active {{peptides}} are {{of particular}} interest in food science and nutrition {{because they have been}} shown to play physiological roles, including opioid-like features, as well as immunostimulating and anti-hypertensive activities, and ability to enhance calcium absorption. Hidden or inactive in the amino-acid sequence of dairy proteins, they can be released or activated in vivo during gastrointestinal digestion, or upstream during food processing via specific, enzyme-mediated proteolysis. Caseins, in either milk or dairy products (e. g. cheese), are important sources of those peptides; their biological significance, their impact on human health and the manufacture of <b>novel</b> functional <b>food</b> <b>ingredients</b> therefrom have been subject to intensive research, which will be briefly presented and critically discussed in this review...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that the gut microbiota has a critical role in both the maintenance of human health and the pathogenesis of many diseases. Modifying the colonic microbiota using functional foods has attracted significant research effort and product development. The pioneering concept of prebiotics, as introduced by Gibson and Roberfroid in the 1990 s, emphasized the importance of diet in the modulation of the gut microbiota and its relationships to human health. Increasing knowledge of the intestinal microbiota now suggests a more comprehensive definition. This paper briefly reviews the basics of the prebiotic concept with a discussion of recent attempts to refine the concept to open the door for <b>novel</b> prebiotic <b>food</b> <b>ingredients,</b> such as polyphenols, minerals and vitamins...|$|R
40|$|In October 1995 the Council of Ministers of the European Community {{finally agreed}} a common {{position}} on a regulation on <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> and <b>food</b> <b>ingredients.</b> Environmental, organic agricultural and consumer and health concerns have been voiced over the production and marketing of genetically modified foods. Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament (EP) have disputed the regulation's scope, procedure and labelling provisions.
