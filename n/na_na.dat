500|$|The {{concerts in}} England and Ireland {{received}} mixed feedback from critics. Kitty Empire (The Observer) was not {{impressed with the}} show at Windsor Hall. Empire wrote, [...] "It's easy to sneer at boy bands, but always worth considering their appeal. It {{goes without saying that}} One Direction are slick, and often bland. With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive". For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson (Daily Mirror) gave the band a positive review. He states, [...] "The room shook with hair raising, ear drum piercing and (if there had been windows) glass-shattering screams. Each took a turn walking forward to embrace the cries from the sold-out Hammersmith Apollo while singing the lame-named <b>Na,</b> <b>Na,</b> <b>Na.</b> It was impossible to tell which one of the five boys had the biggest ovation but the loudest cheer came when Niall played acoustic guitar as they sang solo around an artificial camp fire". Another glowing review was done by Alexandra Ryan (Evening Herald) for the concert at Dublin's The O2. She says, [...] "THEY came, they saw, they conquered. Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2. Swarms of screaming girls flocked to the sold-out venue last night as Zayn, Harry, Louis, Liam and Mullingar teen Niall Horan performed for 14,000 fans".|$|E

500|$|On January 27, 1991, at a music {{industry}} {{party at the}} Po <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> Souk club in Hollywood, Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, because he felt dissatisfied with her news report about the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit {{in response to the}} incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The civil suit was settled out of court. Barnes stated that Young [...] "began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway." [...] Dr. Dre later commented [...] "People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fucks with me, I'm gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know. Ain't nothing you can do now by talking about it. Besides, it ain't no big thing – I just threw her through a door." ...|$|E
500|$|Up All Night is predominately a {{pop music}} album which orientates into {{elements}} of the dance-pop, teen pop, pop rock and power pop genres, with electropop and rock music influences. Instrumentation throughout the record is provided by guitar strings, drums and a piano. The album opens with lead single [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", an uptempo teen pop and power pop song. The opening guitar riff has been noted as {{similar to that of}} Grease single [...] "Summer Nights". [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] has a guitar-based chorus; Digital Spy's Robert Copsey likened it to a cross between Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] and McFly's [...] "All About You".

500|$|During the track, Rihanna's vocal range spans one octave, {{from the}} low note of B3 to the high note of B4. Proposing illicit acts, she uses a [...] "sexually {{aggressive}} tone" [...] in her vocal performance. The lyrics are about sex, sadomasochism, bondage and BDSM fetishes, including the sexual fantasies and turn-ons of its protagonist. The song opens with the hook, [...] "Na, <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> c'mon". During the chorus the lyrics include, [...] "'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it / Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it." [...] In the song, Rihanna describes herself as [...] "bad" [...] and openly praises her own sexual prowess; lyrics include, [...] "Sticks and stones may break my bones / But chains and whips excite me." [...] Rihanna told Spin magazine that the lyrics are metaphoric. She said that she thought the song was mainly about having confidence in one's identity, and about being impervious to rumors and criticism. According to Jake Conway of Q Magazine at Yale, the lyrics are guilty of [...] "divesting sex of emotion" [...] and re-envisaging violence as fetish; {{he went on to}} say that Rihanna pays homage to the sexual acts in an empowered dance and club mood. Chris Ryan described the song as being about [...] "dirty, naughty, illicit bedroom activities".|$|E

500|$|When Lennon {{was invited}} to play with Frank Zappa at the Fillmore (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them. Later that year, she {{released}} Fly, a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional psychedelic rock with tracks including [...] "Midsummer New York" [...] and [...] "Mind Train", {{in addition to a}} number of Fluxus experiments. [...] She also received minor airplay with the ballad [...] "Mrs. Lennon". [...] The track [...] "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)" [...] was an ode to Ono's missing daughter, and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. That same year, while studying with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Majorca, Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from his hotel. Accusations flew between the two, as well as the matter of custody. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko; Ono would not see her daughter until 1998. It was during this time that she wrote [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko", which also appears on Lennon and Ono's album Live Peace in Toronto 1969, in addition to Fly. Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of [...] "Happy Christmas (War Is Over)" [...] when Yoko whispers [...] "Happy Christmas, Kyoko", followed by Lennon whispering, [...] "Happy Christmas, Julian." [...] The song reached No. 4 in the UK, where its release was delayed until 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart. Originally a protest song about the Vietnam War, [...] "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" [...] has since become a Christmas standard. That August the couple appeared together at a benefit in Madison Square Garden with Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, and Sha <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> for mentally handicapped children organized by WABC-TV's Geraldo Rivera.|$|E

Revival television shows and boxed CD sets (e.g., DooWop Box 1–3) have kindled interest in the music, the artists, and their stories.
