40|$|Graduation date: 1983 <b>Napropamide</b> [2 -(alpha-naphthoxyl) -N,N-diethylpropionamide], a preemergence herbicide, {{is widely}} used in the United States {{on a variety of}} tree fruits, nut crops, vegetables, and mint for annual grass and {{broadleaf}} weed control. When <b>napropamide</b> has been left on the soil surface without incorporation through irrigation or mechanical means, inconsistent results have been obtained. This study was conducted (a) {{to determine the extent to}} which <b>napropamide</b> photodecomposes under field conditions, and (b) to attempt to correlate the rate of <b>napropamide</b> loss with the amount of ultraviolet radiation received at the soil surface. If successful, it would be possible to predict <b>napropamide</b> photodecomposition at various locations and times of year, and therefore take steps to avoid herbicide loss. Studies using a spectrophotometer indicated that <b>napropamide</b> absorbs light at wavelengths from 192 to 324 nm. Aqueous solutions of <b>napropamide</b> were exposed to fluorescent sun lamps for different periods of time. The ultraviolet absorption spectra of the aqueous solutions changed rapidly with time, indicating that photodecomposition was taking place. A radiometer was used in the field studies to measure cumulative energy from the sun at wavelengths from 295 to 385 nm. At various cumulative levels, the percentage of <b>napropamide</b> remaining on the soil surface was measured chemically or by bioassay to determine the correlation between <b>napropamide</b> disappearance and ultra-violet radiation received. Comparing <b>napropamide</b> loss at equal amounts of received radiation, demonstrated that <b>napropamide</b> disappeared most quickly in August, more slowly in June, and most slowly in October, indicating a poor correlation between rate of <b>napropamide</b> loss and ultraviolet radiation received. Additional soil samples were covered with a Teflon film during the study to prevent volatilization. <b>Napropamide</b> disappeared at the same rate with or without the film, indicating that volatilization was not a factor in <b>napropamide</b> loss. Soil sprayed with <b>napropamide</b> was placed in an oven, in the absence of light, at temperatures of 27 C and 60 C. No loss of <b>napropamide</b> was measured after 4 days, again indicating that volatilization was not a major factor in <b>napropamide</b> loss. Soil samples were also placed under a polycarbonate plastic which absorbed ultraviolet radiation below 385 nm. Unexpectedly, the rate of loss of <b>napropamide</b> under the polycarbonate plastic was the same as on soil exposed to full sunlight...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Control of {{competing}} vegetation {{is essential for}} the successful establish ment of tree seedlings in nurseries and direct-sown woodland; this usually requires potentially expensive hand weeding or post-sowing preemergence herbicides. In order to identify suitable herbicides, two container experiments tested the response of 12 broadleaved tree and shrub species to <b>napropamide</b> and pendimethalin applied preemergence. Most species tolerated rates adequate for controlling many annual weed species although Rhamnus cathartica L. (buckthorn) and Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. (alder) were damaged by all rates of <b>napropamide.</b> A study of application date of <b>napropamide</b> and pendimethalin applied post-sowing to Fraxinus excelsior L. (ash) in containers showed that pendimethalin was damaging if applied when seeds were germinating or seedlings emerging, but <b>napropamide</b> was tolerated at all growth stages. A field experiment tested the tolerance of ten species sown in seedbeds to <b>napropamide</b> alone and in mixture with pendimethalin. Results generally confirmed the indications of tolerance from the container experiments. Applications of 2 kg a. i. ha– 1 <b>napropamide</b> plus 2 kg a. i. ha– 1 pendimethalin appeared to be safe o...|$|E

The experiment was carried out on soil samples with organic carbon content of 12. 08 g·kg- 1, total nitrogen content of 0. 97 g·kg- 1, and pH 5. 24 with the following variable factors: (a) dose of Devrinol 450 SC formation (containing 450 g of <b>napropamide</b> in dm 3) : 0 (control), 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 -fold hold of field dose; (b) day of experiment: 1, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 112. The half-life of <b>napropamide</b> ranged from 33. 50 to 71. 42 days. The use of <b>napropamide</b> at the dose recommended by the manufacturer and at the dose reduced by half appeared to exhibit low toxicity in relation to enzymes determined.

40|$|The {{photochemical}} behaviour of the herbicide <b>napropamide</b> is studied on cellulose and silica surfaces, using steady-state and laser-flash diffuse ectance techniques. The {{results are}} used to probe how the reaction sites of the host matrices influence the photo-reactive pathways. <b>Napropamide</b> undergoes reaction when irradiated with UV (lamps) or visible (sunlight) radiation on both solid supports. The nature of the intermediates and final products depend strongly on {{the presence or absence}} of molecular oxygen. The triplet state of <b>napropamide</b> adsorbed on cellulose is detected by both time-resolved luminescence and transient absorption spectroscopies. The triplet sate was not observed on silica, but transients which include the participation of molecular oxygen are detected during. ash photolysis studies. The keto intermediates of the photo-Claisen rearrangement products are observed on both solids. Substituted 1 -naphthols from photo-Claisen reactions and 1 -naphthol are among the main reaction products. 1, 4 -Naphthoquinone is a major photoproduct in the presence of molecular oxygen and is expected to be prevalent when <b>napropamide</b> undergoes photodegradation in the environment (i. e., after being applied to plants and fields) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{chirality}} of herbicides {{has been}} the focus of research. However, there is little information on the enantioseparation of amide herbicides with different chiral elements. In this study, the need for different chiral stationary phases (CSPs), mobile phases, temperatures and flow rates for the separation of <b>napropamide,</b> acetochlor and propisochlor was discussed in detail and compared to metolachlor. Resolution of C-chiral enantiomers was easier than that of axial-chiral enantiomers. Metolachlor and acetochlor could achieve baseline separation only on AY-H and AS-H columns, respectively. Propisochlor had satisfactory separations on OD-H and AS-H columns. <b>Napropamide</b> was separated on OJ-H, AY-H and AS-H columns. Both the structures of the compounds and CSPs and the interactions between them played significant roles in the enantioseparations. Molecule dockings were also used to elucidate the separation mechanisms. C-chiral enantiomers had perfect symmetry in their optical properties, whereas the axial-chiral enantiomers did not. The elution order for <b>napropamide,</b> acetochlor and propisochlor, with a single chiral location, was R- prior to S-. These results were the first that compare the enantioseparations of four amide herbicides with different chirality, and they provided the absolute configurations for the herbicides.

Seventy-four wells were sampled in nine counties during March through June 2007. No residues of <b>napropamide</b> or oryzalin were detected {{in any of the}} wells. Since additional laboratory funding was available, each sampled well was also analyzed for the presence of triazine herbicides and degradates, with several detections reported.

Pursuant to California Food and Agricultural Code (FAC) section 13143, companies seeking to register an agricultural use pesticide containing a new AI must send DPR certain chemical and environmental fate data. If these data exceed certain key values and the pesticide label specifies certain application methods, FAC section 13144 requires DPR to add the pesticide to GWPL. GWPL is contained in the Title 3,California Code of Regulations (3 CCR) section 6800. FAC section 13148 requires DPR to monitor pesticides on GWPL to “more accurately determine the mobility and persistence of the pesticides ” and “determine if these pesticides have migrated to groundwaters of the state. ” Since 1990, DPR ha...|$|E

40|$|For {{successful}} strawberry production, {{weed control}} {{in the first four}} to six weeks after planting is essential to avoid reductions in vegetative growth and fruit yield from weed competition. The day-neutral strawberry has the potential as a commercial crop, but applied research into weed control is needed to determine tolerance to herbicides. Field experiments were conducted in 1984 and 1985 to evaluate the effects of herbicides (alone or in combination) on growth and development of two strawberry types, 'Hecker' (day-neutral) and 'Bounty' (June-bearer). All herbicide application rates are given as kilogram active ingredient per hectare (kgÂ·ha- 1). Trifluralin (1. 1, 2. 2 kgÂ·ha- 1); pendimethalin (1. 5, 3. 0 kgÂ·ha- 1); <b>napropamide</b> (4. 5 kgÂ·ha- 1) were preplant incorporated (PPI). Simazine (0. 5, 1. 0 kgÂ·ha- 1); terbacil (0. 25 / 0. 15 kgÂ·ha- 1, 0. 5 / 0. 25 kgÂ·ha- 1); metolachlor (1. 68, 2. 64 kgÂ·ha- 1), sethoxydim (0. 25, 0. 35 kgÂ·ha- 1); chloroxuron (5. 6 kgÂ·ha- 1) were applied four and eight weeks after planting, respectively. Two combinations included were trifluralin (PPI) / terbacil (POST) applied at 1. 1 / 0. 5 kgÂ·ha- 1 and <b>napropamide</b> (PPI) / sethoxydim (POST) applied at 4. 5 / 0. 25 kgÂ·ha- 1. Trifluralin applied at 2. 2 kgÂ·ha- 1, napropamide/sethoxydim (4. 5 / 0. 25 kgÂ·ha- 1), pendimethalin applied at 3. 0 kgÂ·ha- 1, chloroxuron applied at 5. 6 kgÂ·ha- 1; both rates of simazine, terbacil, metolachlor, and sethoxydim in 1984 reduced 'Hecker' fruit yield. No significant reductions in 'Hecker' fruit yield occurred in 1985 when compared to the untreated control. Trifluralin applied at 2. 2 kgÂ·ha- 1 caused reductions in Bounty fruit yield. No significant reductions in 'Hecker' runner growth occurred in 1984, however, reductions occurred in all treated plots in 1985. Significant reductions in 'Bounty' fruit yield resulted from plots treated with trifluralin applied at 2. 2 kgÂ·ha- 1. Significant reductions in 'Bounty' runner growth occurred in all treatment plots in 1984 except trifluralin/terbacil and terbacil (0. 25 / 0. 15 kgÂ·ha- 1) treatment plots. In 1985, significant reductions in runner growth resulted from <b>napropamide</b> (4. 5 kgÂ·ha- 1), napropamide/sethoxydim, and terbacil (0. 25 / 0. 15 kgÂ·ha- 1) treatments.

Weeds targeted for control were: Ipomoea hederacea L. (ivyleaf morningglory), Amaranthus hybridus L. (smooth pigweed), and Eleusine indica L. (goosegrass). Sulfentrazone alone provided 3 ̆e 69...|$|E
40|$|Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crtz.) is a cruciferous plant. As an oilseed crop {{camelina}} {{is mainly}} grown for oil production. After the 1960 s, however, the cultivation {{has become less}} important. Only in recent years, interest in this culture was awakened {{in the search for}} new sources of omega 3 fatty acids, natural antioxidants and a potential crop for the production of biofuels. The use of camelina oil for different purposes {{within the framework of the}} material use of renewable raw materials is of particular interest due to the high levels of linoleic and linolenic acid. For the establishment of camelina as a crop in agricultural crop rotation systems weed control should not be disregarded despite the rather good competitive ability against weeds. Based on greenhouse experiments a field trial in 2015 with different herbicide strategies was carried out. Besides Butisan Top (metazachlor + quinmerac), Devrinol FL (<b>napropamide)</b> and Stomp Aqua (pendimethalin) and also Betasana SC (phenmedipham) has been tested in various amounts and combinations. Using assessments to weed density and herbicide tolerance different herbicide strategies were compared with each other. Though, it is difficult to find a compromise between satisfactory herbicidal effect and a slight injury to the crop plant. The herbicide selection, the application rate and the combination of different herbicides have an effect on the crop. To confirm the data obtained further tests are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Nursery {{cultural}} practices {{have been shown}} to greatly influence the morphological and physiological condition of the seedlings- and ultimately their field performance potential. One such practice is the use of herbicides to control weeds in the nursery bed and thus reduce competition. Therefore, the use of herbicides should allow the production of better quality seedlings. However, while herbicides may control the weeds, they may also have an adverse effect {{on the quality of the}} seedlings. The phytotoxicity of most modern herbicides is caused by their disruption of plant metabolism. Herbicides disrupt plant growth and development, and occasionally lead to injury or death, depending upon the intensity of the effect. Thus it is unwise to use herbicides that damage the crop. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of herbicides used in forest nurseries on seedling quality. This project was initiated by COFORD in 1997 to address some of these problems. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.), ash (Fraxinus excelsior (L.)), beech (Fagus sylvatica (L.)), sycamore (Acerpseudoplatanus (L.)), and oak (Quercus robur (L.)) were selected as test species because they are some of the most important tree species used in Irish forestry today. The objectives of the study were: To examine the efficacy of the herbicides oxadiazone, isoxaben, metazachlor, propyzamide, haloxyfop/isoxaben mixture, oxyflurofen, <b>napropamide,</b> simazine, and prometryn, in controlling weeds in a forest nursery; To study the seasonal effects of these herbicides on the morphology of ash, oak, beech, sycamore, and Sitka spruce seedlings...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBuffer zones such as {{ponds and}} ditches {{are used to}} reduce {{field-scale}} losses of pesticides from subsurface drainage waters to surface waters. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the efficiency of these buffer zones, in particular constructed wetlands, focusing specifically on sorption processes. We modelled the sorption processes of three herbicides [2 -methyl- 4 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -MCPA), isoproturon and napropamide] and three fungicides (boscalid, prochloraz and tebuconazole) on four substrates (two soils, sediment and straw) commonly found in a pond and ditch in Lorraine (France). A wide range of Freundlich coefficient (K (fads)) values was obtained, from 0. 74 to 442. 63 mg(1 -aEuro parts per thousand n) L (n) kg(- 1), and the corresponding K (foc) values ranged from 56 to 3, 725 mg(1 -aEuro parts per thousand n) L (n) kg(- 1). Based on potential retention, the substrates may be classified as straw >> sediments > soils. These results show the importance of organic carbon content and nature in the process of sorption. Similarly, the studied pesticides could be classified according to their adsorption capacity as follows: prochloraz >> tebuconazole-boscalid > <b>napropamide</b> >> MCPA-isoproturon. This classification is strongly influenced by the physico-chemical properties of pesticides, especially solubility and K (oc). Straw exhibited the largest quantity of non-desorbable pesticide residues, from 12. 1 to 224. 2 mg/L for all pesticides. The presence of plants could increase soil-sediment sorption capacity. Thus, establishment and maintenance of plants and straw filters should be promoted to optimise sorption processes and the efficiency of ponds and ditches in reducing surface water pollution...|$|E
40|$|A two-factorial field {{experiment}} should reveal {{the performance of}} Clearfield® oilseed rape under different cropping intensities. The experiment was conducted at the experimental station Ihinger Hof in 2014, with cropping intensity as factor 1 and herbicide strategy as factor 2, all treatments sown with variety PT 228 CL. Treatments of cropping intensities were “normal sowing” (NS; soil inversion tillage tillage, 50 seeds m- 2, 12 cm row spacing), “reduced sowing density” (DS; soil inversion tillage, 25 seeds m- 2, 25 cm row spacing) and striptill (ST; 25 seeds m- 2, 25 cm row spacing). The two herbicide strategies were pre-emergence strategy (VAS; application of Colzor® Trio (30 g L- 1 Clomazone, 187. 5 g L- 1 Dimethachlor, 187. 5 g L- 1 <b>Napropamide)</b> one day after sowing and of Agil® S (100 g/L Propaquizafop) 3. 5 weeks after sowing) and Clearfield® strategy (CLS; application of Clearfield®-Vantiga® (375 g L- 1 Metazachlor, 125 g L- 1 Quinmerac, 6. 25 g L- 1 Imazamox) and Dash® E. C. (345 g L- 1 fatty acid methyl ester, 205 g L- 1 fatty alcohol alkoxylates, 46 g L- 1 oleic acid) at {{the same day as}} Agil® S). NS resulted in the highest yield (3. 9 t ha- 1) which was significantly more than obtained by ST (3. 6 t ha- 1), the least-yielding intensity. There were no significant interactions of the effects. Weed density was highest in DS/CLS and ST/CLS with 12. 8 and 13. 9 plants m- 2, respectively, and thus the two to threefold of the other treatments. The results indicate a lack of efficacy of Clearfield®-Vantiga® under the presumably higher weed pressure in DS and ST, specifically in controlling the weeds Stellaria media and volunteer cereals (in this case: Hordeum vulgare). An economic evaluation will follow...|$|E
40|$|The runoff {{of thirty}} turf {{herbicides}} commonly used on lawns, parks, and golf course fairways and greens throughout the United States was simulated using the TurfPQ model. The model {{was used to}} obtain ninety nine years of daily water input, water runoff, and herbicide runoff for ten locations: Boston, MA, Charlotte, NC, Denver, CO, Houston, TX, Indianapolis, IN, Jacksonville, FL, Los Angeles, CA, Minneapolis, MN, Portland, OR, and Wichita, KS. Results were summarized as mean annual herbicide runoff loads (g/ha), extreme event herbicide runoff loads corresponding to a 20 year return period (g/ha), mean herbicide runoff {{as a percentage of}} annual application, extreme event herbicide runoff as a percentage of annual application, mean annual water input (mm), and mean annual water runoff (mm). Urban areas that produced the highest herbicide runoff loads based on surface runoff were Boston, Charlotte, Houston, Indianapolis, and Jacksonville. Mean annual runoff loads did not surpass 3. 4 % of the annual herbicide application with most instances considerably less than 1 %. Extreme event runoff loads did not surpass 9 % of the annual herbicide application but were highly variable and appear to have been very dependent on both location and herbicide. The runoff loads of atrazine, bensulide, DSMA, ethofumesate, <b>napropamide,</b> pendimethalin, and siduron were the largest per hectare. Siduron has the most massive runoff load, which is mainly due to the large amount of the herbicide that is applied annually. Herbicides whose runoff loads contained 3. 5 % or more of the applied annual amount in one or more simulated event include 2, 4 -D, atrazine, bentazon, dicamba, ethofumesate, halosulfuron, imazaquin, MCPA, MCPP, quinclorac, siduron, simazine, and triclopyr. These herbicides have the most potential for surface runoff in extreme events. A common factor for these herbicides was low organic carbon partition coefficient values...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to obtain and interpret field data related to the establishment of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) plantings, as well as examine the impact of conventional weed management practices on yield components and weed control. Integrated weed management, recently recognized by weed scientists as a desired goal for research and extension, is an important part of current cranberry production. This research was designed to permit the incorporation of the collected data into practical grower recommendations, as well as to expand our general knowledge about invasion ecology and plant species composition in new and established commercial plantings. ^ Data from four years of repeat annual applications of 0, 1. 8, and 4. 5 kg ai/ha dichlobenil in low-weed and high-weed density areas indicated minimal negative impact on cranberry vines. Herbicide application did not adversely affect upright productivity, biomass, fruit set, or other yield parameters; in addition, no improvements for these parameters were noted. No consistent treatment effect on cranberry root length was seen. The presence of weeds, rather than herbicide application, was the important determinant of yield. Vines in low-weed density areas produced more marketable fruit and had higher percentage fruit set than vines growing in high-weed density areas. Results suggest that repeat annual applications of dichlobenil to commercial cranberry beds may be considered as part of a viable integrated weed management program with no adverse effect on crop growth or yield. ^ One specific goal of this research was to identify the most beneficial combination of nitrogen rate, vine planting density, and weed management option that would promote quick and economical vine establishment of the cultivar, Stevens, while providing adequate and cost-effective weed control. After two years, several treatment combinations seemed promising for commercial implementation. However, the most cost-effective production scheme for establishing a new planting was to plant vines at a low density, use moderate rates of nitrogen, and apply a yearly application of <b>napropamide</b> for weed control. This combination produced substantial vine coverage at very low cost, reduced weed biomass by 85 % compared to the untreated plots, and gave the best control per dollar spent. ...|$|E
