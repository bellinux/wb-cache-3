5|$|Because of its {{position}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the River Parrett, and the constantly shifting sands of the Bristol Channel, {{there has always}} been a significant risk to shipping in the area. As a result, several lighthouses, have been built.|$|E

5|$|The spermatophores usually remain {{embedded}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the female. Mating usually occurs {{well before}} spawning, {{but may also}} happen on the spawning grounds themselves. In those cases, the male will stay near the female's side as she lays eggs.|$|E

5|$|From Puerto de Caballos, Gil González sailed west {{along the}} coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish {{settlement}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Río Dulce, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men {{under the command of}} Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east {{along the coast}} to a point east of the Cape of Honduras (near modern Trujillo). From there he marched inland in search of a route to the Pacific. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon searched of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Dulce River.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, {{the bridge}} was renamed DuSable Bridge in honor of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, Chicago's first {{permanent}} resident.

5|$|Much of Harveys Creek is in a forested gorge, {{which is}} {{situated}} in its lower reaches. The upper reaches of its watershed contain swamps and glacial lakes. The cliffs of Tilbury Knob are also situated <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the creek. The creek's source is in Harveys Lake, {{which is the largest}} natural lake in Pennsylvania. It flows in a generally southward direction.|$|E

5000|$|A few sawmills {{were located}} along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> rivers and streams, which {{were used for}} rafting logs to the mills.

5|$|The first schoolhouse in {{the lower}} part of Plymouth Township was built by Jameson Harvey <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Harveys Creek in 1834. The first mill in Lehman Township was built on the creek in 1837. In 1849, Johnathan Williams {{constructed}} a small mill on the creek. In 1869, a mining disaster occurred at the Avondale Mine just east of Harveys Creek. This event killed 108 people.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Toby Creek {{is predominantly}} rural. Most of it (61.3 percent) is forested land. Considerably less common are grassland (19.6 percent) and urban land (16.4 percent). A total of 2.1 {{percent of the}} creek's watershed consists of wetlands and 0.6 percent consists of mining lands. The mining land is confined to one area <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the creek.|$|E
50|$|Tomiyamichthys russus, {{also known}} as the Ocellated shrimpgoby is a species of goby native to the South China Sea where it can be found on silty bottoms at depths of from 1 to 5 m, often <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> streams.|$|R

50|$|Emmerson Island is {{a member}} of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the {{territory}} of Nunavut.

5|$|There was {{historically}} {{a village}} of the Delaware tribe <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Mahoning Creek. The first people of European descent arrived {{in the area in}} the 1760s and 1770s. Various mills were constructed on it in the 1700s and 1800s. Numerous bridges have also been constructed across the creek. Part of the creek is in the Montour Ridge Landscape Corridor.|$|E
5|$|Thwarted in the east, Attalus {{now turned}} his {{attention}} westward. Perhaps because {{of concern for the}} ambitions of Philip V of Macedon, Attalus had sometime before 219BC become allied with Philip's enemies the Aetolian League, a union of Greek states in Aetolia in central Greece, having funded the fortification of Elaeus, an Aetolian stronghold in Calydonia, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river Acheloos.|$|E
5|$|A nearby village, Niguili, {{was located}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Aliso Creek likely near the {{confluence}} of Aliso and Sulphur Creeks. Present-day Laguna Niguel {{takes its name from}} this settlement. The Acjachemen were renamed the Juaneño by Spanish priests in the 18th century, who established a mission at the present-day location of San Juan Capistrano. Following the Spanish arrival, most Juaneño clustered around the mission in the south. Like many other once widespread Juaneño villages, Niguili was likely abandoned soon after, and there is no trace of it remaining.|$|E
25|$|All colonial {{cities were}} founded <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> rivers. St. Augustine was founded where the Matanzas Inlet {{permitted}} {{access to the}} Matanzas River.

50|$|Bonneville {{cutthroat}} trout primarily eat other fish, while smaller individuals {{and to a}} lesser extent adults consume a lot of insects and various benthic organisms. They spawn <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> streams over gravel substrate in the springtime, having an incubation period of 24 to 25 days.|$|R
50|$|Brackish marshes develop by salt marshes where a {{significant}} freshwater influx dilutes the seawater to brackish levels of salinity. This commonly happens upstream from salt marshes by estuaries of coastal rivers or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> <b>of</b> coastal rivers with heavy freshwater discharges in {{the conditions of}} low tidal ranges.|$|R
5|$|Approximately 24percent of the creek's {{watershed}} {{contains the}} Wellsboro-Oquaga-Morris series. The series {{is made of}} Wellsboro soils, Oquaga soils, and some Morris soils. This type of soil series is most common near the creek's source. Another twenty-four percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed {{is made up of}} the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series. This soil series tends to occur on hillsides near streams. The Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series occurs quite <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Nescopeck Creek, with a large patch further upstream, and a small patch in the southwestern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|At its {{southern}} end <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps {{provide access to}} {{the section of the}} Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Somme. This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E
