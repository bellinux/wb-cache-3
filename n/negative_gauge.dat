25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be <b>negative,</b> but <b>gauge</b> pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|R
50|$|Vapor lock was {{far more}} common in older {{gasoline}} fuel systems incorporating a low-pressure mechanical fuel pump driven by the engine, located in the engine compartment and feeding a carburetor. Such pumps were typically located higher than the fuel tank, were directly heated by the engine and fed fuel directly to the float bowl inside the carburetor. Fuel was drawn under <b>negative</b> pressure (<b>gauge</b> pressure) from the feed line, increasing {{the risk of a}} vapor lock developing between the tank and pump. A vapor lock being drawn into the fuel pump could disrupt the fuel pressure long enough for the float chamber in the carburetor to partially or completely drain, causing fuel starvation in the engine. Even temporary disruption of fuel supply into the float chamber is not ideal; most carburetors are designed to run at a fixed level of fuel in the float bowl and reducing the level will reduce the fuel to air mixture delivered to the engine.|$|R
50|$|Similar to a gravity bong, a {{waterfall}} bong utilizes both {{a bottle and}} a cap or screen rigged over the bottle's mouth to hold cannabis. In this case, however, the bottle—which has one or several holes drilled near or at the bottom—is either filled with water or placed in a larger container filled with water before the cannabis is packed. The holes are then uncovered, or the bottle is simply raised from the container, evacuating the water either onto the ground or back into the container. When heat {{is applied to the}} drug, the resultant smoke is forced into the bottle with <b>negative</b> <b>gauge</b> pressure, as with the gravity bong. Once the water is evacuated, the smoke can be inhaled from the bottle. Variations on this concept are also used.|$|E
50|$|A gravity bong (also {{known as}} a grav, bucket, submarine, geeb, or GB) is a {{hydropneumatic}} device used for smoking cannabis. One variant consists of {{a bucket of water}} in which is typically placed a bottle with the bottom cut off, such as a 2-litre PET soft drink bottle. Some kind of cap or screen is rigged over the mouth of the bottle and filled with hash or cannabis. A flame is then held near enough to heat the drug while the bottle is slowly raised out of the water, creating a <b>negative</b> <b>gauge</b> pressure inside the bottle, drawing smoke from the heated cannabis—along with air—into the vacuum. The cap or screen is removed once the bottle is almost full, the user's mouth is placed over the mouth of the bottle and the bottle pushed back down into the water, causing the pressure to rise and forcing the smoke into the lungs. There are many variants on this basic premise, such as using a large water cooler tank in lieu of a soft drink bottle.|$|E
40|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>gauge</b> {{pressure}} {{appears in}} the helium suction line {{during the period of}} compressor starting up. The negative pressure induces the risk of air leakage into the cryogenic system and the damage to the burst disk of cryostat. A buffer tank is connected to the suction line to avoid the <b>negative</b> <b>gauge</b> pressure. Variation of nitrogen pressure changes the thermal-shielding temperature of the cavity cryostat and thus changes the length and frequency of the cavity. A phase separator with pressure control is installed before the cryostat to isolate the fluctuation of nitrogen pressure at the source side and prevent the trip of electron beam due to the frequency change or the overpressure at the cavity side. The stability improvement after usage of the phase separator shows that variation of the nitrogen pressure to the cavity cryostat is reduced from + 0. 6 /- 0. 4 bar to +/- 0. 08 bar and the drift of nitrogen pressure is eliminated. The stability after usage of the buffer tank shows that the <b>negative</b> <b>gauge</b> pressure is avoided in the suction line and the peak pressure was reduced from 1. 4 bar to 1. 2 bar...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} sustainability of internet usage. It {{is based on the}} study on Internet usage among Malay youths in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. The objectives of the study are to determine the factors which have positive and negative effects on sustainable usage of the Internet with respect to Malay youths and to identify the predictor factors for sustainability of Internet usage among Malay youths. This study is based on a model derived from diffusion of innovation theory, i. e. the innovation decision process model, by Rogers (2001). To determine sustainability, four variables were used viz. indispensability, relevance, gratification and beneficial. Six factors were used to measure their effects, either positive or negative, on sustainability of Internet usage. Communication channels, perceived and realized benefits and interpersonal and social network were the factors used to gauge positive effects on sustainability of Internet usage, while security concern and interruptions, moral issues and cost of maintenance and computer upgrade were used to <b>gauge</b> <b>negative</b> effects. This study used the survey research for obtaining data. Some 225 respondents were sampled from the Malays in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. They were interviewed using a standard questionnaire. Inferential statistics comprising multiple regression were used to analyse the data. The results of the study showed that Interpersonal and social network and perceived and realized benefits have significant positive effects on sustainability of Internet usage. The results also showed that issues relating to security concerns and interruptions have significant negative effect on the sustainability of Internet usage. Therefore, the factors which affect sustainability of usage should be given priority in the implementation of Internet and ICT related projects...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} introduces {{three sections}} on giving, employing {{a variety of}} methods in different environments to investigate giving. The first section, utilizes a simple incentivized game to assess differences in risk-sharing norms across communities. In the game, subjects decide whether to share resources with anonymous group members who have lost a lottery where everyone in the group has the same potential for a positive or <b>negative</b> outcome. To <b>gauge</b> the impact of formal institutions on informal risk sharing, subjects make a second sharing decision; but this time they have the opportunity to purchase simple insurance, which guarantees a positive outcome. I found that insurance crowds out informal risk sharing; the amount people share decreases significantly when self-insurance is offered, no matter whether the decision maker chooses to insure. The second section, studies the effects of successful fundraising campaigns on individuals? philanthropic behavior. We investigate the source of funds that are raised in successful campaigns. Using a controlled lab experiment, we ask whether new funds are raised, or if individuals merely redirect funds from contributions to other organizations following a successful campaign. The results show that a successful campaign increases funds raised by the charity. However, the increase in giving to the target charity comes entirely {{at the expense of the}} other charities. This provides strong evidence for a ?crowding-out? effect for targeted campaigns. My third and final section, investigates cooperation, giving, and the effect of punishment in two simple games, the trust game and the public goods game. Notably, the paper examines the puzzle presented by past experimental results of punishment effects in the games. Punishment increases contributions in the public good game, while decreasing cooperation in the trust game. To test the effect of punishment on various sets of game parameters, subjects play modified versions of the two games. By observing the differences in contributions with and without punishment, I find design features are not related to the different effects of punishment...|$|R

5000|$|Miller, et al. (2013) {{focused their}} study on {{emerging}} adults and their reactance to persuasive appeals, as {{research has demonstrated}} that this population is in a transitional stage in life (Voyer et al., 2005) {{and are more likely to}} defend their behavioral freedoms if they feel others are attempting to control their behavior (Grandpre et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2006). Populations in transitional stages rely on source credibility as a major proponent of cognitive processing and message acceptance. If the message is explicit and threatens their perceived freedoms, transitional-stage populations will most likely derogate the source and dismiss the message. Two important needs for reactance to a threatened freedom from an emerging adult population is immediacy and vested interest (Crano, 1995). Their study discusses how emerging adults need to believe their behavioral freedoms, for which they have vestedness, are being threatened and that the threat exists in real time with almost immediate consequences. Threats that their perceived freedoms will be eliminated or minimized increases motivation to restore that freedom or possibly engage in the threatened behavior to reinforce their autonomy and control of their attitudes and actions. The study also surmises that threat does not necessarily need anger to motivate counterargumentation and simply attempting to provoke anger through manipulation is limited as a technique of <b>gauging</b> <b>negative</b> cognitions. Miller, et al. (2013) also consider refutational preemption as motivation for producing initial counterarguments and provocation of dissension when contemplating the attack message (Miller et al., 2013). The main focus of this study is to determine how to improve the effectiveness of the inoculation process by evaluating and generating reactance to a threatened freedom by manipulating explicit and implicit language and its intensity. While most inoculation studies focus on avoiding reactance, or at the very least, minimizing the impact of reactance on behaviors, in contrast, Miller, et al. (2013) chose to manipulate reactance by designing messages to enhance resistance and counterarguing output.|$|R
40|$|Background It is {{predicted}} {{that the end of}} the Multi-Fibre Agreement (2005) and consequent competition from the Far East will be detrimental to the European Textile and Fashion Industry. Discussion about standardisation of garment sizes has led to debate over bespoke clothing. (Berry, 2000) Research in the USA reveals that larger sized consumers seek better fitting, comfortable clothing; customisation’s underlying principle. (Berry, 2000) It is possible that the declining British knitting industry (Orton, Gurdeep and Courtney, 2004) can move into associated niche markets. The ‘outsize’ clothing market is expanding; currently twenty four million adult Britons are overweight, whereas in 1980 only 2. 5 million were classed as such. (Laurance, 2004) The average British woman has a proportionally larger stomach and waist than her 1950 ’s counterpart, and is a size 16. Paradoxically, women of size 16 and above find clothes shopping frustrating, humiliating and fruitless. (Shabi, 2004) This contiguity presents an interesting and novel area of investigation. UK consumers spend £ 23 billion a year on clothing, when viewed in the context that two thirds of British women are overweight (Laurance, 2004), a picture develops of a dissatisfied yet growing market. Aims and Outcomes Is the primary value of knitted fabric on larger bodies its inherent stretch? This research questions whether such a method of achieving fit is satisfactory by exploring shaping methods in combination with direct body shape data. It also challenges the ‘norm’ of the size 12 woman, (disproved by SizeUK findings) and the horror of fat which is demonstrated from haute couture (Evans, 2003, p 85 - 96) to the high street (Shabi, 2004). Outcomes are anticipated to include creating a vocabulary common to both designers and technicians, thereby enabling the production of bespoke knitwear for larger women. Methodology Case study, qualitative methodologies allow multi-method, reflexive and evolving research within a selected participant group, whilst siting the question in its real-world setting. (Marshall and Rossman, 1999) A pilot study has commenced, the results of which will be available by June 2005. An electronic survey, derived from the Heath Carter endomorphic somatotypes, (Carter, 1980) is gathering additional body shape information. Measuring Measuring the body is by traditional methods and exact body ‘clones’ of the participants facilitate experiments. Measurements are between pre-established landmarks; <b>negative</b> spaces are <b>gauged</b> and stance documented, establishing the body’s proportional girth and silhouette. Drawings, photographs and video provide a visual record and data for knit prototyping. Knitting Samples are knitted on a 12 gge Shima Seiki 102 ff machine and SDS 1 system at the University of Brighton. This versatility pursues a thread of the research; enabling bespoke knitwear through a dynamic, digital relationship with the consumer. Consistency of yarn is established, which pre-supposes the price point of custom made knitwear will initially justify a quality fibre. (Berry, 2000). Single jersey is the selected structure; it is supple and not as complex to ‘read’ as other structures when shaped around the body. Purl fabric constructions provide permanent surface-pattern-to-stitch ratios to show distortion. (Smirfitt, 1975), (Spencer, 1983) Narrowing, increasing, stitch quality, gathering, progressive doubling and flèchage will add three dimensional shape. Tests of knitted shapes on the body will make particular note of wrinkling, strain, bulk, flare and drape. Conclusion Relationships between body shape and fabric is currently found to be the most contentious over protruding parts of the body, specifically bust, hips, stomach and particularly around the shoulders. Space between body and knitting over concave body areas is directly influenced by the degree of ease introduced elsewhere. The investigation of ease and its application to specific areas represents the ongoing practical content of the research. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{vortex tube}} (VT) {{is a simple}} and useful fluid dynamic device, used to obtain both cold and hot flows from {{compressed}} gas at room temperature. It can produce a cold flow measuring around — 30 'C, and a hot flow of up to around 130 'C. Until now, the theory and model analysis of the energy/temperature separation inside of VT is proposed {{by a number of}} researchers. From those theories, it is generally accepted that the generation of the cold flow is caused by an adiabatic expansion, which occur after a compressed gas flows through an inlet nozzle. However, details about the physics of the cold flow generation, from the fluid dynamics view point still remain unclear. The objective {{of this study is to}} clarify the energy separation mechanism (ESM) of VT. Therefore, in order to accomplish this objective, experimental and analytical studies were carried out. In order to clarify the flow structure of the cold exit flow, the total temperature and Pitot pressure of a cold flow center were measured. In addition, two simple flow visualization techniques were used to observe the reversed flow at the cold exit. The mixing temperature of cold and hot flows were also measured to clarify the performance of VT used in this research. In Chapter 1, the basic idea about a VT, such as its history, the types, the example of usage, and the advantages/disadvantages of a VT is introduced. A proposed flow pattern inside a Counter-flow VT is also explained. In the literature section, the researches on the geometrical optimization of the VT, and the flow pattern inside a VT are included with a discussion on the contrary points of the researches. The objectives of this thesis are also described in this chapter. Chapter 2 describes the experimental apparatus and procedures of the total temperature/pressure measurement methods, and the flow visualization techniques. The specifications of the equipment and measurement devices are shown in this chapter. There are two simple flow visualization techniques. Both techniques use needle and oil paint droplet. The first technique uses an oil paint droplet, on a 0. 75 mm-diameter needle. The oil paint droplet on the needle is positioned along the centerline of the cold flow. The movement of the oil paint droplet represents the flow direction of the cold flow. Another technique uses a 0. 70 mm-diameter needle with 10 small holes which can exudate colored oil (exudation needle). The exudation needle is inserted into the cold flow along the centerline. Then the colored oil is injected to the exudation needle little by little and exuded from the small holes. The flow direction of the colored oil on the exudation needle represents the flow direction of the cold flow. In Chapter 3, the development of total temperature probe with the objective and structure of the probe is explained. Those probes are named as Type 1, 2, and 3. An evaluation experiment is conducted using the Type 1, 2, and 3 to determine the effects of probe angle along the centerline of a sonic jet nozzle on the measurement accuracy. Results show that the largest measurement error for Type 1, 2, and 3 are — 1. 3 °C, — 1. 1 °C, and — 0. 7 °C, respectively. From these results, the effect of the angle of the thermocouple on the total temperature measurement is negligibly small. Chapter 4 reports the results of total temperature/pressure measurements and flow visualization at cold exit. The experiments of the effects of the cold fraction on the measurement were carried out with the Type 3 total temperature probes and Pitot pressure probe. From the results, a <b>negative</b> and positive <b>gauge</b> pressure regions are measured. It implies the possibility of a direct/reversed flow at the cold exit. To clarify the flow direction, two kinds of flow visualization are conducted. The flow direction of the cold flow is determined by the movement of the oily paint droplet. From the results, a reversed flow is observed around the center of cold exit at a smaller cold fraction. The length of reversed flow increases as the cold fraction decreases, which implies the decrease in the pressure at the core of the vortex chamber. A lower pressure in the vortex chamber means a lower static/total temperatures at the core of vortex chamber and a higher static/total temperatures at the outer region of the vortex in the vortex chamber. This is the effect of cold fraction on the EMS at an arbitrary inlet pressure. When the inlet pressure increases at an arbitrary cold fraction, the tangential velocity increases, which results in a lower static/total temperatures at the core of the vortex chamber and a higher static/total temperatures at the outer region of the vortex in the vortex chamber. Chapter 5 describes a mathematical model analysis of compressible vortex flow with a review of some literatures. The basic equations, the laminar vortex solutions, turbulent vortex solutions, and problems with VAB model are explained. The improvement of the VAB model is conducted by replacing the laminar Prandtl number with a laminar plus turbulent Prandtl numbers. The results show that the total temperature is roughly independent of the summation of laminar and turbulent Prandtl numbers. The EMS in a turbulent compressible vortex is discussed and proposed, by examining the VAIB model. The results show that a hotter gas in the peripheral region of the vortex is mainly caused by heat generated by viscous dissipation, and colder gas in the vortex core is mainly generated by viscous shear work done on the surface of the fluid element to the surrounding gas. Finally, the conclusions of this study based on the implementation of objectives are summarized in Chapter 6...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} supersymmetric compactifications of type IIB and weakly coupled heterotic string-theory in {{the presence}} of G resp. H-flux and various nonperturbative effects. We point out that non-perturbative effects change the Hodge structure of the allowed fluxes in type IIB significantly. In the heterotic case it is known that, in contrast to the potential read off from dimensional reduction, the effective four-dimensional description demands for consistency a non-vanishing H 2, 1 component, once a non-trivial H 3, 0 component balances the gaugino condensate. The H 2, 1 causes classically (but not when non-perturbative effects are included) a non-Kähler compactification geometry whose moduli space is, however, poorly understood. We show that the occurrence of H 2, 1 could be avoided with worldsheet instantons by using a KKLT-like two-step procedure for moduli stabilization. Moreover, heterotic moduli stabilization under the inclusion of one-loop corrections to the gauge kinetic function led to <b>negative</b> <b>gauge</b> couplings and a corresponding strong coupling transition. This problem disappears, as well, when world-sheet instantons are included. They stabilize moreover the Kähler modulus without the need for a non-Kähler geometry with non-trivial dJ...|$|E
