2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War and {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union, Sweden dropped its {{official}} policy of military [...] neutrality, but continued to behave as a neutral and <b>non-aligned</b> <b>country.</b> [...] In 1995 Sweden joined the European Union (but declined Eurozone membership) and has since the mid-1990s continued to reduce its armed forces and became involved in more international missions in countries like Bosnia and Afghanistan. The continued reduction of its own national defence and {{the question of whether the}} country really could defend itself against an aggressor has led to some criticism.|$|E
2500|$|Swedish {{neutrality}} {{refers to}} Sweden's former policy of neutrality in armed conflicts, {{which was in}} effect from the early 19th century, until 2009, when Sweden entered into various mutual defence treaties with the EU, and other Nordic countries. [...] In 2016 Sweden became a [...] "NATO Affiliate" [...] (not member), and signed a treaty allowing NATO operations to take place within the country's borders. [...] Sweden's previous neutrality policy had originated {{largely as a result}} of Sweden's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars during which over a third of the country's territory was lost, including the traumatic loss of Finland to Russia. Resentment towards the old king precipitated a coup d'état and the new regime formulated a new foreign policy which became known as The Policy of 1812. Since the time of the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden has not initiated any direct armed combat. However, Sweden's military and government have been involved in major peacekeeping actions and other military support functions around the world. The accession to the European Union in 1995 meant that neutrality as a principle was abolished. Sweden is still today a neutral and <b>non-aligned</b> <b>country</b> in regard to foreign and security policy. However, it maintains strong links to NATO.|$|E

50|$|The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) was {{a socialist}} country {{that existed in}} the second half of the 20th century.

However, since it was a <b>non-aligned</b> <b>country,</b> it had no ties to the Soviet Bloc either.

50|$|It is {{historically}} {{understood that the}} USSR did intercept the Apollo missions telemetry on {{the territory of the}} USSR, but until 2005, no source in the former USSR military or intelligence services has come forth with any evidence of this happening. The USSR used different frequency bands for its own space missions, so by default its deep space network did not readily have equipment able to receive Apollo telemetry. Whether China or any other non-Western (or <b>non-aligned)</b> <b>country</b> at the time chose to intercept any of the Apollo telemetry is unclear. Amateur radio and affiliated telecommunications sector persons could listen to the Apollo telemetry the world over—provided they could afford the reception equipment.|$|E

Though Tanzania was <b>Non-Aligned</b> <b>country,</b> it {{was practicing}} socialism. The {{country has been}} operating under one-party system since 1965 when opposition parties were abolished. Following the perestroika and fall of communism in the USSR during the late 1980s, many countries including Tanzania changed not only economic systems but also political systems. Tanzania resumed use of a multi-party system in 1992 and to date has 20 registered political parties. In the 1990s, Globalization led many African countries, including Tanzania to change their political systems from one-party system to multiparty system. For twenty years since Tanzania changed to multiparty system, very little or no positive changes in the government accountability has been noticed that would have helped to alleviate poverty at household level.|$|E

5000|$|Kozak wrote several {{plays on}} the issue of revolution, revolutionary terror, and the {{relation}} between power and personal integrity. The themes of his plays were all highly controversial for the communist regime.

Since Yugoslavia was a <b>non-aligned</b> <b>country</b> at the time, criticism of Stalinism or other [...] "deviant" [...] forms of socialism was generally permitted. His best-known play is [...] "The Affair" [...] (Afera), set during the anti-Fascist resistance in Northern Italy, but in fact a metaphorical account of the trial against the dissident Jože Pučnik. In the play [...] "Dialogues" [...] (Dialogi), set in an anonymous Eastern European country, Kozak described the paranoic atmosphere of the Stalinist show trials. The play [...] "Congress" [...] (Kongres) deals with ideological struggles at the university and student protests.

(Taiwan): President Lee Teng-hui issued a statement on 4 June strongly condemning the mainland Chinese response: [...] "Early this morning, Chinese communist troops finally used military force to attack the students and others demonstrating peacefully for democracy and freedom in Tiananmen Square in Peking, resulting in heavy casualties and loss of life. Although we anticipated this mad action of the Chinese communists beforehand, it still has moved us to incomparable grief, indignation and shock." [...] The authorities also lifted a ban on telephone communications to encourage private contacts and counter the news blackout on the mainland.: Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, {{speaking on behalf of}} the Cabinet, said they were shocked and saddened by the response of the Chinese government, adding that [...] "we had expected the Chinese government to apply the doctrine of minimum force when an army is used to quell civil disorder.": General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev did not explicitly condemn the actions, but called for reform. There was an interest on building relations on a recent summit in Beijing, but the events fueled discussion on human rights and Soviet foreign policy. There was some private criticism of the Chinese response. Newly formed opposition groups condemned the military action. Ten days after the incident the government expressed regret, calling for political dialogue. Public demonstrations occurred at the Chinese embassy in Moscow. A spokesman on 10 June said the Kremlin was [...] "extremely dismayed" [...] at the incident.: The Foreign Ministry expressed [...] "grave concern" [...] and hoped for no further deterioration of the situation. The statement also encouraged dialogue to resolve the issue peacefully.: The Swedish government froze diplomatic relations with China.: The Thai government had the warmest relations with Beijing out of all ASEAN members, and expressed confidence that the [...] "fluid situation" [...] in China had passed its [...] "critical point", though it was concerned that it could delay a settlement in the Cambodian-Vietnamese War.: The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, expressed [...] "utter revulsion and outrage", and was [...] "appalled by the indiscriminate shooting of unarmed people." [...] She promised to relax immigration laws for Hong Kong residents.: The United States Congress and media criticized the military action. President George H. W. Bush suspended military sales and visits to that country. Large scale protests against the Chinese government took place around the country.

Media reported on the protests but offered no commentary, and state radio added that the PLA could not have stopped the action after [...] "hooligans and ruffians insulted or beat up soldiers" [...] and destroyed military vehicles.
