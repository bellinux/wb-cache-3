It is my understanding that, in law, First Amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative. In this context, the PMRC's demands are the equivalent of treating dandruff by decapitation....

The band usually recorded songs only once, based on Casablancas's preference for [...] "raw efficiency". RAT effects pedals and overdriving amplifiers were used at times, [...] "taking sounds, disintegrating them and then bringing them back". The band wanted things to be only slightly stressed, with no heavy-handedness in terms of studio effects; only distortion and reverse echo were widely used. Throughout the process, Raphael improvised according to the reactions that he got from the group. At one point, he {{had to cope with}} the threat of eviction from his Transporterraum studio, but once the Strokes received backing from RCA, time and money were no longer pressing concerns. The label's A delegate initially did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>what</b> had been recorded and felt that the album {{was not going to be}} professional enough. The producer and the band were given complete control only when Casablancas persuaded the delegate by playing him some of the new material on a boom box.|$|E

500|$|Game {{director}} and composer Junichi Masuda stated that {{to keep the}} games fresh, he looks at every previous element {{to decide what to}} adapt to the new game, stating [...] "people may <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>what</b> they like in the past, trend wise". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players {{would not be able to}} know what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.|$|E

[...] IGN Robert Canning gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8 out of 10. While he said the episode was entertaining, he felt that it {{did not need to be}} an hour and a half. Emily Yahr of The Washington Post agreed about the extended length, and did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>what</b> she called [...] "lame attempts to fill time", which she said [...] "detracted from what started as a decent episode". She did, however, cite several [...] "promising storylines", including Rachel's, and noted, [...] "Usually, New Directions leader Rachel Berry is a caricature of all things annoying—but this episode, we see her genuinely struggling with wanting to love herself the way she is". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson summed it up as follows: [...] "Not an epic episode, just sort of … meh."

In the book Spooks: The Personnel Files, Tom is revealed to have married Christine Dale following his retirement and to have founded a private security company called 'Trans Atlantic Security'. He is also mentioned in Season 7 Episode 1 when Lucas North asks Harry 'How did Tom Quinn work out?'. Tom briefly returns in the final episode, hired by Harry Pearce as an [...] "outside contractor" [...] to eliminate the head of a conspiracy of Russian nationalists who tried to derail the move to a closer Russian/UK relationship.
