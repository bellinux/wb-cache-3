5|$|According to a Soviet General Staff report, 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe {{raids on}} Soviet airfields in the Kursk sector in June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts were {{so successful that}} German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> vast underestimation of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions.|$|E
5|$|DST is {{generally}} not observed near the equator, where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it.

5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E

Wallace said that if his mother had promised him what he promised his daughter, everything she wanted, Wallace would have been <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> graduate but also {{at the top of his}} class. He continued selling drugs after the birth to support his daughter financially. Once Combs discovered this, he forced Wallace to quit.|$|E

5|$|The MAM is {{enriched in}} enzymes {{involved}} in lipid biosynthesis, such as phosphatidylserine synthase on the ER face and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase on the mitochondrial face. Because mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly undergoing fission and fusion events, they require a constant and well-regulated supply of phospholipids for membrane integrity. But mitochondria are <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> destination for the phospholipids they finish synthesis of; rather, this organelle {{also plays a}} role in inter-organelle trafficking of the intermediates and products of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, ceramide and cholesterol metabolism, and glycosphingolipid anabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Amorium was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> major {{military}} disaster {{and a heavy}} personal blow for Theophilos, but also a traumatic event for the Byzantines, its impact resonating in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which was slowly shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of Iconoclasm, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.|$|E

It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E

5|$|Blitzball {{is first}} {{introduced}} {{in the beginning of}} the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for showing that dopamine is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that some life forms are {{more capable of}} suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms. Gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various life forms in the food chain. He {{believed that}} slaughtering animals is unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available. He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with Henry Stephens Salt. Food to Gandhi was <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being. He avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk. Gandhi wrote the book The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 Ravel met {{the young}} pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> lifelong friend, {{but also one}} of the {{foremost}} interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music. The two shared an appreciation of Wagner, Russian music, and the writings of Poe, Baudelaire, and Mallarmé. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy, as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan, also heard during the Exposition.|$|E
