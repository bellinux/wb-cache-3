5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts {{had little to do with}} the situation on the ground.|$|E

While waiting, he met Geraldine Larrosa, (Innocence) and her then-partner Carlos Marín, {{who spoke to}} him after hearing Sébastien sing in online videos. Carlos said it was worth a try, so Sébastien went to the Bastille in Paris, where the auditions were being held by Sonny Takhar. Hearing Izambard Caruso performed the song while playing the piano himself, relaxed and convinced that he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> since he thought would lead nowhere. But Cowell heard him and offered him the job.

25|$|Gurney was {{particularly}} noted for an exceptionally fluid driving style. On rare occasions, as when his car fell behind with minor mechanical troubles {{and he felt}} he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> he would abandon his classic technique and adopt a more aggressive (and riskier) style. This circumstance produced what many observers consider the finest driving performance of his career, when a punctured tire put him nearly two laps down halfway through the 1967 Rex Mays 300 Indycar race at Riverside, California. He produced an inspired effort, made up the deficit and won the race with a dramatic last-lap pass of runner-up Bobby Unser.|$|E

Robbins has also appeared in mainstream Hollywood thrillers, such as 1999's Arlington Road (as a suspected terrorist) and 2001's Antitrust (as a malicious computer tycoon), and in comical films such as The Hudsucker Proxy, <b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lose,</b> and High Fidelity.

500|$|Tan's first Paralympic {{event was}} the para-dressage Individual Championship Test (class Ia). Riders in this event are {{categorized}} into classes I to IV, those in class I {{having the most}} severe disabilities. On 9 September, riding a 20-year-old chestnut gelding loaned to her named <b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lose</b> (also known as Harvey) at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre in Sha Tin, Tan scored 68.80% to claim the bronze medal behind the United Kingdom's Anne Dunham (73.10%) and Sophie Christiansen (72.80%). She thus became the first Singaporean to win a Paralympic medal, and the holder of Asia's first Paralympic equestrian medal. Two days after achieving the first medal, Tan collected her second bronze with a score of 70.167% for the Individual Freestyle Event, in which she performed to music with <b>Nothing</b> <b>To</b> <b>Lose.</b> The president of the Equestrian Federation of Singapore, Melanie Chew, described her performance as [...] "beyond our expectations", and that the wins would aid in promoting local awareness of the sport.|$|E

Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights {{near the end of the}} game when they have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a [...] "reaction penalty", an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer.

The Mattachine Society newsletter a month later offered its explanation of why the riots occurred: [...] "It catered largely to {{a group of people who}} are not welcome in, or cannot afford, other places of homosexual social gathering... The Stonewall became home to these kids. When it was raided, they fought for it. That, and the fact that they had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> other than the most tolerant and broadminded gay place in town, explains why." ...|$|E

Classic Rock editor Paul Trynka highlights the song among the [...] "beautiful, small-scale moments" [...] that were overlooked {{at the time of the}} album's release, describing it as [...] "a shamefaced confessional on the banality of drunkenness".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{attempted}} to bring closure to {{several aspects of}} the series. In one sequence, Alex Krycek throws The Smoking Man {{down a flight of}} stairs, presumably to his death. Nicholas Lea, the actor who portrayed Krycek, noted: [...] "That's one of the character's great moments, when I get to push Bill Davis down a set of stairs. In a sense, he has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> because his life's burned out. So death doesn't have the same terror that it would to a young happy chap." [...] The episode also featured several tender moments between Mulder and Scully, which many fans found [...] "nearly pornographic {{in the context of their}} long, chaste courtship", according to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files. Gillian Anderson, however, defended the moments, arguing that there was ample amount of romance between Mulder and Scully prior to [...] "Requiem".|$|E
