5|$|Ferguson's {{depression}} returns again, when Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs {{her that}} she has an infection that requires surgery. She rejects the surgery, and is further disappointed when Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tells her that the worst-case scenario is that she will <b>need</b> <b>an</b> ostomy pouching system. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter the emergency room, so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E

It was {{intended}} to only be an oral scene, but {{in the heat of}} the moment she had intercourse with both. The next day she shot a scene with Miles Long in Joey Silvera's Service Animals 4. A few months later, she realized that she did not <b>need</b> <b>an</b> agent and started to represent herself.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{recommended}} {{that the federal government}} assume responsibility for financing social programs such as old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of federal tax revenues should be based on <b>need,</b> <b>an</b> idea that became central to Macdonald's thinking about federal-provincial relations. Among other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of rural electrification to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown large {{enough for her to}} <b>need</b> <b>an</b> assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E
5|$|Dot and Abi make a rum {{cake for}} Patrick's {{birthday}} {{but as soon}} as Abi leaves the house for Exeter, Dot trips over Dave and nobody knows she is seriously injured until another step-granddaughter Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) finds her.

Dot is left worried when the doctor tells her that she will <b>need</b> <b>an</b> operation after her fall has caused problems to her hip. Dot refuses physio and loses her temper with the doctors when they won't let her have a cigarette. Dot is heartbroken when Sonia and Robbie inform her that Dave has died but is relieved when Dave shows up at the hospital alive.|$|E

5|$|Scholarships at McGill are {{relatively}} difficult to attain, {{compared to other}} Canadian universities. For out-of-province first year undergraduate students, a high school average of 95% is required to receive a guaranteed one-year entrance scholarship. To be considered for the same scholarships, Quebec CEGEP students need a minimum R-score of 35.5, United States high school students need a minimum A average {{as well as at}} least 700 in each SAT or 33 in the ACT, and French Baccalaureate students <b>need</b> <b>an</b> average of 15.5 plus a minimum score of 14 in each course; similarly, students in the British education system need As in both GCSE Level and predicted Advanced Level results, and International Baccalaureate students need to attain a minimum overall average of 6.9 on predicted grades or a score of 42 on exam results. In general, entrance scholarship recipients rank in the top 1–2% of their class.|$|E

With help from Ratpouch, Diermot breaks into the house of Taidgh, the magician, where he creates a potion which disguises him as Selena. He enters the mansion where Goewin is being held and orders the Skorl to free her. Not long after, a man named Mallin gives Diermot a book wrapped in cloth to take to a man named Morkus. In the process of delivering the book, Diermot sees a notice stating that whoever returns the book to its rightful owner will be rewarded. Diermot delivers the book to a man named Toby, who rewards him with a statuette. Toby reveals that the dragon can help Diermot defeat Selena, but that he will <b>need</b> <b>an</b> infusion made of three herbs to wake the dragon up, which Goewin then makes for Diermot.|$|E

Weighted kappa {{was used as}} kappa (unweighted) does not consider the degree of disagreement. Reliability was estimated for the ASSQ scoring system with Cronbach’s alpha. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value [22] were estimated from the ASSQ scoring system sleep problem categories to the SMP categories after the clinical interview. Sensitivity was estimated {{as the number of}} subjects determined by the ASSQ scoring system as <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention from the SMP (moderate and severe) divided by the number of subjects <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. Specificity was estimated by the number of subjects determined by the ASSQ scoring system as not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical sleep intervention (none, mild categories) divided by the number of subjects not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. The positive predictive value was estimated by dividing the subjects for which there was agreement on <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention (moderate, severe categories) by the actual number of subjects <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. The negative predictive value was estimated by dividing the subjects for which there was agreement on not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention by the actual number of subjects not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP.|$|R
