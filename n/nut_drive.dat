50|$|Tightening a {{threadless}} headset requires {{tightening the}} preload bolt (or cap bolt) in {{the cap on}} the top of the stem. This bolt is connected to a star <b>nut</b> <b>driven</b> down into the steerer tube that acts as an anchor by gripping the inside of the steerer tube with a downward force. The star nut may be replaced by a self expanding wedge in some designs. The bolt compresses the stem down onto spacers, usually aluminum, which in turn compress the headset bearing cups. The preload bolt does not hold the fork onto the bike; after the preload is set, the stem bolts must be tightened to secure the fork in place. The adjustment must be made such that there is no play in the bearings, but allow the fork to turn smoothly without binding or excessive friction.|$|R

40|$|A drive {{mechanism}} enables a socket-type wrench to rotate a shaft and prevents accidental {{rotation of the}} shaft when the wrench is not coupled to the shaft. In the original intended application, the shaft {{would be part of}} an attachment mechanism on a spacecraft, and the purpose to be served by the drive is to prevent back-driving of the shaft by launch vibrations while enabling an astronaut equipped with the appropriate wrench to actuate the shaft while in orbit. The design could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which it is necessary to prevent rotational back-driving. The mechanism includes a gear near the tip of the shaft, and a <b>drive</b> <b>nut</b> that constitutes the tip of the shaft. The gear and <b>drive</b> <b>nut</b> are positioned in a recess in a housing. The recess is sized to receive the wrench socket that mates with the <b>drive</b> <b>nut.</b> Also contained in the housing are four linkages that include pins that are spring-loaded into engagement with the gear to prevent rotation of the shaft.

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} biological nanomotors {{were classified}} {{into two categories}} in the past: linear and rotation motors. In 2013, a third type of biomotor, revolution without rotation, was discovered and found to be widespread among bacteria, eukaryotic viruses, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages. This review focuses on recent findings about various aspects of motors, including chirality, stoichiometry, channel size, entropy, conformational change, and energy usage rate, {{in a variety of}} well-studied motors, including F o F 1 ATPase, helicases, viral dsDNA-packaging motors, bacterial chromosome translocases, myosin, kinesin, and dynein. In particular, dsDNA translocases are used to illustrate how these features relate to the motion mechanism and how nature elegantly evolved a revolution mechanism to avoid coiling and tangling during lengthy dsDNA genome transportation in cell division. Motor chirality and channel size are two factors that distinguish rotation motors from revolution motors. Rotation motors use right-handed channels to drive the right-handed dsDNA, similar to the way a <b>nut</b> <b>drives</b> the bolt with threads in same orientation; revolution motors use left-handed motor channels to revolve the right-handed dsDNA. Rotation motors use small channels (3 nm) with room for the bolt to revolve. Binding and hydrolysis of ATP are linked to different conformational entropy changes in the motor that lead to altered affinity for the substrate and allow work to be done, for example, helicase unwinding of DNA or translocase directional movement of DNA...|$|R

40|$|Tree nut allergies {{are some}} of the most common and serious allergies in the United States. Patients who are {{sensitive}} to nuts or to seeds commonly called nuts are advised to avoid consuming a variety of different species, even though these may be distantly related in terms of their evolutionary history. This is because studies in the literature report that patients often display sensitivity to multiple nut species (cross-sensitivity) if they have an existing nut allergy. These reports suggest that cross-sensitivity in patients with nut allergies may be caused by an IgE antibody reacting with epitopes present in the seed proteins of different species (cross-reactivity), for example, if IgE isolated from the serum of a patient were able to bind to both almond and peanut allergens. We hypothesize that allergenic proteins in seeds may have similar amino acid sequences that cause the observed cross-sensitivity. Here, we test the hypothesis that similarity in the protein sequences of allergenic <b>nuts</b> <b>drives</b> cross-sensitivity and cross-reactivity by reconstructing the gene trees of three allergenic seed-storage proteins (vicilin, legumin, and 2 S albumin) from species sampled across vascular plants. We generate estimates of their phylogenetic relationships and compare these to the allergen cross-sensitivity and cross-reactivity data that is reported in the literature. In general, evolutionary relationships of the three proteins are congruent with the current understanding of plant species relationships. However, we find little evidence that distantly related nut species reported to be cross-reactive share similar vicilin, legumin, or 2 S albumin amino acid sequences. Our data thus suggest that features of the proteins other than their amino acid sequences may be driving the cross-reactivity observed during in vitro tests and skin tests. Our results support current treatment guidelines to limit nut and seed consumption if allergies are present in a patient. More studies are necessary to better understand the characteristics of allergenic proteins and patterns of cross-sensitivity in patients who suffer from nut allergies...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design of some main {{components}} of a lunar rover assigned to working tasks. The main task of this rover is to clear areas of the lunar soil allocated to the building of a lunar base. In {{the first part of the}} work the lunar environment is studied and described with particular attention to the rover tasks. The rover in the final configuration will be able to advance in all directions on the soil, to control the attitude and to grasp and to remove obstacle and object on the soil. It will be provided by a frame, legs and will, grasping system. The design of the lifting system for the attitude control, based on the action of four motorized legs, has been approached with particular regard to the structural characteristics and to the transmission and motorization. The transmission of the lifting system uses a precision coupling between a lead screw and <b>nut,</b> <b>driven</b> by electrical motors. To allow optimal working conditions for the lead screw and nut, the lifting device was designed as a compact apparatus which also comprises a particular joint which is capable to uncouple shear and bending loads transmitted to it from the other parts. The design of the components has to keep into account the peculiar characteristics of the lunar environment. This aspect was considered by an appropriate geometrical design of the components and a careful choice of the materials. The gripper mechanism of the rover is designed to operate without dedicated motors and it is able to be self-adaptive to the shape of the picked up item also if the object is placed in a non defined position, in any case in a working space. The design optimization of the grasping mechanism, choosing shape and dimension of the different arms, was performed by means of parametric modeling and numerical simulations. Finally an innovative type of wheel was designed and realized to verify the real ability to operate. The wheel is a non pneumatic system with and integrated suspension and energy scavenging system to power the sensors and control system on board. ...|$|R

Many actuators being proposed involve designs which lead to bulky packages. The key facing those improving coaxial valves is the provision of suitable linear actuation. The valve herein indudes a valve housing with a flow channel there-through. Arranged in the flow channel is a closing body. In alignment with the closing body is a ball screw actuator which includes a ball nut and a cylindrical screw. The ball nut sounds a threaded portion of the cylindrical screw.

40|$|The {{sprinkler}} pivots on {{a bearing}} {{on top of}} its threaded attachment <b>nut.</b> It is <b>driven</b> in a circular motion by a spring-loaded arm pushed back by the water stream which returns to "impact" the stream. The water stream can thus rotate around a fix axis. Analogously in our universe, the outflow or jet formed by the relativistic plasma corresponds to the water stream of a sprinkler; and the baryons in the tilted outer accretion disc or torus {{play the role of}} "impact arm". Then the jet aligning with the inner parts of a warped disc can directly "touch" the outer region of the disc. The resultant collision between such rapid leptons and slow baryons automatically accounts for the main features of broad-line region of active galactic nuclei. Moreover, it naturally provides a channel of dissipating the angular momentum of an accretion disc, which has long been a problem in theory of accretion disc.

50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a lead screw. A lead screw has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the lead screw is a lead nut or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the lead screw (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the lead screw is rotated, the <b>nut</b> will be <b>driven</b> along the threads. The direction of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the lead screw. By connecting linkages to the nut, the motion {{can be converted to}} usable linear displacement. Most current actuators are built for high speed, high force, or a compromise between the two. When considering an actuator for a particular application, the most important specifications are typically travel, speed, force, accuracy, and lifetime. Most varieties are mounted on dampers or butterfly valves.|$|R
40|$|The {{induction}} of IgE {{antibodies to}} aeroallergens depends upon antigen-specific CD 4 + helper T cells of an 'interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) -dominant' phenotype. <b>Nuts</b> also <b>drive</b> IgE-mediated hypersensitivity {{and are the}} most dangerous of the orally encountered allergens. We have studied the polyclonal T-cell responses of atopic and non-atopic individuals to extracts of peanut, brazilnut and hazelnut. Strong proliferative responses were observed in all patients but specific IgE was only present in the nut-allergic patients suggesting a similar pathogenic mechanism to aeroallergen-mediated hypersensitivity. To investigate this hypothesis a panel of peanut-reactive T-cell clones was raised from a peanut- and brazilnut-allergic individual without hazelnut allergy. The antigen specificity, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II restriction and cytokine profiles of the T-cell clones were determined. With {{the exception of one}} T-cell clone, which proliferated in response to both peanut and hazelnut extract, the peanut T-cell clones were not cross-reactive with hazelnut or brazilnut. The T-cell clones recognized antigen in association with HLA-DR and HLA-DP but not HLA-DQ class II molecules. The peanut-specific clones produced high levels of IL- 4 and low levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), exhibiting the 'TH 2 -like' profile which dominates the aeroallergen response. In contrast, the T-cell clone that was cross-reactive on both peanut and hazelnut allergen had a Th 0 -like phenotype, consistent with the lack of specific serum IgE to hazelnut. These results support the importance of functionally distinct T-cell populations that recognize oral allergens. The relative production of IL- 4 and IFN-gamma of the cloned T cells in the peanut-allergic patients plays a role in determining whether or not IgE antibody responses are induced with the associated potential to develop anaphylactic reactions...|$|R

5000|$|The music {{about the}} church was written by Dr. William S. Pitts in 1857 {{following}} a coach ride that stopped in Bradford, Iowa. The church is in a valley near the town, though the church was not actually built until several years later. In the years since, the church has become known simply as [...] "the Little Brown Church". When Pitts returned to the area {{with his wife in}} 1862 he discovered a church being erected where he imagined it. The congregation had been meeting in various temporary spaces until Rev. J.K. <b>Nutting</b> led the <b>drive</b> to create a permanent home for the congregation. During this period, Pitts had been teaching singing at nearby Bradford Academy and taught his class to sing his song {{for the first time at}} the dedication of the church in 1864. Pitts later sold the rights to the song for a nominal sum. After the church closed in 1888 due to economic downturn in the town, the Society For the Preservation of the Little Brown Church was founded. By 1914, services were again held in the building. Shortly afterward, the small congregation experienced a revival that attracted new attention to it and to its song. Among those who found and loved the song at this time was the Weatherwax Quartet. This group of traveling singers traveled throughout Canada and the United States in the 1920s and '30s and used as their trademark song [...] "The Church in the Wildwood." [...] They would quite easily talk about the little church during their travels. As the song grew in popularity, coupled with the development of the U.S. Highway system in the mid-1920s, many visitors came to the newly-reopened little church. Since then the church has become a popular tourist spot, and remains so today. It attracts thousands of visitors every year to see or be married in the [...] "little brown church in the vale." [...] The church is currently a member of the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches.|$|R
