40|$|The {{isoflavone}} genistein {{is found}} predominantly in soyabeans and {{is thought to}} possess various potent biological properties, including anticarcinogenic effects. Studies have shown that genistein is extensively degraded by the human gut microflora, presumably {{with a loss of}} its anti-carcinogenic action. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the potential of a prebiotic to divert bacterial metabolism away from genistein breakdown: this may be of benefit to the host. Faecal samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and fermented in the presence of a source of soyabean isoflavones (Novasoy(TM) (10 g/l); ADM <b>Neutraceuticals,</b> Erith, Kent, UK). Bacterial genera of the human gut were enumerated using selective agars and genistein was quantified by HPLC. The experiment was repeated with the addition of glucose (10 g/l) or fructo-oligosaccharide (10 g/l; FOS) to the fermentation medium. The results showed most notably that counts of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were significantly increased (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 01 respectively) under steady-state conditions in the presence of FOS. Counts of Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. were, however, both significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) during the fermentation. A decline in genistein concentration by about 52 and 56 % over the 120 h culture period was observed with the addition of glucose or FOS to the basal medium (P< 0. 01), compared with about 91 % loss of genistein in the vessels containing Novasoy(TM) (ADM <b>Neutraceuticals)</b> only. Similar trends were obtained using a three-stage chemostat (gut model), in which once again the degradation of genistein was about 22 % in vessel one, about 24 % in vessel two and about 26 % in vessel three in the presence of FOS, compared with a degradation of genistein of about 67 % in vessel one, about 95 % in vessel two and about 93 % in vessel three in the gut model containing Novasoy(TM) (ADM <b>Neutraceuticals)</b> only. The present study has shown that the addition of excess substrate appeared to preserve genistein in vitro. In particular, the use of FOS not only augmented this effect, but also conferred an additional benefit in selectively increasing numbers of purportedly beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Type 2 {{diabetes}} is growing explosively in India. The exact cause being unknown and both nature and nurture {{are believed to}} have role.

Further, Indians being poor the dietary ingrediant, must be affordable. Health infrastructure in rural India is poor and hence <b>neutraceutical</b> aided control is helpful in villagers. A particular food composite used daily reduces the compliance and hence alternative approaches like use of different sets of neutraceuticals or use of same neutraceuticals not on daily basis is suggested. Chances are there that on non daily use the beneficial effects of <b>neutraceutical</b> may reduce.

40|$|Nutritional supplements, or neutraceuticals, are touted by {{many for}} their purported ability to {{maintain}} wellness and treat disease. <b>Neutraceutical</b> treatment of human diseases is gaining popularity; however comparatively few scientific studies support their routine use. This study compares the effects of periwinkle extract as a <b>neutraceutical</b> treatment to determine {{if it has a}} differential impact on cancerous and normal cell lines. Periwinkle, a flower currently used to help treat leukemia and lymphoma, is a prime candidate for study. An exploratory study was conducted to investigate periwinkle’s effect on growth rate and morphology for MCF- 7 human breast cancer and C 2 C 12 mouse myoblast cell lines. Initial studies showed a dose-dependent decrease of MCF- 7 viability as well as dramatic changes in cancer cell morphology; however periwinkle’s effects on normal cells is unknown. Ideally, periwinkle would differentially affect breast cancer but not normal cells. This ongoing study is investigating that question. Based on preliminary results, we anticipate that: a) MCF- 7 human breast cancer cell growth rate will decrease as periwinkle concentration increases; b) MCF- 7 morphology will change as periwinkle concentration changes; C 2 C 12 muscle cell viability be unaffected at normal but will decrease at high periwinkle concentrations; and C 2 C 12 muscle cell morphology remain unchanged as periwinkle concentration changes.
