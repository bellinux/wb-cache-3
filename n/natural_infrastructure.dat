50|$|The film also {{spends a}} lengthy {{amount of time}} on the topic of {{privatization}} of water infrastructure. Major businesses depicted in the film are Nestle, The Coca-Cola Company, Suez, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While tap water has gained a great stigma over the years, the FDA cannot confirm that bottled water is any safer. Tap water passes through water treatment plants and has to abide by set regulations, however, bottled water has less stringent regulations because there is no primary monitoring agency designated for the industry. Ethical dilemmas arise from the conversation of water privatization because water is a natural and common resource that companies are capturing for free to build a large profit. This constant pumping of water has changed the <b>natural</b> <b>infrastructure</b> of land and has caused water shortages in areas near pumping facilities. In 2008, the U.N. estimated that it would require funds of $30 billion a year to provide clean, accessible, drinking water to the entire planet while in the previous year, the world spent $90 billion on bottled water.|$|E
5000|$|Societies {{increasingly}} face challenges such as climate change, urbanization, jeopardized {{food security}} and water resource provision, and disaster risk. One approach {{to answer these}} challenges is to singularly rely on technological strategies. An alternative approach is to manage the (socio-)ecological systems in a comprehensive way in order to sustain and potentially increase the delivery of ecosystem services to humans. In this context, nature-based solutions (NbS) have recently been put forward by practitioners and quickly thereafter by policymakers, referring to the sustainable use of nature in solving coupled environmental-social-economic challenges. While ecosystem services are often valued in terms of immediate benefits to human well-being and economy, NbS focus on the benefits to people and the environment itself, to allow for sustainable solutions {{that are able to}} respond to environmental change and hazards in the long-term. NbS go beyond the traditional biodiversity conservation and management principles by [...] "re-focusing" [...] the debate on humans and specifically integrating societal factors such as human well-being and poverty reduction, socio-economic development, and governance principles. In this sense, NbS are strongly connected to ideas such as natural systems agriculture, natural solutions, ecosystem-based approaches, adaptation services, <b>natural</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> green infrastructure [...] and ecological engineering. For instance, ecosystem-based approaches are increasingly promoted for climate change adaptation and mitigation by organisations like United Nations Environment Programme and non-governmental organisations such as The Nature Conservancy. These organisations refer to [...] "policies and measures that take into account the role of ecosystem services in reducing the vulnerability of society to climate change, in a multi-sectoral and multi-scale approach". Likewise, <b>natural</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is defined as a [...] "strategically planned and managed network of natural lands, such as forests and wetlands, working landscapes, and other open spaces that conserves or enhances ecosystem values and functions and provides associated benefits to human populations"; [...] and green infrastructure refers to an [...] "interconnected network of green spaces that conserves natural systems and provides assorted benefits to human populations". Similarly, the concept of ecological engineering generally refers to [...] "protecting, restoring (i.e. ecosystem restoration) or modifying ecological systems to increase the quantity, quality and sustainability of particular services they provide, or to build new ecological systems that provide services that would otherwise be provided through more conventional engineering, based on non-renewable resources". Given the range of different (existing) approaches that NbS seem to cover, IUCN proposes NbS as an umbrella concept [...] (Table 1; Figure 1).|$|E

40|$|Governing {{common pool}} {{resources}} (CPR) {{in the face}} of disturbances such as globalization and climate change is challenging. The outcome of any CPR governance regime is the influenced by local combinations of social, institutional, and biophysical factors, as well as cross-scale interdependencies. In this study, we take a step towards understanding multiple-causation of CPR outcomes by analyzing 1) the co-occurrence of Destign Principles (DP) by activity (irrigation, fishery and forestry), and 2) the combination(s) of DPs leading to social and ecological success. We analyzed 69 cases pertaining to three different activities: irrigation, fishery, and forestry. We find that the importance of the design principles is dependent upon the natural and hard human made infrastructure (i. e. canals, equipment, vessels etc.). For example, clearly defined social bounduaries are important when the <b>natural</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is highly mobile (i. e. tuna fish), while monitoring is more important when the <b>natural</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is more static (i. e. forests or water contained within an irrigation system). However, we also find that congruence between local conditions and rules and proportionality between investment and extraction are key for CPR success independent from the natural and human hard made infrastructure. We further provide new visualization techniques for co-occurrence patterns and add to qualitative comparative analysis by introducing a reliability metric to deal with a large meta-analysis dataset on secondary data where information is missing or uncertain...|$|E
