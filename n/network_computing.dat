5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project for protein structure prediction on the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for <b>Network</b> <b>Computing</b> (BOINC) platform, {{run by the}} Baker laboratory at the University of Washington. Rosetta@home aims to predict protein–protein docking and design new proteins {{with the help of}} about sixty thousand active volunteered computers processing at over 210 teraFLOPS on average as of July 29, 2016. Foldit, a Rosetta@Home videogame, aims to reach these goals with a crowdsourcing approach. Though much of the project is oriented toward basic research to improve the accuracy and robustness of proteomics methods, Rosetta@home also does applied research on malaria, Alzheimer's disease, and other pathologies.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} non-IBM channel systems was hosted in the CDC 6600 supercomputer in 1965. The CDC utilized 10 logically independent computers called peripheral processors, or PPs for this role. PPs were powerful, a modern version of CDC's first 'personal computer', the CDC 160A. The operating system resided and executed in the primary processor, PP0. Since then, channel controllers have been a standard part of most mainframe designs and a primary advantage mainframes have over smaller, faster, personal computers and <b>network</b> <b>computing.</b>|$|E
25|$|An X client cannot {{generally}} be detached from one server and reattached to another unless its code specifically provides for it (emacs {{is one of}} the few common programs with this ability). As such, moving an entire session from one X server to another is generally not possible. However, approaches like Virtual <b>Network</b> <b>Computing</b> (VNC), NX and Xpra allow a virtual session to be reached from different X servers (in a manner similar to GNU Screen in relation to terminals), and other applications and toolkits provide related facilities.|$|E

25|$|On May 21, 1996, Oracle Corporation, {{along with}} 30 {{hardware}} and software vendors, announced an intent to build computers that are designed around the network computer platform. The idea was to design technology based on a profile that included diskless computers, commonly coded applications using languages such as Java, and interface with the Internet using common software such as Netscape Navigator. In May 1996, Apple became {{a partner in the}} <b>network</b> <b>computing</b> effort, and used the Apple Pippin platform as its implementation. Katz Media attempted to use the network computer platform concept as a way to push the Pippin into vertical markets. Although the Apple iMac (1998) is popularly known for the disappearance of the floppy disk, the Apple Pippin platform was about two years ahead of the iMac in this effort.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{the company}} started adding IT {{security}} features. By early 2002, CacheFlow {{was on the}} fifth version of its operating system. The Security Gateway 600/6000 Series was the company's newest product family. It had a range of security features, such as authentication, internet use policies, virus scanning, content filtering, and bandwidth restrictions for streaming video applications. <b>Network</b> <b>Computing</b> tested a beta appliance {{and gave it a}} positive review. Later that year, the company was renamed to Blue Coat Systems to focus on security appliances and simultaneously released the SG800. The appliance sat behind corporate firewalls to filter website traffic for viruses, malware, worms and other harmful software. It had a custom operating system called Security Gateway and provided many of its security features through partners, like Symantec and Trend Micro. An InfoWorld review gave it an 8.4 out of 10.|$|E
25|$|The Reading Plant's heritage, {{combined}} with constant innovation and product quality, positioned the Reading site {{as one of}} the largest semiconductor facilities in the world. In 2000, Lucent Microelectronics and Optoelectronics were reorganized as Agere Systems with the intention of spinning it off as an independent company. Agere Systems Inc. produced high-tech components such as opto-electronics products, which use light-wave technologies to transmit information, and integrated circuits, which are miniaturized chips used in computers and communications. The opto-electronics parts were used in systems such as submarine communication cables, cable transmitters, cable receivers, laser components, and <b>network</b> <b>computing</b> devices. The integrated circuits were found in a wide array of electronic products from modems and computers to cell phones and telephone offices to video equipment and digital television. After becoming Agere Systems, by the end of 2000, the Reading Facility became the Muhlenberg plant and had grown its workforce by 800 to 3,000 as the anticipated lightwave business materialized. In 2001, Agere Systems's stock went public in late March. The spin-off was completed on June 1, 2002. By mid-2001, Agere cut 508 jobs at the Reading Works. These layoffs continued in waves as conditions in the semiconductor market deteriorated {{and by the end of}} the year only had a workforce of 1,546.|$|E

2500|$|SETI@home was {{conceived}} by David Gedye along with Craig Kasnoff {{and is a}} popular volunteer distributed computing project that was launched by the University of California, Berkeley, in May 1999. It was originally funded by The Planetary Society and Paramount Pictures, and later {{by the state of}} California. The project is run by director David P. Anderson and chief scientist Dan Werthimer. Any individual can become involved with SETI research by downloading the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for <b>Network</b> <b>Computing</b> (BOINC) software program, attaching to the SETI@home project, and allowing the program to run as a background process that uses idle computer power. The SETI@home program itself runs signal analysis on a [...] "work unit" [...] of data recorded from the central 2.5MHz wide band of the SERENDIP IV instrument. After computation on the work unit is complete, the results are then automatically reported back to SETI@home servers at University of California, Berkeley. By June 28, 2009, the SETI@home project had over 180,000 active participants volunteering a total of over 290,000 computers. These computers give SETI@home an average computational power of 617 teraFLOPS. In 2004 radio source SHGb02+14a set off speculation in the media that a signal had been detected but researchers noted the frequency drifted rapidly and the detection on three SETI@home computers fell within random chance.|$|E
