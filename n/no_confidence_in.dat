An assembly may pass a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the executive, in which case the executive must either dissolve the assembly within ten days or automatically lose their office. Following the next election, however, the executive remains in office unless the new assembly again passes a no confidence resolution.|$|E

5|$|The Germans rapidly {{realised}} that Pećanac's Chetniks, whose numbers {{had grown}} to 8,000, were inefficient and unreliable, and even the Nedić government had <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> them. They were completely disbanded by March 1943. Pećanac himself was interned by the Nedić regime for some time, and was killed by agents of Mihailović in May or June 1944.|$|E
5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) is {{a member}} of a Singaporean {{opposition}} political party who, according to the Constitution and Parliamentary Elections Act, is declared to have been elected a Member of the Parliament of Singapore despite having lost in a general election by virtue of having been one of the best-performing losers. NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament. They are, however, not allowed to vote on several types of bills such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the Government. An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to take it up.|$|E

Bernard Dowiyogo died in office in March 2003 and Ludwig Scotty was elected as the president, later being re-elected {{to serve a}} full term in October 2004. Following a vote of no confidence on 19 December 2007, Scotty was replaced by Marcus Stephen. Stephen resigned in November 2011, and Freddie Pitcher became President. Sprent Dabwido then filed a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> Pitcher, resulting in him becoming president. Following parliamentary elections in 2013, Baron Waqa was elected president.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, 2002, {{dozens of}} {{members from the}} Deputy Sheriff's Association issued a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the {{incumbent}} sheriff during {{a meeting at the}} county's courthouse. The vote, they claimed, was issued due to allegations that the sheriff made against members of the agency, in which he said they were deliberately malingering in order to reflect badly on him. The sheriff rejected the allegations as unfounded and voiced his displeasure over the vote, calling them politically motivated due to their proximity to the primary elections, which was only weeks away at the time.|$|E
5|$|The NCMP Scheme was {{introduced}} in 1984 to ensure the presence of Opposition Members in Parliament. The NCMP Scheme serves {{to ensure that the}} voices of the minority are still heard. Thus, to qualify as an NCMP, the candidate must have won at least 15% {{of the total number of}} votes. The powers of an NCMP are restricted in Art 39(2) of the Constitution: an NCMP cannot vote on a bill to amend the Constitution; a supply, supplementary supply or final supply bill; a money bill; a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the Government; or a motion for removing the President from office.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{motion of}} <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> {{occurred}} <b>in</b> March 1782 when, following {{news of the}} British defeat at Yorktown in the American Revolutionary War the previous October, the Parliament of Great Britain voted that they [...] "can <b>no</b> longer repose <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the present ministers". Prime Minister Lord North responded by asking King George III to accept his resignation. This did not immediately create a constitutional convention. During the early 19th century, however, attempts by prime ministers such as Robert Peel to govern {{in the absence of}} a parliamentary majority proved unsuccessful, and by the mid-19th century, the power of a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> to break a government was firmly established in the UK.|$|R

5|$|In July 1939, Stevens and Colonial Treasurer Alexander Mair {{attempted}} to address Spooner's unwillingness to accede to cabinet decisions regarding ministerial expenditure {{by creating a}} committee of four, consisting of Mair, Stevens, Spooner and Bruxner, to approve all expenditure. Furious at this gesture, Spooner resigned on 21 July 1939 as Minister and Deputy Leader, citing a 'disagreement in government policy on relief works' as the reason. Despite Spooner's departure, {{the stability of the}} government was to be short. On 1 August 1939, Spooner carried a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> Stevens in the house, which unexpectedly passed by two votes, owing to the absence of several ministers. On 3 August Stevens tendered his resignation to the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, but was granted several days to remain until his successor was chosen.|$|E
5|$|In the House, {{desultory}} {{debate on}} Fraser's censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34pm, when Fraser rose {{and announced that}} he had been commissioned as Prime Minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> him, and asked the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45pm.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} made clear also that Joseph Kabila does not trust the military; the Republican Guard is the only {{component}} he trusts. Major General John Numbi, former Air Force chief, now inspector general of police, ran a parallel chain of command in the east to direct the 2009 Eastern Congo offensive, Operation Umoja Wetu; the regular chain of command was by-passed. Previously Numbi negotiated the agreement {{to carry out the}} mixage process with Laurent Nkunda. Commenting on a proposed vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> the Minister of Defence in September 2012, Baoudin Amba Wetshi of lecongolais.cd described Ntolo as a 'scapegoat'. Wetshi said that all key military and security questions were handled in total secrecy by the President and other civil and military personalities trusted by him, such as John Numbi, Gabriel Amisi Kumba ('Tango Four'), Delphin Kahimbi, and others such as Kalev Mutond and Pierre Lumbi Okongo.|$|E

5|$|Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escort Amidala to Coruscant, so {{that she}} can plead her people's case to Chancellor Valorum and the Galactic Senate. Qui-Gon asks the Jedi Council for {{permission}} to train Anakin as a Jedi, but the Council refuses after he is interviewed by Yoda and becomes concerned that Anakin is vulnerable to the dark side. Undaunted, Qui-Gon vows to train Anakin himself. Meanwhile, Naboo's Senator Palpatine persuades Amidala to make a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> Valorum to elect a more capable chancellor to resolve the crisis on Naboo. Though she is successful in pushing for the vote, Amidala grows frustrated with the corruption in the Senate, and decides to return to Naboo. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are ordered by the Jedi Council to accompany the queen to Naboo, as well as to confirm the return of the Sith, whom they believe to be extinct.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one miners {{were killed}} in an {{accident}} in Ny-Ålesund in 1962. The resulting Kings Bay Affair, where unsafe mining had been approved to maintain an increased Norwegian presence on Svalbard, ultimately led to vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> Parliament and the withdrawal of Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen's third cabinet. Oil drilling was started by Caltex in 1961. Caltex was granted claims based on indications of oil, rather than samples. Arktikugol was not granted claims based on similar evidence, contributing to tensions with the Soviet Union. Both the Kings Bay Affair and the Caltex Affair initiated public debate about the administration of Svalbard, {{and in particular the}} lack of resources and control of Soviet settlements. Funding for local and central administration was increased heavily, and the Governor increased its activities in Soviet settlements. More than half the archipelago was protected in 1972 through four national parks, fourteen bird sanctuaries and four nature reserves. Store Norske was nationalized between 1973 and 1976.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked {{legislation}} that would strengthen safety rules {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E

5|$|In August 1990 several leading {{officials}} {{tried to}} persuade Gorbachev to force Ryzhkov to resign from his post. Gorbachev did not bow to this pressure, fearing that Ryzhkov's removal would lead to increased activity by many of his pro-republican first secretaries and Politburo members. Ryzhkov's numerous supporters were not concerned about policy issues; they backed him simply because he opposed some of Gorbachev's economic and political reforms. In July 1990, as the Politburo underwent restructuring at the 28th Party Congress, all government officials except Gorbachev and Vladimir Ivashko, the Deputy General Secretary, were excluded with Ryzhkov losing his Politburo seat by default. Nevertheless, Ryzhkov, along with many others, was elected {{a member of the}} Presidential Council. On 19 October 1990 the Russian Supreme Soviet, by a vote of 164 to 1 with 16 abstentions, forced the resignation of Ryzhkov and his cabinet and the implementation of the 500 Days Programme. In stark contrast, Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union support for Ryzhkov's economic reform plan increased. Ryzhkov's economic reform plan was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 1,532 deputies in favour, 419 against and 44 deputies abstaining. The parliamentary Interregional Group's vote of <b>no</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> Ryzhkov's government also failed, with 199 members in favour of Ryzhkov and his cabinet's resignation, 1,685 against and 99 abstaining. As the result of a propaganda war launched against Ryzhkov by Gorbachev supporters, several leading members of the Council of Ministers and its Presidium urged Ryzhkov to resign so that the Soviet Government could reach a compromise with the Russian Government. To make matters worse, the Russian Government which was headed by Ivan Silayev, stopped following Ryzhkov's orders, and Silayev refused to visit the Moscow Kremlin.|$|E
