40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the device physics of a {{technique}} for realizing an <b>n-p-n</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> {{action in the}} source side of a junctionless nanowire tunneling FET (BJN-TFET). In the on-state, tunneling of electrons from valence band of the source to conduction band of the channel enhances the hole concentration {{as well as the}} potential in the source region which drives a built-in BJT transistor by forward biasing the base-emitter junction, with the source acting as a p-type region. Owing to the sharp switching of the JN-TFET and high BJT current gain, the overall performance is improved, including favorable high on-state current (2. 17 * 10 - 6 A/um), and sub 60 mV/dec subthreshold swing (~ 50 mV/dec) at low supply voltages. This approach modifies the current mechanism owning to the triggered BJT and makes the proposed structure more attractive for scaling requirements in future low power application.

40|$|The {{effect of}} excess charge storage on the dynamic {{behavior}} of the polysilicon emitter has been studied. The excess charge is a manifestation of minority-carrier confinement, resulting in a lower base current and therefore improved gain. The diode reverse recovery technique {{was used in the}} study. This technique is {{based on the fact that}} the initial phase during the reverse current transient of a diode is a function of the excess minority carriers stored inside the diode. The devices were fabricated using n-p+ epitaxial wafers and the contact to the n-side was made either by diffusion from n + (As) polysilicon or by direct implantation into single-crystal silicon. The structures therefore simulate the emitter-base junction of an <b>n-p-n</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> with the base more heavily doped than the emitter. The storage phenomenon in the polysilicon contact diodes has been modeled by solving the time-dependent continuity equation. A closed-form analytical solution has been obtained, allowing the first extraction of the surface recombination velocity of polysilicon contact from the transient data. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The gain of a <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> is an important figure of merit that significantly constricts the design of optimized devices.
