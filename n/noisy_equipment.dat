Objectives To assess the sound environment in the emergency ward of a general trauma reference hospital in the city of Curitiba, Parana State, Brazil. Methods In this descriptive study, noise levels were assessed on mornings, afternoons, and evenings using an integrating Bruel & Kjaer (Denmark) calibrated sound level meter, type 2230. Ten indoor points in the emergency ward were assessed; the helicopter as well as several available pieces of equipment in the ward were assessed individually. Results Noise levels in sound pressure level ambiance [dBA] ranged from 56. 6 to 68. 8. The afternoon period was the noisiest. The helicopter at 119 dBA and the cast saw at 90 dBA were the <b>noisiest</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the lowest noise level found was the activated oximeter at 61. 0 dBA. Conclusion In all assessed points, noise levels were above the comfort levels recommended by the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (1987), which may harm users' and professionals' health as well as influence professional performance in the emergency ward. Sound pressure levels of the helicopter and cast saw reach high hearing hazard levels, requiring professionals to use individual protection equipment, and point to the need for creation and implementation of effective control measures of noise levels in emergency wards...|$|R

We introduce a noiseless version of the protocol, also having illusory security in the no-wave limit, to show that noise and thermodynamics play no essential role. Then we prove generally that classical electromagnetic protocols cannot establish a secret key between two parties separated by a spacetime region perfectly monitored by an eavesdropper. We note that the original protocol of Kish is vulnerable to passive time-correlation attacks even in the quasi-static limit.

40|$|Objective: Hearing {{impairment}} (HI) {{remains a}} problem among dentists Hearing loss at speech frequencies was recently reported among dentists and dental hygienists. This study aimed to investigate prevalence and {{factors associated with}} perceived HI among dentists. Methods: In 2009 - 2010, 100 general dental practitioners (GDPs) and 115 general (medical) practitioners (GPs) (mean ages, 43. 7 and 44. 4 years) from Rome (Italy), who commenced practice >= 10 years ago, were interviewed {{on a series of}} occupation- and recreation-related HI risk factors and on HI-associated symptoms (tinnitus, sensation of fullness, hypoacusis). Prevalence of presumptive HI (>= 1 symptom perceived during workdays and weekends) was assessed and factors associated with presumptive HI were investigated. Results: Prevalence was 30. 0 % (95 % confidence interval, 21. 0 - 39. 0 %) and 14. 8 % (95 % confidence interval, 8. 3 - 21. 3 %) among GDPs and GPs, respectively. Occupation (GDP vs. GP), family history of hypoacusis, hypertension, ear diseases and smoking were significantly associated with presumptive HI. Within GDPs alone, significant associations were found for frequent use of ultrasonic scalers, use of dental turbines aged >= 1 year and prosthodontics as prevalent specialty. Conclusions: GDPs experienced HI risk than GPs. Such a risk was not generalized to all dentists, but was specific for those who frequently used <b>noisy</b> <b>equipment</b> (aged turbines, ultrasonic scalers) during their daily practice. Clinical significance: GDPs with 10 or more years of practice who routinely use potentially <b>noisy</b> <b>equipment,</b> could be at risk of HI.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{literature}} review {{of the relationship between}} acoustics and satisfaction in the open-plan office, conducted with the aim of developing empirically derived recommendations for satisfactory acoustic conditions. For the purposes of this review, acoustic satisfaction was defined as a state of contentment with acoustic conditions; it is inclusive of annoyance, loudness, and distraction - all concepts used by one or another researcher in this area to assess subjective experiences associated with the acoustic environment in offices. Based on the results of field surveys conducted over the course of thirty years, background noise levels as high as 79 dB(A) were observed. Higher levels of ambient noise existed in the 1970 's and 1980 's and were primarily caused by <b>noisy</b> office <b>equipment</b> and co-workers' conversations. Today, although office machinery have become substantially less noisy, ambient levels continue to remain unsatisfactory, primarily due to unwanted speech sounds. Average levels recorded in contemporary surveys range from 46 - 58 dB(A). The key issues for sound in open-plan offices are characteristics of sound such as level and spectrum, time variation of level, and speech masking effects. The majority of papers were found to be concerned with level effects, while {{there seemed to be a}} void in studies concerning spectrum and masking effects in the open-plan environment. The results from the studies reviewing level effects concluded that ambient levels exceeding 45 dB(A) are associated with lowered acoustic satisfaction.

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the existing noise conditions within industrial education woodworking and metalworking laboratories to determine whether these noise conditions were a problem as seen by the instructors and if in fact these noise conditions exceeded the standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). The study was conducted in three phases: (1) the assessment of the opinions of professional industrial educators towards noise as a pollutant; (2) an electronic instrument measurement of the actual noise exposure conditions that existed in a sampling of laboratories; and (3) the comparison between the opinions of the professional educators and the actual laboratory noise conditions. The study incorporated the responses from every identifiable high school woods and metals instructor throughout Utah. Comparisons between groups were made concerning the opinions of the professional educators. towards noise as a pollutant, their knowledge about OSHA, and their identification of the <b>noisiest</b> pieces of <b>equipment.</b> The second phase of the study entailed the electronic instrument measurement of the actual environmental noise levels within 30 randomly selected laboratories. The use of a sound level dosimeter and a hand held sound level meter were employed. The data obtained from the study disclosed that the two groups were not in agreement on their knowledge about OSHA. The electronic instrument measurements revealed that 8 of the 18 woodworking instructors and 5 of the 12 metals instructors visited were subjected to noise exposures that were in violation to OSHA. The loudest pieces of equipment were the surface planer, radial arm saw, table saw, foundry furnace, pedestal grinder and portable disc grinder. The third phase of the study used a statistical analysis to compare the opinions of the instructors to the actual measured noise conditions. The chi-square test for significance at the. 05 level of confidence was used to reject the null hypothesis. The major conclusions reached as a result of the analysis of data include: (1) a potential safety and health hazard exists from noise pollution within the industrial education facilities; (2) many members of the profession are not fully informed about OSHA; (3) most labs are in compliance to OSHA noise standards, however, many do exceed the maximum a llowable limits; (4) under stringent OSHA compliance, certain curriculum alterations would have to be initiated; (5) there is no apparent connection between those laboratoryies which were in volation to OSIIA noise standards and the composition of size and construction materials; (6) the opinions of the teachers from the field do not necessarily reflect the actual measured conditions of the environmental noise exposures; and (7) the din of noise produced around machinery must not be considered a problem relevant only to industry...|$|R

This paper reviews the progress that has been made. Only two species regularly occur there: the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and the finless porpoise. Because most development has occurred in the western waters of Hong Kong, where generally only the humpback dolphin occurs, most of the work has been conducted on that species. Development of large infrastructure projects (such as airports, bridges, expressways, power plants, fuel facilities, and container ports) in Hong Kong often results in land reclamation, dredging and dumping of spoils, pipe and cable laying, percussive and bored piling work, underwater blasting, large increases in vessel traffic, and other impacts.

Combined effects of noise and of other physical pollutions on people may cause amplification of their negative impact. If the noise pollution level from the object in a residential area exceeds the permissible levels (MPL), noise protection measures can be initiated. Today, the most common design decisions for noise protection are sound absorbing construction, noise screens and barriers, acousting housings, soundproff cabins.

High noise levels can cause headaches, irritation, fatigue, impaired sleep, headache, and tinnitus and have resulted in an inability to hear alarms. Speech intelligibility may be more impaired for crew understanding non-native language in a noisy environment. No hearing loss occurred, but significant effects on crew performance and communication occurred. Permanent Threshold Shifts (PTS) have not been observed in the US shuttle program. Russian specification for noise in spacecraft is 60 dBA (awake) and 50 dBA (asleep) while the U. S. noise specification on ISS is NC 50 (awake) and NC 40 (asleep) with a 85 dBA hazard limit. Background noise levels of ISS modules have measured 56 - 69 dBA. Treadmill exercise operations measure 77 dBA. Alarms are required to be 20 dBA above ambient. Hearing protection is recommended when noise exceeds 60 dB 24 hour Leq. Countermeasures include hearing protection and design/ engineering controls.
