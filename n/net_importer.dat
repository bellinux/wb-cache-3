5|$|Zimbabwe's {{commercial}} farming {{sector was}} traditionally {{a source of}} exports and foreign exchange, and provided 400,000 jobs. However, the government's land reform program badly damaged the sector, turning Zimbabwe into a <b>net</b> <b>importer</b> of food products. For example, between 2000 and 2016 annual wheat production fell from 250,000 tons to 60,000 tons, maize was reduced from two million tons to 500,000 tons and cattle slaughtered for beef fell from 605,000 to 244,000.

40|$|Prior {{research}} on the sensitivity of firms to exchange rates has documented a puzzling result: while firm stock returns are only weakly related to contemporaneous changes in exchange rates, they are related to lagged exchange rate changes. This result is consistent with market inefficiency since the stock market appears to respond to exchange rate changes with a delay when the predictable effects of dollar movements are confirmed in financial statements (Bartov and Bodnar, 1995). We re-examine these results for samples of net exporters and <b>net</b> <b>importers,</b> where <b>net</b> <b>importers</b> (exporters) are firms with a strong positive (negative) correlation between abnormal returns and contemporaneous exchange rate changes over the previous 20 quarters. In contrast with prior results, we find a strong relation between abnormal returns and contemporaneous exchange rate changes. We show that our result is due primarily to subsets of firms and sample periods not examined earlier; specifically, the relation is strongest for <b>net</b> <b>importers</b> (the international firms examined by others {{are more likely to}} be net exporters) and more recent years. Although we confirm the lagged relation observed by others, we document many conflicting aspects of this relationship, and hence are reluctant to interpret it as market inefficiency...|$|R

40|$|We examine carbon {{emission}} transfers via trade among countries over a 20 -year period. A net transfer of {{carbon emission}} {{means that the}} emission embodied in a country’s imports exceeds the emission embodied in exports. We consider a number of socio-economic drivers to explain variations in such net transfers across countries. Our findings show a U-shaped curvilinear relationship between countries’ GDP per capita and their net carbon transfer, suggesting that countries are typically heavy <b>net</b> <b>importers</b> of carbon in early phases of economic development, become balanced or even net exporters of carbon in middle stages of development, {{and then return to}} being heavy <b>net</b> <b>importers</b> of carbon in later stages of development.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{dimension of}} international trade is attaining increased importance. This article describes a method to calculate complete physical trade flows for all countries which report their trade to the UN. The method {{is based on the}} UN Comtrade database and it was used to calculate world-wide physical trade flows for all reporting countries in nine selected years between 1962 and 2005. The results show increasing global trade with global direct material trade flows reaching about 10 Â billionÂ tonnes in 2005, corresponding to a physical trade volume of about 20 Â billionÂ tonnes (adding both total imports and total exports). The share from European countries is declining, mainly in favour of Asian countries. The dominant traded commodity in physical units was fossil fuels, mainly oil. Physical trade balances were used to identify the dominant resource suppliers and demanders. Australia was the principal resource supplier over the period with a diverse material export structure. It was followed by mainly oil-exporting countries with varying volumes. As regards to regions, Latin America, south-east Asian islands and central Asia were big resource exporters, mostly with increasing absolute amounts of net exports. The largest <b>net</b> <b>importers</b> were Japan, the United States and single European countries. Emerging countries like the 'Asian Tigers' with major industrial productive sectors are growing <b>net</b> <b>importers,</b> some of them to an even higher degree than European countries. Altogether, with the major exception of Australia and Canada, industrialized countries are <b>net</b> <b>importers</b> and developing countries and transition countries are net exporters, but there are important differences within these groups.
