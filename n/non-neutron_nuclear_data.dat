The successful development of advanced nuclear systems for sustainable energy production depends on high-level modelling capabilities for the reliable and cost-effective design and safety assessment of such systems, and for the interpretation of key benchmark experiments needed for performance and safety evaluations. High-quality <b>nuclear</b> <b>data,</b> in particular complete and accurate information about the nuclear reactions taking place in advanced reactors and the fuel cycle, are {{an essential component of}} such modelling capabilities.

40|$|The {{work scope}} of this project related to the Work Packages of “Uncertainty Reduction Analyses” {{with the goal of}} {{reducing}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>data</b> uncertainties is to produce a set of improved <b>nuclear</b> <b>data</b> to be used both {{for a wide range of}} validated advanced fast reactor design calculations, and for providing guidelines for further improvements of the ENDF/B files (i. e. ENDF/B-VII, and future releases). Recent extensive sensitivity/uncertainty studies, performed within an international OECD-NEA initiative, have quantified for the first time the impact of current <b>nuclear</b> <b>data</b> uncertainties on design parameters of the major FCR&D and GEN-IV systems, and in particular on Na-cooled fast reactors with different fuels (oxide or metal), fuel composition (e. g. different Pu/TRU ratios) and different conversion ratios. These studies have pointed out that present uncertainties on the <b>nuclear</b> <b>data</b> should be significantly reduced, in order to get full benefit from the advanced modeling and simulation initiatives. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>data</b> plays a fundamental role in performance calculations of advanced reactor concepts. Uncertainties in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>data</b> propagate into uncertainties in calculated integral quantities, driving margins and costs in advanced system design, operation and safeguards. This package contributes to the resolution of technical, cost, safety, security and proliferation concerns in a multi-pronged, systematic, science-based R&D approach. The <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Data</b> effort identifies and develops small scale, phenomenon-specific experiments informed by theory and engineering to reduce the number of large, expensive integral experiments. The <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Data</b> activities are leveraged by effective collaborations between experiment and theory, between DOE programs and offices, at national laboratories and universities, both domestic and international. The primary objective is to develop reactor core sensitivity and uncertainty analyses that identify the improvement needs of key <b>nuclear</b> <b>data</b> which would facilitate fast spectrum system optimization and assure safety performance. The inclusion of fast spectrum integral experiment data is key to minimizing the impact of <b>nuclear</b> <b>data</b> uncertainties on reactor core performance calculations, thus providing the best <b>nuclear</b> <b>data</b> needs assessment.
