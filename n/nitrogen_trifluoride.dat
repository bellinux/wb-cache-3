5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It {{functions as a}} Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, {{like some}} of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the main greenhouse gases listed above, other greenhouse gases include sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons (see IPCC list of greenhouse gases). Some greenhouse gases are not often listed. For example, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> has a high global warming potential (GWP) but is only present in very small quantities.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{application}} of fluorine gas, consuming up to 7,000metrictons annually, {{is in the}} preparation of [...] for the nuclear fuel cycle. Fluorine is used to fluorinate uranium tetrafluoride, itself formed from uranium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid. Fluorine is monoisotopic, so any mass differences between [...] molecules are due to the presence of [...] or , enabling uranium enrichment via gaseous diffusion or gas centrifuge. About 6,000metrictons per year go into producing the inert dielectric [...] for high-voltage transformers and circuit breakers, eliminating the need for hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls associated with [...] devices. Several fluorine compounds are used in electronics: rhenium and tungsten hexafluoride in chemical vapor deposition, tetrafluoromethane in plasma etching and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> in cleaning equipment. Fluorine is also used in the synthesis of organic fluorides, but its reactivity often necessitates conversion first to the gentler , , or , which together allow calibrated fluorination. Fluorinated pharmaceuticals use sulfur tetrafluoride instead.|$|E
500|$|Five {{nitrogen}} fluorides are known. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> (NF3, first {{prepared in}} 1928) is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily {{produced by the}} electrolysis of molten ammonium fluoride dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Like carbon tetrafluoride, {{it is not at}} all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with copper, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give tetrafluorohydrazine (N2F4). The cations [...] and [...] are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as arsenic pentafluoride), as is ONF3, which has aroused interest due to the short N–O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N–F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF2•. Fluorine azide (FN3) is very explosive and thermally unstable. Dinitrogen difluoride (N2F2) exists as thermally interconvertible cis and trans isomers, and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN3.|$|E
500|$|Industrially, ammonia (NH3) is {{the most}} {{important}} compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound, because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers. It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of hydrogen bonding has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (−78°C) and boiling (−33°C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant, and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH3 is weaker than that in H2O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH3 rather than two in H2O. It is a weak base in aqueous solution (pK'b 4.74); its conjugate acid is ammonium, [...] It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, [...] It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride.</b> Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.|$|E

Today <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> is {{predominantly}} employed in the cleaning of the PECVD chambers in the high-volume production of liquid-crystal displays and silicon-based thin-film solar cells. In these applications NF3 is initially broken down in situ by a plasma. The resulting fluorine atoms are the active cleaning agents that attack the polysilicon, silicon nitride and silicon oxide. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> can be used as well with tungsten silicide, and tungsten produced by CVD. NF3 has been considered as an environmentally preferable substitute for sulfur hexafluoride or perfluorocarbons such as hexafluoroethane.The process utilization of the chemicals applied in plasma processes is typically below 20%.Therefore some of the PFCs and also some of the NF3 always escape into the atmosphere.

50|$|In 1966 W. E. Tolberg first {{synthesized}} a five valent {{nitrogen compound}} of nitrogen and fluorine when tetrafluoroammonium compounds, tetrafluoroammonium heaxafluoroantimonate NF4SbF6 and tetrafluoroammonium heaxafluoroarsenate NF4AsF6 were made. In 1971 C. T. Goetschel announced {{the preparation of}} NF4BF4 and also produced a white solid assumed to be tetrafluoroammonium fluoride (NFF−). This was made by treating <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> and fluorine with 3MeV electron radiation at 77K. It decomposed above 143K back into those ingredients.

50|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> is {{also used}} in {{hydrogen}} fluoride and deuterium fluoride lasers, which are types of chemical lasers. It is preferred to fluorine gas due to its convenient handling properties, reflecting its considerable stability.|$|E
50|$|Fluorinated gases (F-gases) are {{man-made}} gases {{that can}} stay in the atmosphere for centuries and contribute to a global greenhouse effect.

50|$|Difluoroamino sulfur pentafluoride {{is stable}} at room temperature, but {{decomposes}} on the timescale of hours at 80 °C. Decomposition results in sulfur tetrafluoride and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride.</b> It is not stable above 220 °C. It is stable with water or stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>tri{{fluoride}}</b> {{is a rare}} {{example of}} a binary fluoride that can be prepared directly from the elements only at very uncommon conditions, such as electric discharge. After first attempting the synthesis in 1903, Otto Ruff prepared <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> by the electrolysis of a molten mixture of ammonium fluoride and hydrogen fluoride. It proved to be far less reactive than the other nitrogen trihalides nitrogen trichloride, nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide, {{all of which are}} explosive.

It is supplied in pressurized cylinders.|$|E

50|$|Chemical lasers are {{powered by}} a {{chemical}} reaction, and can achieve high powers in continuous operation.

This is a high pressure oxidation. Over 33 GPa it will form a stable ionic compound with formula (NF)2NFF- with space group I4/m. Over 151 GPa this is predicted to transform to NFNF with space group P4/n. A NF5 molecular compound is not stable under any pressure conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{deuterium}} fluoride laser constructionally resembles a rocket engine. In the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride.</b> This reaction produces free excited fluorine radicals. Just after the nozzle, {{the mixture of}} helium and hydrogen or deuterium gas is injected to the exhaust stream; the hydrogen or deuterium reacts with the fluorine radicals, producing excited molecules of deuterium or hydrogen fluoride. The excited molecules then undergo stimulated emission in the optical resonator region of the laser.|$|E
50|$|Chemical lasers are {{powered by}} a {{chemical}} reaction permitting {{a large amount of}} energy to be released quickly. Such very high power lasers are especially of interest to the military, however continuous wave chemical lasers at very high power levels, fed by streams of gasses, have been developed and have some industrial applications. As examples, in the hydrogen fluoride laser (2700-2900 nm) and the deuterium fluoride laser (3800 nm) the reaction is the combination of hydrogen or deuterium gas with combustion products of ethylene in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{production}} of LCD screens uses <b>nitrogen</b> <b>trifluoride</b> (NF3) as an etching fluid during the {{production of}} the thin-film components. NF3 is a potent greenhouse gas, and its relatively long half-life may make it a potentially harmful contributor to global warming. A report in Geophysical Research Letters suggested that its effects were theoretically much greater than better-known sources of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide. As NF3 was not in widespread use at the time, it was not made part of the Kyoto Protocols and has been deemed [...] "the missing greenhouse gas".|$|E
