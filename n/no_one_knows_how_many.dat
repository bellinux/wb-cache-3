500|$|Chess {{has a very}} {{extensive}} literature. In 1913, {{the chess}} historian H.J.R. Murray estimated {{the total number of}} books, magazines, and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5,000. B.H. Wood estimated the number, as of 1949, to be about 20,000. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that, [...] "Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> have been printed." [...] There are two significant public chess libraries: the John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library, with over 32,000 chess books and over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals; and the Chess & Draughts collection at the National Library of the Netherlands, with about 30,000 books. Grandmaster Lothar Schmid owned the world's largest private collection of chess books and memorabilia. David DeLucia's chess library contains 7,000 to 8,000 chess books, a similar number of autographs (letters, score sheets, manuscripts), and about 1,000 items of [...] "ephemera". Dirk Jan ten Geuzendam opines that DeLucia's collection [...] "is arguably the finest chess collection in the world".|$|E
2500|$|Congress had to {{consider}} how to restore to full status and representation within the Union those southern states that had declared their independence from the United States and had withdrawn their representation. Suffrage for former Confederates {{was one of two}} main concerns. A decision needed to be made whether to allow just some or all former Confederates to vote (and to hold office). The moderates in Congress wanted virtually all of them to vote, but the Radicals resisted. They repeatedly imposed the ironclad oath, which would effectively have allowed no former Confederates to vote. Historian Harold Hyman says that in 1866 Congressmen [...] "described the oath as the last bulwark against the return of ex-rebels to power, the barrier behind which Southern Unionists and Negroes protected themselves." [...] Radical Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens proposed, unsuccessfully, that all former Confederates lose the right to vote for five years. The compromise that was reached disenfranchised many Confederate civil and military leaders. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> temporarily lost the vote, but one estimate was that it was as high as 10,000 to 15,000 out of a total white population of roughly eight million.|$|E

Negotiations between Tippoo and the English went on till March, when a treaty was signed. By its provisions, Tippoo should have handed back all his prisoners. He murdered large numbers of them, but 1000 British soldiers, and 1600 Sepoys obtained their liberty. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> were retained of the number, calculated at 200,000, of natives carried off from the countries overrun by Hyder's troops.

60|$|That for six {{thousand}} years--and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> millions of ages before--the great whales {{should have been}} spouting all over the sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, {{as with so many}} sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings-- that all this should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapor--this is surely a noteworthy thing.|$|E
60|$|They rode on horses--stolen horses, of course. The leopard {{heard the}} clatter of hoofs and looked back. Junkie drew nearer to the gnarled tree; the leopard looked forward. Never was savage beast more {{thoroughly}} perplexed. Anxiety glared in his eyes; exasperation grinned in his teeth; indecision quivered in the muscles of his tail. Just at that moment Booby caught sight of his spotted skin. Had the leopard been less perturbed {{he would have been}} too wise to allow his carcass to appear. A poisoned arrow instantly quivered in his flank. It acted like a spur; with an angry growl and a clear bound of <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> feet, he re-entered the jungle and fled to the mountains.|$|E

60|$|So {{passed that}} first year, which many an {{intending}} missionary before Patteson {{has found a}} crucial test which he has not taken into his calculations. The soreness of the wrench from home is still fresh, {{and there is no}} settled or regular work to occupy the mind, while the hardships are exactly of the kind that have not been anticipated, and are most harassing, though unsatisfying to the imagination, and all this when the health is adapting itself to a new climate, and the spirits are least in time, so that the temper is in the most likely condition to feel and resent any apparent slight or unexpected employment. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> high hopes have sunk, how many intended workers have been turned aside, by this ordeal of the first year.|$|E

But Lord Ballindine had made up his mind, or rather, Blake had made it up for him, and the thing was to be done; the risk was to be run, and the preparations--the sweats and the gallops, the physicking, feeding, and coddling, kept Frank tolerably well employed; though the whole process would have gone on quite as well, had he been absent.|$|E

However, {{there was no other}} way of getting the ring, and I could not see how, without it, I could persuade the lady superior to leave her convent with you all; and to tell you the truth, I would rather have got it that way than any other. The bishop is, in my opinion, a man who deserves no respect. He has terrorized all the north of Portugal, has caused scores of better men than himself to be imprisoned or put to death, and has now by his folly and ignorance cost the lives of <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> thousand men, and brought about the sack of Oporto." ...|$|E
