500|$|One {{experiment}} {{designed to}} evaluate insight and problem-solving ability involved {{a piece of}} meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and [...] "the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable trial-and-error learning." [...] This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are 'inventors', implying that they can solve problems. Many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour, but it <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non-human animals.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of her {{appearances}} in Angel, Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, [...] "When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning." [...] Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> such a joy to play as an actress, because {{there have been so many}} chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny [...] I get to be all those different things rolled into one. Getting this role, in hindsight... God I made a good decision, or they did. Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to [...] "selfish, superficial Los Angeles", which turned out to be her [...] "trial by fire".|$|E
500|$|... "Hellbound" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B". John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, gave the episode a positive review and complimented its exploration of Reyes' character. He rated it an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "overall, a wonderful unexpected {{look into the}} underlying motivations of a character that, until <b>now,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> only vaguely drawn for the audience. Thankfully it is completely consistent {{with what we have}} seen before". Keegan added that the [...] "greatest drawback may be that we are unlikely to see this theme explored much further, since this is now officially the final season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the entry's plot—comparing it to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze" [...] and the fourth season episode [...] "The Field Where I Died"—calling the writing [...] "delightfully subtle". They praised Amann's misdirection, noting that the episode contains several red herrings. Shearman and Pearson also praised the episode's effects, calling the skinless bodies [...] "the high point of the series' trading in gore". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "unexpectedly entertaining" [...] and praised the script's attempts to shed more light on Reyes' character.|$|E
500|$|Don't Look <b>Now</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> much {{admired by}} and an {{influence}} on subsequent filmmakers. [...] Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don't Look Now considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and says that he wants things he has written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now. Similarly, Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to '60s and '70s psychological horror, citing Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining as particular examples. Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier's Antichrist have also been observed, with Antichrist's cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, commenting that he has watched Don't Look Now more times than any other film. Fabrice Du Welz, whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don't Look Now, has stated {{that it is a}} film he is [...] "obsessed with", and one of his favourites, while Lynne Ramsay cited it as {{an influence on}} We Need to Talk about Kevin, which incidentally is also produced by Roeg's son, Luc. Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don't Look Now while directing her debut feature, Texas Killing Fields.|$|E

2500|$|According to Smochină's own {{rendition}} of the encounter, {{when asked about his}} vision on the Moldavian question, Lenin began by stating: [...] "You Moldavians have no interest in fighting on the side of Russia, who for centuries <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> enslaving your kind. Culturally, Moldavians are far more advanced than Russians." [...] The thing to do, Lenin said, was for Moldavians to take up arms and fight against the two [...] "oppressors": Russia and [...] "landowners' Romania". According to Smochină, Lenin openly agreed that Moldavians, Bessarabians and Romanians were in essence the same demonym: [...] "Take inspiration from your Romanian blood brothers, but, again, beware of falling into the paws of Romanian boyar exploiters. [...] all Moldavians are Romanians".|$|E

2500|$|Companies {{including}} Reliance Industries Limited (E), RNRL, Vikas WSP Limited {{have expressed}} interest in exploring in India, which is estimated to hold 500 to 2,000 trillion cubic meter of recoverable shale gas. Reliance Industries paid a reported US$1.7 bn for a 40% share in Atlas Energy's leasehold in the Marcellus shale gas play in the eastern US. [...] A complication to shale gas in India is that the government-issued leases for conventional petroleum exploration do not include unconventional sources such as shale gas. However, this policy <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> changed under the Hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy, which provides a uniform license for exploration of conventional and unconventional oil and gas resources and includes private participation.|$|E
