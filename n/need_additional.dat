5|$|Some enzymes do not <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> {{components}} to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors {{to be bound}} for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|E
5|$|The average modern horse on good hay or pasture {{with light}} work usually {{does not need}} supplements; however, horses {{subjected}} to stress due to age, intensive athletic work, or reproduction may <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> nutrition. Extra fat and protein are sometimes added to the horse's diet, along with vitamin and mineral supplements. There are hundreds, if not thousands of commercially prepared vitamin and mineral supplements on the market, many tailored to horses with specialized needs.|$|E

25|$|Initial NATO {{planning}} for a possible no-fly zone took place in late February and early March, especially by NATO members France and the United Kingdom. France and the UK were early supporters of a no-fly zone and had sufficient airpower to impose a no-fly zone over the rebel-held areas, although they might <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> assistance for a more extensive exclusion zone.|$|E
25|$|Inverted or {{retracted}} nipples {{sometimes make}} {{attachment to the}} breast difficult. These mothers <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> support to feed their babies. Treatment is started {{after the birth of}} the baby. The nipple is manually stretched out several times a day. A pump or a plastic syringe is used to draw out the nipple and the baby is then put to the breast.|$|E
25|$|The name transversage {{method is}} often used as a synonym to {{transfer}} method, but is actually a slight twist to the latter. In the transfer method proper the wine is transferred to a tank directly after ageing on lees, while in the transversage method the wine is riddled and disgorged before transfer to a tank. Consequently the transversage method doesn't <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> clarification before bottling.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Myer {{used his}} office {{downtown}} in Washington, D.C. {{to house the}} Signal Corps School. When it was found to <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> space, he sought out other locations. First came Fort Greble, one of the Defenses of Washington during the Civil War, and when that proved inadequate, Myer chose Fort Whipple, on Arlington Heights overlooking the national capital. The size and location were outstanding. The school remained there for over 20 years and ultimately was renamed Fort Myer.|$|E
25|$|With new fleet {{expenditures}} outpacing earnings, Air Canada officials {{indicated that}} the carrier would <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> sources of capital to fund their modernization. By 1985 the Canadian government was indicating a willingness to privatize both Canadian National Railways and Air Canada. In 1988 Air Canada was privatized, and 43% of shares were sold on the public market, with the initial public offering completed in October of that year. By this time, long-haul rival CP Air had become Canadian Airlines International following their acquisition by Pacific Western Airlines.|$|E
25|$|In 87 BC, Metellus Pius’ command was extended, {{with his}} {{appointment}} as Propraetor, responsible for continuing {{the war against}} Samnium. Later that year, however, saw a dispute between the two consuls Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gnaeus Octavius flare up into war. Cinna, expelled from Rome, met up with the exiled Gaius Marius, and both laid siege to Rome. During the early phase of this conflict, the Senate, fearing that they may <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> troops and commanders, ordered Metellus Pius to negotiate a peace with the Samnites.|$|E

25|$|Altogether, 12,456 Air National Guardsmen {{participated in}} Air Force {{operations}} during the Persian Gulf crisis/first Gulf War. When called upon, Air National Guardsmen were immediately prepared {{to perform their}} missions alongside their active Air Force counterparts. They did not <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> training or new equipment to do their jobs. They were integrated into most of the Air Force's operational missions, flying strategic airlift and aerial refueling sorties, and manning aerial ports. Air National Guardsmen also flew fighter, attack, aerial reconnaissance, special operations, and tactical theater airlift missions.|$|E
25|$|Lindbergh {{later said}} that this year was {{critical}} to his development as both a focused, goal-oriented individual and as an aviator. The Army did not <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> active-duty pilots, however, so immediately following graduation Lindbergh returned to civilian aviation as a barnstormer and flight instructor, although as a reserve officer he also continued to do some part-time military flying by joining the 110th Observation Squadron, 35th Division, Missouri National Guard, in St. Louis. He was soon promoted to 1st Lieutenant, and to captain in July 1926.|$|E
25|$|Four paid kitchen staff, three trainee {{chefs and}} 25 {{rostered}} volunteers provide a nutritious three-course lunch daily for around 350 people. Everybody is welcome.

25|$|A walker {{or walking}} frame or Rollator {{is a tool}} for {{disabled}} people who <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> support to maintain balance or stability while walking. It consists of a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes, such as for children, or for heavy people. Modern walkers are height-adjustable. The front two legs of the walker {{may or may not}} have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.|$|E
25|$|After the Rada {{voted down}} the law several times, the Ministry devised a {{workaround}} to overcome the parliamentary opposition, and in early 2000 the military announced that in the upcoming rotation of the Ukrainian servicemen of the Kosovo mission scheduled for July 2000, the ministry would deploy the Ukrainian part of battalion, claiming that since the Ukrainian participation in the mission per se had already {{been approved by the}} parliament, choosing the unit to replace the troops during the rotation did not <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> parliamentary approval. Fearing that such inevitable deployment would undermine its prestige, the parliament ratified the 1997 agreement on April 6, 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 China {{passed its}} Law on the Protection of Endangered Species after ratifying the UN Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), making {{it illegal to}} use and trade {{unlicensed}} pythons. To regulate the use of python skins, China's State Forestry Administration introduced a certification scheme between python skin sellers in Southeast Asia and musical instrument makers in China. From January 1, 2005, new regulations also require Erhus to have a certificate from the State Forestry Administration, which certify that the Erhu python skin is not made with wild pythons, but from farm-raised pythons. Individuals are allowed to take up to two Erhus out of China when traveling; commercial buyers <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> export certificates.|$|E

25|$|Oxygenate {{blending}} adds oxygen-bearing compounds such as MTBE, ETBE, ethanol, and biobutanol. The {{presence of}} these oxygenates reduces {{the amount of carbon}} monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas. In many areas throughout the US, oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants. For example, in Southern California, fuel must contain 2% oxygen by weight, resulting in a mixture of 5.6% ethanol in gasoline. The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline (RFG) or oxygenated gasoline, {{or in the case of}} California, California reformulated gasoline. The federal requirement that RFG contain oxygen was dropped on 6 May 2006 because the industry had developed VOC-controlled RFG that did not <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Specifically, {{pregnant}} and breastfeeding women <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> fluids to stay hydrated. The Institute of Medicine (U.S.) recommends that, on average, men consume 3.0 liters and women 2.2 liters; pregnant women should increase intake to 2.4 liters (10 cups) and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially {{large amount of}} fluid is lost during nursing. Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages (caffeinated included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through urine and feces, through sweating, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.|$|E
25|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} chemoembolization (TACE) {{is usually}} performed for unresectable tumors or {{as a temporary}} treatment while waiting for liver transplant. TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure it to restrict the tumor’s vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE {{has been shown to}} increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure may are followed with CT scans and may <b>need</b> <b>additional</b> TACE procedures if the tumor persists. As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of vascular invasion, and smallest tumors. TACE is not suitable for big tumors (>8nbsp&cm), the presence of portal vein thrombus, tumors with a portal-systemic shunt, and patients with poor liver function.|$|E
