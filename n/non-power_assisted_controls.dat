40|$|Abstract — This Paper {{describes}} the generalised structure of Force-Sensor-less Power <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> (FSPAC) {{which is an}} essential technology to design a feedback control system in a human friendly way. Paper clarifies regarding generalised structure of Force-Sensor-less power <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> using two force observer. The Force, {{which is used to}} <b>assist</b> the <b>control</b> system is estimated by using encoders instead of using force-sensors. This Paper also compares other FSPAC’s with the FSPAC using two observer methodology. Since, this Feedback control system uses positive feedback, the Force-sensor-less Power <b>Assist</b> <b>control</b> deals with weak robustness problem. To increase Robustness of the system, Control design based on disturbance observer with variable gain is also discussed in this paper. Finally paper concludes considering its advantages disadvantages and applications. Keywords—Force Estimation, inner observer, Structure of FSPAC, two observer, variable gain...|$|R

40|$|Powered exoskeletons are {{becoming}} popular especially in fields of nursing care and agriculture. We have been developing a powered exoskeleton {{that is supposed}} to be used in case of a nuclear hazard. Conventional powered exoskeletons typically use electromyographs (EMG), force switches, or force sensors on the wear's feet. Unfortunately, the former suffers from the decline in measuring accuracy or slips of EMG sensor by sweating. The force-switch-based <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> method has a difficulty in speedy <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> of walk because it needs a few steps of a walk for the recognition. The force-sensorbased <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> method realizes a rapid <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> but the assistive motion is defined beforehand in general. We propose a new approach for power assist controller based on user motion prediction using 9 axis motion sensor. The motion sensor detects the angle and angular velocity of the wear's limb and estimates the appropriate angle of the powered attachment according to the estimated motion. This report conducts experiments with one degree of freedom powered arm to evaluate the proposed method by EMG sensors and a force sensor...|$|R

Nomenclature of mechanical ventilation has become more standardized and these terms are no longer preferred but still may be seen in older research there are many different names that historically were used to reference CMV but now reference <b>Assist</b> <b>Control.</b> Names such as: volume control ventilation, and volume cycled ventilation in modern usage refer to the <b>Assist</b> <b>Control</b> mode.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to verify that the patient/ventilator {{interaction}} is similar, regardless of the mode of assisted mechanical ventilation (i. e. pressure- or volume-limited) used, if tidal volume (VT) and peak inspiratory flow (PIF) are matched. Therefore, the authors compared the effects of three different modes of assisted ventilation on the work of breathing (WOB) and gas exchange in patients with acute respiratory failure. For Protocol 1, in seven patients, the authors compared pressure support, <b>assist</b> pressure <b>control</b> and <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> (with square and decelerating wave inspiratory flow pattern) set to deliver the same VT and PIF. For Protocol 2, in another 10 patients, the authors compared pressure support and <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> with high (0. 8 L x s(- 1)) and low (0. 6 L x s(- 1)) PIFs set to deliver the same VT. In Protocol 1, there was no difference in WOB and gas exchange between the three modes of assisted ventilation tested. In Protocol 2, the decrease of PIFs during <b>assist</b> <b>control</b> significantly increased WOB. In conclusion, different modes of assisted ventilation similarly reduce work of breathing and provide adequate gas exchange at fixed tidal volume and peak inspiratory flow only. During <b>assist</b> <b>control,</b> tidal volume and peak inspiratory flow (set by the physician) are the main determinants of the patient/ventilator interaction...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to associate the healthy area of the lung (evaluated by radiography) with the data of respiratory mechanics in children with atelectasis after cardiac surgery, under mechanical ventilation in the <b>assisted</b> <b>controlled</b> mode. Altogether, 46 children were selected, but 16 were excluded due to irregular respiratory waves or lack of the data on arterial blood gases. A group of 30 children under <b>assisted</b> <b>controlled</b> mode were analyzed, and 10 from this group developed atelectasis. The data were analyzed before and after the onset of atelectasis, and respiratory mechanics was correlated to radiography. We also analyzed the data related to arterial blood gas of these children - who initially had no pulmonary complication - to verify possible changes due to <b>assisted</b> <b>controlled</b> cycles. Atelectasis may modify some parameters of respiratory mechanics. In the association of the healthy area of the lung with the respiratory mechanics, the Spearman correlation results showed statistical significance of the lung area with airway resistance (&# 961;=&# 8722; 0. 648 and p= 0. 043). Our results show that it is possible to analyze respiratory mechanics waves by selecting controlled cycles in the <b>assisted</b> <b>controlled</b> mode, since we found insignificant changes in potential ionic hydrogen. The analysis of respiratory mechanics allows checking lung function and undesired lung injuries; the analysis of respiratory mechanics can be daily performed in these children to have important information on the pulmonary function. Our research also showed that under the <b>assisted</b> <b>controlled</b> mode is also possible to evaluate respiratory mechanics...|$|R
