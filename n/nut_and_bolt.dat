25|$|During {{the post-war}} period, Lionel {{produced}} a construction set, utilizing a unique component set. While competitive sets used <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> fasteners, the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with rubber grommets, {{eliminating the need}} for tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum base plate was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric AC motor with a worm drive and reduction gearset that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.|$|E

2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads and both the <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> are, ideally, independently supported, the nut by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the thread flanks when subjected to radial loads, which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|E

50|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} {{was based on}} the simplest of things, which in effect made them very reliable. The locomotive was operated by design from the outside (side of engine) and wasn't equipped with a dead man device to stop the locomotive automatically in case of incapacity of the operator. There were two manual brakes: a handle and a foot brake. As the handle could be moved by in-train forces while dead-heading it was required to be fixed by a <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt.</b> Upon taking the locomotive into service again, it was necessary to loosen the <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt.</b> In some cases this was forgotten and the result was that the operator couldn't brake; many Siks have suffered collision damage due to this.|$|E
