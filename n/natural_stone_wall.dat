Each stone—weighing between 15,000 to 32,000 pounds—was shaped by hand on-site in order to create an interlocking wall system holding the natural earth below the upper plazas and accentuating the elevation variations of the project site. The walls use more than one million pounds of limestone from throughout Ohio, Indiana, and Kansas.|$|E
40|$|Patch-based texture {{synthesis}} algorithms produce reasonable {{results for}} a wide variety of texture classes. They preserve global structure, but often introduce unwanted visual artifacts along patch boundaries. Pixel-based synthesis algorithms, on the other hand, tend to blur out small objects while maintaining a consistent texture impression, which in return doesn’t necessarily resemble the input texture. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and hybrid algorithm. Our algorithm adaptively splits patches so as to use as large as possible patches while staying within a user-defined error tolerance for the mismatch in the overlap region. Using large patches improves the reproduction of global structure. The remaining errors in the overlap regions are eliminated using pixel-based re-synthesis. We introduce an optimized ordering for the re-synthesis of these erroneous pixels using morphological operators, which ensures that every pixel has enough valid (i. e., error-free) neighboring pixels. Examples and comparisons with existing techniques demonstrate that our approach improves over previous texture synthesis algorithms, especially for textures with well-visible, possibly anisotropic structure, such as <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> or scales...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{experimental}} studies, {{conducted by}} some of the authors, on in-plane response of tuff masonry walls strengthened with an innovative cementitious matrix composite grid (CMG) system confirmed that the CMG system could satisfy basic design requirements such as compatibility with the tuff masonry support (i. e., in terms of good bond properties), reversibility of the intervention and strengthening effectiveness. However, very large scatter was found in the experimental outcomes. Micromodeling and some parametric analyses were adopted to understand the contribution of basic material (mortar, tuff blocks and CMG strengthening) and the effect of the workmanship defects on the structural behavior of a <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall.</b> In order to conduct the analyses, finite-element method models of the elements have been compared to experimental data and they were found to be in good agreement with the test data. Significant improvements of strength and in the postpeak response were achieved installing different layouts of the CMG system. However the strengthening intervention had a negligible influence on the initial stiffness of the walls and this means that it has a reduced impact on the behavior of the existing structure...|$|E

Immersive, semi-immersive and augmented visualizations can be realized in everyday environments – {{without the need for}} special projection screens and dedicated display configurations. Limitations of mobile devices, such as low resolution and small field of view, focus constrains, and ergonomic issues can be overcome in many cases by the utilization of projection technology. Thus, applications that do not require mobility can benefit from efficient spatial augmentations. Examples range from edutainment in museums (such as storytelling projections onto <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> in historical buildings) to architectural visualizations (such as augmentations of complex illumination simulations or modified surface materials in real building structures).

40|$|My {{thesis is}} that culture and nature {{are the first}} to be ignored by the broad arm of globalization, and we cannot afford to {{recklessly}} abandon the cultures and ecosystems that define our world. Architecture cannot become yet another by-product of globalization but must reflect on, respond, and belong to the specific natural and cultural environment in which they exist. Given a site in Marfa, Texas and a program of an Institute of Contemporary Art, I studied extensively the culture and history of West Texas in order to understand what a building there should be. In my research, I discovered that living in West Texas boiled down to two very simple things: weather and survival. With this in mind, I studied the dog-trot house and the wrap-around porch house extensively and adapted my design off the precedent of these two styles. Thus, I designed a building that had an equality of indoor and outdoor and space, used the venturi effect to passively cool the spaces, and used <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> and other vernacular materials that work effectively in the climate and create a building that will stand the test of time.

Stone as building material was originating from rocks in the near territory, resulting an absolute harmony with the natural environment. From a hydrological and hydrostatical point of view, many of the protective type stone structures (terraces, dams) had gaps in their main body for passage of the water, significantly reducing the hydrostatic loads and increasing their stability. Finally, stone constructions as terraces, gutters, benches and walls protect agricultural lands and increase the soil moisture making them productive.

50|$|The Hafen Riesbach, or Riesbach harbour area, is {{situated}} between Seefeldquai and Blatterwiese. The harbour {{is used as}} a private-owned marina. In 2004, the old kiosk at the popular open lido at Riesbachstrasse was replaced by a building with a windowed face. The new polygonal pavilion was designed by the architects Andreas Furrimann and Gabrielle Hächler, and now houses a small restaurant and an annexed ZüriWC public toilet. The colour of the windows is reflected by the surroundings, and the pavilion is illuminated in the evening hours. The original seawall front is 200 m long, and was renovated in 2003 and 2006 but not fully renewed due to risk of collapse; thus the <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> dry <b>wall</b> was rebuilt in the same way. The Seefeldquai is an important milestone {{in the work of the}} landscape architect Willi Neukom, as it combines park designs from different design periods. The stone pillar Klausstud originally stood in the lake and served as a border designation of the medieval right of bann (boundary) of the city republic of Zürich. It marked where fishing rights of the urban fishermen ended, and from here the Einsiedeln Abbey pilgrims proved their honour to the Protestantic city by lowering the volume of their prayers and songs. Since the landfills in the construction of the quais, the pillar stands in the middle of the park. The sculpture by Henry Moore is named Sheep Peace, and was donated in 1976.|$|R

40|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>walls</b> are {{relics of}} an {{agricultural}} civilization that once flourished in New England. By identifying {{the locations of}} both historical and present day <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> compositions of post-agricultural landscapes common across the New England region can be assessed with inclusion of historic human-land use interactions. I selected the town of New Shoreham, known as Block Island, as the study site for this thesis. Block Island is located approximately 14. 5 km south of the Rhode Island mainland. The Island has rich land use history which resulted in an extensive network of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> still present across the landscape. Through visual image interpretation of 0. 5 ft (0. 1524 m) resolution orthophotography collected {{in the spring of}} 2011 and a historical topographic map from 1900, I created two datasets of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> containing total lengths of 260. 6 km and 349. 1 km, respectively. Analysis of these two datasets allowed for a temporal analysis to then creation three additional datasets containing <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> between 1900 and 2011 which were matching, removed and built. ^ The presence of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> on Block Island was quantified in connection to ancillary Geographic Information System (GIS) data, representing both natural and anthropogenic classifications of the landscape. The natural landscape is represented by land use and land cover (LULC) available for 1988, 1995, 2003 / 04 and 2011. Data of LULC were further quantified for land cover change frequency (LCCF); the number of land cover changes occurring within each 45 m pixel between 1988 and 2011. The anthropogenic landscape is distinguished by the parcel boundaries for New Shoreham as of 2013 and protected open space as of 2013. The 2011 dataset of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> was quantified for <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> distribution among each land cover class for the temporal range, finding a higher abundance of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> within agricultural lands for 1988 and 1995 and urban lands from 1995 through 2011. ^ The 2011 <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> dataset was also quantified for distribution among each land LCCF class to find a higher proportion of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> contained within lands with the greatest frequency of land cover change. A strong relationship exists between the coincidence of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> and the boundaries of land parcels. Approximately 81 % of parcels are in part bordered by a <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> from the 2011 dataset. Additionally, over 50 % of the lengths <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> within the 5 datasets of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> are bordering parcel boundaries, with the more current datasets of 2011, matching and built having over 80 % of their lengths adjacent to the boundaries of 2013 parcels. Lastly, at least 37 % of the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> current as of 2011 are expected to remain untouched due to being contained within land designated as protected open space. ^ <b>Stone</b> <b>walls</b> represent a human component, among the many broad factors which generate the composition of landscape mosaics. By utilizing abilities of GIS technologies to identify <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> for a large geographic area, this research models initial exploration of the relationship between this historical feature and the landscape it continues to reside within. Additionally, this work adds justification to continue the integration of remote sensing technologies and human’s cultural histories in studying driving factors of land cover change and anthropogenic landscape characterization. ...|$|R
