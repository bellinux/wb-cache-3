5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the match}} {{and they had}} first chance of the match in the fourth minute, but the free-kick by midfielder Murphy was caught by United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Defender Henchoz was shown a yellow card in the 12th minute and United midfielder Giggs had the first shot of the match, which was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. Twice in the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Liverpool had chances from moves down the {{right-hand}} side of the pitch. On both occasions, however, the pass into the penalty area was intercepted. United had a chance to score in the 20th minute. Keane passed to Scholes, who found Giggs on the left-hand side of the pitch. His cross into the penalty area found striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, but his shot went wide of the Liverpool goal.|$|E
25|$|The last quarterfinals saw Co-host Sweden {{going up}} against the Czech team. The first period ended in a 2–1 lead for the Czech Republic after Sweden took the lead early on. Martin Erat scored and gave the Czechs a two-goal lead before Henrik Zetterberg cut into the lead 45 seconds {{before the end of}} the second period. Jonathan Ericsson {{continued}} the Swedish way of climbing back by tying the game just 45 seconds into the last period. Both teams had their chance in the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Sweden hit the post and the Czechs failed to score against Viktor Fasth. 29 seconds before the end, Michálek took the puck away from a Swedish defender and scored. Sweden pulled the goalie and had one last chance but it was missed and the Czech advanced to the semifinals. The Czechs became the first team since Finland in 2000 to eliminate Sweden in a World Championship quarterfinal.|$|E
25|$|Closed mode systems, by definition, {{are closed}} without a vent. When making {{measurement}}s, closed systems take a CO2 measurement of ambient air {{just after the}} soil sample chamber is sealed. This becomes the CO2 reference. The system continues to take measurements at regular intervals over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> until a final CO2 concentration is recorded at a predetermined end time over time. Closed systems have the advantages that they are used by more researchers, and they provide wind proof results. Since there is no vent, wind is not an issue. When using a closed mode system, {{it is important that}} the experimental design include a maximum measuring time for two reasons: First; if the measuring time is too long, an unacceptable positive partial CO2 pressure can build up in the chamber limiting the amount of additional CO2 from entering the chamber, causing a measuring artifact. The second reason is that if a chamber that is closed for too long, it can modify ambient conditions and cause measuring artifacts. Finding the optimal measuring time range is important. Tests on the soil in question can confirm the best time solution, and eliminate the partial CO2 pressure buildup from being a significant issue.|$|E

2500|$|These {{reactions}} {{continued until}} the decreasing temperature and density caused the reactions to become too slow, which occurred at about T = 0.7 MeV (time around 1 second) and {{is called the}} freeze out temperature. At freeze out, the neutron-proton ratio was about 1/6. However, free neutrons are unstable with a mean life of 880 sec; some neutrons decayed in the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before fusing into any nucleus, so the ratio of total neutrons to protons after nucleosynthesis ends is about 1/7. [...] Almost all neutrons that fused instead of decaying ended up combined into helium-4, {{due to the fact}} that helium-4 has the highest binding energy per nucleon among light elements. This predicts that about 8% of all atoms should be helium-4, leading to a mass fraction of helium-4 of about 25%, which is in line with observations. Small traces of deuterium and helium-3 remained as there was insufficient time and density for them to react and form helium-4.|$|E

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{intrinsic}} [...] "prompt effects" [...] of nuclear detonations, that of thermal flash, blast and initial radiation releases. If {{any part of}} the fireball of the nuclear detonation contacts the ground, in what is known as a surface burst. Another, comparatively slowly increasing, radiation hazard will also begin to form in the immediate area. Putting aside the possibility of the detonation occurring during an already established heavy rain-storm, the formation of this life-threatening [...] "delayed nuclear radiation" [...] manifests only when the altitude, or [...] "height of burst" [...] of the explosion, is such that both the fireball and the buoyant updrafts it creates, sufficiently heats and lifts the soil that was below it, into the core of the mushroom cloud.

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} collision, Andrea Doria {{began to take}} on water and started to list {{severely}} to starboard. Within minutes, the list was at least 18°. After the ships separated, Captain Calamai quickly brought the engine controls to [...] "all stop". One of the watertight doors to the engine room may have been missing, though this issue was later determined to be moot. Much more importantly, however, crucial stability was lost by the earlier failure, during routine operations, to ballast the mostly empty fuel tanks as the builders had specified. (Filling the tanks with seawater as the fuel was emptied {{would have resulted in}} more costly procedures to refuel when port was reached). Owing to the immediate rush of seawater flooding the starboard tanks, and because the port tanks had emptied during the crossing, the list was greater than would otherwise have been the case.

2500|$|Captain Brooke's plan, after {{casting off}} the Jolly Bachelor, {{would be to}} ram the prahus while keeping them engaged so as to prevent the pirates from {{boarding}} and overwhelming the Sarawakians. McDougall wrote; [...] "Our plan of action was to silence the brass guns with our rifles, to shake them at their oars with grape and round shot, until we could run into them without their being strong enough to board us. The steamer was kept dodging about within range until {{the time came to}} run in; then we got into a good position to put on all steam and given them the stem, which was always admirably and coolly done by Captain Hewat whenever the order was given by the Rajah Mudah." [...] After the first prahu got away the attention was turned to the second boat which was sailing for the shore and when the Rainbow was 200 yards away the Sulus opened fire with all of their guns. For the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> Brooke chased the prahu at full speed before running right over it and sinking her. The Sarawakians called out to the survivors to hang onto the wreckage and wait for rescue, they then went after the third prahu but the Rainbow ran aground in less than two fathoms of water.|$|E
2500|$|After {{an opening}} period that {{announcer}} Brent Musburger called [...] "as good {{a half of}} college basketball as I've ever seen," [...] the second half began with a successful jump shot by Ewing; Thompson had told the Hoyas to feature him in their offense. The Wildcats reclaimed the lead on a field goal by Harold Jensen, his third of the game, before Pinckney made a shot while being fouled by Ewing. His ensuing free throw attempt was good, and Villanova extended their lead to 34–30. The play began a stretch of about a minute in which Ewing committed three personal fouls {{and had to be}} removed from the Hoyas lineup; with Williams suffering from an ankle injury, Georgetown's two leading players on offense were out of the game. The Wildcats began taking more time on their possessions, and took a 38–32 advantage in the first four minutes of the half. Ewing re-entered the game, but Villanova maintained their lead; three points by McClain brought the score to 41–36. McLain was injured while running into Hoyas player Horace Broadnax and was temporarily forced to the bench. With 10 minutes left in regulation, the Wildcats held a one-point lead, even though they had attempted only five field goals so far in the second half. Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of play, Villanova went up 53–48; after a field goal by Pinckney, the Hoyas called a timeout. The closing six minutes started with a Georgetown scoring run; the Hoyas took a 54–53 lead and gained ball possession off of a turnover by Villanova with about four minutes left.|$|E

In the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> several more bulletins reporting that Kennedy had died were given to Cronkite, including one from CBS's own correspondent Dan Rather that had been reported as confirmation of Kennedy's demise by CBS Radio. As these bulletins came into the newsroom, it was becoming clearer that Kennedy had in fact lost his life. Cronkite, however, stressed that these bulletins were simply reports and not any official confirmation of the President's condition; some of his colleagues recounted in 2013 that his early career as a wire service reporter taught him to wait for official word before reporting a story. Still, as more word came in, Cronkite seemed to be resigned {{to the fact that it}} was only a matter of time before the assassination was confirmed. He appeared to concede this when, several minutes after he received the Rather report, he received word that the two priests who gave the last rites to Kennedy told reporters on the scene that he was dead. Cronkite said that report [...] "seems to be as close to official as we can get", but would not declare it as such. Nor did he do so with a report from Washington, DC that came moments later, which said that government sources were now reporting the President was dead (this information was passed on to ABC as well, which took it as official confirmation and reported it as such; NBC did not report this information at all and chose instead to rely on reports from Charles Murphy and Robert MacNeil to confirm their suspicions).|$|E
2500|$|The protagonist, Bruce Delamitiri, is {{an artist}} {{who works in the}} motion picture industry. Many people in the US think that, by making these movies, Bruce makes killing cool. Numerous {{characters}} throughout the book imply that he encourages everyone who's watching these movies to kill for fun. Bruce, on the other hand, defends himself by telling everyone that he doesn’t think he encourages anyone to do anything. He says that there has always been violence but humans are not like robots, seeing something on the screen does not necessarily make us want to do it ourselves( [...] p.13 [...] "people get up from the movie theatre or the TV and do what they just saw"). He also claims that he is just showing existing violence. Unfortunately for Bruce, Wayne and Scout (a pair of psychopaths known in the media as the [...] "Mall Murderers") have formulated a plan to hold him hostage and have him publicly announce that his movies are responsible for their crimes so they can avoid the death penalty (Wayne has a lengthy speech giving examples of how in America it is possible to be guilty and innocent at the same time.) As the novel progresses, Bruce and a critically injured Brooke Daniels are joined inside his house by his wife and daughter and a TV camera crew. The siege reaches its climax as Wayne holds a ratings monitor and announces on live TV that he will spare the hostages if everyone stops watching the siege in the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> - however, this does not happen and he begins firing as the LAPD begin a frantic attempt to subdue him. Many of the characters die in the ensuing violence and the epilogue of the story reveals grim details as to how all the survivors have found a way of escaping responsibility for the tragedy using varying routes from lawsuits and finding religion to making documentaries which explicitly blame everyone else. The book ends with the line [...] "No one has taken responsibility" [...] — echoing an earlier rant by Bruce that we have created a blame free society in which any problem or shortcoming can be blamed on others rather than accepting responsibility for our own actions.|$|E
