Legal dispositions were plotted in four sample areas with about 4 km 2 (2 km X 2 km) located in São Roque (SP) municipal district. The areas were selected inthe way ofcomprisi <b>ng</b> different <b>stages</b> {{and patterns of}} urban settlements and different natural environmental contexts, principally geomorphological and hidrographical ones. The areas legally destinated to environmental protection (borders and riverheads of bodies of water, mountain tops and high-declivity areas) were delimitated and size-calculated.

A dual-mode engine has been developed where in one mode all engine cylinders fire normally, providing locomotion for the vehicle. In the other mode, one cylinder of the engine is used to compress low pressure residential natural gas (<b>NG),</b> in multiple <b>stages,</b> to a standard U. S. compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle storage tank pressure of 248 bar [3600 psig]. This allows a natural gas vehicle (NGV) to be refueled anywhere there is access to the natural gas distribution network. Experimental studies were conducted on this prototype engine and are reported here. Knowledge gained from applying numerical models combined with empirical results led to the realization of a self-refueling natural gas vehicle. On the test stand, air (a surrogate for NG) was compressed by the engine to over 138 bar [2000 psig] filling an 11. 8 GGE [140 L] tank in 150 min. On the vehicle platform, the integral compressor had an approximate refueling efficiency of 70 %, with an electrical-equivalent parasitic load of 12. 6 %. Idling of non-compression cylinders and the distance between the compressor and the three-way valves used to control the compression staging were noteworthy sources of inefficiency within the system. At the conclusion of the project the vehicle powered by the dual mode engine was driven over 161 km [100 miles] using self-compressed natural gas which originated from the local utility...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Dec. 3, 2014 - June 3, 2015 Given the current abundant supply and cheap price of natural gas (NG) in the United States, {{there is a significant}} opportunity to use this fuel for transportation. However, there are few fueling stations for consumers. To address this need, a dual-mode engine has been developed where in one mode all engine cylinders fire normally, providing locomotion for the vehicle. In the other mode, one cylinder of the engine is used to compress low pressure residential <b>NG,</b> in multiple <b>stages,</b> to a standard U. S. compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle storage tank pressure of 248 bar [3600 psi]. This allows a natural gas vehicle (NGV) to be refueled anywhere there is access to the natural gas distribution network. A detailed numerical model was developed as a design aid to simulate the compressor capability of the engine. Additionally, an original first order time response filling model for the compressor and storage tanks was developed in order to draw insight into and optimize the refueling rate of the system. Using this model, it was determined that the fastest refueling rate occurred at the lowest pressures and that switching between intermediate staging tanks more frequently led to an increase in the overall refueling rate. It also became apparent that the low pressure residential NG (1. 7 kPa [1 / 4 psi]) source was the most limiting factor of the design, as the peak pressure {{at the end of a}} compression stroke is dictated by the inlet pressure. Boosting the inlet pressure a small amount before the initial stage of compression would dramatically improve the refueling rate. Experimental studies were conducted on this prototype engine at the Oregon State University Energy Systems Laboratory located in Bend, OR. Knowledge gained from applying the aforementioned models combined with empirical results led to the realization of a self-refueling natural gas vehicle. The integral compressor had an approximate refueling efficiency of 70...|$|R
40|$|Oligodendrocyte {{progenitor}} cells (OPCs, NG 2 cells, polydendrocytes) are {{a population}} of glial cells in {{the central nervous system}} that continue to proliferate and differentiate into adulthood. The mechanisms underlying the decision to proliferate and self-renew or to generate myelinating oligodendrocytes are not completely understood. Histone methylation is a posttranslational modification of chromatin that has been shown to control cell fate by regulating transcription in various stem and progenitor cell types. The methylation of histone H 3 lysine 27 (H 3 K 27 me 3) is catalyzed by Ezh 2, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 that induces chromatin compaction, thereby repressing transcription of target genes. In this thesis we show that Ezh 2 regulates distinct cell cycle dynamics in NG 2 cells and further modulates their generation of oligodendrocytes. Thus, we identify a novel molecular mechanism which controls cell cycle in this resident population of brain progenitor cells with important implications for understanding development and disease. Using a transgenic mouse model to induce the deletion of Ezh 2 specifically in NG 2 cells, we examined the cell cycle dynamics and fate of NG 2 cells in vivo. In combination with cell cycle phase-specific markers, we further identified at what <b>stage</b> <b>NG</b> 2 cell division was disrupted with the loss of Ezh 2. We also discovered a compensatory population of NG 2 cells that maintained Ezh 2 expression in the knockout, but also had altered cell cycle dynamics. In addition to cell cycle, we found that Ezh 2 modulated the generation of oligodendrocytes, particularly during a precise temporal window after division. To understand the molecular changes associated with these findings, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing and discovered several differentially expressed genes that provide novel insight into the role of Ezh 2 in NG 2 cells, as well as in cells exhibiting compensatory proliferation. The cell cycle length of NG 2 cells has been shown to elongate with age, but these findings provide a molecular mechanism by which cell cycle time is regulated. It is critical for NG 2 cells to properly expand during development to generate oligodendrocytes in a timely manner, and our data show that Ezh 2 is important for cell cycle and oligodendrocyte differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{signalling}} has a {{vital function}} in memory processing, with well-established roles for channels controlling calcium influx from the extracellular environment. In contrast, {{there is limited}} evidence examining the involvement of channels controlling calcium release from intracellular stores, including ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol (1, 4, 5) -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptors (IP 3 Rs). Previous investigations using a single-trial discrimination avoidance task in young chicks revealed the inhibition of RyRs resulted in a persistent retention loss observed by 40 min post-training, during the intermediate stage of memory formation in this model. Extending upon this finding, the aim in this thesis {{was to investigate the}} roles of IP 3 Rs and RyRs in memory formation using the single-trial discrimination avoidance task developed for young chicks. Chicks were trained using both a strongly and weakly reinforced variant of this task which resulted in a persistent or labile memory trace, respectively. The findings were interpreted {{within the framework of the}} Gibbs and <b>Ng</b> three <b>stage</b> memory model derived from this task. The temporally precise task and detail inherent in the model enabled the investigation of molecules likely to activate, or be activated following, RyRs and IP 3 Rs. Using strongly reinforced training, the inhibition of IP 3 Rs, metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR 1) and small-conductance calcium-activated (SK) channels each yielded retention loss by 90 min post-training, 30 min into the protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory (LTM) stage. These findings suggest that IP 3 Rs are required during LTM formation and may be activated following mGluR 1. In addition, IP 3 Rs may provide a calcium source to activate SK channels, potentially impacting on dendritic excitability and synaptic plasticity. Using weakly reinforced training, the administration of a RyR agonist promoted the consolidation of the LTM stage, demonstrating that RyRs are involved in triggering LTM consolidation. Further investigations examined whether RyR-dependent calcium release was dependent upon nitric oxide (NO) and noradrenergic mechanisms, also temporally implicated in the same stage of memory formation. Findings using strongly reinforced training indicated the capacity of NO, RyR-dependent calcium release and noradrenaline (NA) to modulate memory. Retention loss induced by a RyR antagonist was prevented by a NO donor or NA. A RyR agonist also prevented retention loss induced by either NO synthase or β 1 + 2 -adrenoceptor inhibition. However, differential findings were observed using weakly reinforced training, as retention loss facilitated by a RyR agonist was prevented by a β 1 + 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, but not a NO synthase inhibitor. In addition, a RyR antagonist compromised LTM consolidation promoted by a NO donor, but not NA. These findings indicate that NO promotes memory formation through mechanisms dependent upon RyRs. RyRs appear to facilitate memory formation through noradrenergic activation of β 2 -adrenoceptors. These findings demonstrate important roles for intracellular calcium release channels in memory processing. The requirement of RyRs and IP 3 Rs in different stages of memory provides compelling evidence for distinct roles for these channels in memory formation. This thesis addresses a novel area in the neurobiology of memory literature and represents an important step in understanding memory consolidation. Increased knowledge of the function of intracellular calcium stores in memory processing may have important implications for the understanding of disorders with memory impairments which involve altered calcium signalling...|$|R
