After the death of Hugh du Puiset, Burchard was a candidate for the Hugh's old bishopric, but lost out in the end to another candidate. Burchard died in 1196.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{effectiveness}} of a proactive school-wide discipline plan on office discipline referrals, and as a predictor of incidents of chronic disciplinary referrals. The study examined two consecutive school years, 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009, with 2007 - 2008 being the control group without a school-wide discipline plan, and 2008 - 2009 the treatment group with a school-wide discipline plan in place for a full academic year. The purpose was to determine if there would be a statistically significant decrease in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> discipline referrals and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> discipline referrals which resulted in In-School or Out of School suspension. The study also demonstrated through Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s product-moment correlation coefficient regression if academic achievement was a predictor of incidents <b>of</b> chronic <b>office</b> disciplinary referrals which may contribute to future behavioral issues and the need for secondary intervention. The hypotheses stated there would not be a significant difference in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> referrals and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> discipline referrals which result in In-School Suspension and/or Out-of-School Suspension, and students with two or more office discipline referrals would not be significantly different than other students in terms of academic achievement. A dependent t-test showed there were significantly more office discipline referrals and office discipline referrals which resulted in In-School or Out of School suspensions in 2008 - 2009 than in 2007 - 2008. Using Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation, a negative correlation was found between academic achievement and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> discipline referrals. As academic achievement decreased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> discipline referrals increased. Results indicate that academic achievement can serve as an early predictor <b>of</b> chronic <b>office</b> discipline referrals...|$|R

40|$|Patients with {{diabetes}} type 2 should receive regular medical care. We aimed at investigating {{the association between}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> visits and improvement of their cardiovascular-risk factors. Four hundred and ninety patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were followed in a tertiary center were enrolled in this longitudinal study. The minimum follow up period was 3 years. Patient data were extracted from manual or electronic records. Sixty- four percent of cases were females, the mean age was 61 ± 12. 45 years, and the mean disease duration was 6. 5 ± 7. 9 years. The mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> visits was 2. 69 ± 0. 91 per year. Comparing the means {{of each of the}} cardio-vascular risk factors showed a significant decrease in all cardiovascular risk factors, while there was a significant weight gain over the same period. The association between changes in these parameters and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients' <b>office</b> visits per year were not statistically significant. In patients with disease duration less than 5 years, each additional office visits by one visit per year was associated with a decrease in serum total cholesterol by 6. 94 mg/dl. The mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> visits per year in patients older than 60 years old was more than younger patient (p = 0. 001). The decrease in the mean values of the investigated parameters was statistically significant between the first year of follow up and the following years. Yet, these changes were not related to the mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients' <b>office</b> visits per year, which may reflect the poor compliance of patients to treatment regardless <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> their <b>office</b> visits...|$|R

40|$|This survey study among 111 teleworkers {{in a bank}} {{organization}} {{investigated the}} relationship between telework intensity and individual productivity, and whether this relationship was mediated by employees’ intrinsic motivation. Also the moderating role <b>of</b> <b>office</b> hours in the model’s associations was studied. Based on the Job Demands-Resources Model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007) and the professional isolation literature (e. g., Golden, Vega, & Dino, 2008), we developed and tested a set of hypotheses. Partly in line with expectations, we found a direct curvilinear relationship between telework intensity and individual productivity, characterized by a slight, non-significant positive association at the low telework intensity end, and a significant negative association for the high telework intensity end. Strikingly, we neither found support for a mediating role of intrinsic motivation, nor for a moderation effect <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> hours {{in the relationship between}} telework intensity and intrinsic motivation. However, the direct relationship between telework intensity and individual productivity appeared to be moderated by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> hours. It was concluded that consequences for productivity are contingent on telework intensity, and that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> hours has an important impact on the consequences of different telework intensities.
