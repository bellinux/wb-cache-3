5|$|As {{his father}} was playing for the Chicago Blackhawks, Hull's early life was spent in Illinois, and he first played {{organized}} hockey in the Chicago area {{at the age of}} four. He and his brothers often skated with the Black Hawks where they watched their father play. The family moved back to Canada when Bobby signed with the original Winnipeg Jets in 1972. Brett moved to Vancouver with his mother and two youngest siblings shortly before his parents' acrimonious divorce in 1979. Hull was <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> his father following the breakup, though the two spoke periodically.|$|E

In contrast, Steph has a very close relationship with her father, Johnno.|$|E
5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use echolocation, but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E

For Test Baker, an {{underwater}} explosion, the ship was positioned closer to ground zero. Nagato rode out the tsunami {{of water from the}} explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized during the night of 29/30 July. Opened to divers in 1996, The Times has named Nagato {{as one of the top}} 10 wreck diving sites in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} certificates {{were granted}} on 10 April, {{and the first}} trial run was made the following day. Ordinary service started on 25 April, though without the dining car. The initial price was NOK 422, and travel time was 5 hours 45 minutes. The trains have four cars, of which three are regular open seating, and one is a dining car. From 15 June, full service was introduced. The company stated that the service {{was meant to be}} more luxurious than with SJ, including wider seating (three instead of four abreast) and a wooden interior. The company markets the service as all first-class seating. The trains also had Wi-Fi. After the full service was introduced, the price increased to NOK 593. By July, Ofotbanen had still not found a locomotive for the second train, and was still operating only a single round service. Passenger numbers were at 35 per departure, <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the capacity of 84, or the necessary annual 100,000 needed to make a profit.|$|E
5|$|The Whig National Convention {{opened on}} December 4, 1839, {{almost a year}} before the general election. The {{candidates}} did not travel to the convention, and with no telegraph yet in operation, they did not learn of events in Harrisburg until the convention was over. Each state was allocated two delegates for each member of the House of Representatives and Senate it was entitled to send to Washington. There were four absent states from the South, which hurt Clay. The rules of the convention, once passed by the delegates, also hurt Clay, since they provided that the entirety of a state's vote would be cast as a majority of the delegation directed, negating Clay's sizable minorities in Northern states such as New York. That state's delegation was run by its Whig boss, Thurlow Weed, who deemed Clay unelectable as a slaveholder. New York provided much of Scott's vote through the first four ballots, which were deadlocked, with Clay ahead but <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> a majority. Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, a leader of the Harrison forces, had obtained possession of a letter Scott had written expressing sympathy for abolitionists. Stevens intentionally dropped the letter while walking among the pro-Clay Virginia delegation. After reading it, the Virginians announced Harrison was their second choice, setting off a stampede for him, and he became the Whig nominee for president on the fifth ballot.|$|E

25|$|While Saturn's mid-sized moons Dione and Tethys are <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> {{an exact}} {{resonance}} now, {{they may have}} been in a 2:3 resonance early in the Solar System's history. This would have led to orbital eccentricity and tidal heating that may have warmed Tethys' interior enough to form a subsurface ocean. Subsequent freezing of the ocean after the moons escaped from the resonance may have generated the extensional stresses that created the enormous graben system of Ithaca Chasma on Tethys.|$|E
25|$|Unlike typical {{earthquakes}} worldwide, the earthquakes of Northern Europe are intraplate earthquakes, {{meaning they}} are <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> tectonic plate boundaries. Most intraplate earthquakes in northern Europe, including the British Isles, {{are thought to}} be driven by distant tectonic stresses – a combination of E–W North Atlantic Ridge and N–S African Plate regional stress fields, and local mantle conditions. Indeed, the motion on the strike-slip fault responsible for the earthquake is compatible with a local NW–SE stress field; a product of the E–W and N–S regional stress fields.|$|E

The game's creator, Ron Gilbert, departed from Lucas Arts after the second game.

25|$|The Cabinet Crisis, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Revolt of the Ministers {{is one of the most}} important but also most controversial episodes in the history of independent Malawi. Many of the contemporary documentary sources were written by expatriate diplomats and officials who were <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the ex-ministers, and in some cases antipathetic to them. These accounts have been contradicted by the autobiographies, often written long after the event, of the ex-ministers themselves, although these are also inconsistent with one another. The principal published works quoted rely on a mixture of documentary sources and interviews with participants, both African and expatriate, and suggest that the crisis arose in a political culture that permitted no dissent, and treated attempts to debate issues as plotting.|$|E
25|$|The Valdivia earthquake, {{the most}} {{powerful}} earthquake ever recorded, occurred on 22 May 1960. With over 50,000 casualties and more than 2 million people affected, the earthquake forced the organising committee to completely modify the World Cup's calendar. Talca, Concepción, Talcahuano and Valdivia were severely damaged and discarded as venues. Antofagasta and Valparaíso declined to host any matches as their venues were not financially self-sustainable. Viña del Mar and Arica managed to rebuild their stadiums while Braden Copper Company, then an American company that controlled the El Teniente copper mine, allowed the use of its stadium in Rancagua. The most used stadium was the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, with 10 matches; the Estadio Sausalito in Viña del Mar hosted 8 matches, and the stadiums in Rancagua and far-away Arica (the only location that was <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the other cities) both hosted 7 matches.|$|E
25|$|The late 1960s brought {{big changes}} in the {{programming}} practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS and ABC {{began to realize that}} much of their existing programming had not only been running for years, but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to clean house of a number of veteran shows. In NBC's case, this included programs like The Bell Telephone Hour and Sing Along With Mitch, which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35–45, 18–25 or 18–35. Regardless of the exact target demographic, the general idea was to appeal to viewers who were <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> retirement age and to modernize television programming, which the networks felt overall was stuck in a 1950s mentality, to closely resemble contemporary American society.|$|E

Rathina Thevar came third with 17244 votes (31.02%). The most spectacular victory was that of P.K. Mookiah Thevar (who contested Lok Sabha and assembly elections simultaneously) who got 49292 votes (74.46%) in the Usilampatti constituency, defeating S. Andi Thevar of the Revolutionary Forward Bloc. Lastly in West Bengal the party contested 52 constituencies, but could only win three seats. Its vote stood at 374 141 (2.90% of the statewide vote).|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 1883, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company {{gained control}} of the Staten Island Railway and its boats. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B) {{obtained}} control of the Staten Island Railway Ferry Company's operations the next year. A controlling interest in the Railway Ferry Company was obtained by the B in 1885 through purchases of stock. On November 21, 1885, Robert Garrett, President of the B, leased the Railway Ferry Company to the B for 99 years. The B could now provide service to a ferry terminal that was closer to Manhattan public transit. Rather than having passengers transfer to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ)'s ferries from the Jersey City Terminal to the Liberty Street Ferry Terminal in Manhattan, which was <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> any elevated rail stations in the area, the B could now operate to the Whitehall Street terminal, {{where there was a}} direct transfer to an elevated station. Garrett resigned from his position at the B in 1887, and his successors did not show as much interest in Staten Island transit operations. Wiman lost {{a lot of money in}} the Panic of 1893, and two years later, much of his property was auctioned to pay off debts.|$|E
25|$|Setting out towards Imbros, Yavûz Sultân Selîm {{struck a}} mine on transit to the island, {{but the damage}} was {{insignificant}} and the two Ottoman vessels were able to continue their mission. Yavûz Sultân Selîm then proceeded to bombard the British signal station at Kephalo Point while Midilli was sent ahead to guard the entrance of Kusu Bay. As Yavûz Sultân Selîm and Midilli approached Kusu Bay, they were sighted by the destroyer HMS Lizard at 5:30am. Lizard attempted to engage the Ottoman ships, but could <b>not</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> torpedo range due to heavy fire from her opponents. Yavûz Sultân Selîm soon sighted the two British monitors taking refuge in the bay, and broke off from Lizard to engage them. As Yavûz Sultân Selîm attacked the monitors, Midilli continued to duel with Lizard who was then joined by the destroyer HMS Tigress. Lizard and Tigress attempted to shield the monitors from Yavûz Sultân Selîm by laying a smoke screen, but this was ineffective. The monitors were both much too slow to evade Yavûz Sultân Selîm {{and she was able}} to score numerous hits on Raglan, hitting her foretop and killing her gunnery and direction officers. Raglan attempted to return fire with its 6 and 14-inch guns, but scored no hits on the German vessels before her main armament was knocked out when a shell pierced its casemate and ignited the ammunition within it. Shortly after she was disarmed, Raglan was hit in her magazine by one of Yavûz Sultân Selîms 11-inch shells causing the monitor to sink. After Raglan was sunk, the Ottoman battlecruiser began turned her attention to HMS M28, striking her amidships and setting her alight before she was sunk when her magazine exploded at 6:00a.m. With the two monitors sunk, the Ottomans decided to break off the engagement and head south in an attempt to raid the allied naval base at Mudros.|$|E
