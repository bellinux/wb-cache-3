40|$|Tertiary RNA {{structures}} from thermophilic bacteria {{generally are}} {{more stable than}} their mesophilic homologs. To understand the structural basis {{of the increase in}} stability, we investigated equilibrium folding of the specificity domain (S-domain) of RNase P RNA from a mesophilic (Escherichia coli) and a thermophilic (Thermus thermophilus) bacterium. Equilibrium folding of both S-domains is described by a minimal, three-state folding scheme, U-to-I-to-N. In the I-to-N transition of the thermophilic S-domain, more structure forms and protections are stronger against T 1 nuclease and hydroxyl radical reactions. Phylogenetic comparison {{in the context of the}} native structure reveals that among 39 nucleotide differences between these S-domains, 12 likely contribute to higher stability. These residues participate in extensive networks of hydrogen bonding, stacking, and metal ion coordination throughout the molecule. The thermophilic S-domain achieves higher stability by mutating strategic base pairs to G-C, decreasing surface accessibility of the native state, and increasing the amount of structure formation in the native folding transition. An E. coli S-domain mutant containing these 12 nt has the same stability and folding cooperativity as the T. thermophilus S-domain. E. coli S-domain mutants containing a subset of 4 or 6 <b>nt</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same stability as the T. thermophilus S-domain but the same folding cooperativity as the E. coli S-domain. These results show that increasing stability can be accomplished by mutations within a local structure, but increasing folding cooperativity needs concerted changes among multiple structural units...|$|E

The files of ISO size # 15 and a shaft length of 25 mm were selected. For measuring buckling resistance (n = 10), the files were loaded in the axial {{direction of the}} shaft, and the maximum load was measured during the files' deflection. The files (n = 10) were fixed at 3 -mm from the tip and then bent 45 ° {{with respect to their}} long axis, while the bending force was recorded by a load cell. For measuring the torsional properties, the files (n = 10) were also fixed at 3 -mm, and clockwise rotations (2 -rpm) were applied to the files in a straight state. The torsional load and the distortion angle were recorded until the files succumbed to the torque.

Interest in more ecologically sustainable agricultural systems is rising with increasing recognition that agricultural intensification can adversely affect environmental quality. This paper discusses the effect of tillage system on some soil characteristics, such as pH, C, N and S levels, total and Olsen-P contents including some P forms associated with organic matter, glomalin contents and arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) parameters, such as root colonization, spore number and total and active hyphal length. Measurements were in the sixth year of an on-going tillage-rotation experiment conducted on an Ultisol under no-till (NT), reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage with stubble mixed into the soil (CTS) or stubble burnt (CTB). Soil was sampled at two dates; after wheat (Triticum aestivum) harvest (autumn) and 6 months after subsequent grassland seeding (spring). Higher C, N, S, total P and fulvic acid-P concentrations and pH occurred under NT and RT than under CTS and CTB after wheat harvest. However, results at the second sampling were not consistent. AM spore number and active hyphal length were highest under <b>NT</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> greatest incidence on AM root colonization and P concentration in shoots of the pasture.

Nowadays {{it is probable that}} a total of about 55 000 ha are cropped under NT, the prevalent crops being autumn-winter cereals, soybean and sunflower, with only a thousand hectares devoted to maize Tabaglio, 2007). The limited use of this land management technique is due to several factors: wrong choice of soil-type, short-term experimental studies, and inadequate basic knowledge of the various herbicide treatments and fertilizers needed. Overall though, the limited adaptability of farmers to the new principles of management necessary for <b>NT</b> <b>has</b> been <b>the</b> major obstacle. Nevertheless, the advantages and conditions for <b>the</b> application of <b>NT</b> <b>have</b> been repeatedly presented and discussed worldwide (Phillips and Phillips, 1984; Sprague and Triplett, 1986; Bartolini, 1989; Baker et al., 2006; Tabaglio and Gavazzi, 2006; Pisante, 2007). More specifically, {{in the absence of the}} plough the soil profile is undisturbed and the environment is less oxidative, the most important consequence being an improvement in soil quality and health over time. The most appropriate techniques to detect and to measure this improvement need to be identified. Given that a single parameter cannot describe the complexity of the soil ecosystem, it becomes necessary to establish how many and which soil quality indicators to use (Doran and Parkin, 1994; Larson and Pierce, 1991; Benedetti and De Bertoldi, 2000; Dell’Abate, 2000; Landi et al., 2000; Vignozzi, 2000). For this research, chemical (pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, cation exchange capacity and carbonates) and physical (water aggregate stability) indicators were considered. The aim of this field experiment was to verify the ability of these indicators to detect any changes in soil quality in relation to changes in tillage management and different levels of nitrogen fertilization, after three years of continuous maize...|$|R

While there are a few reviews of NT oriented towards ecologists, our goal here is to review the quantitative results of NT and its extensions for physicists who are interested in learning what NT is, what its successes are and what important problems remain unresolved. Furthermore, we hope that this review could also be of interest to theoretical ecologists because many potentially interesting results are buried in the vast NT literature.

Materials and methods: The subjects were {{participants in a}} comprehensive health examination of 67 - 68 -year-old men living in Malmö, Sweden. Four hundred eighty-three men {{took part in a}} clinical oral examination which recorded the number of teeth and removable dentures. One hundred and one had complete dentures in both jaws and 131 had removable partial dentures in different combinations. Masticatory tests used almonds to record the number of strokes to the first swallow, and two-coloured chewing gums for recording bolus kneading and shaping. A nutritionist paid a home visit to assess dietary habits including the consumption of hard and soft foods. The data could be split into groups of different tooth and denture situations which were large enough to enable statistical analysis to be carried out. The results of a regression analysis of the group with different numbers of natural teeth (NT) and no removable dentures {{could be used as a}} reference for correlation with the masticatory capacity of removable denture wearers. Results: Number of strokes to the first swallow revealed no masticatory limitations of wearing removable dentures, while chewing gum colour-mixing and shaping revealed more differentiated impairments equivalent to the function of five to 16 teeth in a remaining natural dentition. Hard food intake for the removable denture groups was comparable to 17 - 19 NT. Soft food intake was not influenced by denture wearing.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of no-tillage (NT) on the chemical and biological properties of an Entic Haploxeroll in Central Chile. Soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass and associated indicators qCO 2, qMic, qMin, available N, P and K, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and crop yield were determined in a field experiment having a wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) –maize (Zea mays L.) crop rotation. The change in soil chemical properties was further evaluated using a greenhouse bioassay in which ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was grown in soil samples extracted at 0 – 2, 2 – 5, and 5 – 15 cm depth. After nine years SOC in the NT treatment was 29. 7 Mg ha 1 compared to 24. 8 Mg ha 1 of CT, resulting in 4. 98 Mg ha 1 C gain. The NT therefore resulted in an average annual sequestration of 0. 55 Mg C ha 1 yr 1 in the upper 15 cm soil. The soil organic C stored under NT was mainly accumulated in the top 2 -cm of soil. The biological indicators showed a greater biological soil quality under NT than under CT. Soil organic C was positively associated with available N, P, and K, but negatively with soil pH. The ryegrass bioassay yielded higher biomass in NT than CT. An improvement in the soil chemical quality of the NT soil was considered to be the main reason for this result.

At the present time it is uncertain whether such pulses are generated exclusively under large alpha conditions or whether the presence of large-amplitude heavy ion cyclotron waves during more moderate alpha conditions masks their presence. It is also unclear whether these pulses are superposed on top of cometary turbulence or simply a part of it. The above observations will be compared to recent theoretical predictions of cometary waves generated during large alpha conditions...|$|R
