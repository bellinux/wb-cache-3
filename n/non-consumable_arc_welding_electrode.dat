40|$|AbstractIn {{repair of}} {{aircraft}} structures of magnesium alloy ML 10, the argon <b>arc</b> <b>non-consumable</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>welding</b> is used. In this case, the residual welding stresses occur in repair welds, {{being one of}} the causes for reducing the service characteristics of the restored products. Residual stresses arise as a result of welding. Post-weld heat treatment is used to reduce the residual stresses. The heat treatment, which occurs after welding, increases the cost of repair. This leads to the search for alternative methods to control the stressed state of welded joints, one of which is electrodynamic treatment, which reduces the level of residual stresses in repair welds, and as a consequence, the cost of the welding repair in restoring aircraft structures. It was found from the results of experiments carried out, that the electrodynamic treatment allows reduces the initial level of stresses in welded joints, reaching 120 [*]MPa, to 30 [*]MPa, and at definite geometric characteristics of the specimens forming the field of compressive stresses, the values of which are equal to – 50 [*]MPa. It is shown that the optimum distance between the zones of treatment, being 5 [*]mm, provides the guaranteed covering the zones of electrodynamic effect and, as a consequence, the maximum efficiency of the electric dynamic treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{employment}} of Laser Beam Welding (LBW) for many traditional <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> applications is often {{limited by the}} inability of LBW to compensate for variations in the weld joint gap. This limitation is associated with fluctuations in the energy transfer efficiency along the weld joint. Since coupling of the laser beam to the workpiece {{is dependent on the}} maintenance of a stable absorption keyhole, perturbations to the weld pool can lead to decreased energy transfer and resultant weld defects. Because energy transfer in <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> does not similarly depend on weld pool geometry, it is expected that combining these two processes together will lead to an enhanced fusion welding process that exhibits the advantages of both <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and LBW. Laser assisted <b>non-consumable</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welds</b> have been made on thin section aluminum. The welds combine the advantages of <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and laser welding, with enhanced penetration and fusion zone size. The use of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with the combined process appears to be advantageous since this laser is effective in removing the aluminum oxide and thereby allowing operation with the tungsten electrode negative.

5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> Consumable <b>electrode</b> processes such as shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the <b>electrode</b> affects <b>weld</b> properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow <b>welds.</b> Nonconsumable <b>electrode</b> processes, such as gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged <b>electrode</b> causes shallow <b>welds,</b> while a negatively charged <b>electrode</b> makes deeper <b>welds.</b> Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|R
30|$|The arc plasma is the ionized {{state of}} the welding gas and {{is a mixture of}} almost equal amounts of {{electrons}} and ions. The plasma carries the arc current. Most of the current conduction is carried by the electrons. In the case of <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> the <b>electrode</b> is generally assumed to be the cathode and the workpiece is the anode. The electrons flow out from the electrode (i.e. the negative terminal) and are forwarded into the workpiece (i.e. the positive terminal) (Naidu et al. 2003). To determine the effects of arc plasma on the weld pool, four factors should be considered (i) heat flux, (ii) current density, (iii) shear stress, and (iv) arc pressure.|$|R
