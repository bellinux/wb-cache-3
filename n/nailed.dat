40|$|Background: Proximal <b>nail</b> fold {{inflammation}} can {{be caused}} by many diseases and has not previously been recognized as a result of posterior embedding of the <b>nail.</b> We describe a new pattern of ingrowth that we have termed retronychia (‘‘retro’’—Latin for backwards; ‘‘onychia’’—Greek for <b>nail).</b> The term describes a combination of proximal <b>nail</b> plate ingrowth into the proximal <b>nail</b> fold which is associated with multiple generations of <b>nail</b> plate misaligned beneath the proximal <b>nail.</b> Objective: To describe a new pattern of <b>nail</b> ingrowth which causes a specific form of proximal <b>nail</b> fold paronychia. Methods: Collective cases were reported to a European <b>Nail</b> Society expert group. Results: Persistent proximal <b>nail</b> fold inflammation can result from an episode of trauma that disturbs longitudinal <b>nail</b> growth and results in reverse embedding of the <b>nail</b> plate. This can cause pain, inflammation, and granulation tissue formation, and is typically relieved by avulsion and antiinflammatory treatment. Limitations: We cannot demonstrate causality between the proposed precipitants and the clinical features. Conclusion: Retroncyhia represents proximal ingrowth of the <b>nail</b> that occurs when the <b>nail</b> embeds backwards into the proximal <b>nail</b> fold. <b>Nail</b> plate avulsion with supplementary medical management is curative.

40|$|The <b>nail</b> {{plate is}} the {{permanent}} {{product of the}} <b>nail</b> matrix. Its normal appearance and growth depend on the integrity of several components: the surrounding tissues or perionychium and the bony phalanx that are contributing to the <b>nail</b> apparatus or <b>nail</b> unit. The <b>nail</b> is inserted proximally in an invagination practically parallel to the upper surface of the skin and laterally in the lateral <b>nail</b> grooves. This pocket-like invagination has a roof, the proximal <b>nail</b> fold and a floor, the matrix from which the <b>nail</b> is derived. The germinal matrix forms {{the bulk of the}} <b>nail</b> plate. The proximal element forms the superficial third of the <b>nail</b> whereas the distal element provides its inferior two-thirds. The ventral surface of the proximal <b>nail</b> fold adheres closely to the <b>nail</b> for a short distance and forms a gradually desquamating tissue, the cuticle, made of the stratum corneum of both the dorsal and the ventral side of the proximal <b>nail</b> fold. The cuticle seals and therefore protects the ungual cul-de-sac. The <b>nail</b> plate is bordered by the proximal <b>nail</b> fold which is continuous with the similarly structured lateral <b>nail</b> fold on each side. The <b>nail</b> bed extends from the lunula to the hyponychium. It presents with parallel longitudinal rete ridges. This area, by contrast to the matrix has a firm attachment to the <b>nail</b> plate and <b>nail</b> avulsion produces a denudation of the <b>nail</b> bed. Colourless, but translucent, the highly vascular connective tissue containing glomus organs transmits a pink colour through the <b>nail.</b> Among its multiple functions, the <b>nail</b> provides counterpressure to the pulp that is essential to the tactile sensation involving the fingers and to the prevention of the hypertrophy of the distal wall tissue, produced after <b>nail</b> loss of the great toe <b>nail.</b> Journal ArticleFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Salih had designated his second eldest son, Thimal, as his successor and left him in charge of Aleppo. However, his eldest son, Nasr, who fought at al-Uqhuwanah, escaped the battle to wrest control of Aleppo. For a brief period, the two sons ruled Aleppo jointly with Nasr controlling the city and Thimal the citadel, until sometime in 1030 when Nasr compelled Thimal to relocate to al-Rahba. In 1038, Anushtakin killed Nasr and seized Aleppo. Thimal later restored Mirdasid rule in the city, which continued, with occasional interruption, until 1080.|$|E
