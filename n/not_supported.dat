French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stressed on April 8 that France had <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> Bacar or provided him with any protection, {{and that it had}} fully supported African Union intervention.|$|E
5|$|Due to low accuracy, the C-PIB-PET scan is not {{recommended}} {{to be used as}} an early diagnostic tool or for predicting the development of Alzheimer's disease when people show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The use of ¬π‚Å∏F-FDG PET scans, as a single test, to identify people who may develop Alzheimer's disease is also <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> by evidence.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetically Capricornis {{is closer}} to goats and sheep than cattle. The {{nomenclature}} and status of Capricornis taxa are not completely resolved. Some researchers have considered Capricornis a junior synonym of Naemorhedus, a classification that includes gorals; molecular analysis has <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> this classification. Capricornis has a lower canine, which Naemorhedus species usually do not.|$|E

50|$|Due to its {{compatibility}} {{with the older}} operating system, the browser lacks the entire feature set of modern Firefox versions. In particular, it does <b>not</b> fully <b>support</b> Core Text, so it does not understand Apple Advanced Typography features in certain international fonts; it does <b>not</b> <b>support</b> graphics acceleration for compositing; and it does <b>not</b> <b>support</b> WebGL (because PowerPC Tiger does <b>not</b> <b>support</b> OpenGL 2). Furthermore, for security and maintainability reasons, NPAPI plugins support is deprecated, and has been subsequently removed.|$|R
5|$|Some NTFS {{features}} are <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> in ReFS, including object IDs, short names, file compression, file level encryption (EFS), user data transactions, hard links, extended attributes, and disk quotas. Sparse files are supported. Support for named streams is not implemented in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, {{though it was}} later added in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. ReFS does not itself offer data deduplication. Dynamic disks with mirrored or striped volumes are replaced with mirrored or striped storage pools provided by Storage Spaces. In Windows Server 2012, automated error-correction with integrity streams is only supported on mirrored spaces; automatic recovery on parity spaces was added in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. Booting from ReFS is <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> either.|$|E
5|$|The iPad 2 is {{compatible}} with iOS 7, which was released on September 18, 2013.

5|$|The third-generation iPad is {{compatible}} with iOS 7, which was released in 2013. Although complete support, some newer features such as AirDrop that were released to newer models were <b>not</b> <b>supported.</b> This is the similar support that was also given on the iPhone 4S.|$|E

5|$|Although The Thrill Book {{has been}} {{described}} as the first American pulp to specialize in fantasy and science fiction, this description is <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> by recent historians of the field, who regard it instead as a stepping stone on the path that ultimately led to Weird Tales and Amazing Stories, the first true specialized magazines in the fields of weird fiction and science fiction respectively.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia has {{traditionally}} been described as lying within series Spicigerae of Banksia, together with Banksia spinulosa and various western Hairpin-like Banksias such as B.seminuda and B.brownii. This series is placed in Banksia sect. Oncostylis according to Alex George's taxonomy of Banksia, but directly into Banksia subg. Banksia in Thiele's arrangement based on cladistic analysis. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a subseries Ericifoliae, but this was <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> by George.|$|E

5|$|FreeBSD has a {{software}} repository of over 26,000 applications that are developed by third parties. Examples include: windowing systems, web browsers, email clients, office suites and so forth. In general, the project {{itself does not}} develop this software, only the framework to allow these programs to be installed, which {{is known as the}} Ports collection. Applications may either be compiled from source ("ports"), provided their licensing terms allow this, or downloaded as pre-compiled binaries ("packages"). The Ports collection supports the current and stable branches of FreeBSD. Older releases are <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> and may or may not work correctly with an up-to-date Ports collection.|$|E
5|$|Gorrostieta Salazar {{left the}} PRI {{and joined the}} PRD in August 2010, stating that the PRI had <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> her after the attacks.

She returned to private life, remarried, and dedicated her time to raise her three children: Malusi, Jos√©, and Deysi. Her police protection came to an end when her mayoral term expired in 2011.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the papal}} plans were <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> {{by the other}} European monarchs, who had lost enthusiasm for the Crusades. Only one western monarch {{attended}} the Council, the elderly James I of Aragon, who could only offer a small force. There was fundraising for a new crusade, and plans were made, but never followed through. The projects essentially {{came to a halt}} with the death of Pope Gregory on , and the money which had been raised to finance the expedition was instead distributed in Italy.|$|E
50|$|Very few {{systems support}} these encodings. Microsoft Windows does <b>not</b> <b>support</b> them, for example.

Speculation that oral consumption of the drug causes tooth decay by raising the acidity of users' mouths is also unsupported. Meth mouth is generally most severe in users who inject the drug, rather than those who smoke, ingest or inhale it.|$|E
5|$|In his Cabinet appointments, Pierce {{sought to}} unite {{a party that}} was squabbling over the fruits of victory.

5|$|Legal {{proceedings}} {{began when}} the insurers refused to compensate the owners of Zong. The dispute was initially tried at the Guildhall in London on 6March 1783, with the Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, overseeing the trial before a jury.
