40|$|The {{concept of}} {{microstructural}} engineering of steels {{is well established}} and {{is the basis for}} a wide range of processes and products. Recently, though, there has been increasing emphasis in developing microstructures that have submicron length scales and also in understanding in far greater detail the structures and solute effects that are occurring at the nanoscale. In this review it is proposed that we are heading towards the situation where we are applying <b>nanostructural</b> <b>engineering</b> concepts in the development of new steels. A range of examples are given as well as a discussion of the potential impact of new processing routes. Clearly the future advances will be driven through improved characterization methods, such as atom probe tomography, in combination with advanced modeling...|$|E
40|$|The nanostructure, {{physical}} {{properties and mechanical}} performance of C-S-H, the principal component in cement-based materials, was studied. Synthetic C-S-H of variable composition was examined as a model system in comparison with that produced in the hydration of Portland cement. The current doctoral thesis is comprised of several research chapters designed to probe some of the ambiguous aspects of the C-S-H at the nano level. Several advanced analytical tools and novel approaches were utilized in order to elucidate various controversial issues in cement and concrete science. The studied topics include three areas of C-S-H investigation: <b>nanostructural</b> features, <b>engineering</b> properties and modified systems. Nanostructural Features [...] The C-S-H (I) was categorized in two main classes separated at a C/S ratio of about 1. 1. These exhibit distinct properties as determined by XRD, Helium Inflow, 29 Si NMR and 43 Ca NMR. New evidence was provided supporting the layered nature of the C-S-H. The role of interlayer water and calcium ions as well as silicate tetrahedra on {{physical properties}} of C-S-H analogs were evaluated. It was mainly demonstrated that the high C/S ratio C-S-H (I) {{can be considered as}} a viable model for the nanostructure of the C-S-H in hydrated cement paste. Engineering Properties - The relation between the chemistry and mechanical performance of the phase pure C-S-H systems was investigated. The dynamic mechanical response and stress relaxation of the synthetic C-S-H as well as C-S-H in hydrated Portland cement were examined at various moisture contents. A unique oscillatory response in the storage modulus and internal friction of the C-S-H materials was identified. Viscoelastic behavior of C-S-H was associated with the sliding of the C-S-H sheets. A mechanistic model as proposed to explain the observed changes in the mechanical properties of layered C-S-H materials. Modified Systems - Two approaches were evaluated in order prepare and characterize nanohybrid C-S-H phases: organic modification of C-S-H, and metamorphosis of C-S-H in cement paste. In situ polymerized C-S-H/polyaniline nanostructures demonstrated enhanced physical and mechanical properties attributable to the interaction of polymer molecules with the silicate structure of the inorganic host. C-S-H seeding was also employed in order to tailor the nature of the C-S-H product. It was shown that the chemical properties of C-S-H can be readily controlled depending on the stoichiometry of the seed. This offers a unique method in order to engineer the hydrated cement and concrete materials for improved sustainability...|$|R
30|$|Defect-reduced {{perovskite}} films can {{be realized}} by directly modifying the perovskite synthesis conditions (e.g., reaction environment, precursor stoichiometry, crystallization atmosphere, etc.) [11 – 13] or by altering the mesoscopic structure of the underlying layers over which the perovskite film synthesis is conducted. The perovskite films are generally deposited upon mesoscopic scaffolds composed of oxide nanoparticles like TiO 2, into which the perovskite precursors infiltrate and form small crystallites whose dimensions are defined by the internal pore size of mother scaffold. Enlarging the pores in the scaffold, and hence, increasing the infiltrated perovskite grains is expected to reduce the defects by grain boundaries. At the same time, the internal electric field that is formed at the semiconductor junction may further assist the charge separation. Light trapping by the <b>nanostructural</b> <b>engineering</b> will also yield an additional merit for the performance enhancement [14].|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} on thermoelectrics experienced a renaissance {{due to the}} theoretical predictions made by Hicks and Dresselhaus that thermoelectric efficiency could be greatly enhanced through <b>nanostructural</b> <b>engineering.</b> The nanoalloying method {{has proved to be}} a promising approach to synthesize binary and nanostructured thin films. The films were analyzed in a combined approach utilizing the FhIPM expertise in thermoelectrical measurement techniques with that of the groups from the University of Kiel for structural analysis and nanoscale characterization of structure and composition via advanced electron microscopy techniques. It is believed that the high degree of thermal stability is caused by the epitaxial growth of the materials for which interdiffusion of the binary constituents is suppressed by a strong degree of c-orientation and the absence of grain boundaries. The feasibility of highly stable, low periodic Bi 2 Te 3 /Bi 2 (Se,Te) 3 SLs by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has already been demonstrated...|$|E
30|$|To {{exploit the}} {{potential}} benefits of large-sized single crystalline perovskite, we herein controlled the nanostructures of mesoscopic TiO 2 layer to infiltrate the enlarged CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 (Cl) grains. Introduction of sacrificial templates during photoelectrode fabrication, one of the facile methods to obtain the controlled pore size and internal surface area [15 – 18], was applied to render sub-micron sized pores where the large perovskite grains can be accommodated. The concomitant effect of perovskite crystallinity, perovskite-TiO 2 interfacial area, and light trapping was investigated to understand the change of photovoltaic parameters resulted from the templating method. Furthermore, since the templated porous layer with hundred-nanometer large open pores inevitably raises the necessity for the complete compactness of hole-blocking layers against charge recombination at the FTO-perovskite direct contact, an alternative blocking layer was applied, providing additional power-conversion efficiency improvement. The essential issues in <b>nanostructural</b> <b>engineering</b> were discussed with the correlated solar-cell parameters.|$|E
40|$|Anodic oxide {{fabricated}} by anodizing {{has been}} widely used for <b>nanostructural</b> <b>engineering,</b> but the nanomorphology is limited to only two oxides: anodic barrier and porous oxides. Therefore, the discovery of an additional anodic oxide with a unique nanofeature would expand the applicability of anodizing. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of a third-generation anodic oxide, specifically, anodic alumina nanofibers, by anodizing in a new electrolyte, pyrophosphoric acid. Ultra-high density single nanometer-scale anodic alumina nanofibers (1010 nanofibers/cm(2)) consisting of an amorphous, pure aluminum oxide were successfully fabricated via pyrophosphoric acid anodizing. The nanomorphologies of the anodic nanofibers can be controlled by the electrochemical conditions. Anodic tungsten oxide nanofibers can also be fabricated by pyrophosphoric acid anodizing. The aluminum surface covered by the anodic alumina nanofibers exhibited ultra-fast superhydrophilic behavior, with a contact angle of less than 16, within 1 second. Such ultra-narrow nanofibers {{can be used for}} various nanoapplications including catalysts, wettability control, and electronic devices...|$|E
40|$|Transition {{metal oxides}} {{possessing}} {{two kinds of}} metals (denoted as AxB 3 -xO 4, which is generally defined as a spinel structure; A, B = Co, Ni, Zn, Mn, Fe, etc.), with stoichiometric or even non-stoichiometric compositions, have recently attracted great interest in electrochemical energy storage systems (ESSs). The spinel-type transition metal oxides exhibit outstanding electrochemical activity and stability, and thus, they can {{play a key role}} in realising cost-effective and environmentally friendly ESSs. Moreover, porous nanoarchitectures can offer a large number of electrochemically active sites and, at the same time, facilitate transport of charge carriers (electrons and ions) during energy storage reactions. In the design of spinel-type transition metal oxides for energy storage applications, therefore, <b>nanostructural</b> <b>engineering</b> is one of the most essential approaches to achieving high electrochemical performance in ESSs. In this perspective, we introduce spinel-type transition metal oxides with various transition metals and present recent research advances in material design of spinel-type transition metal oxides with tunable architectures (shape, porosity, and size) and compositions on the micro- and nano-scale. Furthermore, their technological applications as electrode materials for next-generation ESSs, including metal-air batteries, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors, are discussed...|$|E
3000|$|... 1 + endohedral {{complex is}} uniformly {{distributed}} over the C 60 shell. The nanotube (8, 8) in the junction prevents the K@C 601 + {{from entering the}} storage chamber. The nanotube (8, 8) diameter is rather large for the penetration of methane molecules, but small for the transition of the K@C 601 +. Each hole in the blocking chamber {{is formed as a}} result of removing 24 carbon atoms. Dangling bonds are saturated by hydrogen atoms. The holes obtained are large enough for free penetration of methane molecules into the nanotube internal space. The experiment on obtaining similar holes with the application of electron beams is described in [14]. It is shown that the beams can be focused on the area 1 Å in diameter. The holes in the nanotube can exist at the temperatures up to 400 K; when the temperature elevates, the hole diameter in the nanotubes considerably decreases due to the motion and fusion of single vacancies [8 – 10]. During modeling, it is imitated that the nanocapsule is placed on the substrate, i.e., the nanotube base is fixed—the nanocapsule left end is demonstrated in Fig. 1. The change in the nanotube diameter is also possible with the methods of <b>nanostructural</b> <b>engineering</b> [14].|$|E
30|$|A mixed {{transition}} metal oxide, NiCo 2 O 4, is also of significant interest because it exhibits higher electrical conductivity and electrochemical activities toward the conversion reaction with Li {{in comparison to}} Co 3 O 4 [23 – 27]. As an example, Li et al. reported that the mesoporous NiCo 2 O 4 anode exhibits a high specific capacity of ~ 1200  mAh g− 1 as well as stable cycling performance for ~ 500  cycles [23]. On the other hand, {{there are only a}} few reports on the electrochemical Na storage behavior of NiCo 2 O 4 for NIBs [28 – 30]. Alcántara et al. were the first to demonstrate that NiCo 2 O 4 has the ability to store Na through the conversion reaction similar to that of Li [28]. In their report, however, the NiCo 2 O 4 powder prepared by precipitation of oxalate precursors delivered only a reversible capacity of 200  mAh g− 1 in a Na half-cell and displayed a significant capacity decay within 5  cycles. A recent study reported an interesting result showing that NiCo 2 O 4 nanowires grown on a carbon cloth exhibit enhanced Na storage capability with stable cyclability [29]. This indicates that, as shown previously in the studies on LIBs, the controlled <b>nanostructural</b> <b>engineering</b> of NiCo 2 O 4 could be an effective approach to improving Na storage performance.|$|E
40|$|This is an Open Access article {{published}} by the American Chemical Society and distributed {{under the terms of}} the Creative Commons Attribution licence, [URL] polymers are identified as a new class of passivating agents for carbon electrodes in ionic liquids. They are inert and can readily be deposited as thin, conformal films by electropolymerization. Unlike conventional poly(monophenol) polymers, a single voltammetric scan is sufficient to accomplish their deposition. This is seen, for example, in the cases of poly(bisphenol A) and poly(bisphenol P). In each case, the thickness of the electropolymerized films is determined by the quantum tunneling distance of the faradaic electrons. Thus, film growth terminates when the faradaic electrons can no longer transit the film at a measurable rate. At that point, all the faradaic reactions cease, while the capacitive charging processes continue unabated. Experimentally, film thicknesses are observed in the range 4 – 30 nm. A challenging test for the poly(bisphenol) polymers is to coat them onto arrays of microelectrodes (RAM electrodes). Normally, microelectrodes are difficult to coat by electropolymerization due to the intense flux of soluble intermediates away from their surfaces. In the present work, however, coating is facile due to the extreme insolubility of the intermediates. This same property makes the films strongly adherent. Such remarkable behavior suggest that poly(bisphenol) films may have an important role to play as passivating agents in supercapacitors. They may also find application in other areas of technology that require thin-film passivity, such as <b>nanostructural</b> <b>engineering</b> and device physics...|$|E
