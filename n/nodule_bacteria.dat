The seed treatment with fungicide is essential in the improved technology for increasing crop production. In the present investigation two seed protectant fungicides captan and carbendazim are used. Effect of fungicides on growth of Rhizobium japonicum has been studied. Soybean seeds of two varieties PK- 472 and JS- 72 - 44 were treated with the said fungicides.

40|$|By some {{investigators}} {{including the}} author, {{it was already}} mentioned that the knobbed dwarf cripples are made limited to the leaf-nodular Ardisia crispa and A. punctata by the treatments of heat and antibiotic to their seeds and seedlings. The experiment, however, regarding {{the formation of the}} cripples in which using the pure cultured suspension of the leaf <b>nodule</b> <b>bacterium,</b> was never practised until nowadays. In this paper the author dealt with the artifical knob and mosaic symptom formations applying the low temperature treated bacterial suspensions. These were prepared from the pure cultured leaf <b>nodule</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Bacterium foliicola (including 4 strains), isolated from A. crispa and A. punctata in Japan and Germany. 1. The knobbed dwarf cripples were produced for the first time when applied to the seedlings of leaf-nodular Ardisia spp. with the warmed and concentrated suspensions to the consistency of 1 / 2 or 1 / 10 volume at 45 ℃ for 24 or 48 hours containing in cotton or when soaked the seeds in the treated suspensions prior to sowing. But never on the non-leaf-nodular A. japonica by the same treatments. No such knobbed cripple was made on the samely treated leaf-nodular plants with intact and boiled (for one hour) suspensions or IAA solutions. 2. When injected the sterilized (50 ℃, 30 mins.) or concentrated (47 ℃, 24 hrs.) bacterial suspension into Ardisia spp. and tomato shoots, a mosaic-like symptom appeared restrict to the treatd A. punctata in the next year; namely, the leaves turned into mosaic of yollow and green color, curled and dwindled, and they attached to the apical part of the stem in rosette-like and the part swelled more or less. Such a symptom was never observed on the plants (including A. punctata} which received the injection with knob-extract of A. crispa, intact and boiled bacterial suspensions.

40|$|Most legumes {{are able}} to thrive in {{nitrogen}} (N) depleted soils because they can assimilate N via N fixing root nodules, symbiotic organs formed in partnership with rhizobia. Nodulation begins with an exchange of signals between the symbiotic partners, fol-lowed by plant cell divisions in the root cortex and pericycle and subsequent rhizobial invasion of the root through plant-derived infection threads. The infection threads in newly divided cells are encased by thin cell walls that can breach, forming an infection droplet. At the site of droplet formation, the plasma membrane separating the bacteria from the plant cytoplasm continues to pro-liferate, and individual rhizobia are endocytosed into the plant host cell cytoplasm, forming symbiosomes.

5000|$|Symbiotic Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium species, detect {{compounds}} like flavonoids secreted by {{the roots}} of leguminous plants and then produce nod factors which signal to the plant that they are present and {{will lead to the}} formation of root nodules.

Even though these organisms are thought to be only loosely associated with plants they inhabit, they may respond very strongly to the status of the plants.

50|$|The {{patentee}} {{discovered that}} there are strains of each species of root <b>nodule</b> <b>bacteria</b> which do not exert a mutually inhibitive effect on each other.

Kalo exploited the claimed invention by selling multi-purpose packages containing a mixture of different species of Rhizobia suitable for different plants. Funk infringed by selling similar packages and Kalo sued for patent infringement. While the patent had claims both to the method of producing a multi-purpose inoculant by mixing together mutually non-inhibitive strains of Rhizobia and to the inoculant product comprising a mixture of mutually non-inhibitive strains of Rhizobia, the case before the Court involved only the product claims.|$|E
50|$|The {{aggregation}} of select {{strains of}} the several species into one product is an application of that newly discovered natural principle. But however ingenious the discovery of that natural principle may have been, the application of it is hardly more than an advance in the packaging of the inoculants. Each of the species of root <b>nodule</b> <b>bacteria</b> contained in the package infects {{the same group of}} leguminous plants which it always infected. No species acquires a different use. The combination of species produces no new bacteria, no change in the six species of bacteria, and no enlargement of the range of their utility. Each species has the same effect it always had. The bacteria perform in their natural way. Their use in combination does not improve in any way their natural functioning. They serve the ends nature originally provided, and act quite independently of any effort of the patentee.… The application of this newly discovered natural principle to the problem of packaging of inoculants may well have been an important commercial advance. But once nature's secret of the noninhibitive quality of certain {{strains of the}} species of Rhizobium was discovered, {{the state of the art}} made the production of a mixed inoculant a simple step. Even though it may have been the product of skill, it certainly was not the product of invention. There is no way in which we could call it such unless we borrowed invention from the discovery of the natural principle itself. That is to say, there is no invention here unless the discovery that certain strains of the several species of these bacteria are noninhibitive, and may thus be safely mixed, is invention. But we cannot so hold without allowing a patent to issue on one of the ancient secrets of nature now disclosed.… Since we conclude that the product claims do not disclose an invention or discovery within the meaning of the patent statutes, we do not consider whether the other statutory requirements…are satisfied.|$|E
2500|$|Many Fabaceae host {{bacteria}} in their roots within structures called root <b>nodules.</b> These <b>bacteria,</b> known as rhizobia, {{have the ability}} to take nitrogen gas (N2) out of the air and convert it to a form of nitrogen that is usable to the host plant ( [...] NO3− or NH3 [...] ).

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the structural characterization and genetic regulation of new bacterial groES and groEL chaperonin genes, and presents two novelties. The first is the discovery that the nitrogen fixing soybean root <b>nodule</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Bradyrhizobium japonicum, unlike all other prokaryotes investigated so far, possesses a multigene family consisting of five very similar, though not identical, groESL-like genes. The second novelty relates to the finding that these five homologues are expressed to different degrees and, in particular, that one family member (namely groESL 3) is induced by a mechanism that does not involve the well-known heat shock response. By contrast, the groESL 3 genes are co-regulated together with symbiotic nitrogen fixation genes, in that they are activated by the nitrogen fixation regulatory protein NifA at low oxygen conditions and transcribed from a - 24 /- 12 promoter by the sigma 54 RNA polymerase. Two other members of the groESL gene family are apparently expressed constitutively at different levels, and yet another one is strongly induced by high temperature. As an attractive hypothesis it follows that B. japonicum may modulate its cellular contents of GroES- and GroEL-like chaperonins in response to specific environmental conditions and physiological needs...|$|R
40|$|The obligately aerobic soybean root <b>nodule</b> <b>bacterium</b> Rhizobium japonicum {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of heme (iron protoporphyrin) only under low oxygen tensions, such as exist in the symbiotic root nodule. Aerobically incubated suspensions of both laboratory-cultured and symbiotic bacteria (bacteroids) metabolize delta-aminolevulinic acid to uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphyrin. Under anaerobic conditions, suspensions of laboratory-cultured bacteria form greatly reduced amounts of protoporphyrin from delta-aminolevulinic acid, whereas protoporphyrin formation by bacteroid suspensions is unaffected by anaerobiosis, suggesting that bacteroids form protoporphyrin under anaerobic conditions more readily than do free-living bacteria. Oxygen is the major terminal electron acceptor for coproporphyrinogen oxidation in cell-free extracts of both bacteroids and free-living bacteria. In the absence of oxygen, ATP, NADP, Mg 2 +, and L-methionine are required for protoporphyrin formation in vitro. In {{the presence of these}} supplements, coproporphyrinogenase activity under anaerobic conditions is 5 to 10 % of that observed under aerobic conditions.
