5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the <b>nasotracheal</b> route. <b>Nasotracheal</b> intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding.

5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and <b>nasotracheal</b> intubation are impossible or contraindicated.

5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube is passed through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea.

Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct {{laryngoscopy}} as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind <b>nasotracheal</b> intubation, the Magill forceps, the Magill laryngoscope blade, and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.|$|E

25|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is often}} performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration.

Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the nasopharynx or oropharynx and subglottic stenosis.|$|E
25|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} (usually simply {{referred to}} as intubation), an invasive medical procedure, is the placement of a flexible plastic catheter into the trachea. For millennia, tracheotomy was considered the most reliable (and most risky) method of tracheal intubation. By the late 19th century, advances in the sciences of anatomy and physiology, {{as well as the}} beginnings of an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had reduced the morbidity and mortality of this operation to a more acceptable rate. Also in the late 19th century, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved {{to such a degree that}} direct laryngoscopy had finally become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. <b>Nasotracheal</b> intubation was not widely practiced until the early 20th century.

500|$|A {{tracheal}} tube is a catheter that is {{inserted into the}} trachea for {{the primary purpose of}} establishing and maintaining a patent (open and unobstructed) airway. Tracheal tubes are frequently used for airway management in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine. Many different types of {{tracheal tube}}s are available, suited for different specific applications. An endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (<b>nasotracheal).</b> It is a breathing conduit designed to be placed into the airway of critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical positive pressure ventilation of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction. The endotracheal tube has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of pressurized gas such as oxygen. At the other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into the lungs and may also include a balloon (referred to as a cuff). The tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned above the carina (before the trachea divides to each lung) and sealed within the trachea so that the lungs can be ventilated equally. A tracheostomy tube is another type of tracheal tube; this [...] curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a tracheostomy stoma or a cricothyrotomy incision.|$|E
2500|$|IC or MICA paramedics {{are able}} to {{practice}} intensive care procedures such as endotracheal intubation, surgical airways, rapid sequence intubation (RSI), <b>nasotracheal</b> intubation, chest tube insertion, and drug infusions (e.g. Adrenaline, Salbutamol, sedation, thrombolytics etc.). [...] IC or MICA paramedics practice under clinical practice guidelines independently of medical control. [...] The Council of Ambulance Authorities is currently lobbying for an expanded scope of practice to permit more primary care by advance care paramedics, including the role of paramedic as independent practitioner.|$|E
2500|$|An {{immediate}} need {{in treatment}} {{is to ensure}} that the airway is open and not threatened (for example by tissues or foreign objects), because airway compromisation can occur rapidly and insidiously, and is potentially deadly. [...] Material in the mouth that threatens the airway can be removed manually or using a suction tool for that purpose, and supplemental oxygen can be provided. Facial fractures that threaten to interfere with the airway can be reduced by moving the bones back into place; this both reduces bleeding and moves the bone {{out of the way of}} the airway. Tracheal intubation (inserting a tube into the airway to assist breathing) may be difficult or impossible due to swelling. [...] Nasal intubation, inserting an endotracheal tube through the nose, may be contraindicated in the presence of facial trauma because if there is an undiscovered fracture at the base of the skull, the tube could be forced through it and into the brain. [...] If facial injuries prevent oraotracheal or <b>nasotracheal</b> intubation, a surgical airway can be placed to provide an adequate airway. [...] Although cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy can secure an airway when other methods fail, they are used only as a last resort because of potential complications and the difficulty of the procedures.|$|E

The surgical creation of a permanent opening in the larynx is referred to as laryngostomy.Surgical airway management is a primary consideration in anaesthesia, emergency medicine and intensive care medicine.|$|E
5000|$|Methods {{used for}} {{pulmonary}} hygiene include suctioning of the airways, chest physiotherapy, blow bottles, and <b>nasotracheal</b> suction. [...] Bronchoscopy, {{in which a}} tube is inserted into the airways so that an examiner can view them, can be used therapeutically as part of pulmonary hygiene. Incentive spirometry and use of analgesics (pain medications) that do not inhibit breathing are also parts of pulmonary toilet. [...] Coughing is also important for ridding the airways of secretions, so healthcare providers are careful not to oversedate patients, because that could inhibit coughing. [...] Tracheotomy facilitates pulmonary toilet. Percussion, another method, loosens secretions and allows the cilia of the airways to remove material. Positioning is another method for promoting drainage of secretions; sometimes patients are placed in a prone position to aid in this purpose.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to supraglottic devices, infraglottic devices create a conduit between the mouth, {{passing through the}} glottis, and into the trachea. There are many infraglottic methods available and the chosen technique is reliant on the accessibility of medical equipment, competence of the clinician and the patient's injury or disease.
