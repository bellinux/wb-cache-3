5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that he should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> responsible for the content of the film.|$|E

5|$|A {{by-election}} need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> to fill {{a vacancy}} in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Major {{political}} differences between Democrats and Republicans and wartime propaganda caused many Hoosiers to become suspicious of dissenters and fearful of potential insurrections, especially from secret societies {{sympathetic to the}} South. During the Indianapolis city election In May, the Democrats, who decided a fair election could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held,</b> withdrew their ticket. Only 14 votes were cast for Democratic candidates in the nine Indianapolis wards.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the Czech {{invasion}} in 1919 was primarily the organisation of elections to the Sejm (parliament) of Poland in the disputed area. The elections were {{to be held in}} the whole of Cieszyn Silesia. The Czechs claimed that the polls must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> in the disputed area as the delimitation was only interim and no sovereign rule should be executed there by any party. When the Czech demand was rejected by the Poles, the Czechs decided to resolve the issue by force.|$|E

5|$|By {{the next}} day, Mackay {{realised}} {{that the position}} could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with {{the security of the}} new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were severe enough for him to be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> responsible for the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers {{to meet up with}} the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, city {{officials}} {{announced that the}} Peachtree Road Race, Atlanta Pride Festival, the Atlanta Jazz Festival, and the Dogwood Festival would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> in the park due to extreme drought. Some festivals which don't make use of green space were still allowed in the park. The Atlanta Arts Festival ran from September 12â€“14, 2008, and utilized only paved areas. Other festivals were temporarily moved to alternate venues, such as Centennial Olympic Park. The drought in Atlanta ended by late 2009. In 2010, several events returned to Piedmont Park, including the Dogwood Festival, the Jazz Festival, and Screen on the Green.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} {{that the government should}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> accountable for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|After convalescing, Miles re-joined the 2nd New Zealand Division in North Africa, {{where it}} was {{reforming}} after the losses incurred in Greece and on Crete. He then participated in Operation Crusader. During this campaign, aimed at lifting the besieged port of Tobruk, the 2nd New Zealand Division was involved in heavy fighting around Sidi Rezegh, where Miles deployed artillery {{in support of the}} 6th Infantry Brigade. Having established a corridor to Tobruk, the commander of the division, Major General Bernard Freyberg, was becoming concerned that they would be unable to hold it open. On 30 November, he entrusted Miles with getting permission from Lieutenant General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the corps commander, to withdraw into or alongside Tobruk. Tentative permission was granted but only if Sidi Rezegh could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> However, the same day the 6th Brigade was overrun by elements of the 15th Panzer Division.|$|E

5|$|Although the 1940 Olympic Games could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> due to war, Brundage {{sought to}} {{organize}} Western Hemisphere games {{that might be}} able to proceed despite the troubled international climate. Brundage was one of the leaders in the founding of the Pan-American Games, participating in the initial discussions in August 1940 in Buenos Aires. On his return, he arranged for the American Olympic Association to be renamed the United States of America Sports Federation (USASF), which would organize the United States Olympic Committee (as the AOC would now be called) and another committee to see to American participation in the Pan-American Games. Brundage became an early member of the international Pan-American Games Commission, although the inaugural event in Buenos Aires was postponed because of the war and was eventually held in 1951, with Brundage present. Despite his role in founding them, Brundage viewed the Pan-American Games as imitative, with no true link with antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Back in the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus {{speculated that}} the Universe lacked a center and a circumference. He {{believed}} that the Universe, while not infinite, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained. These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology {{to the concept of}} an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called aether, which did not cause resistance to the motions of heavenly bodies. English philosopher William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void. This concept of an aether originated with ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies moved.|$|E
5|$|In {{this very}} tense {{atmosphere}} {{it was decided}} that a plebiscite would be held in the area asking people which country this territory should join. Plebiscite commissioners arrived there at the end of January 1920, and after analysing the situation {{declared a state of emergency}} in the territory on 19 May 1920. The situation in the area remained very tense, with mutual intimidation, acts of terror, beatings and even killings. A plebiscite could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> in this atmosphere. On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of a plebiscite and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors with the decision. Eventually, on 28 July 1920, by a decision of the Spa Conference, Czechoslovakia received 58.1% of the area of Cieszyn Silesia, containing 67.9% of the population. It was this territory that became known from the Polish standpoint as Zaolzie â€“ the Olza River marked the boundary between the Polish and Czechoslovak parts of the territory.|$|E

5|$|On {{the advice}} of Rommel and Jodl, Hitler decided that the Italian Peninsula could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> without the {{assistance}} of the Italian Army. Kesselring was ordered to withdraw from southern Italy and consolidate his Army Group C with Rommel's Army Group B in Northern Italy, where Rommel would assume overall command. Kesselring was slated to be posted to Norway. Kesselring was appalled at the prospect of abandoning Italy. It would expose southern Germany to bombers operating from Italy; risk the Allies breaking into the Po Valley; and was completely unnecessary, as he was certain that Rome could be held until the summer of 1944. This assessment was based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of their air cover, which could only reach as far as Salerno. Kesselring submitted his resignation on 14 August 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{case for}} Hess's defence was {{presented}} from 22â€“26 March by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl. He noted that while Hess accepted {{responsibility for the}} many decrees he had signed, he said these matters {{were part of the}} internal workings of a sovereign state and thus outside the purview of a war crimes trial. He called to the stand Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, the man who had been head of the NSDAP/AO, to testify on Hess's behalf. When Griffith-Jones presented questions about the organisation's spying in several countries, Bohle testified that any warlike activities such as espionage had been done without his permission or knowledge. Seidl called two other witnesses, former mayor of Stuttgart Karl StrÃ¶lin and Hess's brother Alfred, both of whom refuted the allegations that the NSDAP/AO had been spying and fomenting war. Seidl presented a summation of the defence's case on 25 July, in which he attempted to refute the charge of conspiracy by pointing out that Hitler alone had made all the important decisions. He noted that Hess could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held</b> responsible for any events that took place after he left Germany in May 1941. Meanwhile, Hess mentally detached himself from what was happening, declining visits from his family and refusing to read the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|The first air {{transport}} {{mission to the}} Kokoda front was flown on 26 July, when a DC-3 from the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron landed 15 troops of the 39th Infantry Battalion and some stores. A C-53 followed that afternoon with another 15 men and some stores. The flight time to Kokoda was about 20 minutes. An air supply run the following day by a C-53 and a DC-2 found the airstrip barricaded. The barricades were removed, but the aircraft were recalled by a radio message that the Kokoda Drome could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> The loss of the airstrip meant a switch to air dropping supplies. An aircraft was sent that afternoon, but was recalled. On 28 July, a DC-5, a DC-3 and a DC-2 dropped supplies near Kokoda. Three transports dropped supplies near Kagi on 29 July, and one on 30 July. No more missions were flown until 6 August.|$|E
