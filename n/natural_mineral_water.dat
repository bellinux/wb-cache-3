In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water,</b> a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, Malvern's reputation for purity suffered a blow when the rock that filters the water dried out during 2006, allowing the water from heavy storms to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process to take place efficiently. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under European Union law. Consequently, the labels were change from: Malvern The Original English <b>Natural</b> <b>Mineral</b> <b>Water.</b> Naturally filtered through Pre-Cambrian granite and sourced from deep beneath the Malvern Hills. to read The Original English Water Bottled in the Malvern Hills.|$|E

The monastery lay in ruins until the beginning of the 20th century, when some restoration was completed on a few halls and rooms. During the First World War, Dair Mar Elia was a place of refuge which led to the rebuilding of part of the site.

5000|$|Broadly speaking, [...] "mineral water" [...] is {{groundwater}} {{that has}} emerged {{from the ground and}} flowed over rock. Treatment of mineral water is restricted to removal of unstable elements such as iron and sulfur compounds. Treatment for such minerals may extend only to filtration or decanting with oxygenation. Free carbon dioxide may be removed only by physical methods, and the regulations for introduction (or reintroduction) of CO2 are strictly defined. Disinfection of <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> is completely prohibited, including the addition of any element that is likely to change bacterial colony counts. If <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> is effervescent, it must be labelled accordingly, depending on the origin of the carbon dioxide: naturally carbonated <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> (no introduction of CO2); <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> fortified with gas from the spring (reintroduction of CO2); carbonated <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> (CO2 added following strict guidelines).|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of substances with hormone-like activity in <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> has been repeatedly studied {{over the past}} few years. In a research project of the chemical and veteri-nary inspection agency (CVUA) Stuttgart, the potential oestrogen-like activity of natural min-eral waters was analysed. Additionally, <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> were tested for substances that may exhibit oestrogen-like activity. It was also tested whether this activity is related to packaging in glass or plastic bottles. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the hormone-like activity as well as the toxic effects of substances found in <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>waters.</b> Oestrogen-like activi-ties were not detected in these <b>mineral</b> <b>waters,</b> nor were concentrations of substances de-tected that could cause such activity. However, a number of substances were identified for which no data on hormone-like activity is available yet. BfR concludes that <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> should not exhibit hormone-like activity. BfR advises sys-tematic step-by-step controls: Water obtained directly at the spring, water that has under-gone treatment by bottlers and water that is available in shops, bottled <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> of dif-ferent storage periods should be analysed and compared.
