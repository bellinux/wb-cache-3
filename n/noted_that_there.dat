5|$|Various {{commentators}} <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was {{a renewed}} {{sense of pride}} among the country's indigenous population following Morales' election. Conversely, the opposition accused Morales' administration of aggravating racial tensions between indigenous, white, and mestizo populations, with some non-indigenous Bolivians feeling that they were now experiencing racism.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle further <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are many}} bird forms within the bird kind – cranes, eagles, crows, bustards, sparrows, and so on, {{just as there}} are many forms of fishes within the fish kind. He {{sometimes}} called these atomon eidos, indivisible forms. Human is one of these indivisible forms: Socrates {{and the rest of us}} are all different individually, but we all have human form.|$|E

5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Before long, it was <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably {{is built around}} the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled {{with the belief that}} the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|By May 1947, {{authorities}} in Vojvodina <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a dispute {{between them and}} the {{authorities in}} Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and that the federal authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further attention as its resolution was discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E

5|$|By {{the fall}} of his junior season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of the}} all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a high chance that this would be the fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. He also noted that the class has a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was anything in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane has <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are three views. The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E

5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Taft {{wrote for}} a 6–3 {{majority}} in Myers v. United States that Congress could {{not require the}} president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee. Taft <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no restriction of the president's power to remove officials in the constitution. Although Myers involved the removal of a postmaster, Taft in his opinion found invalid the repealed Tenure of Office Act, for violation of which his presidential predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached, though acquitted by the Senate. Taft valued Myers as his most important opinion.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{were three}} kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which is not surprising given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E

5|$|Klaus Dodds has <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a geopolitical {{aspect to}} the {{locations}} used, {{although this is}} often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played {{against the backdrop of}} Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|On May 4, 1925, Rossi sent {{a letter}} to Mint Director Robert J. Grant. Rossi <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> had been some delay in the {{preparation}} of the design for the new half dollar, and that California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor Joseph (Jo) Mora, with the promise that a finished design, and a model, would follow. Citizens' Committee members had selected Mora unanimously, feeling he was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.|$|E
5|$|The term {{greenwashing}} {{was first}} used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to “save the environment”. Westerveld <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was little else {{to suggest that the}} hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} classes of comet: short-period comets (also called {{ecliptic}} comets) and long-period comets (also called nearly isotropic comets). Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits, below 10AU, and follow the ecliptic plane, the same plane in which the planets lie. All long-period comets have very large orbits, {{on the order of}} thousands of AU, and appear from every direction in the sky. Oort <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a peak in numbers of long-period comets with aphelia (their farthest distance from the Sun) of roughly 20,000AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|By August12, the NHC {{reported}} that Tropical Depression Two was near tropical storm intensity after {{a burst of}} deep convection over the center. At this point, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm; however, in a post-storm analysis, {{it was determined that}} the system had attained tropical storm-force winds, peaking at 40mph (65km/h) for 12hours on August12. Several hours later, the system became disorganized due to increased wind shear. By the afternoon of August13, the system had weakened to a tropical depression and shortly thereafter, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low-pressure area as it failed to maintain convection around the center for 24hours. At this time, the NHC issued their final advisory on the system but <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was the possibility of regeneration.|$|E
