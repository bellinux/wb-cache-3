The purpose of my thesis is to analyse the area of international child abduction and the proceedings of that. Chapter One describes the contentious and non- contentious proceedings and distinction between that with an overview of <b>non-contentious</b> <b>proceedings</b> in cases involving minors and their distribution. For the purpose of this text, non- contentious proceedings in cases involving minors are divided into two subdivisions, namely the adoption proceedings and court custody of minors. Chapter Two concentrates on court custody of minors. Chapter Three focuses on the international child abduction, which is selected from court custody of minors. New substantive law was the cause of creation of the new system of procedural law, which shows a certain degree of shortcomings regarding the procedure for the adoption of an full age.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{analysis}} of legislation of the Republic of Serbia relating to trial {{within a reasonable}} time. The author draws a conclusion that the trial within reasonable time is a right granted to {{the parties to the}} proceedings, guaranteed by special legal remedies, decided upon by a higher court. The higher court does not decide the merits of the case, rather it only points to the reasons that caused the rights of the parties to be violated and instructs the judge to take actions, within a set time, that are directed at speeding up the proceedings. Also, the new Law on Protection of the Right to a Trial within a Reasonable Time of the Republic of Serbia provides for compensation of damages to a party to the proceedings that suffered damages as a result of unreasonable delay in the proceedings. In order for such damages, borne by the Republic of Serbia, to be awarded, it is necessary that such delay in the proceedings to be caused by the court, not by the parties. Further, the paper raises issues concerning mutatis mutandis application of the Law on Civil Procedure and the Law on <b>Non-Contentious</b> <b>Proceedings.</b> The author supports mutatis mutandis application of the rules governing civil procedure to compensation of damages and mutatis mutandis application of the rules governing non- contentious proceedings to requests for speeding up the proceedings. This is in contrast to the present wording of the Law that envisages mutatis mutandis application of the Law on <b>Non-Contentious</b> <b>Proceedings</b> in all cases. The author finds reasons for such position in the contentious nature of the request for speeding up the trial and in adversarial nature of the claim to damages...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this diploma thesis is the declaratory {{principle}} in contentious and non- contentious proceedings. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to describe how the declaratory principle is applied in both forms of Czech civil proceedings, contentious and non-contentious. There are some differences between application of the declaratory principle in a contentious proceedings and application of this principle in a <b>non-contentious</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Parties are much more free to dispose of their claims in contentious proceedings, because the declaratory principle {{is one of the}} main principles of this form of civil proceedings. It is necessary to say that legal system in the Czech Republic is the continental legal system and the declaratory principle is traditional for continental legal system. The declaratory principle also means that the court is limited in its decision making. It is not possible to decide more than it has been asked to. The major part of this thesis is about disposition acts. How it was mentioned before, parties are free to dispose their claims in contentious proceedings and the reason for it is that they are able to use many disposition acts. Each of these procedural acts is defined in its own subchapter of this work and there are also mentioned related judgements. Other parts of this diploma thesis are [...] ...|$|E
