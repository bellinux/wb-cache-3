25|$|Murray {{summoned the}} Corps Chiefs of Staff at around 1am on 24 August (the {{night after the}} Battle of Mons), and ordered them to retreat, but gave them no {{detailed}} plans, leaving them {{to work out the}} details themselves. French agreed to Haig’s request that I Corps retreat east of the Forest of Mormal (Haig Diary, 24 August) without, apparently, Smith-Dorrien (GOC II Corps) being asked or informed. (Inept staffwork was not unique to GHQ – <b>neither</b> <b>I</b> <b>nor</b> II Corps staff had checked whether or not the Forest of Mormal was occupied by the enemy.) On 24 August Harper refused to do anything for Murray, so that Lord Loch had to write messages even though it was not his job. Loch wrote in his diary for that day that Murray was “by nature petulant” and “difficult to work with”. Murray and his staff were working flat out in intense heat at Bavai, and recorded (24 August) that he had passed 24 hours without undressing or sleeping. Smith-Dorrien visited GHQ to request detailed orders on the evening of 24 August, and had to bully Murray into issuing orders for II Corps to retreat to Le Cateau.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what I do and I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I will tell you that <b>neither</b> <b>I</b> <b>nor</b> other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of the {{original}} Norwegian black metal musicians believe that black metal {{does not need to}} hold any ideologies. For example, Jan Axel [...] "Hellhammer" [...] Blomberg of Mayhem has {{said in an interview with}} Metal Library: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I will tell you that <b>neither</b> <b>I</b> <b>nor</b> other [...] members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Although rejecting the idea of [...] "Christian black metal", Satyricon's vocalist Sigurd Wongraven stated in the Murder Music documentary that black metal [...] "doesn't necessarily have to be all Satanic as long as it's dark".|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a {{primitive}} recursive programming language is one that contains basic arithmetic operators (e.g. + and −, or ADD and SUBTRACT), conditionals and comparison (IF-THEN, EQUALS, LESS-THAN), and bounded loops, such as the basic for loop, {{where there is a}} known or calculable upper bound to all loops (FOR i FROM 1 to n, with <b>neither</b> <b>i</b> <b>nor</b> n modifiable by the loop body). No control structures of greater generality, such as while loops or IF-THEN plus GOTO, are admitted in a primitive recursive language. Douglas Hofstadter's BlooP in Gödel, Escher, Bach is one such. [...] Adding unbounded loops (WHILE, GOTO) makes the language partially recursive, or Turing-complete; Floop is such, as are almost all real-world computer languages.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{visit to}} Germany in January 2013, Morsi again stated that his remarks were taken out of context, insisting that they were {{intended}} as a criticism of Israel's policies toward the Palestinians. Addressing reporters, Morsi stated that [...] " [...] not against the Jewish faith or the Jewish people. My comments were about conduct that sheds blood and kills innocent people– things <b>neither</b> <b>I...</b> <b>nor</b> anyone condones... My comments were about the conduct and manners, the killings and the aggression by tanks and warplanes and cluster bombs and internationally banned weapons against innocent people." [...] Morsi also stated that, [...] " [...] cannot be against the Jewish faith or Jews or Christianity and Christians," [...] {{pointing out that the}} Quran requires Muslims [...] "to believe in all religions."".|$|E
