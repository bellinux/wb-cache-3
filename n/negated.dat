Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not <b>negated</b> by regular exercise, though it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|The syntax of verb {{negation}} {{shifted from}} negation particles preceding final verbs to a negation particle following participles; thus, as final verbs {{could no longer}} be <b>negated,</b> their paradigm of negation was filled by particles. For example, Preclassical Mongolian ese irebe 'did not come' vs. modern spoken Khalkha Mongolian ireegüj or irsengüj.|$|E

2500|$|Esperanto has {{a fairly}} {{flexible}} word order. However, word order does {{play a role}} in Esperanto grammar, even if a much lesser role than it does in English. For example, the negative particle ne generally comes before the element being negated; <b>negating</b> the verb has the effect of <b>negating</b> the entire clause (or rather, there is ambiguity between <b>negating</b> the verb alone and <b>negating</b> the clause): ...|$|R
25|$|Negation Theory {{contends that}} the {{negative}} need only <b>negate</b> the affirmative {{instead of having to}} <b>negate</b> the resolution. The acceptance of negation theory allows negative teams to run arguments such as topical counter plans that may affirm the resolution but still <b>negate</b> the affirmative's specific plan.|$|R

5|$|Zutphen {{was secured}} for the Spanish, {{though in the}} {{following}} weeks the English managed to capture a major Spanish fort, Zutphen's sconce, {{on the bank of}} the IJssel river opposite the town. Most of the English gains were <b>negated</b> when, months later, the English governors of Deventer and Zutphen's sconce defected to the Spanish ranks and handed over their places to Farnese.|$|E
5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or <b>negated</b> variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E

5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the <b>negated</b> verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E
5|$|Glorious carried four BL 15-inch (381mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, {{one each}} fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her {{secondary}} armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three breeches too close {{together and the}} 23 loaders tended to interfere with one another. This <b>negated</b> the mount's intended high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast of the mainmast on Glorious. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} rushing offense, {{the two teams}} {{differed}} wildly. Virginia Tech, led by Vick, ran for 278rushing yards. Florida State, meanwhile, ran for just 30yards. The Seminoles were led on the ground by Chaney, who carried the ball four times for 43yards, and Minor, who carried the ball nine times for 35yards. Much of these two players' rushing total was <b>negated</b> by Chris Weinke, who lost 41yards on seven carries. Virginia Tech, bolstered by Vick's 97rushing yards, also saw André Kendrick accumulate 69yards and two touchdowns with 12carries and Shyrone Stith pick up 68yards on 11carries.|$|E
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This <b>negated</b> the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
5|$|Stanley and York's acts {{not only}} <b>negated</b> the gains of the 1586 campaign, but also {{undermined}} Leicester's reputation and the Dutch States {{confidence in the}} English troops. The Dutch States decided to appoint Count Maurice of Nassau as Governor-General of the Netherlands and Philip of Hohenlohe as his lieutenant. With the loss of Deventer and Zutphen's sconce, the Spanish were able to levy war contributions in the provinces of Utrecht, Overijssel and Gelderland. Zutphen and Deventer remained in Spanish control until their capture in 1591 by Maurice of Nassau.|$|E

In binary, flip the bits, then add 1 (same as 2's complement). For example, to <b>negate</b> 01'1, which is one-third, flip the bits to get 10'0, then add 1 to get 10'1, and roll right to shorten it to 01' [...] which is minus one-third.|$|R
2500|$|The {{orthogonal}} matrices whose determinant is +1 form a path-connected {{normal subgroup}} of [...] of index 2, the special orthogonal group [...] of rotations. The quotient group [...] is isomorphic to , with the projection map choosing [...] or [...] {{according to the}} determinant.

If [...] is odd, then the semidirect product is in fact a direct product, and any orthogonal matrix can be produced by taking a rotation matrix and possibly <b>negating</b> all of its columns. This follows from the property of determinants that <b>negating</b> a column <b>negates</b> the determinant, and thus <b>negating</b> an odd (but not even) number of columns <b>negates</b> the determinant.|$|R
5|$|Alone, Williams {{had more}} rushing yards {{than all of}} Tennessee's players combined. Tennessee's leading rusher was Montario Hardesty, who carried the ball 18 times for 39 yards and a touchdown. Hardesty had 1,345 rushing yards on the season, the fourth-highest season total for any player in Tennessee's history. Tennessee's No. 2 rusher was Tauren Poole, who gained 15 yards on 3 carries. Collectively, Tennessee had just five yards net rushing, the second-least ever in a Tennessee bowl game and the least allowed by Virginia Tech in a bowl game. Most of Tennessee's rushing gains were <b>negated</b> when quarterback Jonathan Crompton was sacked six times, losing 55 yards.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Americans {{entered the}} battle with a very good picture of where, when, and in what {{strength}} the Japanese would appear. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had <b>negated</b> their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, all too-widely separated {{to be able to}} support each other. This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier Striking Force, reducing the number of anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers. Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained mainly unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.|$|E
5|$|At 10:10 of {{the third}} quarter Roethlisberger {{completed}} a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14–9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was <b>negated</b> due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of the end zone on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison—who was called in to replace injured long snapper Greg Warren—snapped the ball out of the end zone to give the Giants a safety and tie the game. The Giants drove after receiving the safety's kickoff to score a touchdown—taking a 21–14 lead with 3:07 remaining. Pittsburgh was unable to convert on their final two drives, as Roethlisberger threw his fourth interception of the day.|$|E

5000|$|While the CPC {{concur with}} Gorbachev's {{assessment}} that the CPSU needed internal reform, {{they do not}} agree on how it was implemented, criticizing his idea of [...] "humanistic and democratic socialism", of <b>negating</b> the leading role of the CPSU, of <b>negating</b> Marxism, of <b>negating</b> the analysis of class contradictions and class struggle, and of <b>negating</b> the [...] "ultimate socialist goal of realizing communism". Unlike the other Soviet leaders, Gorbachev is criticized for pursuing the wrong reformist policies and for being too flexible and too rightist. The CPC Organization Department said, [...] "What Gorbachev in fact did was not to transform the CPSU by correct principles—indeed the Soviet Communist Party needed transformation—but instead he, step-by-step, and ultimately, eroded the ruling party's dominance in ideological, political and organizational aspects".|$|R

Such <b>negating</b> words generally have corresponding negative polarity items (ever for never, anybody for nobody, etc.) which can appear in a negative context, but are not negative themselves (and can thus be used after a negation without giving rise to double negatives).|$|R
5|$|Both teams {{came into}} this game after losses the {{previous}} week. Iowa State dropped to 3–3 (0–2 Big12) with a 28–14 loss to Nebraska in Ames. There were three Cyclone touchdowns <b>negated</b> by the officials in that game (one called caught out of bounds, two on offensive penalties). Oklahoma lost to Texas {{for the second straight}} year in the Red River Rivalry in Dallas and was unable to mount a successful offensive drive for the entire second half. The Sooners also committed 11penalties (a full third of their season total at the time) and five turnovers in that game. After equally disappointing weeks, both teams were looking to rebound.|$|E
5|$|Chris Chibnall {{wanted to}} write a story that tackled the issue of loss and {{revolved}} around a missing person case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic themes in the episode and cited the script as one of his inspirations in continuing the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against type in the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no easy answer. Some critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes <b>negated</b> these.|$|E
5|$|Following the duels, general {{engagement}} {{between the}} two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were <b>negated</b> by the Muslim archers. Enjoying {{the best of these}} early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift the outcome of the battle, as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.|$|E
