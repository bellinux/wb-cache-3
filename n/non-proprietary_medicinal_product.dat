In the empirical research are included 758 regulated prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed by the outpatients’ department on a prescription (Rp) during the years 2003 – 2010, which are financed from public expenditures. The correlation and regression analyses are used {{in order to establish}} the association between the regulated wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The correlation analysis confirmed a strong positive correlation of the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> with the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, a weak correlation with the wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and with the classification lists of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The multiple regression analysis confirmed a positive significant impact of the wholesale price of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, on the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The research has confirmed the association of the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> with the regulated wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> It has underlined the importance of the rational prescription and use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The explanatory variables included in the regression model for the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> explained up to 94 % of variability in the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{reference}} price system in Slovenia is {{used with the}} aim of managing and reducing public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> We aim to investigate whether the {{reference price}} system has had an effect on real price reductions for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> We present the reference price regulation system for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and empirically estimate the effect of price regulation on the development of real prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and its economic rationale. The main thesis that the nominal and real prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during price regulation is revealed by the Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test, by confirming the existence of statistically significant differences in prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Therefore, we adopt the alternative hypothesis that prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the price regulation system. The reference price regulation system, with an efficient use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and their efficient supply, could have positive effects on management and reduction of public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> price regulation for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> reference price system, Slovenia...|$|R

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years. The regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices ofgeneric <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined more than the prices of original <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Conclusions: We have found that the analysed regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed period 2003 – 2010.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Clinical trials assessing typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> require authorisation from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire. The report revealed that, even though {{a number of countries}} had developed legislative texts on <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> these texts vary widely from one country to another and in only a few cases are they specific to veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> In most cases, the implementing regulations are not properly enforced.

40|$|According to the European Medicine Agency, a “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> {{that contains a}} version of the active substance of an original biological <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (reference or innovative <b>medicinal</b> <b>product)</b> that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable {{to a wide range of}} chemically derived <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity. Furthermore, these biopharmaceuticals products, in comparison with the conventional ones, show a greater ability to activate the immune response. The evaluation of biosimilar medicines for authorisation purposes by the European Medicine Agency does not include recommendations on whether a biosimilar should be used interchangeably with its reference medicine. Substitution policies are, therefore, within the remit of the EU member states. In order to support pharmacovigilance monitoring, all appropriate measures should be taken to clearly identify any biological <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> with due regard to its brand name and batch number.

40|$|While {{the safety}} and {{availability}} of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{for the majority of}} adult patients has steadily improved in recent decades, for children and people suffering from rare diseases (orphan diseases) {{there is a lack of}} approved <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> for these patient populations. Since the research and development of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> is associated with high costs, the costs for paediatric <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicines for rare diseases (orphan drugs) may barely be covered under normal market conditions due to the small patient populations. In order to prevent the continued exclusion of children and persons suffering from rare diseases from medical progress and to eliminate the deficits in the research and development of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> for these patient groups, the European Union created, along the lines of the U.
