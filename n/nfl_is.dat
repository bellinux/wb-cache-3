5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> {{the only one of}} the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played until there is a winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals that he did not know a tie was a possible result.|$|E
25|$|Despite having {{over ten}} million people, North Carolina's {{population}} being {{spread out over}} three major metropolitan areas precluded attracting any major professional sports league teams until 1974, when the New York Stars of the World Football League was relocated to Charlotte {{in the middle of}} the season and renamed the Charlotte Hornets (although the team was referred to as the Charlotte Stars for the first game in Charlotte). The National Football League (<b>NFL)</b> <b>is</b> represented by the Carolina Panthers, who began play in 1995, and call Charlotte's Bank of America Stadium home. North Carolina was home to the Charlotte Rage and the Carolina Cobras of the Arena Football League. Since 2017, Boone has been home to the High Country Grizzlies of the American Arena League.|$|E
25|$|Flutie {{became the}} Buffalo Bills' quarterback five games into the 1998 season. The Bills were {{initially}} uninterested in signing him, but then-pro personnel director A.J. Smith convinced {{the organization that}} Flutie {{would be a great}} asset to the team. In his first action with the Bills, Flutie entered for an injured Rob Johnson and passed for two TDs while leading a fourth-quarter comeback against the Indianapolis Colts on October 11, 1998. The following week, Doug Flutie made his first NFL start since October 15, 1989, against the unbeaten Jacksonville Jaguars. The nine-year gap between starts for a quarterback in the <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> the third-longest in duration behind Tommy Maddox (December 12, 1992 to October 6, 2002) and Todd Collins (December 14, 1997 to December 16, 2007). Flutie was the hero of the Bills' victory as he scored the winning touchdown against the Jaguars by rolling out on a bootleg and into the end zone on a fourth-down play in the waning seconds. The Bills' success continued with Flutie at the helm; his record as a starter that season was 8 wins and 3 losses. Flutie was selected to play in the 1998 Pro Bowl, and is currently the shortest quarterback to make the Pro Bowl since 1970.|$|E

500|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{considered}} the key player for the Virginia Tech offense heading into the Gator Bowl.

On the ground, he ran for 370yards and six touchdowns. Prior to the Gator Bowl, he pledged that he would return for another season at Virginia Tech before entering the NFL draft. [...] "The <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> tough. It's the real deal. You've got to be ready for it. You just don't want to rush into just throwing yourself out there because of the money or anything like that. You've got to really be prepared for it", he said.|$|E

500|$|The company {{contemplated}} {{purchasing the}} Argonauts of the CFL at least twice, with minority partner Tanenbaum keen {{to add the}} team to his list of franchises, but concluded that the cost and effort {{that would be required}} to make the team profitable was not worth the minimal financial upside. [...] In 2013, it was reported that the company was again considering purchasing the team and having them play at a renovated BMO Field, with the asking price reportedly $20 million, but later coming down to $10 million. [...] A vote by MLSE's board on purchasing the team was called in December 2013, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the issue. [...] On May 20, 2015 it was announced that two of the three ownership partners of MLSE, Bell Canada and Tanenbaum's Kilmer Group, had acquired ownership of the Argos, with the deal to close {{at the end of the}} year, and would move the team to BMO Field for the 2016 season. It has been speculated that Rogers was not interested in investing in the team since Bell has exclusive rights to broadcast all CFL games. It is thought that control of the Argos by MLSE will enhance Toronto's chances of acquiring an NFL franchise, with Peddie saying [...] "the <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> telling them that if you want an NFL team, you better make sure the Argos are okay." [...] Leiweke has said that moving into a renovated BMO field [...] "will help turn [...] around" [...] and that [...] "there's no way the NFL comes here without the CFL being unbelievably successful first." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> {{very active}} on {{stopping}} {{what it says}} is unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms [...] "NFL", [...] "Super Bowl", and [...] "Super Sunday". As a result, many events and promotions tied to the game, but not sanctioned by the NFL, are asked to refer to it with colloquialisms such as [...] "The Big Game", or other generic descriptions. [...] A radio spot for Planters nuts parodied this, by saying [...] "it would be super...to have a bowl...of Planters nuts while watching the big game!" [...] and comedian Stephen Colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the [...] "Superb Owl". [...] In 2015, the NFL filed opposition with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to a trademark application submitted by an Arizona-based nonprofit for [...] "Superb Owl". [...] The NFL claims that the use of the phrase [...] "Super Bowl" [...] implies an NFL affiliation, and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly; for example, the league says Super Bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that [...] "promote a message", while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the Super Bowl on any television screen larger than 55inches. Some critics say the <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that [...] "any use is prohibited", as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the United States. Legislation was proposed by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in 2008 [...] "to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games", and [...] "for other purposes".|$|E

[...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The <b>NFL</b> <b>is</b> so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionA {{decreased}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (CSF) p-Tau 181 to total tau ratio (p/t-tau) is a biomarker for frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP 43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and for {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS). CSF light chain neurofilaments (<b>NfL)</b> <b>are</b> increased in ALS. We examined whether CSF p/t-tau and <b>NfL</b> <b>are</b> related to ALS status in FTLD-TDP. MethodsWe compared CSF p/t-tau and NfL levels between patients with FTLD-TDP with ALS (n =  15), FTLD-TDP without ALS (n =  17), FTLD-Tau (n =  6), Alzheimer's disease (AD; n =  25), and subjective memory complaints (SMC, n =  24). ResultsApart from FTLD-Tau, all groups differed significantly with increasing p/t-tau ratios from FTLD-TDP with ALS to FTLD-TDP without ALS to AD and SMC. CSF <b>NfL</b> <b>was</b> very high in FTLD-TDP with ALS followed by FTLD-TDP without ALS, AD, and SMC. Both biomarkers correlated with survival. DiscussionCSF p/t-tau ratio and <b>NfL</b> levels <b>are</b> strongly driven by ALS status. These markers, therefore, {{appear to be more}} of prognostic than diagnostic significance...|$|R
