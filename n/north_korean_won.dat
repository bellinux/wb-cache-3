2500|$|The won ( [...] ; , symbol: ₩; code: KRW) or the Korean Republic Won is the {{currency}} of South Korea. A single won is divided into 100 jeon, the monetary subunit. The jeon is no longer used for everyday transactions, and appears only in foreign exchange rates. The won is issued by the Bank of Korea, based {{in the capital city}} of Seoul. The official currency of North Korea, issued by the Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which is based in its capital city, Pyongyang, is divided into the same number of units, and is known as the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>won.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>won</b> are {{intended}} exclusively for North Korean citizens, and the Bank of Trade (무역은행) issued a separate currency (or foreign exchange certificates) for visitors, {{like many other}} socialist states. However, North Korea made two varieties of foreign exchange certificates, one for visitors from [...] "socialist countries" [...] which were colored red and hence nicknamed [...] "red won", {{and the other for}} visitors from [...] "capitalist countries" [...] which were colored blue/green and hence known as [...] "blue won". FECs were used until 1999, then officially abolished in 2002, in favor of visitors paying directly with hard currency, especially the euro. Since at least 2012 foreigners (and [...] privileged locals) can buy goods priced in 'tied' won using a local debit card, which they have to credit with exchanging foreign currency (Euro, United States dollar or Renminbi/Yuan) at the official bank rate. One euro would provide a credit of 130 won. This card can be used for instance at the famous Pyongyang Department Store No. 1 or at the different stores at the international hotels, where the goods are priced at the tied won rate. This tied won does not exist in the form of bank notes. In normal stores and markets goods are priced in what has been called the 'untied' won or free market rate and regular banknotes can be used here. At for instance the Tongil Market and the Kwangbok Department Store (a.k.a. the Chinese Market) there are semi-official exchange agents who will give in regular banknotes around 10,000 won for one euro (2012) to locals and foreigners alike, so almost 77 times as much as the tied rate. However, the prices in the normal shops outside the tied won and restricted state shops are also based on this untied won rate.|$|E
