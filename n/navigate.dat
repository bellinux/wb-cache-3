5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to <b>navigate</b> to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they <b>navigate</b> inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E

By contrast <b>navigated</b> total knee arthroplasty has not shown significant functional improvements to date, when compared with conventional surgery using subjective clinical questionnaire scores. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the knee joint kinematics measured during functional activities using electrogoniometry 12 months after total knee arthroplasty in randomised <b>navigated</b> and conventional total knee arthroplasty groups. The study design was a double blinded, randomised, prospective, controlled trial. The patients were randomised into 2 surgical groups (n= 102 <b>navigated</b> group, n= 98 conventional group; mean age navigated= 67, conventional= 67). Flexible electrogoniometry was used to measure patient's knee kinematics with respect to time during 12 functional activities. No significant difference was found in terms of the maximum, minimum and excursion knee joint angle during any of the functional activities.

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: The {{postoperative}} mechanical axis in 36 {{cases of}} total knee arthroplasty using <b>navigated</b> and mechanical alignment systems was evaluated and compared. All the operations were performed {{over the same}} period by the same surgeon and team, who were beginners in the <b>navigated</b> technique and experienced in the mechanical technique. Methods: Between 2008 and 2010, 36 total knee prostheses were performed and compared: 25 <b>navigated</b> and 11 mechanical procedures. Any deviation from the axis measured on the panoramic postoperative X-ray was considered positive. Results: The <b>navigated</b> prostheses produced a mean axis deviation of 1. 32 degrees and standard deviation of 1. 57 degrees and the mechanical, respectively 3. 18 and 2. 99 degrees. There was better alignment with a tendency towards a statistical difference favoring the <b>navigated</b> technique. Conclusion: There were significantly more cases with axis deviation greater than three degrees using the mechanical technique. The <b>navigated</b> technique was incorporated by this team without additional complications and, even without experience of <b>navigated</b> surgery, the initial cases achieved better alignment than with the mechanical technique, and a significantly smaller number of outliers from the three-degree safety zone...|$|R
