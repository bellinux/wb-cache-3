5|$|In November 2016, a {{few days}} before the United States presidential {{elections}} where Donald Trump was the Republican nominee for president, news came out that McDougal had received a payment of $150,000 from The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> for exclusive rights to her story of an affair she had with Trump in 2006 and 2007. However, the story has never been published, with The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> being on record for having endorsed Trump for president.|$|E

25|$|Charles Ogletree, {{a former}} {{criminal}} defense attorney, {{and professor at}} Harvard Law School, said on a 2005 Frontline program that the best investigative reporting around the events and facts of the murder, and {{the evidence of the}} trial, was by the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer.</b>|$|E
25|$|A $25,000 reward {{from the}} City of Los Angeles and a $15,000 reward from Los Angeles County were {{similarly}} withdrawn following the family's request. Tabloid newspapers The Globe ($200,000) and the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> ($100,000) also offered rewards for information {{that were not}} withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|Tabloids: {{half the}} size of broadsheets at 380mm × 300mm (15 × 11¾ inches), and often {{perceived}} as sensationalist in contrast to broadsheets. Examples include The Sun, The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer,</b> The Star Magazine, New York Post, the Chicago Sun-Times, The Princely State, The Globe.|$|E
25|$|On January 21, 2010, John Edwards {{admitted}} that he was, indeed, Quinn's father. In late January 2010, John and Elizabeth separated. In February 2010, The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> reported that Edwards had proposed to Hunter, but that report was categorically denied by an Edwards spokesperson.|$|E
25|$|According to an {{interview}} in the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer,</b> Christiane Plante claimed that Bollea {{had an affair with}} her in 2007 while the Hogan family was shooting Hogan Knows Best. Plante was 33 {{years old at the time}} and had worked with Brooke Hogan on her 2006 album.|$|E
25|$|After the {{allegations}} resurfaced in 2014, Wendy Williams recalled that during her radio {{show in the}} 1990s, she made a reference to sexual assault allegations against Cosby that had {{been published in the}} <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer.</b> Williams said Cosby called her boss {{in the middle of the}} radio broadcast demanding that Williams be fired.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{surfaced}} in late 2011 in The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> and RadarOnline.com that Edwards asked his former mistress {{to move into}} his North Carolina home, where he had once lived with his wife. Rielle Hunter announced her breakup with Edwards {{on the same day}} she released a book about their relationship in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Various UFO {{conspiracy}} {{ideas have}} flourished {{on the internet}} and were frequently featured on Art Bell's program, Coast to Coast AM. According to MUFON, the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> reported that a survey found 76% of participants felt the government was not revealing all it knew about UFOs, 54% thought UFOs definitely or probably existed, and 32% thought UFOs came from outer space.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Humperdinck filed a {{libel suit}} against the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer.</b> The origin of the libelous {{statements}} {{was said to be}} Kathy Jetter, the mother of Humperdinck's illegitimate child, and were made in an affidavit filed by Jetter in New York Family Court in an effort to increase child support payments from Humperdinck. Jetter lost the action. Jetter had successfully brought a paternity suit against Humperdinck following the birth of her daughter Jennifer in 1977.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1982 by Dr. Charles Holland, based on his work {{reducing}} defects in urethane foam used in nuclear weapons. He was influenced by prior work by British statisticians to improve anti-aircraft shells in World War II, the book The Design of Experiments, and his work supporting seminars with Edwards Deming. The company has designed experiments to determine {{the layout of the}} front page of the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer,</b> to reduce defects and costs in DuPont's manufacturing plants and to assess the optimal format for Lowe's' newspaper advertising inserts.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Shawn Upshaw Brown, a {{woman with}} whom Cosby {{admitted}} to having an extra-marital affair in the 1970s, claimed in the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> that Cosby drugged and raped her {{the last time the}} two were together sexually. Brown is the mother of Autumn Jackson, who claims to be Cosby's illegitimate daughter. Jackson was convicted in 1997 of extortion after she threatened to make the claims public in the Globe. In 2015, Brown went into more detail with her renewed allegations in an interview for the Daily Mail.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} Yugo {{vehicles}} (Red, White, and Blue) {{were introduced to}} the U.S. public at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show in May 1984 held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The car was promoted with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty, free maintenance, and a price of only $4,500. Front page articles about the Yugo appeared in the Los Angeles Times (Business Section), New York Times, and The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer.</b> However, problems soon arose as one car was sent to the California Air Research Board (CARB) for emissions testing– it failed abysmally. The Yugo needed lots of reengineering, and with no help forthcoming from Zastava, Kefurt was in a problematic situation.|$|E
25|$|The tabloid <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> {{suggested}} on {{its cover}} that Orbison had worked himself to death. A memorial was held in Nashville, and another in Los Angeles; he was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery. On April 8, 1989, Orbison became the first deceased musician since Elvis Presley to have two albums in the US Top Five at the same time, with the Traveling Wilburys album at number 4 and his own Mystery Girl at number 5. In the United Kingdom, he achieved even greater posthumous success, with two solo albums in the Top 3 in the chart dated to February 11, 1989, Mystery Girl at number 2 and the compilation The Legendary Roy Orbison at number 3.|$|E
25|$|On October 12, 2001, Miller {{opened an}} anthrax hoax letter mailed to her New York Times office. The 2001 anthrax attacks had begun {{occurring}} {{in the wake of}} the September 11 attacks in 2001, with anthrax-laced letters sent to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, and the New York Post, all in New York City, as well as the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> in Boca Raton, Florida. Two additional letters (with a higher grade of anthrax) were sent on October 9, 2001, to Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy in Washington. Twenty-two people were infected; five died. In 2008, the government's investigation of these mailings focused on Bruce Ivins, who later committed suicide, with the investigation determining that Ivins acted alone.|$|E
25|$|During June 2005, Berkowitz sued {{one of his}} {{previous}} lawyers for the misappropriation {{of a large number}} of letters, photographs, and other personal possessions. Hugo Harmatz, a New Jersey attorney, had represented Berkowitz in an earlier legal effort to prevent the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> from buying one of his letters. Harmatz then self-published his own collection of letters and memorabilia—Dear David (2005)—which he had obtained from Berkowitz during their consultations. Berkowitz stated that he would only drop the lawsuit if the attorney signed over all the money he made to the victims' families. In October 2006, Berkowitz and Harmatz settled out of court, with Harmatz agreeing to return the disputed items and to donate part of his book profits to the New York State Crime Victims Board.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> began {{a series}} of reports alleging an adulterous affair between Edwards and former {{campaign}} worker Rielle Hunter. By July 2008, several news media outlets speculated that Edwards' chances for the Vice Presidency as well as other positions such as the Attorney General were harmed by the allegations, which now included that he fathered a child with Hunter and had visited her and the baby girl at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. However, the story was not widely covered by the press for some time, until, after initially denying the allegations, Edwards admitted the affair. On January 21, 2010, John Edwards issued a press release to admit that he fathered Hunter's child.|$|E
25|$|Some of QualPro's {{clients include}} DuPont, Williams-Sonoma, Allstate, Big Lots and AT. In 1996, QualPro {{conducted}} experiments for the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> {{to determine how}} 20 variables related to its cover, news-stand and in-store promotions effected sales. The firm tested 29 variables in Lowe's' newspaper inserts and 36 {{different versions of the}} insert's cover-page. They found that Lowe's could increase sales by featuring half as many products on the cover and that it could reduce the number of pages from 72 to 48 without an impact on sales. For AutoNation, the company tested 30 variables to improve the effectiveness of ads for local dealerships and found that the size of the ad and whether it was in color had no effect on its effectiveness, despite increased costs.|$|E
25|$|On January 16, 1997, Ennis Cosby {{was killed}} near Interstate 405 in Los Angeles, California. Cosby, {{the son of}} comedian Bill Cosby, {{was shot in the}} head by 18-year-old Mikhail Markhasev in a failed robbery attempt. Cosby's death {{resulted}} in significant media coverage, public outrage and an outpouring of support for the Cosby family. Seeking the $100,000 reward offered by the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer,</b> an acquaintance of the shooter provided information that led to Markhasev's arrest in March 1997. Subsequently, Markhasev was tried and convicted of first-degree murder and attempted robbery on July 7, 1998, and was sentenced to life in prison the following month. Markhasev maintained his innocence until 2001, when he admitted to committing the murder and asked that appeals in his case stop.|$|E
25|$|The {{first set}} of anthrax letters were postmarked September 18, 2001, exactly {{one week after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks. Five letters are {{believed}} to have been mailed at this time, to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and the New York Post, all in New York City; and the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> at American Media, Inc. (AMI) in Boca Raton, Florida. AMI also publishes a tabloid called Sun where Robert Stevens, the first person who died from the mailings, worked. Only the New York Post and NBC News letters were actually found; the existence of the other three letters is inferred from the pattern of infection. The anthrax found in the New York Post letter is reported to have become damp before being discovered. Scientists examining the anthrax from the New York Post letter said it appeared as a coarse brown granular material looking like Purina Dog Chow.|$|E
25|$|At the June 1994, {{grand jury}} hearing, Ross Cutlery {{provided}} store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305mm) stiletto knife {{six weeks before}} the murders. The knife {{was determined to be}} similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that store employees had sold their story to The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> for $12,500. The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to Judge Ito and it was subsequently sealed in a manila envelope to be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating the knife had never been used. The police searched Simpson's Rockingham estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys exactly where it was in the house and it was promptly recovered.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, {{at the age}} of 74, Tipton had {{symptoms}} {{which he}} attributed to the emphysema he had contracted from heavy smoking and refused to call a doctor. He was actually suffering from a hemorrhaging peptic ulcer, which, untreated, was fatal. It was while paramedics were trying to save Tipton's life, with son William looking on, that William learned that his father was a transgender man. Tipton was pronounced dead at Valley General Hospital. The coroner shared this {{with the rest of the}} family. In an attempt to keep the secret, Kitty arranged for his body to be cremated, but later after financial offers from the media, Kitty and one of their sons went public with the story. The first newspaper article was published the day after Tipton's funeral and it was quickly picked up by wire services. Stories about Tipton appeared in a variety of papers including tabloids such as <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> and Star, as well as more reputable papers such as New York Magazine and The Seattle Times. Tipton's family even made talk show appearances.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Lois Pope, {{widow of}} <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> owner Generoso Pope Jr., met a {{disabled}} American veteran at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and {{realized there was}} no memorial in the city which honored disabled veterans. Although {{she did not know}} him, Pope called the office of United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown to plead for a memorial. Pope called every day for the next six months, until finally Brown's secretary put her call through. Brown agreed to support legislation establishing a memorial. Because the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) of 1986 (P.L. 99-625) barred the expenditure of federal funds for memorials, a foundation needed to be established to oversee private fundraising. Brown introduced Pope to Art Wilson, the National Adjutant (e.g., chief executive officer) of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), an organization founded in 1920 to assist disabled veterans. The DAV was itself not a nonprofit, and thus Pope and Wilson agreed that a new foundation, the Disabled Veterans for Life Memorial Foundation (DVLMF; also known as the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation) should be created. Brown (who left office in 1997), Pope, and Wilson incorporated the foundation in 1998, and Wilson was named its president.|$|E
25|$|Since Moore, {{other actors}} played him in later series, notably Return of the Saint (1978–1979) {{starring}} Ian Ogilvy; the series ran for one season, {{although it was}} picked up by the CBS network. In the mid-1980s, the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> and other newspapers reported that Moore was planning to produce a movie based on The Saint with Pierce Brosnan as Templar, but it was never made. (Ironically Brosnan almost became Moore's immediate successor as James Bond.) A television pilot for a The Saint in Manhattan series starring Australian actor Andrew Clarke was shown on CBS in 1987 as part of the CBS Summer Playhouse; the pilot was produced by Don Taffner, but it never progressed beyond the pilot stage. Inspector John Fernack of the NYPD, played by Kevin Tighe, made his first film appearance since the 1940s in that production, while Templar (sporting a moustache) got about in a black Lamborghini bearing the ST1 licence plate. In 1989, six movies were made by Taffner starring Simon Dutton. These were syndicated in the United States as part of a series of films titled Mystery Wheel of Adventure, while in the United Kingdom they were shown as a series on ITV.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, Simpson was arraigned {{and pleaded}} not guilty to both murders. As expected, the {{presiding}} judge ordered that Simpson be held without bail. The following day, a grand jury was called to determine whether to indict him for the two murders. Two days later on June 23, the grand jury was dismissed as a result of excessive media coverage, which could have influenced its neutrality. Jill Shively, a Brentwood resident who testified that she saw Simpson speeding away from the area of Nicole's house {{on the night of the}} murders, told the grand jury that the Bronco almost collided with a Nissan at the intersection of Bundy and San Vicente Boulevard. Another grand jury witness, Jose Camacho, was a knife salesman at Ross Cutlery. He said he had sold Simpson a 15-inch (380mm) German-made knife, similar to the murder weapon, three weeks before the killings. Shively and Camacho were not presented by the prosecution at the criminal trial because they had sold their stories to the tabloid press. Shively had talked to the television show Hard Copy for $5,000, and Camacho sold his story to the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> for $12,500.|$|E
500|$|Brosnan {{first met}} James Bond films {{producer}} Albert R. Broccoli on the sets of For Your Eyes Only because his first wife, Cassandra Harris, starred as Countess Lisl von Schlaf, mistress to Milos Columbo. Broccoli said, [...] "if he can act... he's my guy" [...] to inherit {{the role of}} Bond from Roger Moore. It was reported by both Entertainment Tonight and the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer,</b> that Brosnan was going to inherit another role of Moore's, that of Simon Templar in The Saint. Brosnan denied the rumours in July 1993 but added, [...] "it's still languishing there on someone's desk in Hollywood." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, De Vries aired {{undercover}} {{footage of}} Van der Sloot making {{preparations for the}} apparent sex trafficking of Thai women in Bangkok. De Vries claimed that Van der Sloot was making $13,000 for every woman sold into prostitution in the Netherlands. Van der Sloot used the alias [...] "Murphy Jenkins" [...] to avoid Thai authorities. Peruvian Minister of Justice Aurelio Pastor said that Thailand was pursuing criminal charges against Van der Sloot. According to The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer,</b> he is being investigated for {{his involvement in the}} disappearance of young women he may have recruited for a Thai sex slave gang while posing as a production consultant for a modeling agency that would send them to Europe.|$|E
500|$|Halperin {{states that}} he told a Scientology {{official}} {{he wanted to have}} a successful career in Hollywood but was afraid that if his homosexuality was revealed it would stymie his career. He states that the Scientology official said the organization would [...] "cure him of his sexuality through auditing". According to Halperin the Scientology organization has arranged [...] "cover" [...] marriages as part of a [...] "cure" [...] for homosexuality, and notes that actor and Scientologist John Travolta married Kelly Preston two days after a male porn star told the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> of an alleged relationship he had with Travolta. According to Halperin, Anna Nicole Smith had wanted to become a Scientologist, but decided against it after she was informed by a friend of the organization's stance on homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> {{published}} a story claiming that Woods had an extramarital affair with New York City nightclub manager Rachel Uchitel, who denied the claim. Two days later, around 2:30a.m. on November 27, Woods left {{home in his}} Cadillac Escalade SUV and, while still on his street, collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges. He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving. Following intense media speculation about {{the cause of the}} accident, Woods released a statement on his website and took sole responsibility for the accident, calling it a [...] "private matter" [...] and crediting his wife for helping him from the car. On November 30, Woods announced {{that he would not be}} appearing at his own charity golf tournament, the Chevron World Challenge, nor any other tournaments in 2009, due to his injuries.|$|E
500|$|In mid-June 1998, rumors {{surfaced}} that Rick Schroder {{would replace}} Smits. [...] The following week, Schroder was officially announced as the replacement. By late September, the buildup the Smits' departure {{was set to}} commence with the first episode of season 6, on October 20. On October 7, ABC announced that Smits would be stabbed in the opening episode of the season. The week before the season premiere, Mark Tinker revealed that Smits would be written out in the fifth episode {{of the season and}} Schroder would enter in the subsequent episode. Bochco revealed that <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> and other gossip tabloids had offered to pay for details about the storyline. The five-week story arc was scheduled so that the final three weeks were in the November sweeps with Schroder's debut marking the final week of the sweeps. [...] When the network decided to pre-empt the show on Election Night (November 3), the final episode was moved back to the second last night of sweeps.|$|E
500|$|Leng, {{the first}} author to write purely on Harrison's career rather than on his {{standing}} as a musical celebrity, considers Dark Horse to be a [...] "remarkably revealing album" [...] and writes: [...] "Any voyeur who {{wanted to know the}} intimate details of his personal life didn't need to buy <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer,</b> they just needed to hear this disc." [...] While bemoaning the state of Harrison's voice and the [...] "sonic patchwork" [...] nature of the set, Leng notes that both [...] "So Sad" [...] and [...] "Far East Man" [...] were received positively when first released on albums by Alvin Lee & Mylon LeFevre and Ron Wood, respectively. The difference in winter 1974–75, Leng continues, was that, by championing Ravi Shankar's Indian music segments during the tour and neglecting his duties as an ex-Beatle in America, Harrison had [...] "committed the cardinal counterculture sin – he had rejected 'rock 'n' roll'".|$|E
500|$|Hoffman's {{unexpected}} {{death was}} widely lamented by {{fans and the}} film industry, and was described by several commentators as a considerable loss to the profession. On February 5, 2014, the LAByrinth Theatre Company honored his memory by holding a candlelight vigil, and Broadway dimmed its lights for one minute. In another tribute, actress Cate Blanchett dedicated her BAFTA trophy to Hoffman when she received the award for Blue Jasmine on February 16. Three weeks after Hoffman's death, David Bar Katz established the American Playwriting Foundation in the actor's memory. With the money received from a libel lawsuit against the <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> (which had inaccurately published that Hoffman and Katz were lovers), the foundation awards an annual prize of US$45,000 to the author of an unproduced play. Katz named this the [...] "Relentless Prize" [...] in honor of Hoffman's dedication to the profession. Regarding his material legacy, Hoffman left his entire fortune (around US$35 million) to Mimi O'Donnell in his October 2004 will, trusting her to distribute money to their children.|$|E
500|$|Jackson and Bubbles' bond, {{as well as}} Jackson's other alleged eccentricities, {{contributed to}} the media epithet [...] "Wacko Jacko," [...] a {{nickname}} Jackson came to despise. The media often focused on Bubbles, rather than on Jackson's music, and published many false stories regarding the animal, such as the allegation that Bubbles {{was not a single}} ape, but one of several. A later claim suggested that Bubbles had died; Jackson's press agent Lee Solters quipped to the media that [...] "when Bubbles heard about his demise he went bananas ... Like Mark Twain, his death is grossly exaggerated and he's alive and doing well." [...] Another story, reported in The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer,</b> claimed that Prince, Jackson's longtime rival, had used extrasensory perception to turn Bubbles crazy. [...] "What kind of sicko would mess with a monkey?" [...] Jackson was reported to have asked. [...] "This is the final straw. Poor, poor Bubbles." [...] Jackson found the story hilarious, and his staff reported that they had never seen the singer laugh so much.|$|E
500|$|Larry Nager of The <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> {{commented that}} [...] " [...] packed more {{technical}} wizardry than Harry Potter, but almost no actual singing". He summarized his review saying [...] "If it wasn't quite a real concert, {{it was a}} great show." [...] Ann Powers of The New York Times said the show was [...] "dazzling" [...] and commented that the performance did not suffer from music being its least important element, adding [...] "This dream extravaganza perhaps unwittingly suggested that the Britney we know is herself a dream, an artist whose genius is not for singing [...] but for teasing out the cravings and fears that haunt the modern world. Ms. Spears now wants to awaken to an adult persona, but she may find that the netherworld of desire is her natural home." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News compared it to tours of other teenage artists, saying [...] "her latest 90-minute extravaganza had to be the costliest, most elaborate and, to be honest, least tacky to date". He was also impressed with the stage, calling it [...] "the largest proscenium I've ever seen at a pop show." [...] Camille Lamb of The Daily Collegian named the show [...] "an elaborate, highly homogenized display of capitalism at its finest". She also said the show fulfilled its expectations, saying [...] " [...] a teenage fantasy to a tangible reality." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 7, Trump {{announced}} on Larry King Live that he formed an exploratory committee {{to explore a}} Reform Party presidential bid. Trump planned to use the committee, not to raise money—he would personally fund his campaign—but to advise him on political matters {{in preparation for a}} run. In the interview with Larry King, Trump was optimistic about his chances indicating a [...] "very strong possibility" [...] of victory. He referenced a non-scientific <b>National</b> <b>Enquirer</b> poll of 100 individuals, showing him in first place against his Democratic and Republican counterparts. [...] When pressed, Trump identified Oprah Winfrey as his ideal choice for a running mate, describing her as [...] "somebody that is very special," [...] and that if she agreed to run, [...] "she'd be fantastic [...] [...] [...] she's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman." [...] Oprah's spokesperson later responded [...] "at this point in time [...] [...] [...] Oprah is not running." [...] Trump labeled Rudy Giuliani the greatest Mayor of New York and spoke admirably of Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, saying that Reagan had a demeanor that contributed to a phenomenal spirit in the nation. [...] Trump argued that President Bill Clinton could have been a great president, but destroyed his legacy with the Lewinsky scandal. [...] As for the Reform Party, Trump offered praise for both Perot and Ventura, and attacked potential primary opponent Buchanan as someone [...] "enamored" [...] with Adolf Hitler, based on Buchanan's thesis that Hitler presented no military threat to the United States ahead of World War II.|$|E
