These solutions would be very expensive and could only be justified if they were comprehensively planned, including social as well as traffic needs. However, the report saw <b>no</b> <b>turning</b> back from people's new-found dependence on the car, and thought {{that there would be}} limits to how much traffic could be transferred to railways and buses.|$|E

Cruising can be hazardous due to weed growth, which forms a dense blanket in some channels, but a drain that was formerly virtually un-navigable may suddenly be cleared to improve its drainage performance and become navigable again. One unexpected possibility of cruising the drains is to visit New York, a hamlet just to the north of Hough Bridge on the West Fen Drain.|$|E
25|$|Thatcher herself claimed {{philosophical}} {{inspiration from}} the works of Burke and Friedrich Hayek for her defence of liberal economics. Groups associated with this tradition include the <b>No</b> <b>Turning</b> Back Group and Conservative Way Forward, whilst Enoch Powell and Sir Keith Joseph are usually cited as early influences in the movement. Some free-market supporters and Christian democrats within the party tend to advocate the social market economy, which supports free markets alongside social and environmental responsibility, as well a welfare state. Sir Keith Joseph {{was the first to}} introduce the model idea into British politics, writing the publication: Why Britain needs a Social Market Economy.|$|E

25|$|On , the Cortes met in Lisbon and decreed the {{formation}} of a Council of Regency to exercise power in the name of King John. It freed many political prisoners and demanded the king's immediate return. On 20 April, King John convoked a meeting in Rio to choose deputies to the Constituent Cortes, but the following day, protests in the plaza were put down violently. In Brazil, the general opinion was that the king's return to Portugal could mean loss of the autonomy Brazil had gained and a return to its prior colonial status. Under pressure, John tried to find a middle way by sending his son Prince Pedro to Lisbon to grant a constitution and establish the basis of a new government. The prince, however, already leaning toward liberal ideas, refused. The crisis had gone too far and there was <b>no</b> <b>turning</b> back. John named Pedro regent for Brazil in his name and left for Lisbon on 25 April 1821 after a stay of thirteen years in Brazil, a country he would always miss.|$|E
25|$|Xu Hai's raid {{started with}} three fleets, each several {{thousand}} strong, landing near Yangzhou, Shanghai, and Ningbo. These were later found to the diversionary attacks, meant {{to draw the}} Ming defenders away as Xu Hai's main fleet of more than 10,000 men landed at Zhapu, aiming for the great cities of Hangzhou, Suzhou, and the auxiliary capital Nanjing. After defeating the Ming navy at Zhapu, Xu Hai ordered his own seagoing ships to be destroyed, signalling {{that there would be}} <b>no</b> <b>turning</b> back. He then rendezvoused with his fellow Satsuma raiders Chen Dong and Ye Ma at Zhelin, their base of operations in 1555. The group then headed inland and went on to plunder the market towns of Wuzhen and Zaolin (皂林) in May 1566. In the latter Xu Hai encountered stiff resistance led by the vastly outnumbered Zong Li (宗禮), who only had 900 soldiers from North China. After three days of battle, Xu Hai himself was wounded and his force {{was on the verge of}} defeat, but one final push ended in the slaughter of the government troops, who by this point had run out of supplies and energy. Reinforcements led by Ruan E (阮鶚) did not reach Zaolin in time to relieve Zong Li, and were chased by the victorious raiders to the walled city of Tongxiang.|$|E

On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way I have been doing things is not working.' The big thing about the open-heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs to be kind of kicked in the (butt) to do these things." ...|$|E

[...] Grey's character development has also been known as an influence on the creation of her half-sister, Lexie Grey. Particularly, it has been made clear that they both share the same motives. McKee offered her thoughts: [...] "Meredith and Lexie both want to succeed. They want to be strong. They want to feel normal. They want, so much, to be whole. But it’s a struggle – a genuine struggle for them. Being hardcore doesn’t come naturally. Sometimes, they have to fake it." [...] Grey's personality has been compared with that of Alex Karev's.

500|$|Ruth's {{penchant for}} hitting home runs altered how {{baseball}} is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games {{by getting a}} runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the bunt, and the hit and run. Advocates of what was dubbed [...] "inside baseball", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on {{the purity of the}} game. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, [...] "settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star." [...] Bill James noted, [...] "When the owners discovered that the fans liked to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace , then there was <b>no</b> <b>turning</b> back." [...] While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.|$|E

500|$|The 2008–09 season {{marked a}} {{turnaround}} {{for the team}} for several reasons. The team rebounded from a 10–22 overall record and a 5–13 conference record during the previous 2007–08 season. The season was highlighted by the team's first two wins in eleven years against teams ranked {{among the top five}} in the AP Poll, and by the team's first trip to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament since the 1998 Tournament. Although the team had appeared in the 1998 NCAA tournament, the last appearance in the NCAA tournament that had been recognized in official NCAA records as not having been tainted by the University of Michigan basketball scandal was their 1995 Tournament appearance. [...] The team was in its first year off scholarship probation, which following the scandal had restricted the number of available scholarships. However, the team continued to be prohibited from affiliating with implicated athletes (Chris Webber, Robert Traylor, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock) until 2012, which meant, among other things, that the players could not help the University recruit. [...] The team began the season unranked, but in December 2008 it earned its first place in the top 25 since February 2006. [...] As the season progressed, the team adopted the slogan [...] "Queme los barcos", which is Spanish for [...] "burn the ships", as a reminder that there was <b>no</b> <b>turning</b> back.|$|E
500|$|J. C. Jenkins, Second Parliamentary Counsel at the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, has {{expressed}} some approval at the decision. Firstly, {{he claims that}} it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to Pepper, draftsmanship was a [...] "time consuming" [...] and [...] "frustrating rather than enlightening" [...] business. There are risks of [...] "excessive detail, over-elaboration, verbosity, prolixity, iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that [...] "sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed {{that no one would}} take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called Pepper a [...] "long overdue" [...] decision from [...] "which there is <b>no</b> <b>turning</b> back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where parliamentary sovereignty is confirmed.|$|E
500|$|Michigan {{suffered}} an 80–70 overtime loss {{at the hands}} of ten-place Big Ten foe, Iowa, on February 22. Michigan had led 56–52 with 1 minute and 13 seconds remaining in regulation before allowing four straight free throws by Matt Gatens. [...] The game was notable because Harris did not play during the overtime. [...] At the time of the benching, Harris was in a battle with fellow sophomores Talor Battle and Evan Turner for the Big Ten Scoring leadership. [...] Beilein commented on the benching: [...] "That's what we had to do to make our team better now and in the future.". [...] In the subsequent game against #16-ranked Purdue, Michigan won 87–78, raising its record to 3–4 against ranked opponents on the season. Harris was one of Michigan's leaders with 27 points and 8 rebounds, while Sims had a career-high 29 points. [...] On March 1, Michigan lost to Wisconsin 60–55. After taking a 34–32 halftime lead, Michigan opened the second half shooting 1 for 12. Michigan closed the contest to a 52–50 game with 3 minutes and 55 seconds remaining. They stayed close as Wisconsin missed four of eight late free throws. [...] Prior to the final game of the season, the Wolverines adopted the slogan [...] "Queme los barcos," [...] which means [...] "burn the ships" [...] and which had been used by 16th-century Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortez as a command to his troops to remind them that there was <b>no</b> <b>turning</b> back in their battle with the Aztec. The team traded in their traditional warmup jersey's for shirts with their adopted slogan. [...] On March 7, they recovered from a 51–39 deficit to win their conference finale against Minnesota. Laval Lucas-Perry scored a career-high 19 points, including three straight three-pointers after Minnesota opened up the 12-point lead. Of the three teams that were ranked at the end of February and that Michigan had played twice (Duke, Illinois and Purdue), Michigan split the two games against each opponent, winning against each at home.|$|E

500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites him {{on the back of his}} neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. <b>No</b> <b>turning</b> back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E
