40|$|The {{process that}} allows a call in {{progress}} to continue as the mobile terminal moves between cells is called a handoff. In cellular networks, call admission algorithms {{play an important role}} in improving the performance of the network. In this thesis, we present a new call admission algorithm that improves the quality of service in cellular networks by prioritizing handoff call requests over new call requests. This prioritization is based on defining a controlled dropping ratio that attempts to prevent dropping a handoff call until a pre-specified target number of new calls are blocked. The purpose of blocking new calls is to adaptively reserve bandwidth for handoff calls. The aim of this algorithm is to improve the quality of service of cellular networks by minimizing the grade of service, the <b>non-completed</b> <b>call</b> probability, and the channel non-utilization. The effectiveness of the new call admission algorithm in reducing the handoff dropping probability and the new call blocking probability was studied. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

We present a series of non-complete sets S_k whose minimal uncompletable words have length 5 k^ 2 - 17 k + 13, where k > 3 is the maximal length of words in S_k. This is an infinite series of counterexamples to Restivo's conjecture, which states that any non-complete set possesses an uncompletable word of length at most 2 k^ 2. Comment: 11 page...|$|R
40|$|A <b>non-complete</b> Γ is <b>called</b> {{geometric}} {{if there}} exists a set C of Delsarte cliques such that each edge of Γ lies in a unique clique in C. In this paper, we determine the non-complete distance-regular graphs satisfying { 3, 8 / 3 (a_ 1 + 1) }<k< 4 a_ 1 + 10 - 6 c_ 2. To prove this result, we first show by considering non-existence of 4 -claws that any non-complete distance-regular graph satisfying { 3, / 3 (a_ 1 + 1) }<k< 4 a_ 1 + 10 - 6 c_ 2 is a geometric with smallest eigenvalue - 3. Moreover, we classify the geometric s with smallest eigenvalue - 3. As an application, 7 feasible intersection arrays {{in the list of}} [Chapter 14]bcn are ruled out...|$|R
