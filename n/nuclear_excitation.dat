5000|$|Induced gamma {{emission}} is {{an example}} of interdisciplinary research bordering on both nuclear physics and quantum electronics. Viewed as a nuclear reaction it would belong to a class in which only photons were involved in creating and destroying states of <b>nuclear</b> <b>excitation.</b> It is a class usually overlooked in traditional discussions. In 1939 Pontecorvo and Lazard reported the first example of this type of reaction. Indium was the target and in modern terminology describing nuclear reactions it would be written 115In(γ,γ')115mIn. The product nuclide carries an [...] "m" [...] to denote that it has a long enough half life (4.5 h in this case) to qualify as being a nuclear isomer. That is what made the experiment possible in 1939 because the researchers had hours to remove the products from the irradiating environment and then to study them in a more appropriate location.|$|E

Most notable Jackson and Wetzel in 1969 and Moreh and Kahane in 1973. In both these works use was made of higher energy gamma rays compared with the Göttingen one, conferring a higher contribution of the Delbrück scattering to the overall measured cross section. In general, in the low energy nuclear physics region i.e. < 10-20 MeV, a Delbrück experiment measures a number of competing coherent processes including also Rayleigh scattering from electrons, Thomson scattering from the point nucleus and <b>nuclear</b> <b>excitation</b> via the Giant Dipole Resonance.

40|$|In the {{resonant}} {{process of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>excitation</b> by electron capture (NEEC), a free electron recombines into the atomic shell of an ion with the simultaneous excitation of the nucleus.

In this work, we study the possible interplay of NEEC with <b>nuclear</b> <b>excitation</b> by neutron capture as well as associated gamma-decay and neutron emission in the context of nucleosynthesis. Neutron capture followed by beta-decay of the thus formed neutron-rich daughter isotopes constitutes the basic reaction leading to the synthesis of heavy isotopes.

We show that an additional <b>nuclear</b> <b>excitation</b> of the order of magnitude of 10 keV can cause substantial changes to the net decay rates of the excited nucleus making neutron re-emission predominant.
