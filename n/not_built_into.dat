Unlocked letter boxes are often used for identity theft, including the ordering of something valuable which is then stolen from the unlocked box. By policy, the USPS will not deliver mail to an unlocked or unsecured box which is located at a centralized mailbox installation.|$|E

25|$|The voltage at the {{terminals}} {{generated by}} the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit. For sensitive analog circuits such as sample and hold circuits, integrators, charge amplifiers or high-quality audio circuits, Class-1 ceramic or polypropylene capacitors instead of Class-2 ceramic capacitors, polyester film capacitors or electrolytic capacitors are used. For most electronic circuits, particularly filtering applications, the small dielectric absorption voltage has no influence on the proper electrical function of the circuit. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte which are <b>not</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> a circuit, the dielectric absorption voltage generated can be a personnel safety risk. The voltage can be quite substantial, for example 50V for 400V electrolytic capacitors, and can cause damages to semiconductor devices, or cause sparks during installation in the circuit. Larger aluminum electrolytic capacitors and high-voltage power capacitors are transported and delivered short-circuited to dissipate this unwanted and possibly dangerous energy.|$|E

He must distinguish between the systematic features and sporadic unsystematized features of each dialect, since every dialect has elements that are <b>not</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the system. To regard unsystematized features {{as part of a}} 'system' and to impose an 'over-all pattern' are spurious notions that must be rejected.|$|E
2500|$|The {{microscopic}} {{version is}} sometimes called [...] "Maxwell's equations in a vacuum": this refers {{to the fact that}} the material medium is <b>not</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the structure of the equations, but appears only in the charge and current terms. The microscopic version was introduced by Lorentz, who tried to use it to derive the macroscopic properties of bulk matter from its microscopic constituents.|$|E

Niederwalgern station and Niederweimar station are {{stops on the}} Main-Weser Railway between Kassel and Frankfurt am Main at which stop regional and regional express trains (the latter only in Niederwalgern). Various buslines join {{the community}}'s several centres together and to neighbouring communities.|$|R
30|$|The {{association}} between ketamine’s effect in augmenting fast oscillation {{and the resultant}} reduction in information flow-through was an emergent property that was <b>not</b> explicitly <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the model. Although highly speculative, {{it is helpful to}} consider the implications of this emergence for behavioral and cognitive manifestations of schizophrenia that otherwise only be handled phenomenologically, detached from pathophysiology. In this context, the conjecture is that the increase in gamma oscillation may represent increased stereotypy of neural activity. Information-theoretically, an oscillation implies a reduced number of ensembles (decreased entropy), reducing representational flexibility.|$|R

So firmly was it fixed that, although Roger tried with his whole strength, it did not shake in the slightest; and the work was so admirably done that, from the closest inspection, he was unable to discern aught that would have shown that the cabinet was <b>not</b> <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the wall.

40|$|RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags {{have become}} {{pervasive}} for identifying objects, people and pets, automated payment and theftdeterrents. However, assurance of tag identity has <b>not</b> been <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the RFID environment. Privacy {{by means of}} encryption can prevent the data from being human readable but cannot stop a clone being created. This paper considers recent approaches that have been proposed to breach this gap. These include PUF’s (Physically Unclonable Functions), cryptography, digital signatures and radio fingerprints. This paper contributes a critical analysis of current approaches {{in order to identify}} requirements for RFID tag authentication, focusing on passive RFID tags used for product authentication...|$|R

40|$|The {{variety of}} methods used in health {{services}} research (HSR) embody categorically different epistemological assumptions. These are examined {{in an effort to}} contribute to a usable framework for the evaluation of HSR projects, and in the light of a need in the U. K. for adequate institutional arrangements for the promotion and funding of HSR. Research into organisation has revealed that if desired values are <b>not</b> explicitly <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the structure, other values may appear unbidden. The adequate institutional base is one which embodies, espouses and funds a meaningful and practical scientific pluralism. A possible classification is outlined and illustrated and its implications for competition amongst scientists and the social responsibility of scientists are briefly discussed. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{consistency}} of a relational database is enforced, <b>not</b> by rules <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the applications that use it, {{but rather by}} constraints, declared {{as part of the}} logical schema and enforced by the DBMS for all applications. In general, constraints are expressed using relational comparison operators, of which just one, [...] "is subset of" [...] (⊆), is theoretically sufficient. In practice, several useful shorthands are expected to be available, of which the most important are candidate key (really, superkey) and foreign key constraints.|$|R

500|$|The {{music of}} Atlas Sound {{utilizes}} computer-based MIDI instruments, created and recorded in musical software Ableton Live; the program allows Cox [...] "to turn pretty much any sound into a MIDI-controllable keyboard", according to him. Effects that were <b>not</b> already <b>built</b> <b>into</b> {{the program were}} seldom used. Brian Foote of the band Nudge assisted Cox {{in the production of}} Let the Blind Lead, by showing him the basics of the software, and aiding in the selection of equipment that would be used on the record.

[...] In addition, all of the lyrics on the album were created as they were being recorded on the first take.|$|R
50|$|However, Java does <b>not</b> have {{generators}} <b>built</b> <b>into</b> the language. This {{means that}} creating iterators is often much trickier than in languages with built-in generators, {{especially when the}} generation logic is complex. Because all state must be saved and restored every time an item is to be yielded from an iterator, {{it is not possible}} to store state in local variables or use built-in looping routines, as when generators are available; instead, all of this must be manually simulated, using object fields to hold local state and loop counters.|$|R
40|$|A 90 -day test is {{reported}} of a regenerative {{life support system}} which was completed in a space station simulator. The long duration of the test {{and the fact that}} it was manned, imposed rigid reliability and safety requirements on the facility. Where adequate reliability could <b>not</b> be <b>built</b> <b>into</b> essential facility systems, either backup systems or components were provided. Awareness was intensified by: (1) placing signs on every piece of equipment that could affect the test, (2) painting switches on all breaker panels a bright contrasting color, (3) restricting access to the test control area, and (4) informing personnel in the facility (other than test personnel) of test activities. It is concluded that the basic facility is satisfactory for conducting long-duration manned tests, and it is recommended that all monitor and alarm functions be integrated into a single operation...|$|R

5000|$|In {{spite of}} being a show floor {{demonstration}} system, the system was quite advanced compared to most PRT systems then under study. Most systems had been designed {{in the era of}} Generation II computers (the PDP-8 was common), which were large and relatively slow. These systems normally limited themselves to planning the route in a fixed network with no stops, which greatly simplified the routing task. Vehicles on the network were assumed to be running at a fixed speed or stopped completely in emergencies, there were no on-route stops that could complicate timing. This meant that the guideway network could <b>not</b> be <b>built</b> <b>into</b> existing infrastructure like roads where there are stops at crossing points along the route, stations had to be built [...] "off-line" [...] to allow other vehicles to pass by at full speed.|$|R

30|$|In our view, the {{challenges}} of the resource nexus are <b>not</b> yet <b>built</b> <b>into</b> these future policy tools and not yet reflected properly by research. Climate change and other environmental impacts will have to be fully incorporated into regional planning processes, and can be considered game changers for socio-economic perspectives [40]. The possible cumulative changes of very large numbers of people over the course of years, and potentially disruptive impacts on existing institutions are poorly assessed yet. A more critical view of the aforementioned tools suggests two main weaknesses. Firstly, the international economic order with volatile commodity prices and existing distortions such as illicit trade has been left out. Secondly, destructive tendencies of organized crime, secessionism, fundamentalism and terrorism may have been underestimated. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} socio-economic interconnections between environmental change and the resource curse should receive wider attention in Futures 2.0 research and politics.|$|R
