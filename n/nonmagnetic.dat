5|$|Stainless steels {{contain a}} minimum of 11% chromium, often {{combined}} with nickel, to resist corrosion. Some stainless steels, such as the ferritic stainless steels are magnetic, while others, such as the austenitic, are <b>nonmagnetic.</b> Corrosion-resistant steels are abbreviated as CRES.|$|E
5|$|Mixing about 2.0% {{beryllium}} into copper {{forms an}} alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, <b>nonmagnetic</b> properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.|$|E
25|$|In an {{ordinary}} <b>nonmagnetic</b> conductor the conduction band is identical for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. When {{a magnetic field}} is applied, the conduction band splits apart into a spin-up and a spin-down band due to the difference in magnetic potential energy for spin-up and spin-down electrons.|$|E
25|$|The last-mentioned {{tendency}} dominates in the metals iron, cobalt and nickel, {{and in some}} rare earths, {{which are}} ferromagnetic. Most of the other metals, where the first-mentioned tendency dominates, are <b>nonmagnetic</b> (e.g. sodium, aluminium, and magnesium) or antiferromagnetic (e.g. manganese). Diatomic gases are also almost exclusively diamagnetic, and not paramagnetic. However, the oxygen molecule, because of the involvement of π-orbitals, is an exception important for the life-sciences.|$|E
25|$|Iron sulfide concretions, {{such as the}} Kansas Pop rocks, {{consisting}} of either pyrite and marcasite, are <b>nonmagnetic</b> (Hobbs and Hafner 1999). On the other hand, iron sulfide concretions, which either are composed of or contain either pyrrhotite or smythite, will be magnetic to varying degrees (Hoffmann, 1993). Prolonged heating of either a pyrite or marcasite concretion will convert portions of either mineral into pyrrhotite causing the concretion to become slightly magnetic.|$|E
500|$|Along {{the southeastern}} {{coast of the}} United States, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) is the most {{destructive}} predator of nesting sites. Mortality rates of nearly 100% of all clutches laid in a season have been recorded on some Florida beaches. This is attributed {{to an increase in}} raccoon populations, which have flourished in urban environments. Aggressive efforts to protect nesting sites by covering them with wire mesh has significantly reduced the impact of raccoon predation on loggerhead sea turtle eggs. [...] On Bald Head Island in North Carolina, wire mesh screens are used on every confirmed nest to prevent excavation by resident red foxes. [...] A new concern with the steel cage technique is interference with the normal development of the nestlings' magnetic sense due to the use of ferrous wire, which may disrupt the turtles' ability to navigate properly. [...] Efforts are underway to find a <b>nonmagnetic</b> material that will prevent predators gnawing through the barrier.|$|E
2500|$|It {{might seem}} logical {{to make the}} heavy magnet serve as a mass, but that {{subjects}} the seismograph to errors when the Earth's magnetic field moves. [...] This is also why seismograph's moving parts are constructed from a material that interacts minimally with magnetic fields. [...] A seismograph is also sensitive to changes in temperature so many instruments are constructed from low expansion materials such as <b>nonmagnetic</b> invar.|$|E
2500|$|The ferrous cube complex Fe4C40H52N4O12 (commonly called [...] ) was {{the first}} example of a single-molecule magnet {{involving}} an Fe(II) cluster, and {{the core of this}} complex is a slightly distorted cube with Fe and O atoms on alternating corners. Remarkably, this single-molecule magnet exhibits non-collinear magnetism, in which the atomic spin moments of the four Fe atoms point in opposite directions along two nearly perpendicular axes. Theoretical computations showed that approximately two magnetic electrons are localized on each Fe atom, with the other atoms being nearly <b>nonmagnetic,</b> and the spin–orbit-coupling potential energy surface has three local energy minima with a magnetic anisotropy barrier just below 3 meV.|$|E
2500|$|Tuning a {{klystron}} is delicate work which, if {{not done}} properly, can cause damage to equipment or {{injury to the}} technician due to the very high voltages that could be produced. The technician {{must be careful not}} to exceed the limits of the graduations, or damage to the klystron can result. Other precautions taken when tuning a klystron include using nonferrous tools. Some klystrons employ permanent magnets. [...] If a technician uses ferrous tools (which are ferromagnetic) and comes too close to the intense magnetic fields that contain the electron beam, such a tool can be pulled into the unit by the intense magnetic force, smashing fingers, injuring the technician, or damaging the unit. Special lightweight <b>nonmagnetic</b> (aka diamagnetic) tools made of beryllium alloy have been used for tuning U.S. Air Force klystrons.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{children}} and adults experience problems caused by foreign objects getting stuck in their bodies. Young children, in particular, are naturally curious and may intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins or button batteries, into their mouths. They also like to stick things in their ears and up their noses. The effect of a foreign body can be very different. For example, a coin causes local pressure on the tissue but generally, is not a medical emergency to remove. A button battery, {{which can be a}} very similar size to a coin, generates hydroxide ions at the anode and causes a chemical burn in 2 hours. [...] An ingested button battery that is stuck in the esophagus is a medical emergency. In 2009, Avolio Luigi and Martucciello Giuseppe showed that although ingested <b>nonmagnetic</b> foreign bodies are likely to be passed spontaneously without consequence, ingested magnets (magnetic toys) may attract each other through children's intestinal walls and cause severe damage, such as pressure necrosis, perforation, intestinal fistulas, volvulus, and obstruction.|$|E

50|$|Relative depth {{varies with}} {{temperature}} because the resistivities and permeability vary with temperature. For steel, the relative permeability drops to 1 above the Curie temperature. Thus the reference depth can vary with temperature {{by a factor}} of 2-3 for <b>nonmagnetic</b> conductors, and by as much as 20 for magnetic steels.|$|E
