Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> applied to products of the mind, {{it is possible to}} apply his argument to intellectual property rights, in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another's ideas. Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create. They argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what we create. Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.|$|E

Liberalism rejected the prevailing social and political norms of hereditary privilege, state religion, absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings.

Locke argued that each man has a <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> to life, liberty and property, while adding that governments must not violate these rights based on the social contract.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} assesses Bentham’s {{view that}} the idea of <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> is nonsensical. Bentham’s repudiation of <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> is fundamentally premised on his conviction that rights are the creation of the law and law is a command of the sovereign. Thus, there are no laws and <b>rights</b> without government. <b>Natural</b> <b>rights</b> according to Bentham do not emanate from government and so, are not properly rights. In fact, they have no source and are anarchical. Contrary to Bentham’s view, this paper argues that there are <b>rights</b> (<b>natural</b> <b>rights)</b> which exist prior to the formation of the government, and hence, not dependent on government. Thus, without government, these rights exist. They are not anarchical as claimed by Bentham. On the contrary, it is their non-recognition by the government that may engender a state of anarchy. The paper argues strongly that <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> are the sine qua non for human development. Consequently, their denunciation constitutes an impediment to human development. The paper observes that the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Declaration of Independence, and the French Revolution which have contributed enormously to human development, hinge on the idea of <b>natural</b> <b>rights.</b> The paper concludes, therefore, that the very idea that persons have <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> (non-legal rights) is sensible, contrary to Bentham’s view that it is nonsensical...|$|R
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{separating}} {{church and state}} is often credited to the writings of English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704). According to his principle of the social contract, Locke argued that the government lacked authority {{in the realm of}} individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> in the liberty of conscience, which he argued must therefore remain protected from any government authority. These views on religious tolerance and the importance of individual conscience, along with his social contract, became particularly influential in the American colonies and the drafting of the United States Constitution.|$|E

That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's {{association}} with natural law {{may be due}} to the interpretation given to his works by Thomas Aquinas. But whether Aquinas correctly read Aristotle is in dispute. According to some, Aquinas conflates natural law and <b>natural</b> <b>right,</b> the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the Nicomachean Ethics (Book IV of the Eudemian Ethics). According to this interpretation, Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages in an unfortunate manner, though more recent translations render those more literally. Aristotle notes that natural justice is a species of political justice, specifically the scheme of distributive and corrective justice that would be established under the best political community; were this to take the form of law, this could be called a natural law, though Aristotle does not discuss this and suggests in the Politics that the best regime may not rule by law at all.|$|E
40|$|In {{the age of}} {{revolution}} African Americans fought for emancipation using <b>natural</b> <b>rights.</b> Specifically from 1770 to 1830, the ideals found in <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> philosophy saturated African-American protest. This thesis will focus on such protest as it was manifested it in the North and South {{and the use of}} <b>natural</b> <b>rights.</b> Prince Hall, the leader of the protest in Massachusetts, emulated the popular use of <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> language to argue that blacks were men and deserving of the rights due humanity. Hall utilized the political and legal systems in Massachusetts as those methods of protest were available to African Americans. This produced a very logical and structured form of protest. Other African Americans, such as Gabriel Prosser in Virginia, did not have such luxury and chose to combat their enslavement with the means left available to them, physical force. Gabriel led a conspiracy against Richmond in 1800 fighting for the freedom denied to slaves which he and his fellow conspirators believed to be their <b>natural</b> <b>rights.</b> In 1829 David Walker startled Americans with his ???Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World??? that called for an acknowledgment of the <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> denied to African Americans and a renewal of the fight. Though the means and message of protest varied in these examples, African American protest was deeply inspired by <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> which was not only infused in their language but also crafted their arguments for emancipation.

40|$|Today we tend {{to think}} about <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> as non-positivist claims to limits on {{governmental}} authority — typically claims derived from religion, morality, or logic. These “rights,” by their very definition, exist independent of governmental control. Indeed, that is what makes them “natural. ” This Essay, responding to Randy Barnett 2 ̆ 7 s Our Republican Constitution, sketches a different view of Founding-Era <b>natural</b> <b>rights,</b> their relationship to governmental authority, and their enforceability. With the exception of certain “rights of the mind,” <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> were not really “rights” at all, in the sense of being determinate legal privileges or immunities. Rather, embracing <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> meant embracing a mode of reasoning. And the crux of the idea — {{in stark contrast to the}} modern notion of “natural rights” — was to create a representative government that best served the public good. The Founding-Era idea of “natural rights” thus called for judicial deference to legislative judgments, and it favored broader governmental power just as much as limits to that power. In short, <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> called for good government, not necessarily less government...|$|R

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>rights</b> {{theories}} have powerful reasons {{to limit the}} strength, scope and duration of intellectual property rights. These reasons come in two forms – limitations internal to the basic functioning of <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> as such and limitations arising from rights-based considerations external to the property right. In terms of internal constraints, all <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> conform {{to a variety of}} conditions delimiting the extent and strength of their application. Such conditions include, inter alia, requirements for consistency, universalisability and non-worsening. Like all <b>rights,</b> <b>natural</b> property <b>rights</b> must fulfil these conditions – but such rights require substantial limitations in order to legitimate their capacity to unilaterally impose new duties on others. Consideration of these conditions is, I argue, not sufficient to rule out <b>natural</b> intellectual property <b>rights</b> – but such conditions decisively limit the extent of those rights. By focusing upon the most general and deep-seated mechanisms of <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> thought, this argument aims to be applicable to all <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> theories. I argue <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> {{theories have}} good reasons to accept one, if not both, of two conditions in particular: robust universalisability and self-ownership. As strong intellectual property rights violate both conditions, I conclude such rights cannot be justified by any recognisable <b>natural</b> <b>rights</b> theory. Turning to external considerations, I argue all individuals have a right to intellectual liberty – the right to inform their actions by learning about the world. This is a negative right: it grants freedom from interference in apprehending, investigating and thinking about the world, and in subsequently acting upon what has been learned. I argue this right is grounded in all Enlightenment views of human freedom and flourishing; it is supported by classical liberal State of Nature perspectives, and arises out of respect for human independence, self-governance, self-legislation, self-creation, autonomy and individuality. Acceptance of this right has profound consequences for the strength and scope of intellectual property regimes. I describe the extent we can find this right already operative – albeit in schematic and inchoate form – in contemporary intellectual property law...|$|R

State of Punjab (1996) the Indian Supreme Court held that {{the right to life}} is a <b>natural</b> <b>right</b> embodied in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and since suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life it is incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of the right to life. The US Supreme Court has also declined to recognize that choosing death is a right protected by the Constitution. In Washington v. Glucksberg (1997), a group of Washington residents asserted that a state law banning assisted suicide was unconstitutional on its face. The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
