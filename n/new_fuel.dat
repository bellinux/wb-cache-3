5|$|On 25 March 2010, an A-10 {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} of an aircraft with all engines powered by a biofuel blend. The flight, performed at Eglin Air Force Base, used a 1:1 blend of JP-8 and Camelina-based fuel. On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a <b>new</b> <b>fuel</b> blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based that can be derived using wood, paper, grass, or any cellulose based material, and are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel. ATJ is the third alternative fuel to be evaluated by the Air Force {{as a replacement for}} petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel. Previous types were a synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from coal and natural gas and a bio-mass fuel derived from plant-oils and animal fats known as Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The qualifying session was held in dry and hot weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his fourth pole position of the season, his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:15.632. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard with his fastest time was 0.102 seconds slower and used his team's spare monocoque while the McLaren mechanics fitted his race car with a <b>new</b> <b>fuel</b> pump. Barrichello secured third having changed his car's set-up during the session which garnered confusion over changes in the ride height. Häkkinen took fourth and was pushed down to his position by Barrichello with the Finn struggling in the slow speed corners. Ralf Schumacher qualified fifth and was happy with his starting position. Irvine was pushed down by Ralf Schumacher to sixth in the closing stages of qualifying. BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve managed seventh. The Jordan drivers of Trulli and Frentzen took seventh and eighth positions respectively although both drivers were disappointed with their performance. Button rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Herbert, who took eleventh, missed out in qualifying in the top ten by nearly three-tenths of a second. Salo captured twelfth on the grid with his fastest time set when air and track temperatures were lowered by cloud cover. He was ahead of de la Rosa in the faster of the two Arrows. Fisichella started from 14th position, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Benetton teammate Alexander Wurz; both drivers complained that their cars had balance and grip issues. The two were split by Pedro Diniz in the other Sauber and Heidfeld. Alesi followed up in 18th. Ricardo Zonta set the 19th fastest time and used BAR's spare car when an engine failure on his race car occurred. Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid, covering positions 20 to 22. After the qualifying session, but before the warm-up period, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety delegate, Charlie Whiting announced that he had banned practice starts at the pit lane exit after observing the drivers' behaviour in the area during the Saturday free practice sessions.|$|E
25|$|The {{petroleum}} industry in Japan is now proceeding with {{research and development}} of an original alcohol fuel that differs from GAIAX. However, the commercial manufacture and sale of any <b>new</b> <b>fuel</b> may be barred by existing laws that currently exclude GAIAX from the market. Moreover, the strong aversion by the Japanese consumer to a high density alcohol fuel of any type may prevent commercial success of any <b>new</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of innovative fuels relies on many factors and requires a precise description of the combustion characteristics. In practice, traditional indicators, such as octane or cetane numbers, are used. Obtaining these numbers however requires a specific setup. Moreover, they are not sufficient to predict the combustion timing for innovative concepts, such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). Evaluating and reporting the characteristics of <b>new</b> <b>fuels</b> is therefore challenging. Using a regular diesel engine converted to HCCI operation, we developed a screening methodology to easily characterize and present key features of <b>new</b> <b>fuels.</b> This paper describes the methodology and then applies it to <b>new</b> <b>fuels</b> produced from biomass: valeric biofuels. The methodology presented in this study intends to bridge the work on fundamental chemical kinetics with conventional engine experiments. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|All {{reactors}} breed some fuel this way, but today's solid fueled thermal reactors don't breed enough <b>new</b> <b>fuel</b> {{from the}} fertile {{to make up}} for the amount of fissile they consume. This is because today's reactors use the mined uranium-plutonium cycle in a moderated neutron spectrum. Such a fuel cycle, using slowed down neutrons, gives back less than 2 new neutrons from fissioning the bred plutonium. Since 1 neutron is required to sustain the fission reaction, this leaves a budget of less than 1 neutron per fission to breed <b>new</b> <b>fuel.</b> In addition, the materials in the core such as metals, moderators and fission products absorb some neutrons, leaving too few neutrons to breed enough fuel to continue operating the reactor. As a consequence they must add new fissile fuel periodically and swap out some of the old fuel to make room for the <b>new</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E

40|$|Significant {{advantages}} in weight, volume, and overall system performance of fuel cells would result if high-energy organic substances such as methane and its derivatives {{can be made}} to undergo direct electro-oxidation at the electrodes of the fuel cell without having to be converted by some catalytic process to hydrogen. This study demonstrates three novel fuels for direct-oxidation-type <b>fuel</b> cells. These <b>new</b> <b>fuels</b> are dimethoxymethane (DMM, dimethyl orthoformate), trimethoxymethane (TMM, trimethyl orthoformate), and trioxane (1, 3, 5 -trioxane). The electro-oxidation and elec-trosorption characteristics of these <b>new</b> <b>fuels</b> at Pt, Pt-Sn, and Pt-Ru electrodes and the performance of these fuels in direct-oxidation fuel cells is described. Sustained direct electrochemical oxidation of aqueous solutions of DMM, TMM, and trioxane at high current densities has been demonstrated {{for the first time in}} half-cells and liquid-feed polymer elec-trolyte fuel cells. The oxidation of these fuels leads to the formation of methanol and ultimately carbon dioxide. Cyclic voltammetry and steady-state studies suggest that the electro-oxidation processes occur by chemisorption steps followed by surface reactions of adsorbed intermediates. The electro-oxidation of trioxane is preceded by an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis step on Nafion and in sulfuric acid solutions. These <b>new</b> <b>fuels</b> are best used without further processing in direct liquid-feed polymer electrolyte fuel cells...|$|R

25|$|All {{reactors}} {{continue to}} use low-enriched uranium as the nuclear fuel; however, there have been plans drafted by TEPCO to use MOX fuel {{in some of the}} reactors by the permission of the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC).

25|$|In a reactor that breeds {{at least}} as much <b>new</b> <b>fuel</b> as it consumes, it is not {{necessary}} to add new fissile fuel. Only new fertile fuel is added, which breeds to fissile inside the reactor. In addition the fission products need to be removed. This type of reactor is called a breeder reactor. If it breeds just as much new fissile from fertile to keep operating indefinitely, it is called a break-even breeder or isobreeder. A LFTR is usually designed as a breeder reactor: thorium goes in, fission products come out.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conventional}} design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires the core {{to shut down}} and the pressure vessel to be opened. Due to the arrangement used in CANDU, only the single tube being refuelled needs to be depressurized. This allows the CANDU system to be continually refuelled without shutting down, another major design goal. In modern systems, two robotic machines hook up to the reactor faces and open the end caps of a pressure tube. One machine pushes in the <b>new</b> <b>fuel,</b> whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking fuel bundle can {{be removed from the}} core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary cooling loop.|$|E

30|$|The growing {{concerns}} {{on climate}} change have increased the interest in producing <b>new</b> <b>fuels</b> from renewable sources. Although ethanol provides the first model for biofuel commercialization, different efforts {{have been made to}} develop new processes for producing novel advanced biofuels such as C 3 –C 5 alcohols containing higher energy density than ethanol. These alcohols are compatible with the current fuel infrastructures since they are less hygroscopic than ethanol. Two examples of these alcohols are 1 -butanol and isobutanol that can be blended with gasoline and also can be used for gasoline replacement, as they perform well in conventional gasoline engines.

25|$|The team ran the 1987 HDT VL {{during the}} 1988 Australian Touring Car Championship while the {{evolution}} car was homologated {{and prepared for}} later in the season.

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with <b>new</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes.
