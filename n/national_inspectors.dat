30|$|France’s statist logic creates ‘governance with government’ (Elgie, Grossman, & Mazur, 2017), {{with the}} state the central actor. At the {{intersection}} of civil society and the state, RESF coordinates local opposition to the Prefecture, which reduces undocumented youths’ deportation risk and allows many to regularize their status. Open contestation (legitimized by a citizen logic) and eventual negotiation (driven by the state’s associationalist logic) characterizes the interactions {{between the state and}} these civil society and local government actors. The logic of the state-influenced market economy, however, limits market actors, including flexible workforce policies (ibid.). <b>National</b> <b>inspectors</b> raise the cost of using unauthorized workers, and employers are hesitant to hire them in this environment. Chen, for example, told me he could do at-home piecemeal sewing but Chinese street businesses would not hire him without a visa. Work opportunities are limited for young people in general, making it particularly hard for undocumented or newly documented immigrant youth to find steady work. Chen stayed working longer than other informants at his first job after being regularized, but the part-time work and lack of better possibilities limited his socioeconomic integration.|$|E

40|$|In Korea, a {{national}} inspection system {{was introduced in}} 1997 as an active measure to maintain increased nuclear material and facilities, to respond to all international obligations, and to ensure international transparency and the credibility of nuclear activities in Korea. As the national inspection system settled down, both the IAEA and Korea looked for possible ways of cooperation for mutual benefit. During the 8 th IAEA-Korea Joint Review Meeting on Safeguards Implementation in 1999, the IAEA and Korea agreed to establish a working group for the enhanced cooperation between the two to seek mutually beneficial approaches taking advantage of Korean SSAC expertise as well as ongoing digital surveillance camera upgrades. A working group, composed of experts from the IAEA and Korea, reviewed several options for enhanced cooperation on LWRs in Korea and suggested a measure for implementing the current safeguards approach for LWRs with remote monitoring. Along with the application of remote monitoring, {{it is not necessary}} for IAEA inspectors to participate in all inspections but the IAEA can utilize <b>national</b> <b>inspectors</b> for interim inspections. For the evaluation, the IAEA will take advantage of the data submitted by the SSAC, remote monitoring and randomly selected inspection along with the other inspections performed by both parties, such as PIV.

40|$|In 1948, the U. S. S. R. began {{a global}} {{campaign}} of illegal whaling {{that lasted for}} three decades and, together with the poorly managed “legal” whaling of other nations, seriously depleted whale populations. Although the general story of this whaling has been told and the catch record largely corrected for the Southern Hemisphere, major gaps remain in the North Pacific. Furthermore, {{little attention has been}} paid to the details of this system or its economic context. Using interviews with former Soviet whalers and biologists as well as previously unavailable reports and other material in Russian, our objective is to describe how the Soviet whaling industry was structured and how it worked, from the largest scale of state industrial planning down to the daily details of the ways in which whales were caught and processed, and how data sent to the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics were falsified. Soviet whaling began with the factory ship Aleut in 1933, but by 1963 the industry had a truly global reach, with seven factory fleets (some very large). Catches were driven by a state planning system that set annual production targets. The system gave bonuses and honors only when these were met or exceeded, and it frequently increased the following year’s targets to match the previous year’s production; scientific estimates of the sustainability of the resource were largely ignored. Inevitably, this system led to whale populations being rapidly reduced. Furthermore, productivity was measured in gross output (weights of whales caught), regardless of whether carcasses were sound or rotten, or whether much of the animal was unutilized. Whaling fleets employed numerous people, including women (in one case as the captain of a catcher boat). Because of relatively high salaries and the potential for bonuses, positions in the whaling industry were much sought-after. Catching and processing of whales was highly mechanized and became increasingly efficient as the industry gained more experience. In a single day, the largest factory ships could process up to 200 small sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus; 100 humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae; or 30 – 35 pygmy blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda. However, processing of many animals involved nothing more than stripping the carcass of blubber and then discarding the rest. Until 1952, the main product was whale oil; only later was baleen whale meat regularly utilized. Falsified data on catches were routinely submitted to the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics, but the true catch and biological data were preserved for research and administrative purposes. <b>National</b> <b>inspectors</b> were present at most times, but, with occasional exceptions, they worked primarily to assist fulfillment of plan targets and routinely ignored the illegal nature of many catches. In all, during 40 years of whaling in the Antarctic, the U. S. S. R. reported 185, 778 whales taken but at least 338, 336 were actually killed. Data for the North Pacific are currently incomplete, but from provisional data we estimate that at least 30, 000 whales were killed illegally in this ocean. Overall, we judge that, worldwide, the U. S. S. R. killed approximately 180, 000 whales illegally and caused a number of population crashes. Finally, we note that Soviet illegal catches continued after 1972 despite the presence of international observers on factory fleets...|$|E

Findings indicated that despite the positive developments such as perceiving school guidance services as a need, professional development efforts of counselors and increases in student guidance services, a number of negative aspects of the school guidance services were described by the Inspectors. Negative aspects included the lack of communication between counselors and school administrators, shortage of counselors in many schools, deficiencies in implementation of the “classroom counseling curriculum” and lack of a clear and concise recording system. Inspectors also described a number of problems related to supervision of guidance services including supervision of guidance services by inspectors from outside the field, long intervals between supervision periods, insufficient time allocated for supervision and supervising guidance services most often by reviewing documents and records...|$|R
