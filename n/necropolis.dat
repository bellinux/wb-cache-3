During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, this good fortune came to an end. As bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area, the rolling stock parked in the <b>Necropolis</b> siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the <b>Necropolis</b> terminus was badly damaged. Multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the central section of the terminus building. While the LNC's office building and the station platforms survived, the central section of the station was reduced to rubble. On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed.|$|E

5|$|In 1864 Brookwood (<b>Necropolis)</b> {{railway station}} on the LSWR opened, {{immediately}} east of <b>Necropolis</b> Junction. In conjunction with {{the building of the}} station a run-around loop was added at <b>Necropolis</b> Junction, allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front {{to the rear of the}} train. From then on, on arrival at <b>Necropolis</b> Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned, but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of the cemetery, after which it would use the run-around loop to move to the other end of the train and pull it back to London. Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines.|$|E
5|$|London <b>Necropolis</b> {{railway station}} was the Waterloo, London {{terminus}} of the London <b>Necropolis</b> Railway. The London <b>Necropolis</b> Railway was opened in 1854 {{as a reaction}} to severe overcrowding in London's existing graveyards and cemeteries. It aimed to use the recently developed technology of the railway to move as many burials as possible to the newly built Brookwood Cemetery in Brookwood, Surrey. This location was within easy travelling distance of London, but distant enough for the dead not to pose any risk to public hygiene. There were two locations for the station; the first was in operation from 1854 to 1902, the second from 1902 to 1941.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November 1854 the new {{cemetery}} {{opened and}} the southern Anglican section was consecrated by Charles Sumner, Bishop of Winchester. On 13 November the first scheduled London <b>Necropolis</b> Railway train left the new London <b>Necropolis</b> railway station for the cemetery, and the first burial (that of the stillborn twins of a Mr and Mrs Hore of Ewer Street, Southwark Borough) took place.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the 1852 {{agreement}} and Act of Parliament establishing the London <b>Necropolis</b> Company, the LSWR (after 1923 the SR) provided the locomotives and crew for London <b>Necropolis</b> Railway operations. There was no dedicated LNC locomotive, and the trains were worked by whichever suitable engine happened to be available. (Before the 1864 improvements to <b>Necropolis</b> Junction, locomotives rarely entered the cemetery branch line itself and the trains were generally hauled along the branch line by horses.) Towards the end of the railway's operations in the 1930s the route was almost always worked by LSWR M7 class locomotives, usually No.255.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was never}} as {{successful}} as planned, the London <b>Necropolis</b> Company {{had a significant impact}} on the funeral industry, and the principles established by the LNC influenced the design of many other cemeteries worldwide. The village of Brookwood has grown on the northern (non-cemetery) side of the LSWR railway line, focused on the 1864 railway station which remains heavily used both by commuters and by visitors to the cemetery. Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom and one of the largest in the world. Although not the world's only dedicated funeral railway line, the London <b>Necropolis</b> Railway was the first, the longest lasting and by far the best known. While the growth of the part of Surrey around the cemetery was heavily influenced by the LNC, some iron columns in Newnham Terrace SW1 which once supported the <b>Necropolis</b> Railway viaduct and the LNC's surviving office building at 121 Westminster Bridge Road are the only surviving London <b>Necropolis</b> Company structures in London itself.|$|E

5|$|In 1899 the {{location}} of the terminus was blocking the expansion of Waterloo station. After much negotiation, the LSWR reached agreement with the London <b>Necropolis</b> Company, the owners of the cemetery and the railway: in return for the existing site, the LSWR re-equipped the London <b>Necropolis</b> Railway and supplied it with a new station on Westminster Bridge Road. This new building was designed to contrast with other funeral directors' premises by being as attractive as possible. In 1902 the railway moved into the new building, and the earlier station was demolished.|$|E
