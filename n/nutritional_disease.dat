40|$|Forty Cape Coloured {{children}} who had been hospitalized for kwashiorkor in infancy were compared with their siblings on an intelligence test battery at the 10 th year of follow-up. No significant differences in intelligence test performance were noted. A significant discrepancy between the intelligence test score and the drawing score on late onset cases may be due to affective factors. The groups were similar in terms of height, weight and head circumference. The differences between well-nourished and poorly nourished groups found by previous investigators may be accounted for by the independent operation of non-nutritive variables in the social and emotional environment. The use of intra-familial controls in the present study minimised these influences as well as possible genetic factors in intellectual development. Kwashiorkor is a protein calorie <b>nutritional</b> <b>disease</b> which occurs typically in {{children under the age of}} 2 years. The disease was recognised in the early 1930 's, but only later was the nutritional aetiology realised. Today, kwashiorkor is regarded as a well-defined syndrome representing one pole of the broad clinical spectrum of <b>nutritional</b> <b>disease</b> referred to as protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM). In contrast to marasmus which represents the opposite end of the continuum, the caloric deficiency in kwashiorkor is not as severe as is the protein deficiency.

40|$|Summary {{the first}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>disease</b> ever {{identified}} was scurvy, which was endemic in Europe in the 18 th century.

In light of the current evidence-based paradigm, it appears now that the true effect of vitamin C lies somewhere between the two.

Fourteen male Great Dane dogs at 10 weeks of age were studied during 27 weeks. The experimental design was completely randomized, with two treatments, seven replications, and six months of duration. Treatments were made up of super premium diet given ad libitum (GI) (treatment 1) and restrictedly (GII) (treatment 2). The evaluation of blood and urinary biochemistry as well as the determination ofhematological parameters were carried out. It was concluded that overfed puppies revealed seric elevations of alpha 1 globulin, and lower values of beta globulin, gamma globulin, ALT, ALP, and creatinine.
