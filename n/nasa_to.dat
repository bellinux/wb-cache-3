5|$|In the 1960s, a Grand Tour {{to study}} the outer planets was {{proposed}} which prompted <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> begin work on a mission in the early 1970s. Information gathered by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft helped Voyagers engineers design Voyager to cope more effectively with the intense radiation environment around Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Space {{exploration}} {{has been}} an interest since his fascination with the United States/Soviet Union Space Race during his teenage years. Gingrich wants the U.S. to pursue new achievements in space, such as sustaining civilizations beyond Earth, but advocates relying more on {{the private sector and}} less on the publicly funded <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> drive progress.|$|E
5|$|The project {{also served}} as a {{political}} ruse {{on the part of the}} American government, providing a diplomatic channel for <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> take part in the funding of the cripplingly under-funded Russian space program. This in turn allowed the newly fledged Russian government to keep Mir operating, in addition to the Russian space program as a whole, ensuring the Russian government remained (and remains) friendly towards the United States.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 1, {{which had}} {{completed}} its primary mission and {{was leaving the}} Solar System, was commanded by <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> turn its camera around and take one last photograph of Earth across a great expanse of space, {{at the request of}} astronomer and author Carl Sagan.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|During their expeditions aboard Mir, {{the astronauts}} carried out various experiments, {{including}} growth of crops and crystals, and took hundreds {{of photographs of}} the Earth spinning serenely beneath them. They also assisted in the maintenance and repair of the aging station, following various incidents with fires, collisions, power losses, uncontrolled spins and toxic leaks. In all, the American astronauts would spend almost a thousand days aboard Mir, allowing <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> {{learn a great deal}} about long-duration spaceflight, particularly in the areas of astronaut psychology and how best to arrange experiment schedules for crews aboard space stations.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Apollo 1 fire, to avoid {{appearance}} of a conflict of interest, NASA Administrator James E. Webb asked President Lyndon B. Johnson to allow <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> handle the investigation according to its established procedure, promising to be truthful in assessing blame, {{and to keep the}} appropriate leaders of Congress informed. Seamans then directed establishment of the Apollo 204 Review Board chaired by Langley Research Center director Floyd L. Thompson, which included astronaut Frank Borman, spacecraft designer Maxime Faget, and six others. On February 1, Cornell University professor Frank A. Long left the board, and was replaced by Dr. Robert W. Van Dolah, of the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The next day, North American's Chief engineer for Apollo, George Jeffs, also left.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the Congress {{restored}} {{funding for}} fiscal year 2008 {{as part of an}} omnibus appropriations bill which the President later signed. At the same time the Congress directed <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> move the mission forward to the development phase. In 2009 the project continued its risk reduction work while waiting for the findings and recommendations of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey, Astro2010, performed by the National Academy of Sciences, which would determine the project's future.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In {{the aftermath of the}} Shuttle Columbia accident, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress. By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).|$|E

50|$|On July 23, 2012, a massive, and {{potentially}} damaging, solar superstorm (solar flare, coronal mass ejection, solar EMP) barely missed Earth, according <b>to</b> <b>NASA.</b> According <b>to</b> <b>NASA,</b> {{there may be}} as much as a 12% chance of a similar event occurring between 2012 and 2022, although because this particular figure was based on an extreme extrapolation of the calculated frequency of future storms, the actual probability of this is quite uncertain.|$|R
2500|$|One of Putnam's {{last major}} {{contributions}} as trustee was {{the establishment of}} the Lowell Observatory's Planetary Research Center.

5|$|More unorthodox {{methods were}} also explored. Astrosystems International {{developed}} a so-called “Quartz Chamber” which burned pure oxygen and aircraft fuel, converting the chemical energy into light. The system was {{planned to be}} evaluated within a year, and installed in a similar arrangement to the more conventional BIAS. A plan, codenamed Moonshine, was also put forward. Moonshine {{was to be a}} joint effort with <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> determine the feasibility of a geosynchronous satellite that could in project light directly down on any desired location.|$|E
5|$|Several {{missions}} were {{proposed to}} demonstrate methods of landing the Gemini spacecraft on land. The spacecraft {{had originally been}} designed to land using a paraglider {{and a set of}} skis or wheels, however this was abandoned in favor of splashdowns under parachutes due to delays in development and failures during testing. As the proposed Big Gemini spacecraft would have landed this way, McDonnell Aircraft asked <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> consider flying standard Gemini spacecraft with the paraglider in order to test the system before it would be required operationally.|$|E
5|$|The Moon landing {{data was}} {{recorded}} {{by a special}} Apollo TV camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV. This resulted in lunar footage {{that had to be}} converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes. During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data. Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, President Ronald Reagan {{announced}} the Teacher in Space Project, and McAuliffe learned about <b>NASA's</b> efforts <b>to</b> find their first civilian, an educator, {{to fly into}} space. <b>NASA</b> wanted <b>to</b> find an [...] "ordinary person," [...] a gifted teacher who could communicate with students while in orbit.

5|$|The {{delay in}} the CSM caused by the fire enabled <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> catch up on man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first {{unmanned}} flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{results of}} the mission were mixed. The astronaut returned healthy after nine hours of confinement in a low-gravity environment. Observation of the Earth's surface proved unproductive, however, because of heavy cloud cover and bad photographic exposures. The public and political reaction was muted {{compared with that of}} earlier missions, as the Cuban Missile Crisis soon eclipsed the Space Race in the news. The mission was a technical success: all the engineering objectives were completed without significant malfunctions, and the spacecraft used even less fuel than expected. This confirmed the capabilities of the Mercury spacecraft and allowed <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> plan with confidence for a day-long flight, MA-9, which had been an early goal of the Mercury program.|$|E
5|$|As Barry {{approached}} the Florida Panhandle, voluntary evacuations {{took place in}} eight counties. Shelters opened in six counties, though most were placed on standby. In parts of Franklin County, mandatory evacuations were ordered, and in Okaloosa County, tolls on the Mid-Bay Bridge were suspended. Forty C-130 cargo aircraft and about 300 personnel from Hurlburt Field were moved to the Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas to flee the storm's projected path. In Tallahassee, county officials filled sandbags in areas vulnerable to flooding. At Grand Isle State Park, park rangers moved picnic tables out of tidal range and closed the camping grounds {{for a period of}} time. Additionally, the storm forced <b>NASA</b> <b>to</b> delay a shuttle launch in southern Florida. Elsewhere, thousands of personnel were evacuated from several offshore oil platforms. The city of New Orleans closed 60 of its 72 floodgates to avoid possible flooding. Throughout southeastern Louisiana, including New Orleans, roughly 500Red Cross volunteers and staff members were on standby. The threat of the storm forced the cancellation of an 'N Sync concert at Pro Player Stadium.|$|E

40|$|The {{result of}} an eleven-week study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the American Society of Engineering Education is presented. The study was the ninth {{of a series of}} programs. The {{purposes}} of the programs were: (1) to introduce engineering school faculty members to system design and to a particular approach to teaching system design, (2) to introduce engineering faculty <b>to</b> <b>NASA</b> and <b>to</b> a specific <b>NASA</b> center, and (3) to produce a study of use <b>to</b> <b>NASA</b> and <b>to</b> the participants. The story was concerned with engineering education in the U. S., and concentrated upon undergraduate education and teaching, although this bias was not meant to imply that research and graduate study are less important to engineering education...|$|R
