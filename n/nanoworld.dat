Stability with respect to the scaling coefficients introduced to connect the macro and the <b>nanoworlds</b> is also considered. The theoretical results and the experiments carried out confirm that position control is sensitive to the gain tuning.

In Turtles on the Beach the player constructs (possibly recursive) procedures that produce graphical patterns. The editing is done by manipulating “puzzle pieces ” with code fragments on the screen. In contrast to conventional Logo Turtle environments the programme is executed by a team of Turtles. Each Turtle on the screen is attached to one procedure call.

Recent nanotechnological {{revolution}} mandates astonishing imagination about future <b>nanoworld.</b> Nature has {{ability to create}} nanobiomolecules which can function in extraordinary way {{which can be used}} to produce nano hybrid systems.
