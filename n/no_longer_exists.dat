5|$|Despite the {{significant}} fortifications in the harbour area, {{the rest of}} the islands remained mostly undefended until the 17th century, and they were prone to attacks (such as the raid of 1551). This changed in 1605, when Garzes Tower was built in Mġarr on the island of Gozo. This watchtower <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists</b> as it was demolished by the British administration in 1848.|$|E

5|$|Camuston <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists</b> as a village, but for {{location}} see {{for example}} the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E

5|$|The {{possibility}} of an en passant capture is relevant to claims of a draw by threefold repetition.

5|$|Brooker {{had other}} ideas that {{were removed from}} the {{original}} script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts to not function. However, as the location for the episode <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists,</b> he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} shuttle tracks, only three are in use, {{with the former}} {{southbound}} express track space being used for platform space at each terminal. The former southbound local track is now Shuttle Track 1. Track 2 <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists,</b> but the trackbed of Track 2 can be seen inside the tunnel from passing trains on Tracks 1 and 3. At the two terminals, the trackway for Track 2 is occupied by platforms that provide access to Track 3, which was the former northbound express track. The former northbound local track is Track 4. Track 2 was removed between the two stations in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{designed}} as a defensible battery, rather than a defensive strongpoint. The faces of the fort join to form a half-moon shape or lunette. The guns' primary role was to defend Port Adelaide and the Semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself, and the design reflects this. It {{was intended to be}} supported by field artillery, cavalry and infantry for self-defence and to repel landings. While the fort retains its original form, the ditch and glacis (embankment) have been modified and are largely non-existent in some areas. Ground levels have been changed to accommodate paths and a caravan park, and the original western fence <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists.</b>|$|E
