40|$|We {{present an}} easy, {{efficient}} and fast method to generate arbitrary linear combinations of light {{orbital angular momentum}} eigenstates ℓ=± 2 starting from a linearly polarized TEM_ 00 laser beam. The method exploits the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion capability of a liquid-crystal-based q-plate and a Dove prism inserted in a Sagnac polarizing interferometer. The <b>nominal</b> <b>generation</b> efficiency is 100 %, being limited only by reflection and scattering losses in the optical components. When closed paths are followed on the polarization Poincaré sphere of the input beam, the associated Pancharatnam geometric phase is transferred unchanged to the orbital angular momentum state of the output beam.

40|$|Previous studies reached {{contrasting}} conclusions {{regarding how}} fluctuations in abundance affect Ne in semelparous species with variable age at maturity: that Ne {{is determined by}} the arithmetic mean N among the T years within a generation (Ne ≈ T͞͞N̅͞t; monocarpic plants with seed banks) or the harmonic mean t (N ≈ TÑ; Pacific salmon). I show that these conclusions arise from different model assumptions rather than inherent differences between the species. Sequentially applying standard, discrete-generation formulas for inbreeding Ne to a series of <b>nominal</b> <b>generations</b> accurately predicts the multigenerational rate of increase in inbreeding. Variability in mean realized reproductive success across years (k̅t) is the most important factor determining Ne and Ne/N. When abundance is driven by random variation in k̅t, Ne≤ TÑt 3 ̆c TN̅. With random variation in Nt and constant per capita seed production (C), variation in k̅t is low and Ne TÑt; however, if C varies among years, Ne can be closer to TÑt. Because population regulation affects the genetic contribution of entire cohorts of monocarpic perennials, Ne for these species may be more closely approximated by TÑt than by TN̅. With density-dependent compensation, and Cov (kt, Nt) 3 ̆c 0 is further reduced because relatively few breeders make a disproportionate contribution to the next generation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Nominal</b> command <b>generation</b> in {{real time}} for the control of {{manipulators}} or of maneuvering spacecraft is hampered by the nonlinearity of the equations of motion. Likewise the real time tracking of a computed nominal trajectory {{in the presence of}} disturbances requires the computation of time-varying Jacobians of the motion. An alternative approach is the formulation of acceleration-commanded control laws in appropriately chosen generalized advantageous to design dedicated circuit interfaces to perform the required transformation. It is also possible to guarantee that actuator and sensor saturation limits are not exceeded, by means of feedback-biased circuits that implement automatic overload limitation of acceleration commands. Recent developments following this 'hardware computation' point of view will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} a time dependent {{version of the}} fission matrix method named Transient Fission Matrix (TFM) developed to perform kinetics calculations. Coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics transient calculations are studied using the TFM approach and a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code. The generation of the matrices is performed using the Monte Carlo neutronic code SERPENT beforehand the transient calculation. The neutronic module and the coupling are directly implemented in the CFD opensource code OpenFOAM. An application case is presented on the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). This system is a circulating liquid fuel reactor characterized by a two meter core cavity and a fast spectrum. Thus the present approach is well suited since an accurate distribution of the velocity of the liquid fuel circulating in the cavity and of the delayed neutron precursor transport is required. A reactivity insertion incident of around 2. 5 $ is presented, showing the good behavior of the MSFR in such a case. A load-following from 50 % to the <b>nominal</b> power <b>generation</b> is also discusse...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the fluid {{dynamics}} of the windowless spallation target of an Accelerator Driven System (ADS) is presented. Several target mockup configurations have been investigated: {{the first one was}} a symmetrical target, that was made by two concentric cylinders, the other configurations are not symmetrical. In the experiments water has been used as hydraulic equivalent to lead-bismuth eutectic fluid. The experiments have been carried out at room temperature and flow rate up to 24 kg/s. The fluid velocity components have been measured by an ultrasound technique. The velocity field of the liquid within the target region either for the approximately axial-symmetrical configuration or for the not symmetrical ones {{as a function of the}} flow rate and the initial liquid level is presented. A comparison of experimental data with the prediction of the finite volume FLUENT code is also presented. Moreover the results of a 2 D- 3 D numerical analysis that investigates the effect on the steady state thermal and flow fields due to the insertion of guide vanes in the windowless target unit of the EFIT project ADS nuclear reactor are presented, by analysing both the cold flow case (absence of power generation) and the hot flow case (<b>nominal</b> power <b>generation</b> inside the target unit) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for a}} Two-Span Web Roller machine is defined {{in order to facilitate}} motion planning, motion tracking and state observer design for tracking web tension and web velocity. Differential Flatness is utilized to create reference trajectories that are tracked with a high convergence rate. Flatness also allows for <b>nominal</b> input torque <b>generation</b> without integration. Constraints on the inputs are satisfied through the motion planning phase. A partial state feedback linearization is performed and an exponential tracking dynamic feedback controller is defined. An exponential Kalman-related tension observer is also defined with semi-optimal gain formulation. The observer takes advantage of the bilinearity of the dynamics up to additive output nonlinearity. The closed-loop system is simulated in MatLab with comparisons to reference trajectories previously employed in literature. The importance of proper motion planning is demonstrated by producing excellent performance compared with existing tracking and tension observing methods...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Secret History of the Mongols, {{he was the}} 12th <b>generation</b> <b>nominal</b> (non-biological) {{descendant}} of Borte Chino. Genghis Khan was the 9th generation biological {{descendant of}} Bodonchar Munkhag (sometimes written Butanchar the Simple). Bodonchar Munkhag {{is the founder of}} the House of Borjigin. Chagatai tradition dates 'Buzanjar Munqaq' to the rebellion of Abu Muslim or 747 CE. The name Borjigin does not come from Bodonchar but from Bodonchar's nominal great-grandfather Borjigidai the Wise (Borjigidai Mergen). The date 747 CE corresponds better with Borjigidai Mergen. A confusion with Bayanchur Khan could also account for this date discrepancy. Bodonchar Munkhag means [...] "little misbegotten simpleton". Bodonchar or more accurately Butunchar (Mongolian back vowel ʊ) is a diminutive form of [...] "butuchi" [...] (illegitimate child, misbegotten, bastard) using the diminutive suffix [...] "-nchar" [...] while Munkhag means fool or simpleton. The meaning of the name contrasts with his elevated stature among the Mongol tribes.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present for the}} first time the new digital {{elevation}} model (DEM) for Greenland produced by the TanDEM-X (TerraSAR add-on for digital elevation measurement) mission. The new, full coverage DEM of Greenland has a resolution of 0. 4 arc seconds corresponding to 12 m. It is composed of more than 7. 000 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) DEM scenes. X- Band SAR penetrates the snow and ice pack by several meters depending on the structures within the snow, the acquisition parameters, and the dielectricity constant of the medium. Hence, the resulting SAR measurements do not represent the surface but the elevation of the mean phase center of the backscattered signal. Special adaptations on the <b>nominal</b> TanDEM-X DEM <b>generation</b> are conducted to maintain these characteristics and not to raise or even deform the DEM to surface reference data. For the block adjustment, only on the outer coastal regions ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) elevations as ground control points (GCPs) are used where mostly rock and surface scattering predominates. Comparisons with ICESat data and snow facies are performed. In the inner ice and snow pack, the final X-Band InSAR DEM of Greenland lies up to 10 m below the ICESat measurements. At the outer coastal regions it corresponds well with the GCPs. The resulting DEM is outstanding due to its resolution, accuracy and full coverage. It provides a high resolution dataset as basis for research on climate change in the arctic...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to assess whether the newer stent {{delivery}} systems provide a stented lumen cross-sectional area (CSA) that is equal to the delivery balloon <b>nominal</b> dimensions. BACKGROUNDFirst <b>generation</b> stents were often not adequately expanded with their delivery system and frequently required higher pressure or a larger balloon after deployment. Newer stents were designed to optimize expansion with noncompliant, high-pressure balloons provided as the delivery systems. METHODSIntravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was used to evaluate 38 stents in 32 patients after deployment at 14 to 16 atm with their delivery balloon system. Minimum stent lumen CSA and stent minimum lumen diameter (MLD) were measured by IVUS imaging. The manufacturer’s expected stent diameter was defined as the balloon diameter measured by the company at the maximum pressure used. The manufacturer’s expected stent area was calculated based on the manufacturer’s expected stent diameter. RESULTSThe MLD (2. 5 ± 0. 5 mm) and minimum stent CSA (6. 0 ± 1. 7 mm 2) by IVUS were significantly smaller than the manufacturer’s expected stent diameter (3. 5 ± 0. 4 mm) and area (9. 5 ± 1. 9 mm 2) (p < 0. 0001, respectively). The mean MLD by IVUS was 72 ± 8 % of the expected stent diameter, and the mean minimum stent CSA by IVUS was 62 ± 10 % of the expected stent area. CONCLUSIONSDespite moderately high-pressure inflations, the mean minimum stent CSA actually achieved was, on average, only 62 % of the manufacturer’s expected stent area. To optimize stent deployment, these IVUS observations should be considered during coronary artery stenting...|$|R
