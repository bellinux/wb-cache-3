5|$|Most of Kartodikromo's fictional works {{took place}} in Bandung or Surabaya. He was an early Indonesian example of the social realist movement. Like most {{nationalist}} writers at the time, Kartodikromo preferred writing in Malay (the predecessor of modern Indonesian) rather than his native Javanese; however, he did write several pieces in Javanese. While the state-owned publisher Balai Pustaka was attempting to standardise Malay, Kartodikromo experimented with the language, using words, phrases, and scenes which had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> used.|$|E

5|$|The European Cup final had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> {{played in}} Russia, making this match the easternmost final in the tournament's history; however, the Luzhniki Stadium had {{previously}} {{played host to}} the 1999 UEFA Cup Final, in which Italian club Parma beat French side Marseille 3–0. Because {{of the difference in}} time zones, the match kicked off at 22:45 Moscow Time, making it the first Champions League final to start on one day and finish in the next.|$|E
5|$|Dox wrote prolifically {{over the}} course of his career, {{yielding}} nine poem anthologies, numerous books in prose, and sixteen plays along Biblical themes or Malagasy history and folk tales. In addition, he wrote a number of plays on commission for various clients, with many commissioned by Boy Scout troupes, although these have since been lost. His translation from French to Malagasy of three major Western novels was significant because they enriched Malagasy literature by introducing elements of the novel form that had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> attempted in Malagasy language. These efforts demonstrated to other Malagasy language writers the versatility of the language and the possibility that it could be used for any literary form.|$|E
5|$|On Goodenough Island, between 8 and 14 March 1943, Australian patrols {{from the}} 47th Infantry Battalion found and killed 72 Japanese, {{captured}} 42 and found another nine dead on a raft. One patrol killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat-bottomed boats, in which were found some documents in sealed tins. On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, one document {{turned out to}} be a copy of the Japanese Army List, with the names and postings of every officer in the Japanese Army. It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army, including many units that had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> reported. A mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit. Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan.|$|E

5|$|His {{expedition}} completed after a {{total of}} 17 months, Beebe and Blair crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, then crossed the United States {{to return to their}} home in New York. Their expedition had obtained live or stuffed specimens of nearly all the pheasants he had sought, and also produced extensive notes about their behavior. Some of these pheasants, such as Sclater's impeyan or Himalayan monal, had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> seen in the wild by Americans or Europeans. Beebe's observations of sexual dimorphism in pheasants during this expedition led him to become the first biologist to correctly understand the mechanism by which this aspect of sexual selection operates. On the basis of his observations he also proposed a new evolutionary model of pheasant ancestry, involving a period of rapid diversification followed by more typical and gradual changes. Although this evolutionary model is now taken for granted, in William Beebe's time it was a novel idea.|$|E
5|$|Hodgson's {{departure}} from the club in 1989 marked {{the start of a}} 15-year period during which Malmö FF failed to win a league or cup title. Houghton initially returned in Hodgson's place, but the former manager's two-year sojourn back at the club proved largely unsuccessful. He was replaced by Dane Viggo Jensen in July 1992. Jensen returned to Denmark {{at the end of the}} 1993 season, and was succeeded by Rolf Zetterlund, who managed the club between 1994 and 1996. Zetterlund's time at the club was fairly successful as the club finished each of his years in charge in the top four league places. Dutchman Frans Thijssen took Zetterlund's place in January 1997, and stayed at the club until August 1998 when he was sacked following poor results in Allsvenskan and European competition. Roland Andersson then managed the club until it was relegated at the end of the 1999 season. As the club had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> relegated (having only previously been removed from the top division by a punitive demotion), Andersson was sacked. He was replaced by Michael Andersson (no relation), who guided the team to promotion back to Allsvenskan at the first attempt.|$|E
5|$|In 1820, Champollion {{embarked}} {{in earnest}} {{on the project}} of decipherment of hieroglyphic script, soon overshadowing the achievements of British polymath Thomas Young {{who had made the}} first advances in decipherment before 1819. In 1822, Champollion published his first breakthrough in the decipherment of the Rosetta hieroglyphs, showing that the Egyptian writing system was a combination of phonetic and ideographic signs – the first such script discovered. In 1824, he published a Précis in which he detailed a decipherment of the hieroglyphic script demonstrating the values of its phonetic and ideographic signs. In 1829 he traveled to Egypt where he was able to read many hieroglyphic texts that had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> studied, and brought home a large body of new drawings of hieroglyphic inscriptions. Home again he was given a professorship in egyptology, but only lectured a few times before his health, ruined by the hardships of the Egyptian journey, forced him to give up teaching. He died in Paris in 1832, 41 years old. His grammar of Ancient Egyptian was published posthumously.|$|E

25|$|Crane {{continued}} to produce valuable scientific {{work with the}} department and {{turned her attention to}} the study of copepods. In 1935, she was able to identify around 60 species of copepods, of which almost half had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> recorded in Bermuda. New data was recorded on color during life, swimming methods, breeding habits, growth stages, relative numbers of different species and sexes, diurnal migrations, effects of storms and currents and general viability.|$|E

25|$|This {{motion was}} later {{withdrawn}} due to McQueen's powers of persuasion. However, McQueen's problems were not over. Council moved {{to reduce his}} authority by insisting that he produce a Principal's report for each Council meeting.

This clash of personalities continued for another six years with the authority of the Principal being eaten away year by year.|$|E
25|$|The Russian {{government}} {{claimed that}} this exercise {{was a test}} of the U.S. missile defense program. The defense ministry of Russia accused the U.S. of using hydrazine as a cover for the test of an ASAT. It also noted that extraordinary measures had <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> needed to deal with the many spacecraft that had fallen to Earth. Indeed, the New York Times had paraphrased Gordon Johndroe, spokesman for the United States National Security Council, as stating that 328 objects had deorbited (controlled and uncontrolled) in the previous 5-year period.|$|E
25|$|The {{enhanced}} performance {{may arise from}} a decrease in solvent permeation across the sealant due to {{the application of the}} polymer gel electrolyte. The polymer gel electrolyte is quasi-solid at room temperature, and becomes a viscous liquid (viscosity: 4.34 mPa·s) at 80°C compared with the traditional liquid electrolyte (viscosity: 0.91 mPa·s). The much improved stabilities of the device under both thermal stress and soaking with light has <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>been</b> seen in DSCs, and they match the durability criteria applied to solar cells for outdoor use, which makes these devices viable for practical application.|$|E
