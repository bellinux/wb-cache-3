25|$|Mace {{attempts}} to manually lower the computer {{back into the}} freezing coolant, but when his leg catches on the descending computer he becomes trapped, and the computer disabled. As he freezes to death, he radios Capa to escape the airlock, decouple the bomb from the ship, and activate it as it plummets into the sun, delivering the payload to its destination. Capa blows the airlock, separates the bomb from the ship, which explodes, and enters the payload, where he finds Cassie. Pinbacker ambushes them, telling them God ordered him to send all humanity to Heaven. As they hurtle into the sun, Capa escapes Pinbacker, reaching the bomb controls. <b>Not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> will work under these extreme conditions, he watches as the bomb begins to successfully ignite {{at the edge of}} the sun itself.|$|E

Sheena, being a fan of screenwriter Satoshi Miki's works accepted the offer, and met with Miki to discuss the song.

5000|$|In contrast, Cinema Crazed gave a more {{favorable}} opinion and commented that the film would be polarizing, {{that it would be}} best appeal to a niche audience, and that it was an entertaining example of revenge exploitation cinema. Shock Till You Drop editor Chris Alexander wrote a mixed review, writing [...] "I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it’s</b> a good film but it’s tight, taut, never dull and offers some nice deviations from the usual revenge programmer, enough that I certainly can recommend it as a fine bit of filthy time-wasting." ...|$|R

500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm just <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> works. It's such a drastic change of scenery and tone it's {{hard to say}} whether this is genius or madness." [...] Isler observed {{that he would have}} [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup... But the approach we got feels an awful lot like a gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point." [...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long term collaborator Peter McConnell. McConnell composed pieces for orchestra and Metal band {{to tie in}} with the licensed music in the game. Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by Slough Feg drummer Harry Cantwell, all other [...] "real" [...] drums (6 tracks) were played by Y drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by Jory Prum. The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by Judas Priest guitarists Glenn Tipton (Eddie's solos) and K.K. Downing (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos). While Schafer {{would like to have}} a soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack. Schafer helped to select three songs—"We Are The Road Crew" [...] by Motörhead, [...] "The Metal" [...] by Tenacious D, and [...] "More Than Meets The Eye" [...] by Testament—to appear in a pack of Rock Band downloadable songs that was made available the same day as Brütal Legends release.|$|E

On 25 June, however, Kick the Machine released it in a month-long run, limited to one theater in Bangkok. It passed uncut by the Thai censorship board, despite featuring scenes similar to those cut from the director's past two feature films. Distribution rights for the United States were acquired by Strand Releasing and it was released on 2 March 2011. Cartoonist Chris Ware created the poster for the U.S. release.|$|R
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, Donna and Ringo's {{relationship}} {{goes through}} a rocky patch and during schoolies week, Donna sleeps with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock. Robbie said that Donna begins to [...] "freak out" [...] {{because she did not}} expect to see Andrew again and now he could tell everyone what happened between them. Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were starting to look up. If she comes clean, they might find a way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction. Robbie said that Donna is [...] "flattered" [...] by Andrew's interest in her and when Ringo puts his career before her, Andrew tells Donna what she wants to hear. On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I think at the moment it's quite in the balance. It's right up to the network at the moment as to whether they'll get back together or not." ...|$|E

[...] Despite this, the song has been performed on a majority of the Stones' tours since its introduction to their canon of work.|$|E
5000|$|In another interview, Ament stated:We {{knew it was}} a good song, but it {{was tough}} getting it to feel right—for the chorus to sit back and the outro to push over the top. The tune went from {{practically}} not making it on the record to being one of the best takes. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> the best song on the album but I think it's the best take. On [...] "Jeremy" [...] I always heard this other melody in the choruses and the end, and it never sounded good on guitar or bass. So we brought in a cello player which inspired a background vocal, and those things made the song really happen. Most of the time if something doesn't work right away, I just say fuck it—but this was an instance when perseverance paid off.|$|R

When he appears {{in the living room}} audience in Cahoot's Macbeth the reverse is true: he is the only character who speaks Dogg on a stage full of normal-English speakers, and once again completely baffles characters (as the homeowner puts it, [...] "At the moment we're <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> a language or a clinical condition") until several of them, most notably Cahoot, are revealed to also speak Dogg. However, while Cahoot and others can switch between Dogg and English at will, Easy speaks Dogg exclusively until the closing line of the play.|$|R

2500|$|Cyrus was in Ecbatana {{when the}} revolt had already begun. In Nicolaus's account, when Cyrus was let go, he fled from Astyages {{because he knew}} he might {{eventually}} be executed if Astyages discovered that Cyrus's true motive [...] was to join and fight alongside his father, if necessary. This is because when Cyrus was half way to becoming an adult he learned that Astyages had already tried to execute {{him when he was}} an infant, but it did not succeed, and as time passed, Astyages came to respect Cyrus for the similarities of character they shared. Meanwhile, Astyages was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was safe to let Cyrus return to his homeland. Astyages eventually did, and it helped terminate the Median kingdom. When Astyages was tricked by Harpagus twice into believing Cyrus was not a danger to him, even when the revolt and impending signs of danger had already happened, Cyrus saw how easily Astyages could be swindled. For this reason, Cyrus may have taken advantage of this to bring freedom to his own kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{arrived at}} the scene around 11:45p.m. After about ten minutes, a man walked up to Hollis' driver-side door and flashed a {{flashlight}} in his face, blinding him.

They both got out through the driver-side door. The man told Hollis to [...] "take off your [...] britches." [...] Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they would not be hurt, but, after Hollis removed his trousers, he was struck twice in the head with a heavy, blunt object.

At this point, its looking more like the record will come out a bit later than March, but I think folks can still expect to hear some new material in the coming weeks." [...] On February 9, 2011, Gaskarth posted a new song, titled [...] "Art of the State", on his Twitter. Gaskarth said that [...] "people are chomping at the bit for something new. ... I just tossed a little fuel on the flames." [...] Despite speculation {{that it would be}} the intro to the album, Gaskarth clarified that it was [...] "more of an ending to the story. We pulled a [...] Tarantino." [...] On February 14, while on tour, the band played a new song entitled [...] "Time-Bomb". On February 16, Gaskarth stated that the [...] "record's definitely not coming out in March" [...] due to the [...] "restructuring" [...] of Interscope Records and a number of records have been pushed back, Dirty Work being one of them. In a later interview, Gaskarth presumed [...] "a bunch of people got fired. We {{just wanted to make sure}} we didn't get caught up in that shit storm essentially, so we decided to hold off on putting the record out." [...] "Time-Bomb" [...] was made available for streaming on February 26. In March, the band went on a UK tour alongside Yellowcard and Young Guns. In mid-March, Barakat stated in an interview with AbsolutePunk that All Time Low will [...] "hopefully be releasing the track-listing shortly, maybe even clips of every song." [...] He went on to say that a single hadn't been picked, though mentioned that [...] "I Feel Like Dancin" [...] was [...] "in the running and will most likely be released as a single at some point, we're just <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> will be the first one." ...|$|E

40|$|Freud’s {{reported}} {{interest in}} the Lurianic Kabbalah is explored from both theoretical and psychotherapeutic points of view. The Lurianic symbols are understood both as important historical antecedents to psychoanalysis and as {{a significant source of}} both insight and inspiration for contemporary psychotherapists. David Bakan, in the paperback edition of his work, Sigmund Freud and The Jewish Mystical Tradition relates a story which, I believe, bears repeating. It’s a fascinating story. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> true, but even as an apocryphal tale it should command our attention. The story involves two rabbis by the name of Chayyim, two rabbis by the name of Bloch, Bakan, and Sigmund Freud. In his book, first published in the 1950 s, Bakan had argued that Freud had either consciously or unconsciously made use of Jewish mystical ideas in formulating psychoanalysis [1]. After the book’s publication Bakan received a letter from a Rabbi Chayyim Bloch, who had been an acquaintance of Freud some years back. Bloch had read Bakan's book and informed Bakan that he had some information that might be of interest to him. According to Bloch, many years earlier h...|$|R
5000|$|Bowie and Gabrels had {{previously}} written the song [...] "You've Been Around" [...] together {{when they were}} with Tin Machine, but the track never came out satisfactorily, so Bowie revived it when working on this album.

It's just drums and the voice comes in out of nowhere and you're <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> a melody line or a drone or whatever and there's a really ominous feel to it that I like a lot. But one of the most satisfying things about making that particular track was working with Reeves on it because I had the chance, because it was my album, not Tin Machine's, to mix Reeves way into the background, so I knew that that would doubtlessly really irritate him, which indeed it did." [...] Bowie also appreciated the sexuality of the song, saying [...] "It's the texture of a song, for me, that almost comes above the lyrical content.
