5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used cockades, or {{knots of}} colored ribbons {{pinned to the}} hat, to denote the {{nationality}} of their military. In Poland, until 1831, there was <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> {{as to what the}} colors of the national cockade should be. Polish soldiers wore white, white-and-red, blue-and-red or blue-white-red cockades.|$|E
5|$|Testing the {{validity}} of astrology can be difficult, because there is <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. Most professional astrologers are paid {{to predict the future}} or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.|$|E
5|$|Although Fuegians from Patagonia {{may have}} visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times, the islands were {{uninhabited}} {{at the time}} of their discovery by Europeans. Claims of discovery date back to the 16th century, but <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic. The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong, who, en route to Peru's and Chile's littoral in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.|$|E

5|$|Critics of the {{argument}} include Averroes, who objected to its methodology, Al-Ghazali, who disagreed with its characterization of God, and modern critics who state that its piecemeal derivation of God's attributes allows people to accept parts of {{the argument}} but still reject God's existence. There is <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> among modern scholars on the classification {{of the argument}}; some {{say that it is}} ontological while others say it is cosmological.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are {{relatively}} well-established; {{he was the}} son of Butvydas, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. <b>No</b> <b>consensus</b> exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give Traidenis as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson Boleslaw-Yuri would have violated canon law, since the two would have been related by blood, and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope.|$|E
5|$|In biology, borates {{have low}} {{toxicity}} in mammals (similar to table salt), but are more toxic to arthropods {{and are used}} as insecticides. Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although {{there is some evidence}} it supports bone health.|$|E

5|$|<b>No</b> <b>consensus</b> {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory {{suggests}} that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to brackish water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E

5|$|The term hippocampal {{formation}} {{is used to}} refer to the hippocampus proper and its related parts. However, there is <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> as to what parts are included. Sometimes the hippocampus is said to include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. Some references include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, and others also include the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> among {{philosophers}} {{about many}} of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science, including whether science can reveal the truth about unobservable things and whether scientific reasoning can be justified at all. In addition to these general questions about science as a whole, philosophers of science consider problems that apply to particular sciences (such as biology or physics). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on pacifism among modern Hindu scholars. The {{conflict}} between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and {{the theories of}} just war prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as being an allegory, wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.|$|E

5|$|<b>No</b> <b>consensus</b> existed {{regarding}} the taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The {{placement of the}} Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past. They were once {{considered part of the}} Psittacoidea, but recent 21st-century studies place this group of New Zealand species as their own superfamily next to the Cacatuoidea and remaining members of the Psittacoidea. Many studies have confirmed the unique placement of this group {{at the base of the}} parrot tree. Most authors now recognize this group as a separate taxon containing two families: Nestoridae and Strigopidae. Conversely, the relationships among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> {{could be}} reached, the {{committee}} {{decided to put}} these three definitions to a wider vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in Prague in August 2006, and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from {{two of the three}} proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between planet and rock (or, in the new parlance, small Solar System body), called dwarf planet and placed Pluto in it, along with Ceres and Eris. The vote was passed, with 424 astronomers taking part in the ballot.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher (Toxostoma curvirostre) is a {{medium-sized}} mimid {{that is a}} member of the genus Toxostoma, native to the southwestern United States and much of Mexico. Referred to as the default desert bird, it is a non-migratory species. Several subspecies have been classified since 1827, though there is <b>no</b> <b>consensus</b> on the number. Allopatric speciation is believed to have played a major role in the variations of the curve-billed. It shares striking similarities in appearance with another Toxostoma member, Bendire's thrasher. Nevertheless, it is recognized for its grey color and sickle-shaped bill. It generally resides in desert regions of the United States and Mexico, but can inhabit areas predominately populated by humans.|$|E
