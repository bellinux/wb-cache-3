5|$|Samuel {{knew that}} the Byzantine army would have to invade the country {{through a series of}} {{mountain}} passes, and so took precautions to bar them. The Bulgarians built ditches along the frontier and fortified many of the valleys and passes with walls and towers, especially the pass of Kleidion on the Struma River which Basil would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through to reach the heart of Bulgaria. Samuel heavily fortified the northern slopes of the Belasitsa mountain to the south and east of Strumitsa Castle. The wide valley of the Strumitsa River was a convenient place for attack and it had been used by Byzantine forces for this purpose in previous years. The Bulgarians disposed a strong guard to keep the pass safe. In addition, the Bulgarian ruler chose Strumitsa for his defensive base— it was located on the road from Thessaloniki leading to Thrace to the east and Ohrid to the west. The rugged terrain to the south was dotted with earthworks and walls guarded by strong Bulgarian units.|$|E
5|$|To {{avoid the}} need to {{purchase}} agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways, where construction could be carried out without charge. At {{the northern end of}} the railway, the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required {{to the west of the}} station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.|$|E

30|$|Regarding {{differences}} between groups of students {{we did not find}} any significant relationships between examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> and admission group, upper secondary/high school education, gender or age. However, the upper secondary/high school credit and the Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test point were both significantly related to the average examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> showing that an increase in upper secondary/high school grades/Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test points {{goes hand in hand with}} a decrease in examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass.</b> In other words, students with higher grades/points at admission do not as many examination attempts as students with lower grades/points. The magnitude of the correlations (rs = – 0.4) could be classified as moderate (Cohen [1992]). Regarding {{differences between}} courses we found a difference between courses in medical science compared to courses in nursing science. Medical courses demanded on average 0.4 more attempts <b>to</b> <b>pass.</b> As a comparison, the difference between non-completers and completers was 0.2 in overall average examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass.</b> Thus, the difference between medical and nursing science courses is twice as high.|$|R
25|$|Deutsche Bahn also {{considered}} a 24kilometre-long base tunnel for the {{crossing of the}} Thuringian Forest.

30|$|Data {{collection}} was {{done during the}} 2012 spring term from the Swedish higher education study administration system and from the admissions board. This system stores data on the individual student’s sex, age, qualifying upper secondary/high school education, examination attempts and examination results. Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test points were only available for students admitted based on said points with or without working experience. Likewise, the upper secondary/high school grades were only available for students in the upper secondary/high school admission group. Information {{about the number of}} examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a course was collected for each individual course. Moreover, the number of examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> was calculated for each individual student on an aggregated level. For each year, and for each student, the average number of examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> was calculated for the group of courses in nursing and medical science separately. For instance, if a student has a value of 1.2 for nursing courses in Year 2, that students had to make on average 1.2 attempts for the completed nursing courses in Year 2. For each student the average examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> per year and the overall average examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> including all courses passed, were also calculated. For instance, if a student has 1.5 in average overall examination attempts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> it means that the student had to make on average 1.5 attempts to complete the courses. Qualifying education information (grades/points) was obtained from the admissions board. Admission was granted based on either of the following criteria: upper secondary/high school grades; Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test points; Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test points with work experience; and folk high school credits (1 – 4). Admission distribution over these categories and descriptive statistics for grades and Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test points are given in Table 1.|$|R

25|$|The main A12 {{road from}} London to Great Yarmouth {{passes through the}} centre of Lowestoft, {{crossing}} the harbour in {{the centre of the}} town on the Bascule Bridge.

25|$|Until 2014, Terminal B {{was split}} into {{north and south}} {{building}}s, with a parking garage located between the two buildings. The gates of the south building (primarily occupied by American Airlines and housing an Admirals Club) are divided into three groups: B1–B3, B4–B14 and B15–B19. Gates B1–B3 are the exclusive use of Air Canada. There is a single security lane for these three gates resulting in short wait times. However, to reach other gates in Terminal B including connections to Air Canada's Star Alliance partner United, {{it is necessary to}} leave the secure area and re-enter. Post-security, there is only a grab-and-go restaurant and there is no lounge access. As passengers arriving from Canada are pre-cleared by US Customs and Border Protection, passengers do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through Terminal E's international arrival facility. Gates B4–14 and B15–B19 are connected by a walkway post-security. The gates of the north building (primarily occupied by American Airlines and United Airlines, both of which operate airline lounges in the terminal) are divided into two groups: B20–B36 and B37–B38. Gates B20–29 are used by United Airlines while gates B30–B36 serve American Airlines. Gates B37 and B38 are home to Spirit Airlines.|$|E

500|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Keadby, there are two more bridges. Vazon Swing Bridge is a conventional swing bridge, but the railway crosses to {{the south side of}} the canal on a sliding bridge. The bridge deck is only around [...] above the level of the water. When boats <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> the deck is winched sideways, and clears the waterway because it crosses it at an angle. The bridge was built in 1925-26 and rebuilt in 2004, and is controlled from a signal box nearby. Beyond the bridge, Keadby gas-fired power station is located on the north bank. The final bridge is Keadby Swing Bridge, situated at the head of Keadby Lock. The lock controls passage to the River Trent, which is tidal at this point, and it therefore has four sets of gates. The main structure of the lock dates from the opening of the canal, and is grade II listed. The gates and sills were replaced in 1932. There are wharves on the river for larger ships, and Keadby pumping station is situated just to the south. It was built in the 1930s, and pumps water from Hatfield Chase into the Trent. Since 1945 it has also dealt with water from the North and South Soak Drains. When the South Yorkshire Railway opened their line along the banks of the canal in 1859, it terminated beside the lock, but was diverted to the south to cross the Trent on Keadby Bridge in 1864.|$|E
