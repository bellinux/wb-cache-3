5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, {{she had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation.

Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, kept her {{in a state of}} constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E
