5000|$|Further, {{based upon}} recent {{indications}} from regulators in the U.S. and India, zero-rated and toll-free models {{would appear to}} avoid regulatory scrutiny where the system of subsidizing data is designed to limit actual or perceived discriminatory behavior vis-a-vis the application provider (e.g., a content provider paying for free data within their application) and/or the end-user (the individual using a subsidized application). An example of such design might {{be found in a}} circumstance where the telecom carrier provisioning the subsidized data is incapable of affirmatively knowing which applications it serves are at any given moment benefitting from a data subsidy or not (note - the data subsidy is apparent to the end-user and app provider, but not to the carrier until [...] "after the fact" [...] of such data so delivered to the application). In this sense, the carrier is [...] "blind" [...] as to any data subsidy characteristics at the time data is provisioned through the network and any carrier-induced favoritism is not feasible. Another feature of free data that appears to pass regulatory muster is [...] "after the fact" [...] reimbursement to the end-user for data consumed that may be thereafter freely utilized by the end-user for accessing any content on the Internet (not just the content of the subsidizing party). In this regard, subsidized data programs that reimburse to the end-user for data consumed plus provide an additive [...] "bonus" [...] amount of subsidized data to the end-user are considered to be even more favorable in terms of promoting the public good since end-users may be capable of aggregating significant amounts of free bandwidth (again, unrestricted in terms of how such bandwidth may be utilized by the end-user) which can in turn be used for engaging with larger numbers of online services (whether data subsidized in nature or not). Lastly, due to the competitive and open nature of the Internet, larger and more financially able online entities wishing to engage with end-users will, via free market forces, be naturally incentivized to continuously provide greater amounts of free data to those same end-users in exchange for these end-users' online engagement and patronage, resulting in a continuous, transparent, and upward spiral of subsidized data allotments to end-users which not only lowers the cost of online access to existing and new end-users, but enables these end-users to spend the free data so aggregated on accessing smaller and/or less financially able online services (e.g., start-ups) that are not capable of providing subsidized data as part of their application interaction. In summary, by fostering a transparent, competitive, and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>system</b> for distributing subsidized data, progressive government policy makers can ensure that end-users not only have more free data to access the Internet in a manner chosen solely by the end-user, but these end-users may also have greater overall amounts of monthly accumulated data at their disposal for accessing new and experimental services which otherwise might not be embraced by end-users due to existing and prohibitively high cost of bandwidth.|$|E

40|$|There {{is still}} {{disagreement}} among economists concerning how a country's international economic policies and its rate {{of economic growth}} interact, despite a number of multi-country case studies utilizing comparable analytical frameworks, numerous econometric studies using large cross-country data sets, and important theoretical advances in growth theory.

This capacity is limited and for many reasons inelastic, while demand is constantly rising, creating bottlenecks for air traffic. As the problem of congestion worsens, as are the inevitable service delays accompanied by losses for operators and the economy as a whole, regulators, airports management and other stakeholders have become increasingly concerned with the issue of how to fairly and efficiently distribute these scarce resources. In order to create and sustain an efficient and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>system</b> of slot rationing a few crucial questions must be answered. Should slots be allocated by monetary exchanges or be allotted freely? Who should be responsible for this allocation? Who should have the first claim for available slots? On the eve of reform of the European Union’s slot distribution system it is also vital to explore various alternatives based on experience gained under the current system and its shortcomings.

These initiatives fly {{in the face of}} the long-standing support of key players in the region such as Japan for the MFN-based <b>non-discriminatory</b> trading <b>system</b> and the commitment to non-discriminatory trade liberalisation and reform within APEC. As China establishes its role in the WTO, its interests are very much in an open global trading system. The paper argues that the core interests of East Asian economies remain in non-discriminatory global trading arrangements and prosecuting those interests within the Doha Round of trade negotiations. It suggests that a way forward in sorting out the trade-distorting and protectionist effects of FTAs would be for East Asian economies to take a lead in negotiations on strengthening the WTO rules on preferential trade arrangements. In terms of global economic welfare, the only good preferential arrangement is one that disappears in time. The paper makes specific recommendations for re-vamping the rules on preferential trade arrangements with that objective in mind. ...|$|R

The Codex has been in existence for 40 years, under the joint auspices of the FAO and WHO, and now counts 168 member states. It defines international food standards but has no power to ensure that they are followed. The (complex) work of the Codex Commission is of high importance because the World Trade Organization (WTO) has decided that all food importers have to justify any law which requires more rigorous rules for food safety and labelling than provided for under Codex. The Codex standards should thus be the basis for a clear and <b>non-discriminatory</b> trading <b>system.</b> But can we speak of equity when some countries are not even able to attend the meetings which draw up these rules? The new fund should help deal with that. It will be available to help 120 developing countries and countries in transition (the former member states of the Soviet Union) participate effectively in the Commission s essential work. One idea behind the fund is that countries will not have to seek private funding for their involvement, or at least accept such funding only under very strict conditions.

Nevertheless, we must not disregard that China, India or Russia have a large economic and human potential and they incisively entered the economic competition altogether. For the time being, these countries represent regional or zonal powers and they started to play a commanding role together {{with the beginning of}} the international economic life. Organizations such as WTO or the UN offer, {{there is no doubt about}} it, an important chance to increase the contribution of the multilateral commercial system to reduce poverty and accomplish the objectives of human development. On the other hand, the practice of interstate relations demands an increased attention to the development of international trade, because from a developing and stability factor it can become a cause of instability and thus a cause of economic stagnation. The increased and accentuated interdependence of countries grew the importance of their external trade, which practically became indispensable for the economic and social growth. Moreover, the increase of national incomes in external trade led to increased consumption and increased the demand for energy and raw materials. This fact led, on one hand, to the amplification of exports and on the other hand to the increase of GDP in the developed countries. Adopting an open, impartial, rule-based, predictable and <b>non-discriminatory</b> commercial <b>system</b> may create a global partnership for development and visibly improve the international economic environment that has been severely affected by the current economic crisis.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. The {{principle}} of quality {{education for all}} learners is embedded in all policy documentsand legislation and this emphasis on quality education for all suggests that schools have to meet the diverse needs of all learners. However, throughout South African schooling contexts, there are many learners who face barriers to learning and participation {{in view of the}} fact that schools are unable to respond to the diversity of needs in the learner population. The issue is not how the learners adjust to the learning environment but whether the learning environment is flexible enough to accommodate the diverse needs of all learners. The responsibility of achieving the goal of a <b>non-discriminatory</b> education <b>system</b> lies heavily on the shoulders of classroom teachers. The purpose of this study is to examine how teachers at a primary school experience diversity within the classroom. The research was undertaken in a historically Indian boys' only state primary school in KwaZulu-Natal, with a learner population of almost 95 % African, 4 % Indian and the other 1 % comprising White/Coloured learners. The focus of the study was the teachers. I sought to investigate how teachers construct and respond to diversity in their classes. Within the context of the post apartheid South Africa, the classroom has become a microcosm of the 'rainbow nation', with teachers having to deal with many differences at varying levels within the classroom. How teachers interpret and respond to differences is likely to be subjective. In light of the fact that teachers' interpretations are subjective, for the purpose of this study, symbolic interactionism was used as a theoretical framework. Qualitative research, methodology, which took the form of a case study was used. Teachers experiences were examined through semi-structured interviews, observations and document analysis. Throughout the study, there emerged the "them" and "us" syndrome in teachers. The study shows that while the teachers did not treat African learners unfairly, there are numerous exclusionary practices at the school. Very little attempt is made by the teachers to change their teaching behaviours in ways that make the curriculum responsive to their learners. In fact, very little was done to change the ethos of the school, and African learners where expected to 'fit in' and become part of the existing culture of the school. There emerges from the study, a definite need to train teachers to think and work within a new frame of reference, that is, a human rights framework which constantly interrogates unequal power relations and inequalities that schools perpetuate...|$|R
40|$|Problem {{area for}} {{discussion}} This thesis {{sets out to}} describe and deliberate {{on the concept of}} the professional identity of black teachers in South Africa. The historical and cultural context of South Africa stretching from apartheid rule to the first years of democratisation creates a frame around this study, within which I have investigated the life and work of this professional group who performs a very significant job {{in the process of developing}} a young democracy. Although this study does not claim statistical representativity, and in spite of the obvious lack of time, human and financial resources, it is my hope that the findings reveal certain tendencies that might have a broader applicability for the South African educational system and particularly for black teachers. The thesis presents South African history, describing the introduction of apartheid, its effect on society, teachers and school system, as well as the road to its downfall with democratic elections in 1994. This serves as a contextual frame for the thesis and is followed by an introduction to basic educational reform theory and a description of South Africa‟s contemporary educational policy. This serves as a macro perspective, creating a base on which issues with regard to black South African teachers‟ professional identity are described and debated in a micro perspective. Methodology By employing four broad research questions, I have aimed at discovering how black South African teachers‟ professional identity can be defined, and evaluated the conditions for the development of a new professional identity. The practical reality of South African schooling is investigated and looked at in relation to the vast amounts of new educational policy legislation that was introduced in the wake of the great reforms that took (and are taking) place post the democratic elections of 1994. This is done through a qualitative field study where I conducted semi-structured interviews with five black teachers at a primary school in an under resourced area in Cape Town. This data material is compared to a similar study by Harley et al. (2000), and by employing the concept of professional identity the two studies are analysed using the national policy act, Norms and Standards for Educators. The aim of this analysis is to assess to which degree the teachers that took part in the studies fulfil the roles and competencies sketched out in this document. In order to ensure some degree of methodological triangulation and to provide a complete discussion on these issues document analysis has also been employed. Data and sources The data and sources that are used in this study are, in addition to my own field data, an article by Harley et al. (2000) that accounts for the research they conducted in 2000. I have also employed document analysis using past and current policy legislation and other historically significant documents. In addition to this a great amount of scientific journals have been employed as means of data gathering, such as Journal of Education and Work (Carfax Publishing), Teachers and Teaching, (Elseiver Science Ltd.) and International Journal of Educational Development (Elsevier Science Ltd.). Many of these journals I have found using Internet sources such as ERIC (Education Resources Information Center, [URL] and Informaworld™ ([URL] In addition to these sources of information, I found information relevant to my study in the libraries of The University of Oslo, The University of The Western Cape and The University of Cape Town. Results and conclusions The process of creating a new, democratic and <b>non-discriminatory</b> educational <b>system</b> in South Africa, with its inherent challenges and obstacles posed enormous professional challenges for all teachers, but for black teachers in particular. The new educational legislation that was passed was complex and developed with such haste that teachers on the practice level were not included. The result was that the centralised policy directives that were passed down to the practical realm of schooling were articulated in a language unfamiliar to those who were to implement them. In addition, the new requirements that teachers were faced with were excessive, and demanded more than could be expected. In order for the South African teachers to conduct their work in accordance with the demands of the new curriculum, they would have to undergo a comprehensive professional transformation in a very limited space of time. The new educational policy was also based on the wrongful assumption that all South African educators were all at the same high level of professionalism and were more than capable of making curriculum decisions without relying on centralised dictates. The fieldwork conducted by Harley et al. (20009 and my own field data clearly show that these teachers do not match policy expectations. However, the teachers that were part of these two studies often displayed something over and above what was expected of them. This could be seen in the way teachers in my study would take on the unprescribed role of being parents for their learners and refer to them as “their children”. Harley et al. (2000) reported that the teachers that took part in their study displayed an idealism for their work, stating that they felt a vocational calling and thus a professional commitment that was not related to policy expectations. The educational legislation that was passed post 1994 was based on and articulated with idealism, noble intentions and with an underlying urgency to bring the country up to speed with the international community; intellectually and financially. It is clear, however, that idealism and aspirations for a prosperous, free and equal future for South Africa, could not make up for the lack of contextual analysis that was needed in order to formulate an adequate educational policy for the country. As a result of the country‟s history of separation and discrimination, its school reality is greatly contrasted and the distribution of resources uneven. The policy/practice disjunction in South African educational policy shows how misconceptions on the policy level inevitably leads to conflict on the practice level, and several areas of concern need attention in order for the scales to be balanced. An essential focal point in this thesis, is how the black teachers of South Africa can be empowered to redefine their identities in accordance with new demands. Including practitioners from the country‟s school reality in the development of new educational legislation, is most likely to add to a closing of the gap between policy and practice. This may result in a more adequate and constructive policy that does not require agents on the practice level engaging in time consuming policy interpretation prior to implementation. In addition, a more balanced resource allocation to under privileged schools and increased remuneration for teachers, will undoubtedly aid teachers, and especially black teachers, in the process of creating a new teacher identity. A more stable resource foundation for black teachers coupled with an indigenisation of the country‟s curriculum may increase their capacity to reflect on their professional identity. Including a greater focus on African ideas, values and knowledge systems, may capacitate the reshaping of black teachers‟ professional identities as it will bring them closer to their natural identities that were to a great extent distorted by the apartheid ideology...|$|R
