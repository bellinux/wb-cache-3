5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate <b>norms,</b> including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural <b>norms.</b> It is the remit of sociologists to study why these <b>norms</b> exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of <b>norms.</b> For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E

Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social <b>norms,</b> government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E

5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or <b>norms</b> (principles and rules).

40|$|AbstractWe {{compare the}} classes of {{behaviours}} (transition systems) {{which can be}} generated by <b>normed</b> BPA˙τ and <b>normed</b> BPP˙τ processes. We exactly classify the intersection of these two classes, i. e., the class of transition systems which can be equivalently (up to bisimilarity) described by the syntax of <b>normed</b> BPA˙τ and <b>normed</b> BPP˙τ processes. We provide such a characterization for classes of <b>normed</b> BPA and <b>normed</b> BPP processes as well. Next we show that it is decidable in polynomial time whether for a given <b>normed</b> BPA˙τ (or BPP˙τ) process Δ there is some <b>normed</b> BPP˙τ (or BPA˙τ) process Δ such that Δ is bisimilar to Δ. Moreover, {{if the answer is}} positive then the process Δ can be effectively constructed. Simplified versions of the algorithms mentioned above for <b>normed</b> BPA and <b>normed</b> BPP are given too. As an immediate (but important) consequence we also obtain decidability of bisimilarity in the union of <b>normed</b> BPA˙τ and <b>normed</b> BPP˙τ processes...|$|R

5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal <b>norms</b> {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender <b>norms</b> within a society.

Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.|$|E

Consequently, girls experience physical and sexual violence and are at risk of abduction. Girls' attempts to cope with the educational system may increase their risk of violence and sexual abuse.
