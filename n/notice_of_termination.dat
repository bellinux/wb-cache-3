25|$|The Copyright Act of 1976 {{contained}} a provision which {{allowed for a}} creator to terminate their grant of the copyright to their work 56 years after the date the copyright was first secured. The creator would then have a five-year window to do so. The creator, however, would have to serve a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> {{in advance of the}} effective date; between two and ten years in advance. Action Comics #1 was published on April 18, 1938. Consequently, Superman's copyright would become eligible for termination beginning April 18, 1994 and ending April 18, 1999, and the termination notices had to be served between April 18, 1984, and April 18, 1997. Likewise, Superboy's copyright became eligible for termination between December 2000 and December 2005, and the notices had to be served sometime between and December 1990 and December 2003.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Copyright Act of 1976 in its {{original}} form, only the spouse, children, or grandchildren of a dead author could terminate a grant of copyright. This had prevented Shuster's sister and nephew from terminating Shuster's grant of his half of the copyright to Superman in the years following his death. In 1998, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act modified the law to allow executors of estates to terminate. Under the original law, the window to serve the termination notice had ended in 1997, but the Sonny Bono Act also added a new subsection allowing the Shuster heirs to terminate 75 to 80 years after the copyright was first secured (with the usual two- to ten-year advance notice). The Shuster heirs could terminate their grant between 2013 and 2018, and the termination notice would have to be served between 2003 and 2016. On November 7, 2003, Peary served DC Comics with a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> of Shuster's grant of the rights to Superman. He assigned Shuster's half of the rights to Superman to Pacific Pictures.|$|E
500|$|Whilst {{the royal}} {{prerogative}} is deployed by the UK government when making (and unmaking) treaties, the Supreme Court held in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union {{that it does}} not give the government the power to serve <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> of the UK's membership of the EU (under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union), unless and until Parliament decides to do so. The Court's reasoning was that such a notice will inevitably affect rights under domestic law (many EU rights having direct effect in the UK), in which realm the royal prerogative has no application. [...] Nor was there scope for inferring that when enacting the European Communities Act 1972 Parliament had intended royal prerogative powers to survive for the purpose of serving such a notice. [...] Consequently, only Parliament can decide to serve such a notice.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the United States, despite its objections, was subject to the Court's jurisdiction. The Court had ruled on November 26 by 11 votes to one that it had jurisdiction in the case {{on the basis of}} either Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (i.e. compulsory jurisdiction) or the 1956 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Nicaragua. The Charter provides that, in case of doubt, it is for the Court itself to decide whether it has jurisdiction, and that each member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the Court. The Court also ruled by unanimity that the present case was admissible. The United States then announced that it had [...] "decided not to participate in further proceedings in this case." [...] About a year after the Court's jurisdictional decision, the United States took the further, radical step of withdrawing its consent to the Court's compulsory jurisdiction, ending its previous 40 year legal commitment to binding international adjudication. The Declaration of acceptance of the general compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice terminated after a 6-month <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> delivered by the Secretary of State to the United Nations on October 7, 1985.|$|E

50|$|There {{must be some}} act or some knowing {{omission}} on {{the part}} of the principal - if the agent alone acts to give the third party this false impression, then the principal is not bound. However, the principal will be bound if the agent so acts in the presence of the principal, and the principal stands silently and says nothing to dissuade the third party from believing that the agent has the authority to bind the principal. Apparent authority can also occur where a principal terminates the authority of an agent, but does not inform third parties <b>of</b> this <b>termination.</b> This is called lingering apparent authority. Business owners can avoid being liable by giving public <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> authority, and by contacting any individual third parties who would have had reason to know of such authority.|$|R
40|$|The 1976 Copyright Act’s {{provisions}} on <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> transfers give authors {{or their}} statutory successors {{a mechanism to}} recapture copyright rights that the author previously transferred to a third party. The statute and its implementing regulations outline a relatively complex set of formalities that must be complied with in order to effect a termination. In this article, I examine two different kinds <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> issues related to these formalities. The first issue concerns whether the statute and regulations give adequate notice to a potential terminating party regarding termination formalities. That is, how well do the statute and the regulations tell someone who might wish to terminate a grant precisely {{how to go about}} doing so? This is primarily an issue of statutory and regulatory clarity and workability. The current statutory termination provisions in some respects fail to provide clear and understandable notice to authors (and their statutory successors) of how to fulfill the formalities necessary to effect a <b>termination.</b> Some <b>of</b> this <b>notice</b> failure is due to poor statutory drafting that leaves those trying to use the provision uncertain of how it operates. Some of the failure arises because such a long time passes between the events that trigger termination’s availability and the start <b>of</b> the actual <b>termination</b> process. But the end result is that the statute’s complex formalities impose hurdles that can potentially stymie attempts to exercise the statute’s termination right. The second issue concerns how well the statutory scheme gives <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> a <b>termination</b> (and the consequent change of copyright ownership) both to those whose ownership of copyright rights is being terminated and to strangers to the terminated transaction who may wish to use the work involved. When a termination occurs and previously granted rights revert to the terminating party, how clearly does the termination system inform interested parties of the change of ownership? This issue primarily concerns whether the copyright system does a good job of putting grantees and their successors in title on <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> their ownership, and putting potential users of copyrighted works on <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> whom they should contact to get permission for their desired use...|$|R
