5|$|As long as {{maple syrup}} {{does not have}} an {{off-flavour}} and is of a uniform colour and clean and free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades.

5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable.

5|$|As of 2011, {{there were}} 335 mares and 51 stallions {{registered}} with the Irish registry, which included 59 new foals that year. Herd numbers have steadily increased since registrations began in 2005. These numbers make the Kerry Bog Pony third in population numbers among Irish breeds, behind the Connemara pony and the Irish Draught. Despite the increasing numbers, the breed is still considered to be critically endangered by the Equus Survival Trust. The horses are administered by the Kerry Bog Pony Co-Operative Society of Ireland (formerly the Kerry Bog Pony Society), {{which is based in}} Ireland with a branch in Great Britain. Inspections are required before ponies are allowed into the studbook. The book is divided into four classes: Class 1 ponies meet all requirements, Class 2 ponies do <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> the height requirement, Class 3 ponies do <b>not</b> <b>meet</b> the color requirements, and Class 4 ponies have yet to submit to an official inspection. The breed association has hosted an annual breed show and sale in Glenbeigh, County Kerry since 2007.|$|E

She felt it would be wrong, {{in the absence of}} such formal advice, for her as head of state <b>not</b> to <b>meet</b> the local member of parliament during her visit, and was photographed publicly shaking his hand. During her various visits to Northern Ireland, she in fact regularly met politicians of all hues, including David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party and John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.|$|R
