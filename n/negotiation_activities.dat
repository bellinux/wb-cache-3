Stanley was loaned out to the Cheshires commander, Lieutenant Colonel Bob Stewart, whose battalion was based in Vitez in central Bosnia. During this time the author witnessed the bloodshed between Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats whose common enemy was the Bosnian Serb faction. Stankovic became increasingly involved in looking after elderly people in the besieged city of Sarajevo, one on behalf of General Sir Mike Jackson. He was also involved in the supposed demilitarization of the Srebrenica pocket and early on identified the mortal danger the Muslim population were in. He was gagged and ordered to keep quiet about the precarious situation in Srebrenica. In the final five months of his first long tour in Bosnia Stanley set up and ran an operation in Sarajevo that monitored, accounted for and reported the distribution of humanitarian aid given to the Bosnian Serb part of Sarajevo. In this respect he reported directly to the Head of the UN Department in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. His time in Bosnia was characterised as a succession of high intensity mediation and <b>negotiation</b> <b>activities,</b> frequently conducted on the fly in dangerous and difficult circumstances.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} sparse {{study of how}} {{requirements}} analysis is performed in situ, i. e. by organizations building large, complex systems. We assert that {{a better understanding of}} in situ requirements practice is necessary to improve and ground current theories of requirements analysis. We performed an empirical field study to examine in detail the issues faced by practitioners in forming and stabilizing requirements and the procedures they created to overcome them. We found that the process of requirements determination was intimately related to project selection. We further observed that these two processes were based on the interplay of 1) applied technical, project, and organizational authority with 2) design, sensemaking, and <b>negotiation</b> <b>activity.</b> The ethnography produced an idealized, grounded authority-activity model of requirements analysis and project selection. The model is a generalized form of requirements analysis-project selection for large, complex, risk adverse (highly sensitive to failure) projects. It represents a method to balance the differentiated authority of the stakeholder groups with the activities necessary to form and stabilize technology-project candidates and their related requirements.

40|$|Negotiation {{has been}} studied in {{different}} communities both scientific and communities of practice. The social sciences and the mathematical sciences have investigated different aspects of negotiation with different goals: {{the goals of the}} social sciences are to understand the factors and reasoning processes that underlie human negotiation behavior. The goal of the mathematical sciences is to formulate mathematical models that capture elements of negotiation. Further, the mathematical models can be divided into analytic models (economic, operations research etc) and computational models. The aim of the analytic models is to provide guarantees of their behavior, characterizations of optimality, or provide managerial guidance to optimize <b>negotiation</b> <b>activity.</b> The computational models aim to provide computational tractability through approximation algorithms and heuristics. Most crucially, the computational research aims to have the models implemented in autonomous processes, called agents, that are able to incorporate realistic factors of negotiation (e. g. argumentation, information seeking, and cognitive factors) and engage in negotiations in a decentralized manner. Such agent models promise to contribute to our understanding of human information processing in negotiation. Additionally, they could be used for decision support of human decision makers. In the long run, such models can even become substitutes for human negotiators.
