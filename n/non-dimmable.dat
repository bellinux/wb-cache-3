40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-cost solution of converting the popularly adopted <b>non-dimmable</b> electronic ballast circuit for fluorescent lamps with self-oscillating series resonant inverter into a dimmable one. Dimming function {{is achieved by}} increasing the switching frequency of the inverter from the natural frequency of the resonant tank, so that less energy is coupled to the lamp. Control of the switching frequency is based on deriving an adjustable dc current source from the resonant inductor in the resonant tank to control the operating point of the saturable transformers for driving the switches in the inverter. The overall implementation does not require any integrated circuit. A 17 W prototype has been built and studied. Theoretical predictions have been verified with experimental results. The lamp can be dimmed down to 10 % of the full brightness. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of {{power factor correction}} for electronic ballasts in lighting applications usually is related with additional costs. Besides the requirements for power factor and total harmonic distortion in European standard IEC 1000 - 3 - 2 (class C) are defined only for lighting products above 25 W.

40|$|Opportunities {{exist to}} reduce {{artificial}} lighting in manufacturing facilities which have skylights and/or fenestration that provide sufficient quantities of daylight {{to the work}} space. Using photometric sensors to measure the illuminance in the space, artificial lights can be automatically switched off during periods when sufficient daylight is available. Daylighting controls used in commercial buildings often use dimmable ballasts with fluorescent lights. Most fluorescent lighting used in manufacturing facilities use high output ballasts which are <b>non-dimmable.</b> The preferred method for reducing artificial lighting output is to switch the lamps off. For multi-lamp fixtures such as six-lamp Super T 8 ?s, ballast/lamp configurations are either 2 - 4 or 3 - 3, thus giving rise to various stages of lighting reduction. This paper examines these lighting control strategies for a 90, 000 square foot manufacturing facility in Iowa. Using the EnergyPlus building energy simulation code, annual lighting energy savings associated with utilization of daylighting were computed for the building. Results showed that the 2 - 4 switching control strategy provided better energy reduction opportunity compared to 3 - 3 switching control...|$|E
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the potential for}} improved performance from office lighting through retrofit of electronic ballasts and digital controls several floors of a high-rise Government building built in the 1980 s were selected for a demonstration project. The retrofit project, funded by the US-AEP, {{was carried out in}} two stages. The first stage was a straightforward retrofit on two half-floors of <b>non-dimmable</b> electronic ballasts, replacement lamps, but retaining the basic luminaire. The second stage was a retrofit on one whole floor using dimmable 'digital' electronic ballasts linked to an integrated sensor incorporating constant illuminance, occupancy detection and hand-held remote control. The luminaire itself was modified and T 8 lamps installed. Meters were installed for the continuous monitoring of electricity use in the retrofitted floor and a 'control' floor. The meters measured the energy consumption, power factor, and harmonics content for the lighting circuits. Measurements of the lighting level were made before and after the retrofits. Occupants' opinion surveys were also carried out using questionnaires before and after the retrofit. This paper discusses the measured energy savings, a comparison of power quality and occupants' opinions of the retrofits. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

The main benefits of these products are: • Small Printed-Circuit Board (PCB) footprint, and compact solution • High efficiency (up to 93 %) • High input power factor (> 0. 95); low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD; 0. 7); low ripple (< 5 %); minimum external component count • Enhanced power capability • Low electronic Bill Of Material (BOM) The SSL 5015 TE operates in Boundary Conduction Mode (BCM) with peak current modulation, providing an input power factor correction. The IC is typically configured to a buck converter. It can start up directly from the HV pin using an internal high-voltage current source. When the converter is switching, VCC is supplied through the DVDT pin by a capacitor coupled to the DRAIN pin or by an auxiliary supply. This feature simplifies the VCC supply.

The development of fluorescent lamps is the major advancement in the field of small scale lighting. They have become very popular because of their efficiency and their ability to emit bright white light. Fluorescent lamps have less impact on human eyes compared to incandescent lamps. Recently, high intensity discharge lamps have been developed because of their ability to emit light at various colors. They have applications in overhead, computers and video projectors. The extensive use of arc discharge lamps in many lighting systems has led to the demand for dimmable electronic ballasts for energy saving and specific lighting needs. Today's electronic ballasts use various dimming control systems to achieve dimming to 5 % of full light. The most common dimming method is to shift the switching frequency of the inverter further away from the natural frequency of the output inverter tank. By doing this the energy transferred to the lamp is adjusted. This thesis presents a low-cost solution for modifying a <b>non-dimmable</b> self-oscillating electronic ballast into a dimmable one. A parallel resonant circuit is used instead of a series resonant circuit. The main idea of the technique used is to adjust the operating point of the saturable transformer in the self-oscillating circuit, such that the switching frequency is varied. The frequency modulation is achieved by introducing extra dc current to the nonlinear transformer which is fed back from the same resonant tank circuit. The amount of dc current fed back is controlled by adjusting the biasing condition of transistor operating in active region. The time for which the current is fed back is controlled by the multilevel switching technique...|$|E
40|$|Modern office {{buildings}} are often equipped with automatic systems that {{turn on the}} lights if somebody enters a room and turn them off when everybody has left the room. This ensures that users do not leave the lights on during the night and thus avoids wasting energy. For cost reasons, most of these installations do not include any manual user control any more, thereby exposing the user to an autonomously operating, automated lighting system. This can be quite annoying, not only because it does not allow a user to express any preferences, but also because energy is wasted in a forced manner, especially to energy-concerned users who would e. g. like to turn off the lights when the office is illuminated by bright daylight. In this technical note, we investigate the effect of giving back control of the lighting system to the users, focusing on the energy consumption. This was done in 16 offices in HTC 34. In some of these offices the lights were replaced with ones that are dimmed automatically under day lighting conditions. After having used the system for one year, it indeed showed that users deliberately contribute significantly to energy efficient lighting: the savings in energy consumption compared to the original fully automatic system was over 30 % for the standard <b>non-dimmable</b> lighting and over 50 % for the dimmable lighting. We propose to install a manual override switch in those rooms that receive enough natural light and that currently have a fully presence-based automatic system installed. The estimated payback period is about four years. It is not necessary to replace the lights themselves: although the use of dimmable lights has shown even greater savings, it has a much longer payback time because of the high installation costs. Apart from a financial incentive, installing these switches is beneficial for the “green” image of the campus and empowers people to contribute to this...|$|E
