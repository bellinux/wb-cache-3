5|$|While sharing broadly the blended {{wing-body}} {{design of}} the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version {{by the addition of}} canards, which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft, the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing leading-edge extension, redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate buffeting at high angles of attack and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-g manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 g on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement. More importantly, when working with the relaxed-stability design and the accompanying fly-by-wire flight-control system, the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target. Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller vertical tails, provisions for in-flight refuelling and the use of two-wheel <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> to support the heavier airframe.|$|E
25|$|The {{front wing}} was {{moderately}} tapered {{with a straight}} leading edge, while the rear wing was in three parts: an unswept centre section, clearing the propeller and supporting the main undercarriage legs, and outer sections from about ¼ span swept back at approximately 30°, supporting large end-plate fins at the tips. The box-like fuselage connected all the components and carried the engine, fuel and cockpit {{as well as the}} <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage.</b>|$|E
500|$|A small {{memorial}} {{to the loss of}} the Amana, its passengers and crew, has been created in the aeronautical museum in the town of Beverley, [...] south-east of the crash site. The memorial includes the <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> from the Amana. A memorial plaque was erected in the main street of Beverley on 26 June 2001, the fifty-first anniversary of the crash.|$|E
5000|$|The bicycle {{main and}} <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriages</b> were housed entirely within the {{fuselage}} with wing mounted outriggers in small pods at the wingtips. To increase {{the angle of}} incidence of the aircraft, to 20-22°, for take-off and landing, the twin wheeled levered suspension main undercarriage could be shortened or [...] "knelt".|$|R
50|$|The {{main and}} <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriages</b> {{retracted}} aft into the fuselage, {{with the main}} undercarriage able to kneel for takeoff making takeoff possible on shorter runways. The twin-wheeled nose and main gears had levered suspension and different tracks to improve rough-field performance. The kneeling undercarriage was initiated {{at the start of}} the takeoff run and gradually bled oil out of the Oleo-pneumatic strut until the required incidence of three degrees was reached just before liftoff. After takeoff the undercarriage was selected to retract which reversed the oil flow as the undercarriage retracted. All undercarriages were enclosed with fairings and doors when retracted. The bicycle undercarriage arrangement was tested on the Alekseyev I-215D.|$|R
50|$|Up to 6,000 kg (13,320 lb) {{of bombs}} {{were to be}} carried {{internally}} in the fuselage bomb bay between the <b>nose</b> and main <b>undercarriages.</b>|$|R
500|$|The A330 is a medium-size, {{wide-body}} airliner, {{with two}} engines suspended on pylons under the wings. A two-wheel <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> and two four-wheel bogie main legs built by Messier-Dowty support the airplane on the ground. Its maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) grew from [...] at introduction to [...] in 2015, enhancing its payload-range performance, with a [...] heavier Maximum Ramp Weight (MRW).|$|E
500|$|The A330-200F is an all-cargo {{derivative}} of the A330-200 {{capable of carrying}} [...] over [...] or [...] up to [...] To overcome the standard A330's nose-down body angle on the ground, the A330F uses a revised <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> layout to provide a level deck during cargo loading. The normal A330-200 undercarriage is used, but its attachment points are lower in the fuselage, thus requiring a distinctive blister fairing on the nose to accommodate the retracted nose gear. Power is provided by two Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines. General Electric does not plan to offer an engine for the A330-200F.|$|E
500|$|Su-27M/Su-35: Single-seat fighter {{design with}} a factory code of T-10M (Modernizerovany, [...] "Upgraded"). The first two prototypes {{had a new}} forward fuselage, canards and updated {{fly-by-wire}} flight-control systems. Like three of KNAAPO's nine flying pre-production aircraft (T10M-5, T10M-6 and T10M-7), they were converted from Su-27 airframes. The third aircraft (T10M-3) {{was the first of}} seven pre-production aircraft to have the taller vertical tails, two-wheel <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> and in-flight refuel capability. The Su-27M was powered by AL-31FM turbofan engines. Two prototypes, nine pre-production and three production aircraft were constructed by 1995; two static-test aircraft was also constructed (T10M-0 and T10M-4). The aircraft did not enter mass production.|$|E
50|$|Another {{non-operational}} {{example was}} written off with fuselage damage in August 1962 at Vnukovo Airport after the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>nose</b> gear collapsed during servicing. Tail number CCCP-76479 {{was one of}} only three long range D models manufactured.|$|R
5|$|In June 2010 diving {{operations}} {{were carried out}} and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward <b>nose</b> glazing, <b>undercarriage</b> doors and engine cowling were missing, but {{the discovery of a}} small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site. Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|R
50|$|The Caproni Ca.132 was a {{prototype}} {{for a large}} aircraft built in Italy in 1934, intended for use as either a bomber or airliner. It was a conventional low-wing cantilever monoplane, powered by a radial engine on each wing and in the <b>nose.</b> The main <b>undercarriage</b> was housed within large streamlined spats. Configured as an airliner, it would have seated 20 passengers.|$|R
500|$|The second prototype, VX777, flew in September 1953. More {{representative}} of production aircraft, it was lengthened {{to accommodate a}} longer <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> leg, featured a visual bomb-aiming blister under the cabin and was fitted with Bristol Olympus 100 engines of [...] thrust. At Falk's suggestion, a fighter-style control stick replaced the control wheel. Both prototypes had almost pure delta wings with straight leading edges. During trials in July 1954, VX777 was substantially damaged in a heavy landing at Farnborough. It was repaired and fitted with Olympus 101 engines of [...] thrust before resuming trials in October 1955. While exploring the high speed and high altitude flight envelope, mild buffeting and other undesirable flight characteristics were experienced while approaching the speed of sound, including an alarming tendency to enter an uncontrollable dive, unacceptable to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Boscombe Down. The solution included the [...] "phase 2" [...] wing, featuring a kinked and drooped leading edge and vortex generators on the upper surface, first tested on 707A WD480. An auto-mach trimmer introduced a nose-up attitude when at high speeds; the control column had to be pushed rather than pulled to maintain level flight.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of the way}} Concorde's delta-wing {{generated}} lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually {{strong and}} tall {{to allow for the}} angle of attack at low speed. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 knots indicated airspeed), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage {{in a way that was}} initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign. Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes. The main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to contract in length telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed. The four main wheel tyres on each bogie unit are inflated to [...] The twin-wheel <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of , and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water being thrown up into the engine intakes. The tyres are rated to a maximum speed on the runway of [...] The starboard nose wheel carries a single disc brake to halt wheel rotation during retraction of the undercarriage. The port nose wheel carries speed generators for the anti-skid braking system which prevents brake activation until nose and main wheels rotate at the same rate.|$|E

50|$|The Romanian Naval Forces ordered three IAR 330 Puma Naval helicopters, {{with the}} last one being {{commissioned}} in December 2008. The helicopters are in a similar configuration {{to those of the}} Romanian Air Force, including the SOCAT upgrade package; the Navy Pumas also have flotation gear fitted under the <b>nose</b> and main <b>undercarriage</b> fairings.

5000|$|The SABCA S.40 was a {{military}} trainer aircraft built in Belgium in 1939. It was a graceful, low-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional design with fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The pilot and instructor sat in tandem cockpits, enclosed by sliding canopies. [...] A single engine driving a two-blade propeller was mounted in the <b>nose.</b> The main <b>undercarriage</b> units were fully independent, mounted under the wings, and enclosed in spats. A small number were built for the Belgian military before the German invasion in 1940.|$|R
2500|$|From the outset, the D.H.121 {{was planned}} to employ {{avionics}} which were very advanced for the period. Among other capabilities, they would offer automatic {{approach and landing}} {{within a few years}} of service entry. The avionics were also to have triplicated components for reliability and to allow [...] "majority 2:1 voting" [...] for aircraft guidance during automatic approach and landing. The physical dimensions of most avionics of the period required them to be housed in a large compartment beneath the Trident's flightdeck; the compartment's size was among the factors dictating a distinctive <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> design: offset by [...] to the port side and retracting sideways to stow across the D.H.121's longitudinal axis.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the {{aircraft}} was almost entirely of wood or plywood with fabric covering, steel detail fittings and struts. The wings were three bay strutted and wire-braced assemblies supporting the engine nacelles, at around mid gap and the single axle main undercarriage units. Despite the wide variations between all the Staaken R-series variants in their engine configurations, the identical 42.2 meter wingspan figures for {{nearly all of them}} indicate that nearly identical wing layouts were likely shared by almost all the Zeppelin-Staaken R-series designs built. The square-section fuselage, with curved decking forward of the wings, supported the tail unit and nose twin wheel single axle <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> and housed the majority of the crew, defensive armament positions, cockpit, cabin, and bomb load. [...] The later versions, especially the [...] "production" [...] R.VI version, used pre-printed lozenge camouflage on their fabric covering in the attempt to [...] "conceal" [...] them on their nighttime operations over the U.K.|$|E
2500|$|The Crusader {{was not an}} easy {{aircraft}} to fly, and was often unforgiving in carrier landings, where it suffered from poor recovery from high sink rates, and the poorly designed, castoring <b>nose</b> <b>undercarriage</b> made it hard to steer on the deck. Safe landings required the carriers to steam at full speed to lower the relative landing speed for Crusader pilots. The stacks of the oil-burning carriers on which the Crusader served belched thick black smoke, sometimes obscuring the flight deck, forcing the Crusader's pilot to rely on the landing signal officer's radioed instructions. [...] It earned a reputation as an [...] "ensign eliminator" [...] during its early service introduction. The nozzle and air intake were so low when the aircraft was on the ground or the flight deck that the crews called the aircraft [...] "the Gator". Not surprisingly, the Crusader's mishap rate was relatively high compared to its contemporaries, the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and the F-4 Phantom II. However, the aircraft did possess some amazing capabilities, as proved when several Crusader pilots took off with the wings folded. One of these episodes took place on 23 August 1960; a Crusader with the wings folded took off from Napoli Capodichino in full afterburner, climbed to [...] and then returned to land successfully. The pilot, absentminded but evidently a good [...] "stick man," [...] complained that the control forces were higher than normal. The Crusader was capable of flying in this state, though the pilot would be required to reduce aircraft weight by ejecting stores and fuel before landing. In all, 1,261 Crusaders were built. By the time it was withdrawn from the fleet, 1,106 had been involved in mishaps. Only a handful of them were lost to enemy fire in Vietnam.|$|E

50|$|Owing to {{manufacturing}} difficulties envisaged {{with other}} all-new jet fighter developments, Focke-Wulf's second design {{was nothing more}} than a development of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, but powered with a jet engine, positioned on a redesigned fuselage. This engine, a Jumo 004, was to be housed beneath the <b>nose.</b> A conventional <b>undercarriage</b> was used. The low position of the jet intake raised the likelihood of foreign matter being sucked up, and in any case, the engine would burn the runway. This design development ceased in March 1943.|$|R

5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional <b>nose</b> wheel-led <b>undercarriage.</b> The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|R
50|$|On 21 August 1963 a Soviet twinjet Tu-124 {{airliner}} {{performed an}} emergency water landing on Neva near the Finland Railway Bridge.

After liftoff, the crew noticed that the <b>nose</b> gear <b>undercarriage</b> did not retract, and the ground control diverted the flight to Leningrad (LED) - because of fog at Tallinn. While circling above St. Petersburg at the altitude of at 1650 ft, under unclear circumstances (lack of fuel {{was one of the}} factors), both engines stalled. The crew performed emergency landing on the Neva River barely missing some of its bridges and an 1898-built steam tugboat. The tugboat rushed to the plane and towed it to the shore. No casualties were sustained at any stage. The plane captain was first fired from job but then restored and awarded with the Order of the Red Star.|$|R

5000|$|Bolkhovitinov {{became the}} head of the VVIA design group at the VVA Žukovskij ( [...] - VVS academy Žukovskij [...] ) tasked with the design of a {{replacement}} for the Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber. The resulting DB-A was advanced for its day, with stressed skin aluminium alloy construction throughout with clean lines, neatly cowled engines and trousered main undercarriage legs, with fully retracting main-wheels and tail-wheel. The split flaps, <b>undercarriage,</b> <b>nose</b> turret and bomb-bay doors were all operated by a pneumatic system recharged by engine-driven compressors. Flight trials began on 2 May 1935 at Khodinka piloted by N.G. Kastanyev and Ya.N. Moseyev, factory tests were completed by April [...] and NII testing was carried out in May and June 1935.

50|$|On 26 August 1940, 5K+AR {{was taking}} part in a raid by KG 2 and KG 3, {{targeting}} the RAF stations RAF Debden and RAF Hornchurch. While flying over clouds, the aircraft became separated from the bomber formation and lost its bearings; it was then attacked by Boulton Paul Defiant fighters of No. 264 Squadron RAF. One of the Dornier's engines was disabled and the other damaged, so the wounded pilot, Feldwebel (Flight Sergeant) Willi Effmert, elected to make a crash landing on the Goodwin Sands. He and another crew member survived and were taken prisoner. The other two crew were killed; one is buried at Cannock Chase German war cemetery and the other in the Netherlands. The identity of the Defiant that shot down the Dornier is not certain - it may have been one of three 264 Squadron aircraft that was shot down soon after in a battle with Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter escorts from Jagdgeschwader 3. In June 2010 diving operations were carried out and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward <b>nose</b> glazing, <b>undercarriage</b> doors and engine cowling were missing, but the discovery of a small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site.

50|$|In 1928, Stampe et Vertongen {{contracted}} Alfred Renard {{to design}} an aircraft {{with which the}} firm could compete in the emerging touring aircraft market, which in Belgium was dominated by British types. His response was a conventional, single-bay biplane with staggered wings of equal span. The pilot and passenger sat in tandem open cockpits and power was provided by a radial engine in the <b>nose.</b> The fixed <b>undercarriage</b> consisted of main units braced to one another, and a skid to support the tail. At the time, Stampe et Vertongen designated their aircraft with two numbers: the wing area (measured in square metres) and the engine power (measured in horsepower). Renard's new design had a wing area of 26 m² and was to be powered by a Renard engine of 100 hp and was therefore designated RSV.26/100. Two years previously, the firm had introduced a training biplane for the Belgian Air Force that also had a wing area of 26 m²; powered by a 140-hp engine, it had been designated the RSV.26/140. The similar designations caused confusion in the aviation press, but Renard insisted that the RSV.26/140 and RSV.26/100 were two distinct aircraft.|$|R
