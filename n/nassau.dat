5|$|The newspaper's first {{building}} was located at 113 <b>Nassau</b> Street in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 <b>Nassau</b> Street, and in 1858 to 41 Park Row, {{making it the}} first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to rising}} light {{pollution}} in Cleveland, a new station in Geauga County's Montville Township {{was established in}} 1950s. Named after Jason John <b>Nassau,</b> the station initially housed the Burrell telescope, which was later moved to Kitt Peak National Observatory. Instead of Burrell the station was equipped with the 36-inch robotic telescope. In 2008 <b>Nassau</b> Station was sold to the Geauga Park District and subsequently incorporated into its Observatory Park.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a North Shore Towers {{resident}} {{noticed a}} zip code error when making an online purchase. After further investigation in 2001, {{it was determined}} that the North Shore Towers was one of four zip codes that were mistakenly charged a <b>Nassau</b> County sales tax of 8.5% instead of the New York City sales tax of 8.25% because the zip codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not <b>Nassau</b> County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E

5|$|In the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, 22people were killed. The {{hurricane}} demolished {{three-quarters of}} the structures on Grand Turk Island, while the remaining intact buildings were damaged. The cyclone also produced heavy damage on Long Island, though damages were not reported in <b>Nassau.</b> Peak gusts were estimated near 40mph (65km/h) in <b>Nassau.</b> After the storm, The Daily Gleaner initiated a fund to offer aid for residents in the Turks and Caicos Islands.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nassau</b> {{took part}} in the {{inconclusive}} Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916, in the II Division of the IBattle Squadron. For the majority of the battle, the IBattle Squadron formed the center of the line of battle, behind Rear Admiral Behncke's IIIBattle Squadron, and followed by Rear Admiral Mauve's elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the IIBattle Squadron. <b>Nassau</b> was the third ship in the group of four, behind Rheinland and ahead of Westfalen; Posen was the squadron's flagship. When the German fleet reorganized into a nighttime cruising formation, the order of the ships was inadvertently reversed, and so <b>Nassau</b> was the second ship in the line, astern of Westfalen.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, at dawn, the Dutch force {{crossed the}} Lippe across a pontoon bridge. Maurice awaited them with 5,000 {{infantry}} {{and the rest}} of his cavalry arranged for the battle in the hills near Wesel, along the opposite riverbank. Philip of <b>Nassau</b> divided his troops into four squadrons: the first one of 125 men under the drossaard of Sallandt, the second one of 125 men under the Count of Kinsky, the third one, those in which <b>Nassau</b> and his brothers marched, of 150 soldiers under Lieutenant Balen, and the last, closing the way, of 120 men under the English captain Nicholas Parker. Having arrived at Krudenburg, <b>Nassau</b> sent 40 chosen men from the companies led by Balen to surprise the foraging horses. On finding a force much larger than they expected, the Dutch officers thought that something was wrong and sent a report back to Philip of <b>Nassau.</b> The Dutch commander, nevertheless, believed that it was only the convoy's escort and moved on with his troops and his entourage to attack the Spanish cavalry, aiming to prevent its escape.|$|E

5|$|The Helgoland {{class was}} {{the second type of}} German dreadnoughts, built during 1908–1912. The class was {{composed}} of four ships: Helgoland, Oldenburg, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen. The ships incorporated significant improvements over the previous <b>Nassau</b> type, including more powerful main guns and an improved propulsion system. The Helgolands were easily distinguished from the preceding Nassaus by the three funnels that were closely arranged, compared to the two larger funnels of the previous class. The ships retained the unusual hexagonal main battery layout of the <b>Nassau</b> class.|$|E
5|$|While in <b>Nassau,</b> {{during the}} final {{shooting}} days, special-effects supervisor John Stears was supplied experimental rocket fuel to use in exploding Largo's yacht. Ignoring the true power of the volatile liquid, Stears doused the entire yacht with it, took cover, and then detonated the boat.

5|$|After World War I, {{the bulk}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. As they were the oldest German dreadnoughts, the Nassau-class ships were for the time {{permitted}} to remain in German ports. After the German fleet was scuttled, <b>Nassau</b> and her three sisters were surrendered to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for the sunken ships. <b>Nassau</b> was ceded to Japan in April 1920. With no use for the ship, Japan sold her to a British wrecking firm which then scrapped her in Dordrecht, Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|After {{affecting}} the Turks and Caicos Islands, the hurricane {{passed through the}} Bahamas. The eye crossed over <b>Nassau,</b> where a barometric pressure of 938mbar (27.70inHg) was reported. Based on this observation, the hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). The hurricane struck without warning in the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in <b>Nassau.</b> In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs. Every building in <b>Nassau</b> was damaged or destroyed. After moving through the islands, the hurricane curved northeastward, affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four. On October4, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force11 winds on the Beaufort scale. The hurricane was last observed on October5 to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. Along its path through the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and the western Atlantic, the hurricane killed at least 383people, making it among the 100 deadliest Atlantic hurricanes as of 1997.|$|E
5|$|Another sortie {{into the}} North Sea {{followed}} on 19–20 October. On 21 December, <b>Nassau</b> ran aground {{in the mouth}} of the Elbe. She was able to free herself, and repairs were effected in Hamburg at the Reihersteig Dockyard until 1 February 1917. The ship was part of the force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage and had to be towed back to port. <b>Nassau,</b> Ostfriesland, and Thüringen were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlußstein, a planned occupation of Saint Petersburg. On 8 August, <b>Nassau</b> took on 250 soldiers in Wilhelmshaven and then departed for the Baltic. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August, and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.|$|E
