40|$|We propose an {{efficient}} method to produce multi-particle entangled states of ions in an ion trap {{for which a}} wide range of interesting effects and applications have been suggested. Our preparation scheme exploits the collective vibrational motion of the ions, but it works {{in such a way that}} this motion need not be fully controlled in the experiment. The ions may, e. g., be in thermal motion and exchange mechanical energy with a surrounding heat bath without detrimental effects on the internal state preparation. Our scheme does not require access to the individual ions in the trap. Comment: 4 pages, including 3 figures. To appear in Phys. Rev. Lett.

Our host in Cawnpore had a fine collection of birds--the finest we saw in a private house in India. And in Colombo, Dr. Murray's great compound and commodious bungalow were well populated with domesticated company from the woods: frisky little squirrels; a Ceylon mina walking sociably about the house; a small green parrot that whistled a single urgent note of call without motion of its beak; also chuckled; a monkey in a cage on the back veranda, and some more out in the trees; also a number of beautiful macaws in the trees; and various and sundry birds and animals of breeds not known to me.

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, {{scientists}} {{have been trying to}} replace the regulatory in vivo Draize eye test by in vitro methods, but so far only partial replacement has been achieved. In order to better understand the reasons for this, historical in vivo rabbit data were analysed in detail and resampled with the purpose of (1) revealing which of the in vivo endpoints are most important in driving United Nations Globally Harmonized System/European Union Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging (UN GHS/EU CLP) classification for serious eye damage/eye irritation and (2) evaluating the method’s within-test variability for proposing acceptable and justifiable target values of sensitivity and specificity for alternative methods and their combinations in testing strategies. Among the <b>Cat</b> 1 chemicals evaluated, 36 – 65 % (depending on the database) were classified based only on persistence of effects, with the remaining being classified mostly based on severe corneal effects. Iritis was found to rarely drive the classification (< 4 % of both <b>Cat</b> 1 and <b>Cat</b> 2 chemicals). The two most important endpoints driving <b>Cat</b> 2 classification are conjunctiva redness (75 – 81 %) and corneal opacity (54 – 75 %). The resampling analyses demonstrated an overall probability of at least 11 % that chemicals classified as <b>Cat</b> 1 by the Draize eye test could be equally identified as <b>Cat</b> 2 and of about 12 % for <b>Cat</b> 2 chemicals to be equally identified as <b>No</b> <b>Cat.</b> On the other hand, the over-classification error for <b>No</b> <b>Cat</b> and <b>Cat</b> 2 was negligible (< 1 %), which strongly suggests a high over-predictive power of the Draize eye test. Moreover, our analyses of the classification drivers suggest a critical revision of the UN GHS/EU CLP decision criteria for the classification of chemicals based on Draize eye test data, in particular <b>Cat</b> 1 based only on persistence of conjunctiva effects or corneal opacity scores of 4. In order to successfully replace the regulatory in vivo Draize eye test, it will be important to recognise these uncertainties and to have in vitro tools to address the most important in vivo endpoints identified in this paper.

We employed bioinformatics techniques to identify four members of the C. neoformans catalase gene family and created mutants lacking single or multiple catalase genes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, <b>CAT</b> 1 and <b>CAT</b> 3 encode putative spore-specific catalases, <b>CAT</b> 2 encodes a putative peroxisomal catalase, and <b>CAT</b> 4 encodes a putative cytosolic catalase. Only <b>Cat</b> 1 exhibited detectable biochemical activity in vitro, and <b>Cat</b> 1 activity was constitutive in the yeast form of this organism. Although they were predicted to be important in spores, neither <b>CAT</b> 1 nor <b>CAT</b> 3 was essential for mating or spore viability. Consistent with previous studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the single (<b>cat</b> 1, <b>cat</b> 2, <b>cat</b> 3, and <b>cat</b> 4) and quadruple (<b>cat</b> 1 <b>cat</b> 2 <b>cat</b> 3 <b>cat</b> 4) catalase mutant strains exhibited no oxidative-stress phenotypes under conditions in which either exogenous or endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species were elevated.

60|$|M. Poupart {{then comes}} to the {{adventure}} at St. Maur. The percipient, M. de S., {{was a man of}} twenty-five: his mother {{seems to have been a}} visionary, and his constitution is described as 'melancholic'. He was living alone, however, and his mother has no part in the business. The trouble began with loud knocks at his door, and the servant, when she went to open it, found nobody there. The curtains of his bed were drawn, when he was alone in the room, and here, of course, we have only his evidence. One evening about eleven, he and his servants heard the papers on a table being turned over, and, though they suspected the <b>cat,</b> <b>no</b> <b>cat</b> could be found. When S. went to bed, the same noise persisted in his sitting-room, where the <b>cat,</b> <b>no</b> doubt, could easily conceal herself, for it is not easy to find a <b>cat</b> who has motives for not being found. S. again hunted for the animal, but only heard a great rap on the wall. No sooner had S. gone back to bed, than the bed gave a violent leap, and dashed itself against the wall: the jump covered four feet. He called his servants, who replaced the bed, but the curtains, in their sight, were drawn, and the bed made a wild rush at the fireplace. This happened again twice, though the servants held on gallantly to the bed. Monsieur S. had no sleep, his bed continued to bound and run, and he sent on the following day, for a friend. In that gentleman's presence the leaps made by the bed ended in its breaking its left foot, on which the visitor observed that he had seen quite enough. He is said, later, to have expressed sorrow that he spoke, but he may have had various motives for this repentance.|$|R
