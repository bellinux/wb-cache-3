40|$|A {{backcross}} {{model of}} the obese, hyperglycemic New Zealand obese (<b>NZO)</b> <b>mouse</b> with the lean SJL strain was established in order to locate genes responsible for obesity and the associated syndrome of insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia, and to compare the effects under a standard and a high fat diet. The pattern of symptoms presented by the <b>NZO</b> <b>mouse</b> closely resembles the human metabolic syndrome, suggesting a common pathophysiology. A genome wide scan revealed a susceptibility locus for obesity and hyperinsulinemia (Nob 1) on mouse chromosome 5 {{in the vicinity of}} the markers D 5 Mit 392 and D 5 Mit 302. Nob 1 contributed to higher body weight and insulin resistance (LOD-score for BMI > 11). The effect of Nob 1 on body weight and insulin resistance was enhanced by a high fat diet. Although a sole effect of the leptin receptor variant of the <b>NZO</b> <b>mouse</b> (LeprA 720 T/T 1044 I) on the development of obesity could not be observed, LeprNZO significantly contributed to higher body weight in combination with Nob 1. Furthermore, Nob 1 accelerated and aggravated the development of diabetes in carriers of the diabetogenic Nidd/SJL allele. The synergistic effects of the susceptibility locus for hyperglycemia and islet cell failure Nidd/SJL, and the obesity locus Nob 1 accounted for 90 % of the diabetes observed in the backcross population. The combined effects were dependent on a high dietary fat content. The data indicate that the decompensation of glucose homeostasis in the <b>NZO</b> <b>mouse</b> reflects the synergistic effects of diabetes (Nidd/SJL) and obesity genes (Nob 1). A susceptibility locus for hypercholesterolemia, but not obesity, insulin resistance or hyperglycemia, was located 44 cM distal from Nob 1 on the mouse chromosome 5 near D 5 Mit 244. Homozygous male and female carriers of the responsible NZO allele exhibited significantly elevated cholesterol levels. Although the cholesterol levels of mice raised on a standard diet were significantly lower compared to animals fed a high fat diet, the absolute effect of Chol 1 /NZO was not altered by the dietary fat content. It is suggested that the responsible gene is involved in the cholesterol metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) {{is associated}} with defective insulin secretion, which in turn contributes to worsening glycaemic control and disease progression. The genetic cause(s) associated with impaired insulin secretion in T 2 D are not well elucidated. Here we used the polygenic New Zealand Obese (<b>NZO)</b> <b>mouse</b> model, which displays all the cardinal features of T 2 D including hyperglycaemia to identify genes associated with β-cell dysfunction. A genome-wide scan identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 associated with defective glucose-mediated insulin secretion. Using congenic strains, the locus was narrowed to two candidate genes encoding {{the components of the}} KATP channel: Abcc 8 (SUR 1) and Kcnj 11 (Kir 6. 2). The NZO Abcc 8 allele was associated with a ~ 211 bp deletion in its transcript and reduced expression of SUR 1. Transgenic NZO mice were generated that expressed the WT Abcc 8 /Kcnj 11 genes and displayed significant improvements in early-phase glucose-mediated insulin secretion and glucose tolerance, confirming Abcc 8 as a causative gene. Importantly, we showed that despite improving β-cell function in the NZO transgenic mice, there was no enhancement of insulin sensitivity or body weight. This study provides evidence for a role of Abcc 8 in early-phase glucose-mediated insulin secretion and validates this gene as a contributor to β-cell dysfunction in T 2 D. © 2016 Society for Endocrinology...|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand obese (<b>NZO)</b> <b>mouse</b> strain {{shares with}} the related New Zealand black (NZB) strain {{a number of}} immunophenotypic traits. Among these is a high {{proportion}} of B- 1 B lymphocytes, a subset associated with autoantibody production. Approximately 50 % of NZO/HlLt males develop a chronic insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes syndrome associated with 2 unusual features: the presence of B lymphocyte–enriched peri-insular infiltrates and the development of anti-insulin receptor autoantibodies (AIRAs). To establish the potential pathogenic contributions ofBlymphocytes and AIRAs in this model, a disrupted immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (Igh- 6) congenic on the NZB/BlJ background was backcrossed 4 generations into the NZO/HlLt background and was then intercrossed to produce mice that initially segregated for wild-type versus the mutant Igh- 6 allele and thus permitted comparison of syndrome development. A new flow cytometric assay (AIRA binding to transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing mouse insulin receptor) showed IgM and IgG subclass AIRAs in serum from Igh- 6 intact males, but not in Igh 6 null male serum. However, the absence of B lymphocytes and antibodies distinguishing mutant from wild-type males failed to significantly affect diabetes-free survival. The Igh 6 nullmales gained weight less rapidly than wild-type males, probably accounting for a retardation, but not prevention, of hyperglycemia. Thus, AIRA and the Blymphocyte component of the peri-insulitis in chronic diabetics were not essential either to development of insulin resistance or to eventual pancreatic beta cell failure and loss. A new substrain, designated NZL, was generated by inbreeding Igh- 6 wild-type segregants. Currently at the F 10 generation, NZL mice exhibit the same juvenile-onset obesity as NZO/HlLt males, but develop type 2 diabetes at a higher frequency (> 80 %). Also, unlike NZO/HlLt mice that are difficult to breed, the NZL/Lt strain breeds well and thus offers clear advantages to obesity/diabetes researchers...|$|E

Oxidative stress is a mediator of endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling. We investigated vascular dysfunction in the {{metabolic syndrome}} and the oxidant mechanisms involved. New Zealand obese (<b>NZO)</b> <b>mice</b> with metabolic syndrome and New Zealand black control <b>mice</b> were studied. <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> showed insulin resistance and increased visceral fat and blood pressure compared with New Zealand black mice. Mesenteric resistance arteries from <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> exhibited increased media:lumen ratio and media cross-sectional area, demonstrating hypertrophic vascular remodeling. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, assessed by pressurized myography, was impaired in <b>NZO</b> <b>mice,</b> not affected by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, inhibitor of endothelial NO synthase, and improved by the antioxidant Tempol, suggesting reduced NO bioavailability and increased oxidative stress. Dimer:monomer ratio of endothelial NO synthase was decreased in <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> compared with New Zealand black mice, suggesting endothelial NO synthase uncoupling. Furthermore, vascular superoxide and peroxynitrite production was increased, as well as adhesion molecule expression. Perivascular adipose tissue of <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> showed increased superoxide production and NADPH oxidase activity, as well as adipocyte hypertrophy, associated with inflammatory Mac- 3 –positive cell infiltration. Vasoconstriction to norepinephrine decreased {{in the presence of}} perivascular adipose tissue in New Zealand black mice but was unaffected by perivascular adipose tissue in <b>NZO</b> <b>mice,</b> suggesting loss of perivascular adipose tissue anticontractile properties. Our data suggest that this rodent model of metabolic syndrome is associated with perivascular adipose inflammation and oxidative stress, hypertrophic resistance artery remodeling, and endothelial dysfunction, the latter a result of decreased NO and enhanced superoxide generated by uncoupled endothelial NO synthase.

One {{of the models}} to study the obesity and its entanglements is the New Zealand Obese mice model. Aim {{of this study was}} to check the effect of high fat diet on changes in biochemical parameters as well as on process of angiogenesis in <b>NZO</b> <b>mice.</b> Methods <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> were fed with standard (ST) or high fat (HF) diet for seven weeks. Body weight and serum biochemical parameters were monitored. The PECAM 1 positive vessel-like structures immunostaining, as well as the gene expression of the matrigel penetrating cells by microarray (confirmed by real-time PCR method) were analyzed. Results Mice fed with HF diet developed obesity. Number of newly created vessels with lumen was correlated with hyperglycemia and animal weight gain. The number of PECAM 1 positive cells in matrigel tended to increase during HF diet. Microarray results revealed changes in gene expression (activation of the oxidative stress and insulin resistance, inhibition of apoptosis and cell differentiation), however without markers of endothelial cell network maturation.

40|$|Objective: Dietary protein {{dilution}} (PD) {{has been}} associated with metabolic advantages such as improved glucose homeostasis and increased energy expenditure. This phenotype involves liver-induced release of FGF 21 in response to amino acid insufficiency; however, it has remained unclear whether dietary dilution of specific amino acids (AAs) is also required. Circulating branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are sensitive to protein intake, elevated in the serum of obese humans and mice and thought to promote insulin resistance. We tested whether replenishment of dietary BCAAs to an AA-diluted (AAD) diet is sufficient to reverse the glucoregulatory benefits of dietary PD. Methods: We conducted AA profiling of serum from healthy humans and lean and high fat-fed or New Zealand obese (<b>NZO)</b> <b>mice</b> following dietary PD. We fed wildtype and <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> one of three amino acid defined diets: control, total AAD, or the same diet with complete levels of BCAAs (AAD + BCAA). We quantified serum AAs and characterized mice in terms of metabolic efficiency, body composition, glucose homeostasis, serum FGF 21, and tissue markers of the integrated stress response (ISR) and mTORC 1 signaling. Results: Serum BCAAs, while elevated in serum from hyperphagic NZO, were consistently reduced by dietary PD in humans and murine models. Repletion of dietary BCAAs modestly attenuated insulin sensitivity and metabolic efficiency in wildtype mice but did not restore hyperglycemia in <b>NZO</b> <b>mice.</b> While hepatic markers of the ISR such as P-eIF 2 α and FGF 21 were unabated by dietary BCAA repletion, hepatic and peripheral mTORC 1 signaling were fully or partially restored, independent of changes in circulating glucose or insulin.

40|$|Recent {{data have}} {{identified}} leptin as an afferent signal in a negative-feedback loop regulating {{the mass of}} the adipose tissue. High leptin levels are observed in obese humans and rodents, suggesting that, in some cases, obesity is the result of leptin insensitivity. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the response to peripherally and centrally administered leptin among lean and three obese strains of mice: diet-induced obese AKR/J, New Zealand Obese (NZO), and Ay. Subcutaneous leptin infusion to lean mice resulted in a dose-dependent loss of body weight at physiologic plasma levels. Chronic infusions of leptin intracerebroventricularly (i. c. v.) at doses of 3 ng/hr or greater resulted in complete depletion of visible adipose tissue, which was maintained throughout 30 days of continuous i. c. v. infusion. Direct measurement of energy balance indicated that leptin treatment did not increase total energy expenditure but prevented the decrease that follows reduced food intake. Diet-induced obese mice lost weight in response to peripheral leptin but were less sensitive than lean <b>mice.</b> <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> were unresponsive to peripheral leptin but were responsive to i. c. v. leptin. Ay mice did not respond to subcutaneous leptin and were 1 / 100 as sensitive to i. c. v. leptin. The decreased response to leptin in diet-induced obese, <b>NZO,</b> and Ay <b>mice</b> suggests that obesity in these strains is the result of leptin resistance. In <b>NZO</b> <b>mice,</b> leptin resistance {{may be the result of}} decreased transport of leptin into the cerebrospinal fluid, whereas in Ay mice, leptin resistance probably results from defects downstream of the leptin receptor in the hypothalamus...|$|R

In order to define its biochemical basis, the differential expression of genes involved in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism was studied. An outcross model of obese <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> with the lean SJL strain was established. NZOxF 1 (SJLxNZO) backcross mice were generated {{in order to}} obtain a population with heterogeneous metabolism but comparable genetic background. Groups of normal (normoglycemic/normoinsulinemic), insulin-resistant (normoglycemic/hyperinsulinemic) and diabetic (hyperglycemic/hypoinsulinemic) mice were identified. Parental SJL-mice were used as control. Mice received high fat or standard diet. At 22 weeks, mice were killed and RNA isolated from liver. Differential gene expression of genes chosen for various reasons (array-analysis, literature search and gene localization near a diabetogenic locus) was assessed by Northern and Dot blotting. The data indicate that 1) insulin resistance is associated with increased expression of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and in fatty acid oxidation, whereas 2) gluconeogenic enzymes are not repressed, 3) high fat diet enhanced lipid synthesis, 4) several enzymes display sex dimorphism (SCPx, PLTP, Hsd 3 b 5). The gene expression in insulin resistance reflects a dissociation of the effects of insulin on genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in liver: insulin-resistant hepatic glucose production causes hyperinsulinemia, which then enhances lipogenesis and thus further aggravates insulin resistance in a circulus vitiosus.

40|$|New Zealand obese (<b>NZO)</b> <b>mice</b> {{present a}} {{metabolic}} syndrome of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. To identify chromosomal segments {{associated with these}} traits, we intercrossed <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> with the lean and diabetes-resistant C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) strain. Obesity and hyperglycemia in the (NZO×B 6) F 2 intercross population were predominantly due to a broad quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 1 (Nob 3; logarithm of the odds score 16. 1, 16. 0, 4. 0 for body weight, body fat, and blood glucose, respectively), producing a difference between genotypes of 12. 7 or 5. 2 g of body weight and 12. 0 or 4. 0 g of body fat in females or males, respectively. In addition, significant QTL on chromosomes 3 and 13 and suggestive QTL on chromosomes 4, 6, 9, 12, 14, and 19 contributed to the obese phenotype. Distal chromosome 5 was significantly linked with plasma cholesterol (LOD score 10. 7). Introgression of two segments of Nob 3 into B 6 confirmed the adipogenic effect of the QTL and suggested the presence {{of at least one}} causal gene. Haplotype mapping reduced the critical region of the distal part of the QTL to 31 Mbp containing the potential candidates Nr 1 i 3, Apoa 2, Atp 1 a 2, Prox 1, and Hsd 11 b 1. We conclude that obesity and hyperglycemia of NZO is to a large part caused by variant genes located in Nob 3 on chromosome 1. Since these exert robust effects on a B 6 background, the QTL Nob 3 is a prime target for identification of a novel diabesity gene...|$|R

40|$|New Zealand Obese (<b>NZO)</b> <b>mice</b> {{exhibit a}} {{polygenic}} syndrome of morbid obesity, insulin resistance, and arterial hypertension that resembles the human metabolic syndrome. In addition, adult NZO-males are severely hyperglycemic and hypoinsulinemic. In order to localize the genes {{responsible for this}} polygenic syndrome, an outcross model of <b>NZO</b> <b>mice</b> with the lean, arteriosclerosis-resistant SJL strain was established. A total of 400 male backcross mice were monitored over a time period of 22 weeks (increment of body weight and body mass index, blood glucose, serum insulin, serum lipids). In a genome wide scan with more than 100 polymorphic microsatellite markers, a significant susceptibility locus (Nidd/SJL, LOD score > 8) for hyperglycemia with hypoinsulinemia was identified on the distal end of chromosome 4. This SJL-derived locus was responsible for a major part (60 %) of the total prevalence of diabetes in the backcross population, apparently concealing the effects of other NZO-derived diabetogenic genes. Nidd/SJL leads to a histologically detectable destruction of the b-cells in the islets of Langerhans. However, the diabetogenic allele does not affect obesity or serum insulin levels prior to the onset of diabetes. The allele appears to lower the threshold of obesity required {{for the development of}} the type 2 diabetes-like syndrome, and accelerates the onset of diabetes in mice with rapid weight gain. In the male backcross population, a high fat diet significantly enhanced the development of obesity as well as the diabetogenic effects of Nidd/SJL (difference in body weight approx. 12 g, onset of diabetes approx. 5 weeks earlier). A second diabetogenic locus (Nidd/NZO) was identified on mouse chromosome 15. The NZO-derived Nidd/NZO-allele seems to interact with Nidd/SJL in an additive manner; the combined effects of both alleles explain almost 90 % of the total prevalence of diabetes observed in the backcross. In conclusion, the present data localize a gene variant which, when present on an obese background, is responsible for a type 2 diabetes-like hyperglycemia. Furthermore, obesity and insulin resistance are required, but not sufficient, to produce diabetes in this mouse model. Additional diabetes genes which selectively cause b-cell degeneration are necessary for the type 2 diabetes-like decompensation of glucose homeostasis...|$|R

In the present project has been clarified whether 1) the ATP-dependent potassium channel Kir 6. 1 and its regulators, the sulfonylurea receptor 2 and phosphodiesterase 3 A play a role in autosomal dominant hypertension and brachydactyly in humans, 2) adipocyte-derived relaxing factor (ADRF) plays a role in hypertension modell of genetically obese animal 3) and TRPC 1, a functional component of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDHF) KCa channel signal complex regulates the vascular function and blood pressure. In 1) a Turkish family with autosomal-dominant hypertension and brachydactyly was investigated. With interphase FISH a deletion, reinsertion and inversion in chromosome 12 has been found, the identified candidate genes for hypertension were: ATP-sensitive potassium channel Kir 6. 1 and its regulators, the sulfonylurea receptor 2 and phosphodiesterase 3 A. High levels of PDE 3 A mRNA were measured in the samples from three affected vessel. Three other affected patients showed normal parameters. Forearm infusion studies showed no differences in the responses to diazoxide, isoproterenol or milrinone. The results cast doubt on the role of Kir 6. 1 and SUR 2. The differences in the expression of PDE 3 A and responses to milrinone are probably the consequences of high blood pressure. In 2) were ADRF and adiponectin in Sprague-Dawley rats, wild-type and adiponectin gene-deficient mice (APN 1 -/ -) and New Zealand Obese (<b>NZO)</b> <b>mice</b> tested. The results show that adiponectin is a novel humoral vasodilator, that Kv channels opens.

Through this mechanism, TRPC 1 {{plays an important role in}} the systemic regulation of blood pressure. Our hypothesis is that TRPC 1 is a functional component of EDHF-KCa channel signal complex.

As the stress protein heat shock protein 60 (Hsp 60) induces proinflammatory adipocyte activities, we hypothesized that adipocytes of diabetes-predisposed mice exhibit an increased proinflammatory reactivity to Hsp 60. Preadipocytes and mature adipocytes from nonobese diabetic (NOD), New Zealand obese (NZO), and C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were analyzed for Hsp 60 binding, Hsp 60 -activated signaling pathways, and Hsp 60 -induced release of the chemokine CXCL- 1 (KC), interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and macrophage chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1). Hsp 60 showed specific binding to (pre-) adipocytes of NOD, NZO, and C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Hsp 60 binding involved conserved binding structure(s) and Hsp 60 epitopes and was strongest to NZO mouse-derived mature adipocytes. Hsp 60 exposure induced KC, IL- 6, and MCP- 1 release from (pre-) adipocytes of all mouse strains with a pronounced increase of IL- 6 release from NZO mouse-derived adipocytes. Compared to NOD and C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse derived cells, Hsp 60 -induced formation of IL- 6, KC, and MCP- 1 from NZO mouse-derived (pre-) adipocytes strongly depended on NFκB-activation.

By positional cloning we recently identified a microdeletion within this locus causing the disruption of Ifi 202 b that protects from adiposity by suppressing expression of 11 b-Hsd 1.

The characterization of a subcongenic line carrying 14. 2 Mbp of Nob 3. 38 with a polymorphic region of 4. 4 Mbp indicates that the microdeletion and/or other polymorphisms in its proximity alter body weight, voluntary activity, and exploration.

Analysis of the 10 genes in the critical interval by sequencing, qRT–PCR, and RACE–PCR revealed a striking allelic variance of Zfp 69 encoding zinc finger domain transcription factor 69. In NZO and C 57 BL/ 6 J, a retrotransposon (IAPLTR 1 a) in intron 3 disrupted the gene by formation of a truncated mRNA that lacked the coding sequence for the KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) and Znf-C 2 H 2 domains of Zfp 69, whereas the diabetogenic SJL, NON, and NZB alleles generated a normal mRNA. When combined with the B 6.

During OGTTs, glucose clearance was normal but insulin levels were significantly higher in the B 6 -Tg(Zfp 69) than in control mice. The liver fat content and plasma triacylglycerol levelswere significantly increased in B 6 -Tg(Zfp 69) andNZO/B 6 -Tg(Zfp 69) mice on a high-fat diet compared with controls. Liver transcriptome analysis of B 6 -Tg(Zfp 69) mice revealed a down-regulation of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Specifically, expression ofNampt, Lpin 2,Map 2 k 6, Gys 2, Bnip 3, Fitm 2, Slc 2 a 2,Ppargc 1 α and Insrwas significantly decreased in the liver of B 6 -Tg(Zfp 69) mice compared with wild-type ani-mals. However, overexpression of Zfp 69 did not induce overt diabetes with hyperglycaemia and beta cell loss. Conclusions/interpretation Zfp 69 mediates hyperlipidaemia, liver fat accumulation and mild insulin resistance. However, it does not induce type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the diabetogenic effect of the Zfp 69 locus requires synergy with other as yet unidentified genes...|$|R
40|$|A {{backcross}} {{model of}} New Zealand obese <b>mice</b> (<b>NZO)</b> with the lean, atherosclerosis-resistant SJL strain {{was established to}} locate genes responsible for obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes–like hypergly-cemia. In male NZO F 1 backcross mice, a major sus-ceptibility locus {{for the development of}} hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia (Nidd/SJL) was identified on chro-mosome 4 between the markers D 4 Mit 278 and D 4 Mit 232, 10 – 28 cM distal of the previously described Nidd 1 locus. The diabetogenic allele has presumably been contributed by the SJL genome, and it appeared to be responsible for ~ 60 % of the total prevalence of hyperglycemia. The presence of Nidd/SJL did not alter body weight or weight gain by week 12. Thereafter, it was associated with reduced weight gain or weight loss, pre...|$|R
