40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work {{we show that}} murine ATXN 3 (ATXN 3 Q 6) <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> is {{promoted}} by phosphorylation on serine 29, a highly conserved residue inside the Josephin domain. Both casein kinase 2 (CK 2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK 3) are {{able to carry out}} phosphorylation on this residue. S 29 phosphorylation was initially assessed in vitro on purified ATXN 3 Q 6, and subsequently confirmed in transfected COS- 7 cells, by MS analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of S 29 to an alanine was shown to strongly reduce <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake,</b> in COS- 7 transiently transfected cells overexpressing ATXN 3 Q 6, while substitution with phospho-mimic aspartic acid restored the wild-type phenotype. Finally, treatment with CK 2 and GSK 3 inhibitors prevented S 29 phosphorylation and strongly inhibited <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake,</b> showing that both kinases are involved in ATXN 3 Q 6 subcellular sorting. Although other authors have previously addressed this issue, we show {{for the first time that}} ATXN 3 is phosphorylated inside the Josephin domain and that S 29 phosphorylation is involved in <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of ATXN 3...|$|R

An additional role as inhibitors of <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> was supposed by subcellular fractionation and enucleation experiments. Using indirect immunofluorescence labeling of cells, we show {{here that the}} DNA-binding p 50 and p 65 subunits of NF-kappa B, {{as well as the}} I kappa B protein MAD- 3, all occur in the nucleus when overexpressed on their own. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of p 65 and, to a lesser extent of p 50, was, however, suppressed when MAD- 3 was coexpressed. Likewise, <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of MAD- 3 was blocked by overexpressed p 65 or p 50. This directly demonstrates that I kappa B is a <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> regulatory protein and that the various subunits of NF-kappa B can mutually control their access to the nucleus. In the presence of MAD- 3, antibodies specific for peptides overlapping the nuclear location signal (NLS) sequences of p 65 and p 50 could not recognize their epitopes on NF-kappa B, suggesting that the I kappa B protein rendered the signals inaccessible for NLS receptors...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition of <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of {{calcitriol}} receptor by uremic ultrafiltrate. The {{biological action}} of calcitriol is mediated through a hormone-receptor complex interacting with nuclear chromatin. Interaction of the calcitriol receptor (VDR) with VDR response elements produces bioactive proteins which {{carry out the}} physiological actions of calcitriol. Since biological response to calcitriol appears to be diminished in renal failure, we studied the effect of uremic toxins on the interaction of VDR with nuclear chromatin using in vitro <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of the 3 H-calcitriol labeled VDR by intestinal nuclei. We found that <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of the labeled intestinal VDR from renal failure rats was significantly lower than that from the control animals. HPLC fractionated uremic ultrafiltrate directly inhibited <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of the labeled VDR when the labeled VDR was incubated with 50 % of the ultrafiltrate for various time intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 6 hours. Infusion of uremic ultrafiltrate to normal rats for 20 hours also produced intestinal VDR with a lower binding affinity for intestinal nuclei {{when compared to the}} controls infused with normal ultrafiltrate. The latter study suggests that uremic toxins are responsible for the decreased <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of VDR of rats with renal failure. Although it is difficult to extrapolate these results directly to the intact cells, our findings suggest that part of the calcitriol resistance in renal failure could be explained by decreased entry of receptor into the nucleus...|$|R

The mechanism of apoptosis induction and the molecular {{basis for the}} difference in susceptibility between tumor cells and healthy cells have not been defined. In this study we examined the interaction of MAL with different cellular compartments, using confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation.

We analyzed two aspects of the radioligand interaction; <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> with dispersed, intact cells at 37 degrees C and binding at 0 degrees C with soluble extract ("cytosol") prepared from cells disrupted in buffer containing 300 mM KCl and 10 mM sodium molybdate. With normal fibroblasts the affinity and capacity of <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of [3 H] 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 were 0. 5 nM and 10, 300 sites per cell, respectively; for binding with cytosol these were 0. 13 nM and 8, 900 sites per cell, respectively. The following four patterns of interaction with [3 H] 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 were observed with cells cultured from affected patients: (a) two kindreds; cytosol binding and whole-cell <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> both unmeasurable; (b) one kindred, decreased capacity and normal affinity both for binding in cytosol and for <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> in whole cells; (c) two kindreds, normal or nearly normal capacity and affinity of binding in cytosol but unmeasurable whole-cell nuclear uptake; and (d) one kindred, normal capacity and affinity of both cytosol binding and whole-cell <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake.</b> In all cases where the radioligand bound with high affinity in nucleus or cytosol, the nucleus- or cytosol-associated radioligand exhibited normal sedimentation velocity on sucrose density gradients.

40|$|In stimulated cells, the mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} ERK 2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2) {{concentrates}} in the nucleus. Evidence exists for CRM 1 -dependent, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-mediated nuclear export of ERK 2, but its mechanism of nuclear entry is not understood. To determine requirements for nuclear transport, we tagged ERK 2 with {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) and examined its <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> by using an in vitro import assay. GFP-ERK 2 entered the nucleus in a saturable, time- and temperature-dependent manner. Entry of GFP-ERK 2, like that of ERK 2, required neither energy nor transport factors and was visible within minutes. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of GFP-ERK 2 was inhibited by wheat germ agglutinin, which blocks nuclear entry by binding to carbohydrate moieties on nuclear pore complex proteins. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of GFP-ERK 2 also was reduced by excess amounts of recombinant transport factors. These findings suggest that ERK 2 competes with transport factors for binding to nucleoporins, which mediate the entry and exit of transport factors. In support of this hypothesis, we showed that ERK 2 binds directly to a purified nucleoporin. Our data suggest that GFP-ERK 2 enters the nucleus by a saturable, facilitated mechanism, distinct from a carrier- and energy-dependent import mechanism and involves a direct interaction with nuclear pore complex proteins...|$|R

The characteristics of this process were assessed by analyzing the nuclear bound L-T 3 as a marker of the internalized hormone and by determining the initial rate of L-T 3 uptake. [125 I]L-T 3 cellular uptake at 37 C reached a plateau at 2 h when the <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake,</b> after an initial lag phase, was still increasing and represented 4. 7 % of the cellular uptake. Incubation at 4 C caused [125 I]L-T 3 cellular uptake to decrease by 77 % and <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> to be abolished. A similar effect on [125 I]L-T 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> was obtained after myoblasts were incubated at 37 C with a 1000 -fold excess of unlabeled L-T 3. The addition of various inhibitors of ATP production, cytoskeleton integrity, endocytosis, and Na+, K+-ATPase that did not interfere with [125 I]L-T 3 binding to the cell surface or to isolated nuclei caused a dose-dependent reduction of both extranuclear and <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake,</b> ranging from 34 - 85 %. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence on the myoblast surface of L-T 3 high affinity (Ka = 1. 6 X 10 (9) M- 1) and low affinity (Ka = 5. 4 X 10 (6) M- 1) binding sites; other iodothyronines exhibited lower affinity for both sites. Kinetic analysis of L-T 3 transport after 60 -sec incubation at 23 C defined a process with a Km of 17 +/- 5. 6 nM and a maximum velocity of 83 +/- 35 pmol/mg DNA. These results indicate the existence in rat myoblasts of a temperature-dependent, energy-requiring, saturable, and stereospecific L-T 3 uptake mechanism, probably mediated through an endocytotic pathway, located on the myoblast plasma membrane, that may regulate L-T 3 action in skeletal muscle...|$|R

To understand the trafficking process in astrocytes, we compared nucleocytoplasmic transport of Rev and various proteins with well-characterized nucleocytoplasmic transport features in human astrocytes and control cells (HeLa). Localization and trafficking characteristics of several cellular and viral proteins, as well as nuclear trafficking of classical peptide signals upon microinjection were similar in both cell types, indicating maintenance of general features of nucleocytoplasmic transport in astrocytes. Quantification of fluorescence in living cells expressing Rev fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicated a strong shift in intracellular distribution of Rev in astrocytes, with 50 - 70 % of Rev in the cytoplasm, whereas the cytoplasmic proportion of Rev in HeLa cells is around 10 %.

After incubation with intact cells at 37 C L-T 3 cellular and <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptakes</b> were 91 % and 70 % {{higher than those of}} D-T 3, respectively, but values for <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> as a fraction of cellular uptake were similar. The difference between the enantiomers was abolished at 4 C, and metabolic and endocytotic inhibitors reduced nuclear and extranuclear saturable uptake of L-T 3 to a similar degree, but had little or no effect on D-T 3 uptake. The affinity constants (Ka) for L- and D-T 3 binding to isolated nuclei were similar, but the apparent nuclear Ka of L-T 3 in intact cells was 5 -fold greater than that of D-T 3. The findings suggest that stereospecific transport, mainly active at the plasma membrane, occurs in rat skeletal muscle cells. This discriminative pathway of cell entry facilitates L-T 3 uptake by an energy-dependent pathway not shared by D-T 3 and may explain the greater potency of L-T 3 than D-T 3...|$|R

Non-viral vectors are generally less efficient than viral vectors because they lack specific components that could help with endosomal escape, movement through the cytoplasm and <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake.</b> The simpler composition of non-viral vectors, however, may have an advantage over viral vectors, since they are free of non-human components, making re-administration potentially more successful [44, 45].|$|R
40|$|A pivotal {{step forward}} in {{chemical}} approaches to controlling gene expression {{is the development of}} sequence-specific DNA-binding molecules that can enter live cells and traffic to nuclei unaided. DNA-binding polyamides are a class of programmable, sequence-specific small molecules that have been shown to influence a wide variety of protein–DNA interactions. We have synthesized over 100 polyamide-fluorophore conjugates and assayed their <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> profiles in 13 mammalian cell lines. The compiled dataset, comprising 1300 entries, establishes a benchmark for the nuclear localization of polyamide-dye conjugates. Compounds in this series were chosen to provide systematic variation in several structural variables, including dye composition and placement, molecular weight, charge, ordering of the aromatic and aliphatic amino-acid building blocks and overall shape. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> {{does not appear to be}} correlated with polyamide molecular weight or with the number of imidazole residues, although the positions of imidazole residues affect nuclear access properties significantly. Generally negative determinants for nuclear access include the presence of a ß-Ala-tail residue and the lack of a cationic alkyl amine moiety, whereas the presence of an acetylated 2, 4 -diaminobutyric acid-turn is a positive factor for nuclear localization. We discuss implications of these data on the design of polyamide-dye conjugates for use in biological systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcription}} factor NFATc 1 {{may be involved}} in slow skeletal muscle gene expression. NFATc 1 translocates from cytoplasm to nuclei during slow fiber type electrical stimulation of skeletal muscle fibers because of activation of the Ca 2 +-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, resulting in nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) dephosphorylation and consequent exposure of its nuclear localization signal. Here, we find that unstimulated adult skeletal muscle fibers exhibit a previously unanticipated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NFATc 1 without appreciable nuclear accumulation. In resting fibers, the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B caused nuclear accumulation of NFATc 1 (but not of isoform NFATc 3) and formation of NFATc 1 intranuclear bodies independent of calcineurin. The rate of <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of NFATc 1 was 4. 6 times lower in resting fibers exposed to leptomycin B than during electrical stimulation. Inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase and protein kinase A or of casein kinase 1 slowed the decay of nuclear NFATc 1 after electrical stimulation, but they did not cause NFATc 1 <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> in unstimulated fibers. We propose that two nuclear translocation pathways, one pathway mediated by calcineurin activation and NFAT dephosphorylation and the other pathway independent of calcineurin and possibly independent of NFAT dephosphorylation, determine the distribution of NFATc 1 between cytoplasm and nuclei in adult skeletal muscle...|$|R

Conversion of Lys- 87 to Glu resulted in an inactivated prothymosin α mutant, which lost the ability of the wild-type protein to block yeast cell growth.

40|$|The {{androgen}} resistance syndromes {{are generally}} {{felt to be}} due to quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of the androgen receptor. Some patients with testicular feminization have no demonstrable fibroblast cytosol androgen binding, whereas others have androgen binding in cultured fibrobalsts that is thermolabile or fails to be stabilized by sodium molybdate. I describe here familial incomplete testicular feminization associated with reduced nuclear androgen retention. Fibroblasts, cultured from pubic skin biopsies of two phenotypic female 46 XY siblings, were assayed for whole cell and <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of [3 H]dihydrotestosterone in dispersed, intact cells. Whole cell binding of [3 H]dihydrotestosterone at 22 °C in the patients' fibroblasts was in the normal range. However, no high affinity, saturable binding of [3 H]dihydrotestosterone was demonstrable in crude nuclear pellets prepared from the patients' fibroblasts incubated at 37 °C with the hormone. Incubating the patients' cells with [3 H]methyltrienolone or examining the <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake</b> of [3 H]dihydrotestosterone in these cells at 22 °C did not alter these findings. Although cytosol from the patients' cells revealed a quantitatively diminished 8 S peak for [3 H]dihydrotestosterone after centrifugation on sodium molybdate-containing sucrose gradients, there was no peak of 3 H in the 4 S region from 0. 3 M KCl nuclear extracts of the patients' cells after they had been incubated with [3 H]dihydrotestosterone at 37 °C...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} {{are widely}} used in bioapplications such as imaging (MRI), targeted delivery (drugs/genes) and cell transfection (magnetofection). Historically, the impermeable nature of both the plasma and nuclear membranes hinder potential. Researchers combat this by developing techniques to enhance cellular and <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake.</b> Two current popular methods are using external magnetic fields to remotely control particle direction or functionalising the nanoparticles with a cell penetrating peptide (e. g. tat); both of which facilitate cell entry. This paper compares the success of both methods in terms of nanoparticle uptake, analysing the type of magnetic forces the particles experience, and determines gross cell response in terms of morphology and structure and changes at the gene level via microarray analysis. Results indicated that both methods enhanced uptake via a caveolin dependent manner, with tat peptide being the more efficient and achieving <b>nuclear</b> <b>uptake.</b> On comparison to control cells, many groups of gene changes were observed {{in response to the}} particles. Importantly, the magnetic field also caused many change in gene expression, regardless of the nanoparticles, and appeared to cause F-actin alignment in the cells. Results suggest that static fields should be modelled and analysed prior to application in culture as cells clearly respond appropriately. Furthermore, the use of cell penetrating peptides may prove more beneficial in terms of enhancing uptake and maintaining cell homeostasis than a magnetic field...|$|R
