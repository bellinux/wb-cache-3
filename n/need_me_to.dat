500|$|In 2010, McAdams starred {{with her}} The Family Stone co-star Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford in the comedy Morning Glory. She played a {{television}} producer attempting {{to improve the}} poor ratings of a morning television program. The film was billed as a starring vehicle for McAdams. She initially felt she was unsuited to the role saying, [...] "I'm not funny. So I said, 'if you <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be funny, {{you might want to}} look somewhere else'". The film's director Roger Michell had a number of dinners with McAdams and persuaded her to join the cast. Since working with Keaton, McAdams has described her as a mentor figure. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said McAdams [...] "gives the kind of performance we go to the movies for" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt she played [...] "as lovable a lead as anyone since Amy Adams in Junebug" [...] in an otherwise [...] "routine" [...] movie. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was impressed by [...] "her gift for physical comedy", as was Varietys Andrew Barker. While Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt she [...] "plays her role exceptionally well" [...] and is [...] "effortlessly likable", it called on Hollywood to give her parts [...] "worthy" [...] of her talent. [...] "Ms.McAdams has to rely on her dimples to get by. She does, but she could do better." [...] The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $58million worldwide from a production budget of $40million. McAdams later expressed her disappointment that the film failed to find a larger audience.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1975 {{referendum}} debate {{she took}} a Eurosceptic stance. During a debate with Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe he asked her whether, if the vote would be yes, she would stay on as a minister. To this she replied [...] "If the vote is yes my country will <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> save it." [...] Despite her views she later became a Member of the European Parliament (1979–1989).|$|E
2500|$|In Week 11, the Lions {{hosted the}} Cleveland Browns in a non-conference shootout. The Browns built a big {{lead in the}} first quarter, scoring first with a 44-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. After a 31-yard Jason Hanson field goal, Cleveland scored 21 points on Brady Quinn touchdowns to Mohamed Massaquoi (59 yards), Chansi Stuckey (40 yards), Joshua Cribbs (four yards). The Lions {{answered}} with three consecutive TD passes from Matthew Stafford to Aaron Brown (26 yards) and Kevin Smith (25 yards) and a 75-yard catch and run TD for Calvin Johnson. The Browns responded with a 29-yard field goal just before halftime. In the 3rd quarter Will Heller of the Lions caught a one-yard TD pass. The Browns received a safety when Stafford was tackled in his own end zone and called for intentional grounding. The Browns retook the lead on a two-yard TD catch by Michael Gaines and a Jamal Lewis two-point conversion. Stafford was intercepted on the next Lions possession, but the Lions stopped the Browns on 4th and 5. Then they drove 88 yards. With 2 seconds left, Stafford raced out of the pocket and threw a pass {{into the end zone}} which was intercepted by Brodney Pool, but the pick was nullified on a Hank Poteat pass interference penalty, giving the Lions one more play with no time left on the clock. [...] Stafford was brutally hit by two Browns defenders on the play, and suffered {{what turned out to be}} a major shoulder separation of his left (non-throwing) arm; he had to come out for the final play and backup Daunte Culpepper went in, but the Browns called time-out; under NFL rules injured players must come out for one play, and the Browns timeout thus made Stafford eligible to return to the field; he told the coaches he wanted to return for the final play (pleading to coaches [...] "If you <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> throw the ball, I can throw the ball") and was allowed to go back in. He then threw a touchdown to Brandon Pettigrew, and Jason Hanson tacked on the extra point for the win. Stafford became the youngest QB to throw five touchdown passes in a game since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. He also set a record for passing yards in a game by a rookie with 422. For his performance, Stafford won NFC Offensive Player of the Week and Pepsi Rookie of the Week.|$|E
2500|$|Artest and Yao later {{exchanged}} extensive phone calls. Artest also said, [...] "Whatever Adelman <b>needs</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do, whether that's {{come off}} the bench, sixth, seventh man, start, I don't even care. Whatever he <b>needs</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do, I'm 100 percent sure it's going to work out." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Are you {{a detective}} or a doctor?" [...] she asked calmly. [...] "Do you <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{remind you that}} your patient is {{bleeding}} to death?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Uncle Henry and Aunt Em <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> help them," [...] she added, [...] "so I can't ever be {{very long}} {{away from the}} farm in Kansas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let 'em die then; I'm {{tired of}} fussing over babies, and I'm {{going to play}} with the boys; they <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see to 'em," [...] {{returned}} the strong-minded lady.|$|E

5000|$|Although now {{concentrating on}} the Mondo Generator project, in September 2006 Oliveri stated [...] "I feel that Queens is {{something}} I can contribute <b>to</b> and Homme <b>needs</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am that man, sir, {{though we}} called it the Third Guards in those days. It was a fine ridgment, and they only <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make up a full muster." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell you? You have {{tasted the}} luxury of power. You have made your public, you are already a personage. And I want you for myself--for my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> show ye how {{to bring}} down deer," [...] he observed, with a grin on his homely face. [...] "You have done prime, boys, prime, an' I'm proud of ye!" ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the lack}} of scoring chances created against Romania, Milutinovic's {{decision}} not to play Klopas was brought into question {{the day before the}} Knockout Round match, to which the Serbian manager said, [...] "He can score, but what else?". Klopas responded to Milutinovic's assessment of his play saying, [...] "He said that? I don't know why he would feel that way. I can play wherever he <b>needs</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play. This is the only time I've actually played striker. My five years in Greece, I played midfield and attacker. I'll play any position the team <b>needs</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play. Where I am now, it's not my duty to defend." ...|$|R
5000|$|Now {{that he is}} a lawmaker himself, Tian Chua {{has pledged}} not to change his ways: I'm not {{changing}} my approach. My responsibility is to voice out and if there is something that <b>needs</b> <b>me</b> <b>to,</b> I will do it.|$|R
60|$|There {{was little}} <b>need</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> urge that the moments were precious.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot conceive," [...] he said, [...] "how {{any other}} {{occupation}} {{could ever have}} occurred to you. You do not <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> remind you of your success at Paris. The papers are continually wondering what has become of 'Alcide.' Your name alone would fill any music hall in London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{you don't}} <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go about with you," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "Contrive {{some sort of}} {{excursion}} yourself, and take the ladies out and amuse them. You might take them out to see Pozzuoli and the Solfatara. Besides, you would be doing me a great service if you would go." ...|$|E
60|$|Few moments did it <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make ready, yet fewer, it seems, {{would the}} Borgia impatience have had me employ; for scarce was I booted when someone knocked at my door. I opened, and there entered a very {{mountain}} of a man, whose corselet flashed back the yellow light of my tapers, as {{might have done}} a mirror, and whose harsh voice barked out to ask if I was ready.|$|E
40|$|Leverkusen Memories was {{inspired}} by the Leverkusen Pieces (1969) by Robert Barry. Something that is taking shape in my mind and will sometimes come to consciousness. Something that is searching for <b>me</b> and <b>needs</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reveal itself. Something I was once conscious of but have now forgotten. Something which is unknown <b>to</b> <b>me</b> but which works upon me...|$|R
6000|$|The basic {{realities of}} my poverty again cropped {{out in a}} letter from my mother who wrote that my aunt was very ill and that she <b>needed</b> <b>me.</b> <b>To</b> Zulime I said, [...] "You stay here with your sister and your friends while I {{go up to the}} Homestead and see what I can do for our old people." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the sound}} good feeling and {{good sense of}} her entreaty, Miss Abbey had {{softened}} into a soothing tone, and had even drawn her arm round the girl's waist. But, she only replied, 'Thank you, thank you! I can't. I won't. I must not think of it. The harder father is borne upon, the more he <b>needs</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lean on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a detective," [...] Penelope said coldly. [...] "You do not <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{point out}} certain things to you. Mr. Hamilton Fynes was robbed and murdered--an American citizen {{on his way}} to London. Mr. Richard Vanderpole is also murdered, after a call upon Mr. James B. Coulson, the only {{acquaintance}} whom Mr. Fynes is known to have possessed in this country. Did Mr. Fynes share secrets with Mr. Coulson? If so, did Mr. Coulson pass them on to Mr. Vanderpole, and for that reason did Mr. Vanderpole meet with the same death, at the same hands, as had befallen Mr. Fynes?" ...|$|E
60|$|I joined my wail to theirs, {{loud and}} bitter; but Joseph asked {{what we could}} be {{thinking}} of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven. He told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson. I could not guess the use that either would be of, then. However, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me; the other said he would come in the morning. Leaving Joseph to explain matters, I ran to the children's room: their door was ajar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but they were calmer, and did not <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> console them. The little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit on: no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could not help wishing we were all there safe together.|$|E
60|$|Four {{buttons of}} my pelisse were open, {{and it did}} not <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> put my hand up to know that my {{precious}} papers were gone. Oh! the depth of cunning that lurks in a woman's heart. She had robbed me, this creature, robbed me as she clung to my breast. Even while I smoothed her hair, and whispered kind words into her ear, her hands had been at work beneath my dolman. And here I was, at the very last step of my journey, without the power of carrying out this mission which had already deprived one good man of his life, and was likely to rob another one of his credit. What would the Emperor say when he heard that I had lost his despatches? Would the army believe it of Etienne Gerard? And when they heard that a woman's hand had coaxed them from me, what laughter there would be at mess-table and at camp-fire! I could have rolled upon the ground in my despair.|$|E
60|$|With his quick sensibilities, {{there was}} no <b>need</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> express myself in words. My face {{revealed}} to him what was passing in my mind.|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{maybe it}} won't." [...] Slow and mocking came Wolverstone's voice {{to answer the}} other's {{confident}} excitement, and as he spoke he advanced to Blood's side, an unexpected ally. [...] "Some o' them dawcocks may believe that tale." [...] He jerked a contemptuous thumb towards {{the men in the}} waist, whose ranks were steadily being increased by the advent of others from the forecastle. [...] "Although even some o' they should know better, for there's still a few was on Barbados with us, and are acquainted like me and you with Colonel Bishop. If ye're counting on pulling Bishop's heartstrings, ye're a bigger fool, Ogle, than I've always thought you was with anything but guns. There's no heaving to for such a matter as that unless you wants to make quite sure of our being sunk. Though we had a cargo of Bishop's nieces it wouldn't make him hold his hand. Why, as I was just telling his lordship here, who thought like you that having Miss Bishop aboard would make us safe, not for his mother would that filthy slaver forgo what's due to him. And if ye' weren't a fool, Ogle, you wouldn't <b>need</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell you this. We've got to fight, my lads...." ...|$|E
