40|$|Outdoor {{wayfinding}} <b>and</b> <b>navigation</b> systems <b>and</b> {{services have}} become indispensable in people's mobility in unfamiliar environments. Advances in key technologies (e. g., positioning and mobile devices), has spurred interest {{in research and}} development of indoor wayfinding <b>and</b> <b>navigation</b> systems <b>and</b> services in recent years. Indoor Wayfinding <b>and</b> <b>Navigation</b> provides both breadth and depth of knowledge in designing and building indoor wayfinding <b>and</b> <b>navigation</b> systems <b>and</b> services. It covers the types of sensors both feasible and practical for localization of users inside buildings. The book discusses current approaches, techniques, and technologies for addressing issues in indoor wayfinding <b>and</b> <b>navigation</b> systems <b>and</b> services. It includes coverage of the cognitive, positioning, mapping, and application perspectives, an unusual but useful combination of information. This mix of different perspectives helps you better understand the issues and challenges of building indoor wayfinding <b>and</b> <b>navigation</b> systems <b>and</b> services, how they are different from those used outdoors, and how they can be used efficiently and effectively in challenging applications. Written by well-known specialists in the field, the book addresses all aspects of indoor wayfinding <b>and</b> <b>navigation.</b> It includes the latest research developments on the topic, succinctly covers the fundamentals, and details the issues and challenges in building new systems and services. With this information, you can design indoor wayfinding <b>and</b> <b>navigation</b> systems <b>and</b> services for a variety of uses and users...|$|R

5|$|Like its sibling V-Bombers, the Victor {{made use}} of the Navigational and Bombing System (NBS); a little-used optical sight had also been {{installed}} upon early aircraft. For <b>navigation</b> <b>and</b> bomb-aiming purposes, the Victor employed numerous radar systems. These included the H2S radar, the first airborne ground-scanning radar, and the Green Satin radar. Radar information was inputted into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus. Some of the <b>navigation</b> <b>and</b> targeting equipment was either directly descended from, or shared concepts with, those used on Handley Page's preceding Halifax bomber. Operationally, {{the accuracy of the}} bomb-aiming system proved to be limited to roughly 400 yards, which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations.|$|E
5|$|Midshipmen were {{expected}} {{to work on the}} ship, but were also expected to learn <b>navigation</b> <b>and</b> seamanship. They {{were expected}} to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising gun batteries, commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, <b>navigation,</b> <b>and</b> sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain. Midshipmen {{were expected to}} keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.|$|E

The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time <b>navigation</b> <b>and</b> the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E
