500|$|Although Frederick {{demonstrated}} good {{leadership by}} rallying his troops against the surprise attack, Hochkirch {{is considered one}} of his worst losses, and it badly shook his equanimity. [...] Andrew Mitchell, the British envoy who was with them, and normally wrote positively about Frederick, attributed Frederick's loss to the contempt he had for Daun's supposedly cautious nature and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not agree with what he imagined was true: according to Mitchell, there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> but himself. That winter, Mitchell described the 46-year-old Frederick as [...] "an old man lacking half of his teeth, with greying hair, without gaiety or spark or imagination." [...] Frederick suffered from gout and influenza, and refused to change his uniform, which was moth-eaten and covered in food and snuff stains.|$|E

2500|$|When Ustinov {{closed the}} {{criminal}} case without filing charges, family members were angry. Retired Russian navy Captain Vladimir Mityayev lost a son on Kursk.

5000|$|The {{film was}} not {{distributed}} and received generally poor reviews, with Leslie Felperin of Variety calling the film [...] "underwhelming" [...] and [...] "a disappointment". [...] Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter {{wrote that the}} film [...] "is an incomprehensible, disappointing effort in which he (Gallo) receives producing, directing, writing, editing, music and acting credits, so there really is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> if this story {{about a man who}} broods on love and death disappears into the waves almost immediately after its festival outings." ...|$|R

On the whole, I wish to look upon her as modest and becoming, and yet the clouds that drive among these hills are not more unsartain.

60|$|In {{answer to}} the doctor's inquiry how did it happen, and was anyone to blame, Tom Tootle gives in his verdict, {{unavoidable}} accident and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> but the sufferer. 'He was slinking about in his boat,' says Tom, 'which slinking were, not to speak ill of the dead, {{the manner of the}} man, when he come right athwart the steamer's bows and she cut him in two.' Mr Tootle is so far figurative, touching the dismemberment, as that he means the boat, and not the man. For, the man lies whole before them.|$|E
50|$|Relatives of Giselle Salandy are {{questioning}} {{why she was}} allowed to drive herself on Sunday, although a driver was assigned to her. A 21-year-old man {{had been given the}} job to take Salandy to different destinations. Salandy, who held a driver's permit for the last two years, hired a driver because of her hectic schedule. However, her manager Boxu Potts dispelled the rumours that the driver abandoned his job, and claimed it was Salandy's decision to drive herself, and her cousin stressed that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for the accident.|$|R

60|$|With a truly perverse instinct, I saw {{how strong}} {{this might be}} made, at the fond reader's expense, to be sure, and how much more pathetic, in such a case, the silhouetted figure on the coke-cart would really be. I should, of course, make it {{perfectly}} plain that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was <b>to</b> <b>blame,</b> and that the whole affair had been so tacit on Jan's part that Nina might very well have known nothing of his feeling for her. Perhaps {{at the very end}} I might subtly insinuate that it was possible he might have had no such feeling towards her as the reader had been led to imagine.|$|R

60|$|Shadow the Weasel was a prisoner. He {{who always}} had been free to go and come as he pleased and to do as he pleased was now in a little narrow cage and quite helpless. For once he had been careless, {{and this was the}} result. Farmer Brown's boy had caught him in a trap. Of course, he should have known better than to have visited the {{henhouse}} a second time after killing three of the best pullets there. He should have known that Farmer Brown's boy would be sure to do something about it. The truth is, he had yielded to temptation when common sense had warned him not to. So he had <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> for his present difficulty but himself, and he knew it.|$|E
60|$|But {{now as he}} {{clung to}} a little branch {{near the top of}} a tall pine-tree in the Green Forest {{and looked down at the}} big sharp teeth of Buster Bear drawing nearer and nearer, and listened to the deep, angry growls that made his hair stand on end, Chatterer was too frightened to think. If only he had kept his tongue still instead of saying hateful things to Buster Bear! If only he had known that Buster could climb a tree! If only he had chosen a tree near enough to other trees for him to jump across! But he had said hateful things, he had chosen to sit in a tree which stood quite by itself, and Buster Bear could climb! Chatterer was in the worst kind of trouble, and there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> but himself. That is usually the case with those who get into trouble.|$|E

50|$|At {{the ensuing}} inquest, John Scott's chief {{engineer}} {{claimed that the}} disaster was probably caused when {{the base of the}} coffer dam shifted after pilings from the old dock wall were removed, and this event could not have been foreseen. However, this explanation was never independently tested or verified. One man—John Jones, the operator of the piledriving machine used to build the dam—bravely spoke out at the inquest, claiming there had been shoddy workmanship and rotten building materials had been used on the project. But his evidence was disregarded and the jury, heavily influenced by the coroner's summing-up, returned a verdict was that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was <b>to</b> <b>blame.</b> The Vittoria Dock opened for business four months after the disaster and is still in operation today.|$|R
40|$|Walter Kerr, in the May 26 New York Herald Tribune, {{described}} Frank D Gilroy???s ???The Subject was Roses??? as a ???Family Triangle {{in which}} a father loves {{a son and a}} mother loves that son and the son loves both mother and father and not one of them can make a move or utter a sound that does not instantly damage the other. ??? Not so immediately evident but central to the character of Nettie Cleary, the mother, is the underlying tug of war that she has carried on continually with her husband for the emotional custody of their son. At the beginning of the play, she tries to resume her old game of long suffering mother and wife. Her son, Timmy, however, is no longer willing to play the game and tries to show Nettie that he demands of both parents a new game: honesty. Though Nettie flees the house in panic at the prospect of such change, the truth Timmy has placed her with will not go away. When she returns home, it will be with the knowledge that Timmy can only be hers now if she lets him go. By the time the curtain falls, Tom and Nettie can let Timmy move away from home without further alienation. And in the coming of this end, they have achieved an emotional balance, however precarious, that allows Timmy???s final insight: ???When I left this house three years ago, I blamed him for everything that was wrong here???When I came home, I blamed you???. Now I suspect that <b>no</b> <b>one???s</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame,</b> not even me. ??? (See more in text. ...|$|R
