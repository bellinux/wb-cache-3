40|$|Histopathological {{examination}} {{was performed}} on cutaneous biopsies from 900 dogs with skin lesions from Zimbabwe, collected from 1996 to 2000. Clinical {{data were collected from}} medical records. Sixty per cent (540 / 900) of the cases were tumours and 40 % (360 / 900) were non-neoplastic inflammatory or degenerative diseases. Thirty different histological types of tumour were diagnosed. The prevalence of epithelial, mesenchymal, lymphohistiocytic and melanocytic tumours was 39. 4 %, 44. 4 %, 7. 4 % and 8. 7 %, respectively. The 10 most common tumours, comprising 73. 7 % of all cutaneous neoplasms, were mast cell tumours, squamous cell carcinomas, perianal gland adenomas, lymphomas, benign melanomas, haemangiosarcomas, sebaceous gland adenomas, fibrosarcomas, lipomas and malignant melanomas. The prevalence of various neoplasms, age of affected dogs and sites of occurrence were similar to surveys in other countries, except that in Zimbabwe there was a greater prevalence of lymphomas and of tumours associated with increased exposure to ultraviolet light (squamous cell carcinomas, haemangiosarcomas and melanomas). For all classes of tumours the sex of the dog did not have any significant influence on the likelihood of developing a tumour. For a dog diagnosed with a tumour located on the trunk, the tumour was significantly more likely to be an epithelial tumour than a <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumour.</b> The occurrence of melanocytic tumours on the trunk was significantly lower than at other sites. Lymphohistiocytic tumours were 10 times more likely to occur at multiple locations as opposed to single locations...|$|E
40|$|Members of the Dutch {{working group}} on soft tissue tumours {{developed}} an up-to-standard evidence-based multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis of soft tissue tumours and the treatment and follow-up of soft tissue sarcomas, {{in cooperation with the}} Dutch Association of Comprehensive Cancer Centres and the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement. A soft tissue sarcoma is defined as every <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumour</b> that does not originate in haematopoietic or lymphatic system, central nervous system or bone. The guideline lists 'alarm signals' to raise awareness of malignancy and recommends consulting a multidisciplinary team. Non-invasive imaging has to be completed before proceeding to any invasive (diagnostic) procedure or assessment of dissemination. Aspiration cytology can be useful for differentiating between sarcoma and other malignancies. A definite diagnosis is obtained by means of image-guided needle biopsy. Tumours will be classified according to the World Health Organization and graded according to the Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer. Surgical excision with a tumour free margin of 2 cm is the core of therapy, taking into account vital structures when necessary. In case of small superficial tumours (diameter < or = 3 cm) excision biopsy may be justified. Radiotherapy is almost always necessary and certainly indicated when wide margins are impossible even after re-resection. In the case of primary metastatic disease, an individual decision should be taken after multi-disciplinary consultation concerning the possibility of curative or palliative treatment. Neither neo-adjuvant nor adjuvant chemotherapy is standard. Chemotherapy may be useful in metastatic disease. The guideline advises referring patients who are eligible for chemotherapy to a centre and that they should be included in a study protocol...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMalignant primary {{epithelial}} tumours of {{the penis}} are rare and mainly affect uncircumcised {{men in their}} fifties to seventies. They are most frequently located in the glans and foreskin. Imaging is performed if the clinician has doubts about deep extension, after a diagnostic biopsy. High-resolution ultrasound and above all MRI are used to detect invasion of the corpora cavernosa and spongiosum. The lesion is often seen as a moderate T 2 hyposignal, {{making it possible to}} distinguish it from the relative hypersignal of the corpora cavernosa. The sentinel lymph nodes are inguinal. Adenopathy is frequently present, but does not, however, necessarily reflect tumour invasion, as secondary infection of the lesion, which is often ulcerated, is common. The prognosis for T 1 N 0 tumours is good, at the cost of mutilating ablation. Extension to the lymph nodes is detrimental. <b>Non-epithelial</b> <b>tumours</b> and metastases are even rarer...|$|R
40|$|Usually, {{malignant}} melanoma is readily diagnosed {{by the presence}} of melanin granules. Although amelanotic melanoma contains a few melanin granules, {{it is often difficult to}} differentiate from <b>non-epithelial</b> malignant <b>tumours.</b> This report describes a case of amelanotic melanoma of the vagina, which was originally suspected to be a <b>non-epithelial</b> malignant <b>tumour,</b> but was subsequently correctly diagnosed by immunohistochemical staining with the HMB- 45 antibody and for the S- 100 protein. A light grey tumour with superficial ulceration was located in the upper third of the vagina. The patient was treated with irradiation followed by chemotherapy. Subsequently, the tumour disappeared and cytology was negative; thus, she achieved complete remission. However, 20 months after complete remission, the tumour recurred locally: the site had a grossly black appearance, which was pathognomonic for a {{malignant melanoma}}.

40|$|Aims Sex cord stromal tumours (SCSTs) of the ovary {{encompass}} several histological tumour subtypes {{that are}} defined by characteristic histological features. Some can show morphological overlap with other subtypes of SCSTs, {{as well as with}} non-SCSTs. The E-cadherin/catenin complex constitutes the adherens junction, which is well developed in epithelial tissue, but the constituent molecules are also expressed in several <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumours.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the expression patterns of E-cadherin and catenins in ovarian SCSTs can be of diagnostic utility. Methods and results We studied the expression of E-cadherin, α-, β- and γ-catenin in 55 tumours using immunohistochemistry. We found that all tumour subtypes showed nuclear expression of E-cadherin, while only microcystic stromal tumours (MCSTs) displayed a distinct profile, with nuclear localization of all three catenins in almost all cases. Conclusions We conclude that the E-cadherin expression profile in SCSTs can assist in distinguishing between SCSTs and non-SCSTs in which there is no nuclear expression of E-cadherin. The nuclear localization of catenins may be of potential use in distinguishing MCST from other subtypes of SCST...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{reports on the}} {{frequency}} of MDM 2 gene amplification and MDM 2 protein expression {{in a series of}} 100 breast carcinomas and its association with accumulation of the p 53 protein. Of the 100 cases, frozen samples for 82 cases were available for Southern blotting. Three of the 82 (4 %) demonstrated MDM 2 gene amplification of up to 6 -fold. Immunohistochemical analysis of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumours demonstrated that 7 / 97 (7 %) had nuclear expression for MDM 2 in 10 - 50 % of the tumour cells (type 2 staining) and were denoted MDM 2 +. Two of the MDM 2 -amplified samples were MDM 2 + with one of the two tumours also displaying type 2 p 53 nuclear staining. Finally at the protein level, MDM 2 + tumours were significantly associated with tumours having low levels of p 53 staining (0 - 10 % cells positive) (P = 0. 03). We conclude that MDM 2 gene amplification occurs at a lower frequency in breast cancer than in <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumours.</b> Alterations in MDM 2 and p 53 may represent alternative pathways in tumorigenesis, but they are not mutually exclusive in all cases...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest {{over the last}} few years in the protective effect of vitamin A against carcinogenesis. Much of the interest stemmed from the fact that vitamin A has profound effects on the differentiation of epithelium, tissues in which more than 90 % of human malignancies arise. Human studies of vitamin A and cancer have therefore concentrated on epithelial tumours, and a number of case/control studies have demonstrated lower levels of serum retinol and B-carotene in cancer patients (Peto et al., 1981). In addition, 2 prospective studies have shown lower levels of serum retinol in patients subsequently developing cancer (Wald et al., 1980, Kark et al., 1981). However, recent studies have failed to confirm a relationship between serum retinol (Willett et al., 1984; Wald et al., 1984), or retinol binding protein (RBP) and total carotenoids with the subsequent development of tumours (Willett et al., 1984). An alternative explanation for the lower levels is that they are a consequence of the presence of the malignancy, an hypothesis supported by an observed relationship with the stage of the disease (Chaudhy et al., 1980; Tyler 1984). To further investigate the relationship between serum levels of retinol and carotenoids with malignancy we have undertaken a pilot study to determine whether or not similar differences occur in patients with <b>non-epithelial</b> malignant <b>tumours.</b> In addition, we have measured the levels of retinol transport proteins in the serum in order to ascertain whether any observed low values for retinol were due to a dietary vitamin A insufficiency. The study group consisted of 31 patients, 14 male and 17 female, with non-disseminated <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumours</b> admitted for surgery to the Royal Marsden hospital during a 12 month period in 1983 / 1984.

They recognize a stub of delta Di- 4 S and delta Di- 6 S binding to core protein via a linkage tetrasaccharide, respectively. The antibody 6 B 6 raised against dermatan sulphate PG obtained from an ovarian fibroma capsule in our laboratory was also used. The interstitial fibrous elements, so-called 'specific stroma' within the cancer cell nests contained chondroitin 4 -sulphate PG as revealed with 9 A- 2, whereas the surrounding connective tissue and the preexisting fibrous connective tissue involved in the tumour growth consisted of dermatan sulphate PG with {{a considerable amount of}} chondroitin 4 -sulphate PG. Chondroitin 6 -sulphate PG as revealed with 3 B- 3 was located in the connective tissue proliferating from blood vessels and muscle tissue in association with the invasive growth of tumour cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epithelial {{neoplasms}} are uncommon lesions {{affecting the}} sino-nasal tract. There are hardly any {{reports in the}} Indian literature. AIM: To study the incidence, mode of presentation and histological types of sino-nasal epithelial tumours in the surgical pathology material. SETTING AND DESIGN: Retrospective retrieval of all sino-nasal tumours and analysis of epithelial tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All sino-nasal epithelial tumours, biopsied or surgically excised {{over a period of}} ten years, were studied. The tumours were classified as benign or malignant. The histology was correlated with the clinical presentation and investigations. RESULTS: In ten years, there were 120 sino-nasal tumours representing 0. 14 &#x 0025; of all the surgical specimens received. Sixty-nine epithelial tumours (59. 2 &#x 0025;) outnumbered the <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumours</b> and were diagnosed on the basis of histopathology. Twenty were benign and 49 malignant; occurring predominantly in males. Benign lesions included four squamous papillomas and 16 inverted papillomas, with recurrence in three inverted papillomas (21 &#x 0025;). Squamous cell carcinomas were the commonest among malignant tumours and four of these were associated with inverted or cylindrical cell papilloma. The second most frequent malignant tumour was adenoid cystic carcinoma with eight cases. Other rare types included the variants of squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinomas of the non-enteric type, muco-epidermoid carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinomas. CONCLUSION: Sino-nasal epithelial tumours are rare lesions, with male preponderance. Inverted papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas are the most frequent neoplasms...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} reports the induction, histopathology, immunocytochemistry, growth pattern and proliferative {{behaviour}} of mesenchymal tumours of the urinary bladder of rats induced {{by a single}} intravesical dose (5 mg/kg/body weight) of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). In 14 of 283 female Wistar rats (incidence: 4. 9 %). 16 <b>non-epithelial</b> <b>tumours</b> had developed after an experimental period of 14 months. The most common histological type induced was of fibrohistiocytic origin (eight benign-appearing and three malignant fibrous histiocytomas). Furthermore, two pure histiocytomas (one benign and one malignant) and three capillary and cavernous haemangiomas were produced. Since no metastases occurred and no clear-cut distinction between a merely expansive and a truly invasive growth was possible, the diagnosis of malignancy {{was based on the}} degree of cellular atypia and the mitotic activity. The benign-appearing fibrous histiocytomas showed a mean mitotic index of 0. 06 % and the malignant fibrous histiocytomas of 0. 34 %. The mitotic activity of the malignant histiocytoma was threefold (0. 78 %) as high as in the benign-appearing histiocytoma (0. 25 %). There exist close morphological similarities between the induced mesenchymal tumours in the rat and those occurring in the human bladder. Although the spectrum of histological types of mesenchymal tumours seen in the rat bladder was narrower than that encountered in man, MNU seems suitable for further studying the histogenesis, histopathology and biology of experimentally induced non-epithelial bladder neoplasms to gain information for {{a better understanding of the}} pathogenesis of human disease...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the prevalence, histologic types and clinical features of primary epithelial tumours of the vermiform appendix {{in a predominantly}} black population. METHODS: All cases of primary tumours of the appendix identified by review of the histopathology records at the University of the West Indies between January 1987 and June 2007 were selected. Relevant pathologic and clinical data were extracted with supplementation from patient charts where available. <b>Non-epithelial</b> <b>tumours</b> were excluded. The total number of appendectomy specimens over the period was also ascertained. RESULTS: Forty-two primary epithelial tumours were identified out of 6 824 appendectomies yielding a prevalence rate of approximately 0. 62 %. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine cell tumours (carcinoids, 47. 6 %) and benign non-endocrine cell tumours (adenomas, 45. 2 %) were most common with nearly equal frequency. The median age was 43 years, with no sex predilection. Carcinoid tumours occurred in younger patients (mean age 32 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 1. 2 : 1. A clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis {{was the most common}} reason for appendectomy (57. 1 %) and was histologically confirmed in 75 % (18 of 24) of cases. In total, 16. 7 % of cases were diagnosed after incidental appendectomy. CONCLUSION: Appendiceal epithelial tumours are rare in our experience, and are represented principally by carcinoid tumours and adenomas. Carcinoid tumours occurred in younger patients but were slightly more common in men than women. Tumours were not suspected clinically and were diagnosed incidentally in specimens submitted for acute appendicitis supporting the need for histological evaluation in all resection specimens...|$|R

40|$|Ovarian carcinomas {{constitute}} the {{major cause of}} the mortality and morbidity in gynaecology. Most ovary carcinomas are epithelial tumours.

Recent studies using experimental models allow us to better define the fundamental mechanisms of carcinogenesis from the serous ovarian cells and of invasion of the abdominopelvic cavity by proximity. This review article tries to update on epidemiology, genetic syndromes, biology, screening, and therapy of these epithelial tumours, and about the new directions taken by basic and clinical research.

This was an incidental finding discovered during an emergency caesarean section for presumed fetal distress. The majority of ovarian carcinomas diagnosed in pregnancy present at early stages, {{are associated with a}} good prognosis and are <b>non-epithelial</b> type <b>tumours.</b> Advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma diagnosed in pregnancy however is associated with a poor prognosis.

40|$|Gastrointestinal stromal tumours {{are rare}} {{neoplasms}} originating from the connective tissue of {{the digestive tract}} and constitute most of the <b>non-epithelial</b> primitive digestive <b>tumours.</b> The origin from the interstitial cell of Cajal is appreciated because of this tumours constantly present {{the expression of the}} surface antigens CD 34 and CD 117 which can be determined immunohistochemistry. In the majority of cases, GISTs are symptomatic and symptoms are most commonly related to mass effect or bleeding. Asymptomatic GISTs are often found incidentally on physical examination, radiologic imaging, endoscopy, laparotomy or laparoscopy. US endoscopy and fine needle aspiration with subsequent immunohistochemistry analysis afford the best diagnostic accuracy. In primary and localized GISTs surgery is always indicated and laparoscopic technique is feasible and is recommended as the treatment of choice for all the patients. Imatinib should be started in metastatic or recurrent disease and neoadjuvant imatinib is also experimental, although its use may be justified in unresectable or marginally resectable GIST. Sunitinib has recently been approved for patients with GIST principally those who fail imatinib therapy. Our experience is based on the study of 7 GISTs: only in 2 cases the neoplasm was found occasionally; in the other, symptoms were related to mass effect or bleeding. Laparoscopic tumour resection was then performed in all the patients.

40|$|Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) {{are rare}} {{neoplasms}} originating from connective {{tissue in the}} digestive tract with an incidence of less than 1 % and account for most <b>non-epithelial</b> primitive digestive <b>tumours.</b> Metastasis diagnosed {{at the time of}} disease discovery confirms GIST malignancy. Kit protein, a trans-membrane tyrosine kinase receptor of staminal cells, is characteristically expressed by GIST. Most GIST have a mutation in the kit proto-oncogene. Resistance to conventional chemotherapy is commonly shown by malignant GIST. Most patients with advanced malignant GIST achieve clinical benefit with imatinib mesilate, an orally administered selective inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase receptor. We treated a 43 -year-old male patient suffering from a gastric GIST diagnosed during a surgical emergency operation for peritonitis caused by gastric perforation. At {{the time of the first}} operation the patient had lost 10 kg body weight over the previous months and was seriously cachectic. During the emergency operation the perforation was sutured. The biopsy results showed the presence of CD 1 17 (c-kit) and CD 34 markers. A total body CT scan documented the substantial size of the gastric wall lesion, an increased volume of abdominal lymph nodes and compression of the splenic vein with alternative collateral circulation. The liver presented no less than 5 large metastases distributed in both the left and right lobes. There was also a pulmonary metastasis. Because of frequent spontaneous bleeding and starvation the patient was seriously anaemic. Considering the action mechanism of imatinib and the extent of the lesion we decided to perform a total gastrectomy procedure. At the time of the operation the stomach seemed to have a modified volume and shape: it appeared to be divided into two sacs, the larger and deeper of which was the original gastric cavity, while the superficial, smaller one seemed to be a protrusion of the organ. The stomach was indistinguishable from the spleen, the transverse colon and the distal pancreatic tract. The neoplasm was directly linked to the left liver and to the inferior diaphragmatic surface. We performed total gastrectomy and resection of the tail of the pancreas, the spleen, and the transverse colon all in one and the same session. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8 and commenced imatinib therapy 30 days after the operation with 4 tablets per day. In the following months the patient repeated the CT scan to monitor the progressive volume reduction of the liver and lung lesions and a PET scan confirmed that the lesions were not active; the patient experienced a 13 kg body weight increase.
