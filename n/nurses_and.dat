Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Abstract Clinical teachers’ {{experiences}} of <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> teaching Clinical <b>nurse</b> teachers’ {{experiences of}} <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> teaching undergraduate <b>nursing</b> students on clinical placement are explored {{in this thesis}} {{because of concerns about}} the quality of nursing students’ learning outcomes. The aim was to identify variation in clinical teachers’ conceptions of <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> their conceptions of, and approaches to teaching undergraduate nursing students. The study was significant because clinical teachers’ conceptions of <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> approaches to clinical teaching have not been researched previously. Underpinning the study was a phenomenographic perspective on learning and teaching. This perspective views learning and teaching in terms of how they were experienced. Experience of <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> clinical teaching, for example, can be understood in terms of related ‘what’ and ‘how’ aspects. The ‘what’ aspect concerns how <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> clinical teaching were understood. The ‘how’ aspect is concerned the ways <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> clinical teaching were approached. Experience of <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> clinical teaching were described and analysed in terms of the separate ‘what’ and ‘how’ aspects and are understood in terms of the relationship between each of the aspects. Data from semi-structured interviews with twenty clinical teachers were analysed using phenomenographic research techniques (Marton & Booth, 1997) in order to identify variation in how <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> clinical teaching were experienced. To extend the description, the research also sought to identify the empirical relationships between each of the aspects investigated. Key aspects of variation in clinical teacher experiences of <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> clinical teaching and associated relationships have been identified. The results suggest that clinical teachers who adopted a student-centred approach to teaching conceived of <b>nursing</b> <b>and</b> clinical teaching in complex ways. The phenomenographic approach provides for an experiential and holistic account of clinical teaching: a perspective absent in nursing education research literature. The research findings extend knowledge that will assist with preparation and support of clinical teachers...|$|R

5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, <b>nurses</b> <b>and</b> other participants.

Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her research work. Adding to the difficulty of the situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a home economics program.|$|E
