40|$|Abstract Three {{cases of}} wave {{propagation}} involving possible superluminal speeds are discussed. The picture that emerges {{is that the}} actual propagation velocity of the wave front <b>never</b> <b>exceeds</b> the <b>speed</b> of light in vacuum. However, once the wave front has reached some distant point in space, then propagation may actually seem to take place along this wave with superluminal speed, yet involving no conflict with special relativity. Quantum entanglement – Einstein’s “spooky action at a distance ” – is one famous, and now experimentally verified example of propagation at such apparent superluminal speed, but which is here explained {{within the framework of}} special relativity. This then at the same time also leads to {{a deeper understanding of the}} limitation of the recently proposed clock-hypothesis in special relativity, and also provides an illustration of the mechanism involved in wave-particle duality...|$|R
40|$|Ever since Einstein’s special {{relativity}} in 1905, {{the principle of}} invariant light speed in vacuum has been attracting attention {{from a wide range}} of disciplines. How to interpret the principle of light speed? Is light referred to continuous light, or light pulse with definite boundaries? Recent discovery of superluminal medium triggered vigorous discussion within the Physics community. Can communication via such “superluminal channel” break the speed limit and thus violate causality principle? Or, will a single photon, which is not governed by classical laws of Physics, tend to break the speed limit? To solve these problems, in this Brief we bring in optical precursor, the theoretical works for which started as early as 1914. This is a typical optical phenomenon combining wave propagation theory and light-wave interaction. Both theory and experimental works are covered in this Brief. The study of precursor verifies that the effective information carried by light pulses can <b>never</b> <b>exceed</b> the <b>speed</b> of light in vacuum- c. Further, through observation from nonclassical single photon source, the precursor rules out the probability of a single photon traveling with the speed, breaking the classical limit...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} approximation, the Universe 2 ̆ 7 s {{expansion}} {{is described by}} the Hubble 2 ̆ 7 s law v = H * R, according to which the relative speed v of two objects in the expanding Universe grows linearly with the distance R between them. This law {{can be derived from}} the Copernican principle, according to which, cosmology-wise, there is no special location in the Universe, and thus, the expanding Universe should look the same from every starting point. The problem with the Hubble 2 ̆ 7 s formula is that for large distance, it leads to non-physical larger-than-speed-of-light velocities. Since the Universe 2 ̆ 7 s expansion is a consequence of Einstein 2 ̆ 7 s General Relativity Theory (GRT), this problem is usually handled by taking into account GRT 2 ̆ 7 s curved character of space-time. In this paper, we consider this problem from a purely kinematic viewpoint. We show that if we take into account special-relativistic effects when applying the Copernican principle, we get {{a modified version of the}} Hubble 2 ̆ 7 s law in which all the velocities are physically meaningful [...] in the sense that they <b>never</b> <b>exceed</b> the <b>speed</b> of light...|$|R
5000|$|According to Flight Global, unnamed Israeli {{experts say}} the [...] "indigenous fighter jet" [...] Iran {{presented}} on 2 February {{is nothing more than}} a [...] "very sleek plastic model". Further, the canopy appears to be constructed of [...] "basic plastic," [...] the air intakes are unusually small, and [...] "The whole impression is of some plastic parts pasted to an old flying platform." [...] One expert says the cockpit and ejection seat seem real, but the Qaher-313 displayed seemed too small to be a capable fighter. A photo of the cockpit shows a simple glass cockpit design using civilian avionics from Dynon Avionics and Garmin which are normally found on much less sophisticated general aviation aircraft. The markings on the backup airspeed indicator in this photo seem unrealistic, suggesting a stall speed in landing configuration of merely 70 knots and a <b>never</b> <b>exceed</b> <b>speed</b> of about 260 knots; values more likely to be found on a small turboprop aircraft. Video footage showing the plane airborne could have been a radio-controlled model aircraft. Poor-quality footage posted on the internet provided no sense of scale for the platform being flown, and also failed to show its take-off or landing. Its stealth claims have also been called into question, having no visible weapons carrying capability, either internally or externally. Iran has stated that the videos are of small radio controlled jet and propeller models and not the full size airplane. Furthermore the animation provided by the designers shows two internal weapons bay under the wings.|$|E
40|$|We study {{thermodynamic}} {{properties of the}} multiquark nuclear matter. The dependence of the equation of state on the colour charges is explored both analytically and numerically in the limits where the baryon density is small and large at fixed temperature between the gluon deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration. The gravitational stability of the hypothetical multiquark stars are discussed using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. Since the equations of state of the multiquarks can be well approximated by different power laws for small and large density, {{the content of the}} multiquark stars has the core and crust structure. We found that most of the mass of the star comes from the crust region where the density is relatively small. The mass limit of the multiquark star is determined as well as its relation to the star radius. For typical energy density scale of 10 GeV/fm^ 3, the converging mass and radius of the hypothetical multiquark star in the limit of large central density are approximately 2. 6 - 3. 9 solar mass and 15 - 27 km. The adiabatic index and sound speed distributions of the multiquark matter in the star are also calculated and discussed. The sound <b>speed</b> <b>never</b> <b>exceeds</b> the <b>speed</b> of light and the multiquark matters are thus compressible even at high density and pressure.

40|$|A central {{feature of}} the most {{elementary}} rotating black hole (BH) solution in general relativity is the Kerr bound which, for vacuum Kerr BHs, can be expressed either {{in terms of the}} Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) or horizon "charges. " However, this bound is not a fundamental property of general relativity and stationary, asymptotically flat, and regular (on and outside an event horizon) BHs are known to violate the Kerr bound, in terms of both their ADM and horizon quantities. Examples include the recently discovered Kerr BHs with scalar [C. A. R. Herdeiro and E. Radu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 221101 (2014) ] or Proca hair [C. Herdeiro, E. Radu, and H. Runarsson, arXiv: 1603. 02687]. Here, we point out the fact that the Kerr bound in terms of horizon quantities is also violated by well-known rotating and charged solutions which are known in closed form, such as the Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen BHs. Moreover, for the former we observe that the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) bound is also violated in terms of horizon quantities, even in the static (i. e., RN) limit. By contrast, for the latter the existence of charged matter outside the horizon allows for a curious invariance of the charge-to-mass ratio between the ADM and horizon quantities. Regardless of the Kerr bound violation, we show that in all cases the event horizon linear velocity [C. A. R. Herdeiro and E. Radu, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 24, 1544022 (2015) ] <b>never</b> <b>exceeds</b> the <b>speed</b> of light. Finally, we suggest a new type of informative parametrization for BH spacetimes where part of the asymptotic charge is supported outside the horizon...|$|R
40|$|We present {{preliminary}} results and interpretations for Mars Atmospheric and Volatile EvolutioN,(MAVEN) observations of magnetosheath-ionospheric boundary oscillations at Mars. Using centrifugal force arguments, we first predict that a signature of fully rolled up Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices at Mars is sheath ions {{that have a}} bulk motion toward the Sun.
