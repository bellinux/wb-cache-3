Caustic (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) will be used to treat the H 2 S produced from the geothermal well because caustic has a high affinity for hydrogen sulfide. Brewer Chemical Company has been contacted, and they have provided assurance that caustic is available on the Big Island in the necessary quantities. Brewer has a bulk terminal in Hilo with approximately 100, 000 gallons of storage capacity. Brewer will deliver caustic to the drill site in a 50 % solution in 3500 gallon tanker trucks. In addition to caustic, hydrogen peroxide is sometimes used to convert the sodium sulfide into sodium sulfate. Hydrogen peroxide does not react directly with H 2 S, rather it tranforms the treated compound to a more stable form. Peroxide will not be used unless it becomes necessary.

40|$|The recent {{awareness}} in human safety and environmental conservation has created fresh enthusiasm for natural sources of pigments. Compared to synthetic pigments, microbial pigments shows better biodegradability and higher compatibility with the environment, and have numerous applications from food to cosmetics. Identification of new microbial sources, utilization of low cost substrates and optimization of process parameters are the areas under focus towards economical pigment production. The present study aimed at screening and identification of microbial isolates from soil and water, which are having pigment producing ability. Efforts {{have been made}} to cultivate them on numerous cheaper and inexpensive substrates with <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>conditions</b> and supplements for effective pigment production. Furthermore, two carotenoid producing strains were also exploited on numerous inexpensive substrates at ambient conditions for pigment metabolites. While analyzing pigment metabolites in all cases, key parameters influencing pigment production by respective strains were optimized by utilizing statistical techniques like Taguchi method and response surface approaches wherever needed. The conditions for enhanced pigment production were established employing microbial isolates and purchase strains individually. The melanin producing Pseudomonas guinea, (bacterial strain) was isolated from marine water sample and was employed on vegetable waste for effective pigment production. Another strain of Bacillus safensis was isolated from garden soil and showed its ability to produce melanin on fruit waste extract (FWE). It is noteworthy that both melanins produced from marine and soil isolates showed antioxidant, photoprotective and metal ion chelation activities. Addressing garden soil, a new carotenoid producing bacterial strain Bacillus clausii was screened and cultivated on FWE for high yield pigment production. The pigment produced by this strain was observed to be a β-carotenoid type and its stability towards thermal treatment was also evaluated. Eying on the significance of carotenoids, microorganisms (Rhodotorula rubra, Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous) in their developmental stage were purchased and studied for pigment production on various residues as sole substrates. The obtained yeasts showed improved carotenoids yield i. e. torularhodin and astaxanthin respectively on FWE.

40|$|International audienceVolcanic eruptions involve {{high-speed}} turbulent {{flows of}} gas and magma mixtures in which peak gas velocities often approach 600 m s− 1. Such speeds are well {{in excess of the}} slow mixture sound speeds of approximately 150 m s− 1 predicted by pseudo-gas theory, in which the gas and magma phases are assumed to be locked to each other; eruptions thus appear to be highly super-sonic. Indeed, flow in the volcanic conduit will choke when it reaches the sound speed and to attain supersonic velocities one must invoke special conduit nozzle shapes. However, the pseudo-gas approximation is a long-wavelength assumption, while choking and acoustic shocks are a short-wavelength effect; thus, the approximation is likely inapplicable for the choking phenomenon. To allow for non-pseudo-gas effects, such as phase separation, in the short-wavelength limit requires a more complete treatment of two-phase eruptions. We therefore develop and explore a model for two-phase, high Reynolds number flow of a compacting suspension of magma particles in a compressible gas. Flow properties, such as mixture density, are controlled both by gas content as well as gas compressibility, both of which vary according to different processes of compaction and compression, respectively. The two phases of the mixture separate because of their different densities, and the interaction forces (turbulent drag and inertial exchange) can be complex. The model is used to examine acoustic-porosity wave propagation and the development of shocks or choking structures in a volcanic conduit. Sound waves in separable mixtures are highly dispersive with fast waves propagating at the pure gas sound speed at small wavelengths, slow waves travelling at the pseudo-gas speed at long wavelengths, and pure attenuation and sound blocking at intermediate wavelengths. As shock fronts in gas density develop they become increasingly short wavelength features and thus will only cause choking if the maximum speed in the flow reaches the pure gas sound speed. Non-linear, finite-amplitude steady-state models of eruptions in a volcanic conduit show that compaction occurs over the magma particle gravitational deceleration height, and either suppresses gas expansion for fast eruptions, or isopycnally collapses the gas volume near the base of the erupting column for slow eruptions. Once compaction ceases, the gas expands toward a shock structure or choking point, which is coincident with a rapid gas acceleration and a high-speed vent eruption. Increased turbulent drag between the gas and particles suppresses compaction effects but greatly sharpens the shock front at the choking point. Although the standard pseudo-gas models predict such choking to occur at low velocities, the full two-phase theory always has choking occur when the gas reaches the pure gas sound speed, in keeping with the sound-speed dispersion analysis. Therefore, the full two-phase theory predicts choking to occur at the pure gas sound speed, which (for water vapour at the relevant high temperatures) is about 700 m s− 1. Eruption velocities of 600 m s− 1 are therefore fully consistent with the limit imposed by this choking condition, and <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>conditions</b> to obtain supersonic eruptions, such as nozzled conduit geometries, are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Tamoxifen, a {{selective}} estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, {{is widely used}} {{in the treatment of}} ER-positive breast cancer. It has been used for over 40 years and has dramatically reduced recurrence and mortality rates of ER-positive breast cancer patients. However, not all patients benefit from tamoxifen treatment as in about 25 - 30 % of the patients the disease recurs. There is an urgent need to gain insight into factors that are predictive for treatment outcome, however, until today the mechanisms of this variable response remain unclear. Studies on the pharmacology of tamoxifen revealed extensive biotransformation and showed that some of its metabolites, especially 4 -hydroxytamoxifen and N-desmethyl- 4 -hydroxytamoxifen (endoxifen), have a much higher affinity for the ER than tamoxifen itself. Endoxifen is suggested {{to be the most important}} metabolite, considering it is present at a much higher steady-state serum concentration in patients using tamoxifen than 4 -hydroxytamoxifen. There is wide inter-patient variability in tamoxifen pharmacokinetics, however, in general all patients use a standard dose of 20 mg tamoxifen per day. These findings provide a new possibility for treatment optimization; individual dosing based on active metabolites levels. The results of a recent large clinical trial encouraged this optimization option; a significant correlation between endoxifen serum levels and breast cancer recurrence rate was shown and a minimum therapeutic threshold endoxifen serum level was suggested. To enable dose individualization, a sensitive and selective method for the quantitative analysis of tamoxifen and its metabolites in patient serum samples was developed. Subsequently, this method was implemented in clinical practice and used to support clinical studies. Considerable inter-patient variability, but low intra-patient variability, in systemic exposure of tamoxifen and its metabolites was observed. Additionally, it was shown that the prescribed tamoxifen dose was related to endoxifen exposure and that increasing the tamoxifen dose leads to a significantly higher serum concentration of tamoxifen and its metabolite. To ease sampling logistics and as a patient-friendly alternative to venous sampling, a dried blood spot (DBS) method for quantification of tamoxifen and endoxifen was developed. DBS sampling consists of the collection of a whole blood sample, obtained by a finger prick, on a paper DBS card. DBS samples can be transported by regular mail service, since <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>conditions</b> for transport and storage of the samples are required. To enable the use of DBS in clinical practice, a bridging study was performed to establish the relationship between DBS and serum concentrations of tamoxifen and endoxifen. After correction for haematocrit and analyte-specific blood cell-to-serum ratio, DBS concentrations were equal to serum concentrations. Additionally, patients were shown to be capable of collecting DBS by themselves at home and they stated to prefer this sampling method over venous sampling. These findings enable DBS sampling at home for the determination of tamoxifen and endoxifen in patient samples, for clinical studies and therapeutic drug monitoring purposes. The insights generated in this thesis could be used to further individualize and optimize tamoxifen treatment, and could be used as a starting point for further research on the association between active metabolite levels and treatment outcome...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates, {{within a}} minimalist {{framework}} (Chomsky (1993 et seq.)), {{some of the}} properties of "subjects". It is demonstrated that the term "subject" picks out whatever element occupies the highest argumental position within its clause at LF, following reconstruction effects. [...] In Chapter One, several recent analyses of certain "non-finite" clauses in the ergative Inuktitut/West Greenlandic languages and Lezgian are examined. I conclude that, in each case, the clauses in question are finite. It is proposed that the conspicuous absence, or near-absence, of non-finite control structures in ergative languages derives {{from the fact that}} arguments licensed as PRO in such languages do not typically occupy a position where they can be controlled by an element in a higher clause. I consider one strategy made use of by the (ergative) Mayan language Jacaltec to make such clauses possible. [...] In Chapter Two, standard assumptions with respect to a 'subject/object' extractability asymmetry are reconsidered, in light of data from English. It is shown that A'-extraction of 'subjects' of unaccusative or passive VPs is not as sensitive to intervening islands as is extraction of 'subjects' of transitive or unergative VPs. This follows, I demonstrate, from the requirement that both types of arguments raise overtly to an A'-position prior to extraction, attracted by an [event] feature of the C head, with the former type of argument necessarily raising via an intermediate A-position, while the latter type must raise directly. Second, two non-finite constructions — one in Italian and another in European Portuguese - are considered. The interaction of the proposed [event] feature of C⁰ with certain other features is shown to derive both fixed word-ordering restrictions and the unexpected availability of 'nominative' Case in these clauses in both languages. [...] In Chapter Three, I offer a preliminary analysis which derives 'accusative' versus 'ergative' Case checking patterns in strict terms of Economy, depending on the strength of certain features. I show that <b>no</b> <b>special</b> <b>condition,</b> like the Obligatory Case Parameter (Bobaljik (1993)), need be introduced to derive the differences between the Case patterns of accusative and ergative languages...|$|R

Although middle T-transformed cells grow as tumors when transplanted into nude mice or syngeneic rats, the middle T gene alone is totally inactive when used in a more stringent and rigorous assay for tumorigenicity such as the injection of DNA into newborn rats. Thus, functions other than those expressed by middle T antigen are required for the elaboration of all the properties associated with tumorigenesis. To assess whether a complementary function could be exerted by the large or the small T antigen, we constructed plasmids containing two modified early regions which independently encoded middle T {{and one of the}} two other proteins.

For R. solanacearum, QIF was used to determine the amount of β-galactosidase protein within wild-type cells containing a stable eps-lacZ reporter allele. When cultured cells were examined to test the method, QIF accurately detected both low and high levels of eps gene expression. QIF analysis of R. solanacearum cells recovered from stems of infected tomato plants showed that expression of eps during pathogenesis was similar to that in culture. These results suggest that there are <b>no</b> <b>special</b> signals or <b>conditions</b> within plants that override or short-circuit the regulatory processes observed in R. solanacearum in culture. Because QIF is a robust, relatively simple procedure that uses generally accessible equipment, it should be useful in many situations where gene expression in single bacterial cells must be determined...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has focused mainly on determining the effectiveness of suspended sentences compared with other sentences, and seldom on understanding {{to what extent the}} different types of suspended sentences reduce recidivism rates. This study examined reconviction rates of offenders (N = 1, 258) who received fully or partly suspended prison sentences, with or without <b>special</b> <b>conditions,</b> in 2006 in two of the largest court districts in the Netherlands. Cox proportional hazard models revealed no difference in reconviction rates between fully and partly suspended prison sentences, with and without <b>special</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, suspended sentences without <b>special</b> <b>conditions</b> had significantly lower reconviction rates compared with <b>special</b> <b>conditions</b> that were solely control-orientated. Although there are indications that certain types of suspended sentences reduced reconviction rates more than other types, more rigorous research is still required...|$|R
