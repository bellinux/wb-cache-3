5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team <b>noticed</b> <b>some</b> fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{winter of}} 1922–23, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{selected}} {{a team to}} tour Australia and New Zealand. This side, captained by Archie MacLaren and composed mainly of amateurs, was not particularly strong and contained several players chosen for their social standing rather than cricketing ability. The team played four first-class games in Australia against state teams; the first was drawn {{and the others were}} lost. After scores of 75 and 58 against Western Australia, Chapman played consecutive innings of 53, 73 and 69 against South Australia and Victoria, followed by 100 in the most eagerly awaited match of the tour against a strong New South Wales side. The press and public praised his attacking batting and his fielding, although Frank Iredale, a former Test cricketer, <b>noticed</b> <b>some</b> flaws in his technique. When the team moved on to New Zealand, after an uncertain start Chapman scored 533 runs at an average of 48.45, including two centuries. The tourists returned to Australia for the last leg of the tour; Chapman scored 91 against New South Wales and 134 in 142 minutes against South Australia. In all the Australian games, he totalled 782 runs at 65.16; in all the matches on tour he had 1,315 runs at an average of 57.15.|$|E

5|$|The Via Panisperna boys also <b>noticed</b> <b>some</b> unexplained effects. The {{experiment}} {{seemed to}} work better on a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons, {{so he decided to}} try that. When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. He developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.|$|E

25|$|A {{year before}} the flight, Aaron had been observing a test at Kennedy Space Center when he had <b>noticed</b> <b>some</b> unusual {{telemetry}} readings. On his own initiative, he traced this anomaly back to the obscure Signal Conditioning Electronics (SCE) system, {{and became one of}} the few flight controllers who was familiar with the system and its operations. For the case that first drew his attention to the system, normal readings could be restored by putting the SCE on its auxiliary setting, which meant that it would operate even with low-voltage conditions.|$|E
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly <b>noticed</b> <b>some</b> inconsistencies in his story. The man said he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 24 June, a 10-men team led by Subedar Harnam Singh was sent out. Another team led by Subedar Sansar Chand {{followed}} it at a distance. A third team led by Naib Subedar Bana Singh was kept as a reserve force to be deployed in case the first assault team was stalled due to enemy fire. Harnam Singh's team managed to find the rope and the dead bodies of Pande's patrol. The Indian soldiers started climbing the ice wall. They had barely covered a distance of 50 m, when their scout Naik Tara Chand <b>noticed</b> <b>some</b> movement in the front. Alerted by Tara Chand, the Indian soldiers started moving down. But before they could take up the firing positions, the Pakistanis opened fire with medium machine guns. Tara Chand and two others were killed instantaneously. The troops following them were unable to fire back as their weapons had jammed in the -25°C temperature. Later, the Indians found that the Pakistanis were heating their weapons with a kerosene stove kept below the weapon. Harnam Singh's men first took shelter behind icicles, and then hurriedly dug shallow trenches in the ice. The Indian artillery designated to cover them {{could not be used}} to full extent, as there was danger of them being hurt. Ultimately, the attack had to be abandoned.|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were the}} most praised aspect of the game. Ryan Davis of GameSpot said that the visuals were [...] "gorgeous" [...] and breathtaking to look at, both in ship designs and details of the tracks. However, Davis noted that the game never remains at a [...] "solid" [...] 60 frames per second, which can cause occasional fluctuation. A reviewer of GamePro similarly praised the visuals as breathtaking, stating that the [...] "beautiful" [...] panoramic scenery defied the notion of usual graphics displayed on a handheld console. Ryan O'Donnell of IGN considered the graphics to be the strongest aspect of the game, saying that its courses, weapon detail and ship designs were [...] "beautiful". However, O'Donnell found that occasional framerate issues kept it from [...] "perfection". Daniel Chang of GameSpy opinionated that the visuals were [...] "well-crafted as any video game or feature film". John Davison of 1UP stated that both the game's presentation and graphics were stunning and [...] "absolutely beautiful".

500|$|The {{video was}} also heavily {{compared}} to works by 1980s pop artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson.

MTV's Kyle Anderson found references to Madonna's 1996 film Evita and the music videos for her songs [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "Vogue."

[...] The magazine believed that the [...] "Alejandro" [...] was so similar to Madonna's work because director Steven Klein had closely worked with Madonna prior to shooting [...] "Alejandro." [...] Devon Thomas from CBS News said the [...] "Madonna-isms run high in the clip." [...] He noted Gaga's short, cropped hair and black blazer [...] "set against the stark, post-industrialist mood of the [...] clip" [...] was similar to [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and the machine-gun bra in the video {{was similar to the}} cone bra Madonna sported in [...] "Vogue." [...] He also compared the video to Madonna's early Blond Ambition World Tour era by saying that [...] " [...] is a visual love letter to [...] ". New York said the video [...] "reeked" [...] of Madonna. James Montgomery of MTV News defended Gaga against the Madonna comparisons, saying, [...] "Just to say, 'Oh, 'cause it's in black and white and she has a bowl haircut at one point, it's Madonna,' that's sort of selling their vision short." [...] He also said that the music video for [...] "Alejandro" [...] is [...] "not the best video in the world." [...] In an article for The Sunday Times, Camille Paglia wrote [...] "Gaga has borrowed so heavily from Madonna (as in her latest video-Alejandro) that it must be asked, at what point does homage become theft?" ...|$|E
