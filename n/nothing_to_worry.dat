5|$|Writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{of the show}} TGS with Tracy Jordan have decided to rig the TGS auditions—in which they are {{in search of a}} new cast member on the show—by planning to add bad actors so that their preferred choice, Jayden Michael Tyler (Nick Fondulis), gets hired by their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). TGS cast member Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that the auditions are taking place and worries that her position on the show will be lessened with the arrival of a new actor. Although Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the star of the show, reassures Jenna that the two have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about, she remains uneasy. Later, Jenna discovers that Liz and Pete want Jayden to be cast, but she pleads with Liz to pull Jayden out of his audition. Jenna hates him for humiliating her after working together on a play, but Liz does not change her mind about Jayden. Jenna eventually figures out what Liz and Pete are scheming, so she and Tracy go out and find people (Angela Grovey and David Perlman) and bring them to the TGS auditions.|$|E

25|$|The 1,000-man {{battalion}} of the Loyal Lusitanian Legion sustained losses of three officers and 103 men killed, five officers and 143 men wounded, and 15 men missing. Militia losses were not stated. The dismounted gun was abandoned. French losses are unknown. Victor saw for himself that Mayne's small force {{was not the}} threat he had supposed. The French pressed {{only a few miles}} beyond Alcántara, but this alarmed Mackenzie who believed he was about to be attacked. Wellesley reassured his subordinate that he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about, that Victor could not spare enough soldiers to present a real threat to his position behind the Zêzere River. After spending three days near Alcántara, Victor withdrew to Torremocha. While Victor was away, Cuesta sent a force against Mérida. The raid failed to dislodge two battalions of Jean Francois Leval's German division from a fortified convent.|$|E

25|$|The game {{begins with}} the Romans under attack by the Amazons, and {{on the brink of}} defeat. They barely survive, and the Amazons next attack the Asians and Egyptians in turn, {{prompting}} Jupiter, Horus and Ch'ih-yu to ally. In the newly renamed 2 Gorgons, they meet to discuss strategy, fully aware that the Gorgons, Q'nqüra's aunts, are spying on them, and feeding details of their plan to Q'nqüra. Meanwhile, the men launch an all-out offensive, although Helios is worried that Q'nqüra's response is too subdued, and she must have a plan. His concerns are ignored, however, as the others assure him that because their enemy is a woman, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about. Confidant that the Amazons are nearly defeated, Jupiter leaves Horus to fight on, whilst he pillages both Egyptian and Amazonian lands. Disgusted, Horus withdraws from the fight, and Jupiter, in a temper, cuts off his own troops, leaving Ch'ih-yu to see out the conflict alone.|$|E
25|$|Fry's {{career in}} {{television}} {{began with the}} 1982 broadcasting of The Cellar Tapes, the 1981 Cambridge Footlights Revue which was written by Fry, Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson and Tony Slattery. The revue {{caught the attention of}} Granada Television, who, keen to replicate the success of the BBC's Not the Nine O'Clock News, hired Fry, Laurie and Thompson to star alongside Ben Elton in There's <b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>Worry</b> About!. A second series, retitled Alfresco, was broadcast in 1983, and a third in 1984; it established Fry and Laurie's reputation as a comedy double act. In 1983, the BBC offered Fry, Laurie and Thompson their own show, which became The Crystal Cube, a mixture of science fiction and mockumentary that was cancelled after the first episode. Undeterred, Fry and Laurie appeared in an episode of The Young Ones in 1984, and Fry also appeared in Ben Elton's 1985 Happy Families series. In 1986 and 1987 Fry and Laurie performed sketches on the LWT/Channel 4 show Saturday Live.|$|E
500|$|Thompson had {{her first}} {{professional}} role in 1982, touring in a stage version of Not the Nine O'Clock News. She then turned to television, where much of her early work came with her Footlights co-stars Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. The regional ITV comedy series [...] There's <b>Nothing</b> <b>To</b> <b>Worry</b> About! (1982) was their first outing, followed by the one-off BBC show The Crystal Cube (1983). There's <b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>Worry</b> About! later returned as the networked sketch show Alfresco (1983–84), which ran for two series with Thompson, Fry, Laurie, Ben Elton, and Robbie Coltrane. She later collaborated again with Fry and Laurie on the acclaimed BBC Radio 4 series Saturday Night Fry (1988).|$|E

One survivor reported going to the fire department to be informed that the ash was [...] "nothing".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} 1987 about the {{suitability}} of a film-like rating system for video games, {{a representative of the}} Software Publishers Association said that [...] "Adult computer software is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about. It's not an issue that the government wants to spend any time with ... They just got done with a big witchhunt in the music recording industry, and they got absolutely nowhere".

500|$|Stossel {{challenges}} {{the notion that}} man-made global warming would have net negative consequences, pointing to assertedly warmer periods in human history. Central to his argument {{is the idea that}} groups and individuals get much more public attention, donations, and government funding when they proclaim [...] "this will be terrible" [...] than groups that say [...] "this is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about." [...] He points to groups like the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and to activists such as Rachel Carson and ...|$|E

500|$|The tank {{scene was}} created {{completely}} using CGI. The only actual footage {{from the scene}} was the background. A computer-generated tank, along with women, were designed on a computer. Then, special effects shots of smoke and explosions were layered {{on top of the}} vehicle to give it a more life-like appearance. Bruce Harwood, who portrayed Byers, noted that the action sequences in the episode were a challenge. He explained, [...] "It's pretty difficult on a set when the stuntmen come up to you and go, 'Don't worry, you'll be safe, <b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about. Okay. Everyone put their safety glasses on.'" ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{shooting}} of the video, Shakur was engaged in an argument with someone, who was heard telling him [...] "You'll get shot." [...] His armed bodyguard assured {{him that he had}} <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about. He also broke up a fight involving his friend Muta during the filming, and fired a production assistant on set. The assistant was answering Shakur's pager and returning his personal calls without his consent. Many callers were confused or angry that a female assistant was answering Shakur's calls. The assistant had mistakenly lost the pager, and with Shakur already growing wary of her, fired her for that reason.|$|E
500|$|In November 1919, Ueshiba {{learned that}} his father Yoroku was ill, and was not {{expected}} to survive. Leaving most of his possessions to Takeda, Ueshiba left Shirataki with the apparent intention of returning to Tanabe to visit his ailing parent. En route he made a detour to Ayabe, near Kyoto, intending to visit Onisaburo Deguchi, the spiritual leader of the Ōmoto-kyō religion (Ueshiba's nephew Noriaki Inoue had already joined the religion and may have recommended it to his uncle). Ueshiba stayed at the Ōmoto-kyō headquarters for several days, and met with Deguchi, who told him that, [...] "There is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about with your father". On his return to Tanabe, Ueshiba found that Yoroku had died. Criticised by family and friends for arriving too late to see his father, Ueshiba went into the mountains with a sword and practised kenjutsu for several days; this almost led to his arrest when the police were informed of a sword-wielding madman on the loose.|$|E

500|$|On 31 March 1945, Galland flew 12 {{operational}} jets to Munich {{to begin}} operations. On 5 April, he organised the interception of a USAAF raid. The Me 262s destroyed three B-17s. On 16 April Galland claimed two Martin B-26 Marauder bombers shot down. On 21 April, to his surprise, he was visited by Göring {{for the final}} time. Göring officially assigned Günther Lützow to him and confessed to Galland that his assertions about the Me 262 {{and the use of}} bomber pilots with experience as jet fighter pilots had been correct. He enquired about the progress of his unit with outspoken civility. As they parted, Göring said, [...] "I envy you Galland, for going into action. I wish I were a few years younger and less bulky. If I were, I would gladly put myself under your command. It would be marvelous to have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about but a good fight, like it was in the old days." ...|$|E
500|$|Four battalions of rebel troops moved {{before dawn}} from the Mekong Delta towards Saigon, using armored {{personnel}} carriers and jeeps carrying machine guns. After cowing several police checkpoints {{on the edge of}} the capital with threats of machine-gun and artillery fire, the plotters put rebel sentries in their place to seal off Saigon from incoming or outgoing traffic. They then captured communication facilities in the capital, including the post office, to prevent messages from being sent in or out. As his troops took over the city, Phát sat in a civilian vehicle and placidly said [...] "We'll be holding a press conference in town this afternoon at 4 p.m." [...] He said [...] "This is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about. Just a little operation against some politicians." [...] The rebels set up their command post in the Saigon home of General Duong Ngoc Lam, who had been removed from his post as Mayor of Saigon by Khánh.

[...] Nixon was a virtual unknown outside of his hometown of Whittier and was facing a popular and respected incumbent.
