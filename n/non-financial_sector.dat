50|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the 1990 Convention, money laundering techniques and anti-money laundering strategies had significantly evolved. For example, laundering techniques increasingly targeted the <b>non-financial</b> <b>sector</b> and used professional intermediaries to invest criminal proceeds in the legitimate economy. Many jurisdictions had set up Financial Intelligence Units to process suspicious or unusual transaction reports and thus triggered more laundering investigations. Those changes needed to be followed up by reassessing the Convention's focus, adjusting some of its requirements and supplementing it with additional provisions. In addition, some of these changes had already been included in standards set by other international fora (European Union, United Nations, FATF), which a new convention could not ignore. Rather, the text of the new Convention brought into line with these new developments to ensure mutual consistency with these standards and to make possible harmonised domestic responses in an appropriate legal format.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the e↵ects of intra-financial lending – claims between financial institutions – on aggregate investment and {{credit to the}} <b>non-financial</b> <b>sector</b> in the United States. Building on Montecino, Epstein, and Levina (2014) we document a large growth in intra-financial assets {{beginning in the early}} 1980 s. Using a vector autoregression model, we find that intra-financial lending is negatively related to gross capital formation and present evidence that this operates through a credit channel. However, we also find evidence of a structural break around the year 2000. Rolling impulse response functions suggest the presence of two alternative regimes over the post-war period: a “capital diversion ” regime in which credit to the <b>non-financial</b> <b>sector</b> and intra-financial lending are substitutes, as well as a financial bubble regime in which credit and intra-financial lending are complements. In the latter case, credit to the <b>non-financial</b> <b>sector</b> and intra-financial lending appear to feed each other in an unsustainable bubble process. In neither case do we find macroeconomic evidence in support of the financial eciency view that increased intra-financial lending reflect financial innovations associated with more ecient risk bearing, liquidity provision, and credit allocation...|$|E

The Macro-Network comprises of linkages across financial and <b>non-financial</b> <b>Sectors</b> in each country. These country-level sector networks are then connected by the cross-border links between the individual banking sectors. Using the Macro-Network to simulate financial shocks, we find that the propagation effects depend on the underlying network structure, which evolves overtime. After the financial crisis, bilateral linkages contracted sharply, reflecting the surge in counterparty risk and the de-leveraging processes. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that even after this process, vulnerabilities remained in the euro area financial system, while a more diversified portfolio of cross-border exposures might mitigate the shock effects. We identify sectors which are most relevant for the propagation of financial shocks in the Macro-Network...|$|R

I use bank deregulation as an instrumental variable to identify an exogenous increase in the competitiveness of the <b>non-financial</b> <b>sector</b> and evaluate its impact on union membership. Two-stage least squares estimates indicate that competition materially reduced union membership. The reduction in union membership is larger in states with greater changes in competition and in manufacturing sectors with relatively high dependence on external finance. Moreover, the reduction in union membership {{is associated with a}} reduction in the union wage premium and with an increase in working hours among workers who lost union representation. The results are consistent with the view that unions target less competitive industries and that shocks to competition increase the elasticity of labor-demand.

40|$|Total credit as {{an early}} warning {{indicator}} for systemic banking crises 1 Credit-to-GDP gaps are valuable early warning indicators for systemic banking crises. As such, they are useful for identifying vulnerabilities and can help guide the deployment of macroprudential tools such as the build-up of countercyclical capital buffers. In line with Basel III recommendations, credit-to-GDP gaps can be further improved by taking account of all sources of credit to the private <b>non-financial</b> <b>sector,</b> rather than just bank credit. Drawing on a new BIS database, this special feature finds that total credit developments predict the risk of systemic crises better than indicators based solely on bank credit. JEL classification: E 44, G 01. Financial crises are usually preceded by private sector credit booms. 2 This insight {{can be used to}} construct early warning indicators for crises. Yet much of the work on such indicators is based only on credit granted by domestic banks, even though this aggregate excludes lending from non-banks or foreigners. However, such lending can be significant. A new BIS database reveals, for example, that banks may provide as little as 30 % of total credit to the private <b>non-financial</b> <b>sector,</b> as is currently the case in the United States. This special feature assesses whether credit from all sources (ie total credit) has different early warning properties than bank credit. It extends previous BIS work (eg Borio and Lowe (2002), Borio and Drehmann (2009)) which finds that credit booms can be successfully captured by the so-called credit-to-GDP gap. 3 In particular, the analysis draws on the new BIS database covering bank and total credit to the private <b>non-financial</b> <b>sector</b> (Dembiermont et al (2013)). The sample comprises 39 emerging market and advanced economies, starting at the earliest in 1970 and capturing 33 crises. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causes and balance sheet effect {{consequences}} of the liability dollarisation of <b>non-financial</b> <b>sectors</b> in Turkey using the Company Accounts database compiled by the Central Bank of Turkey. The results from the panel EGLS and GMM procedures suggest that both sector-specific (tangibility, leverage ratio, export share) and macroeconomic condition variables (inflation, real exchange rate change, budget deficits and confidence) are significant in explaining the corporate sector liability dollarisation. Firms are found to match only partially the currency composition of their debt with their income streams making them potentially vulnerable to negative balance sheet affects of real exchange rate depreciation shocks. Consistent with this argument, real exchange rate depreciations {{are found to be}} contractionary, in terms of investments and profits, for sectors with higher liability dollarisation. Macroeconomic instability, as proxied by budget deficits and inflation, appears to have a significant negative affect on the performance of the firms in the <b>non-financial</b> <b>sectors,</b> in terms of their investments, sales and profits. Our results also stress the importance of strong macroeconomic policy stance and price stability for an endogenous dedollarisation process along with regulatory measures to limit vulnerabilities caused by dollarisation.

We compute the Hurst exponent for fifteen sectorial indices to scrutinise the time-varying behaviour of long-range memory, applying a shuffling technique to avoid short-term correlation. We find that the financial crisis has uneven effects on the informational efficiency of all corporate bond sectors, especially those related to financial services. However, their vulnerability is not homogeneous and some <b>non-financial</b> <b>sectors</b> suffer only a transitory effect. ...|$|R
