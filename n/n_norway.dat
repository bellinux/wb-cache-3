Calanus spp. numerically dominated the herbivores; Aglantha digitale, Mertensia ovum, Beroë cucumis, and Parasagitta elegans were the dominant carnivores. Omnivores and detritivores were numerically less important. Descent to deeper regions of the water column (> 100 m) between August and October, and ascent to the shallower region (< 100 m) between November and May was the overall seasonal pattern in this zooplankton community. In contrast to other groups, P. elegans did not exhibit pronounced vertical migrations. Seasonal vertical distributions of most species showed statistical associations with the availability of their main food source. The vertical distribution of later developmental stages of Calanus spp. was inversely associated with fluorescence, indicating that they descended from the shallower region {{while it was still}} relatively productive, and ascended before the primary production had started to increase. Strong associations between the vertical distributions of secondary consumer M. ovum and Calanus spp., and tertiary consumer B. cucumis and M. ovum indicated that these carnivores seasonally followed their prey through the water column. We conclude that seasonal vertical migrations are a widespread trait in the high Arctic community studied, and predator−prey interactions seem particularly central in shaping the associations between the seasonal vertical strategies of adjacent trophic levels...|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{test for}} a {{possible}} effect of environmental harshness on large-scale latitudinal and elevational patterns in taxon richness of macrofauna in arctic and alpine glacier-fed streams. Location Svalbard (79 degrees N), Iceland (65 degrees <b>N),</b> <b>Norway</b> (62 degrees N), Switzerland and Italy (46 degrees N), France (43 degrees N), New Zealand (43 degrees S) and Ecuador (0 degrees), covering an elevational gradient from sea level to 4800 m a. s. l. Methods We gathered data from 63 sites along 13 streams and created an index of glacial influence (the glacial index, GI) as an integrative proxy for environmental harshness. The explicative power of the GI, environmental variables, latitude and elevation on taxon richness was tested in generalized linear models. Taxon richness along geographical gradients was analysed at standardized levels of GI in contour plots. Beta diversity and assemblage similarity was calculated at different GI intervals and compared with a null-model. Results Overall, taxon richness decreased exponentially with increased GI (r 2 = 0. 64), and of all included factors, GI had the highest explicative power. At low values of GI we found that local taxon richness varied along the coupled gradients of latitude and elevation in a hump-shaped manner. However, this pattern disappeared at high values of GI, i. e. when environmental harshness increased. Beta diversity increased, while similarity among assemblages decreased towards high GI values. Main conclusions In our study system, the number of taxa {{able to cope with}} the harshest conditions was largely independent of the regional taxon pool, and environmental harshness constituted a fixed constraint for local richness, irrespective of latitude and elevation. Contrary to expectations, we found that beta diversity was highest and similarity lowest among the harshest sites, suggesting that taxon richness was not solely driven by niche selection based on environmental tolerances, but also stochastic ecological drift, leading to dispersal-limited communities...|$|E
40|$|Nearly {{one third}} of the {{vascular}} plant species of the remote high arctic archipelago of Svalbard are listed on the regional Red List for Svalbard, and {{there is a need for}} information to evaluate their conservation status, and improve conservation management. Here I study distribution, population sizes, ecology, and threats in Carex capillaris, Comastoma tenellum, Puccinellia angustata ssp. palibinii, and Tofieldia pusilla which are all restricted to some of the warmest local areas of Svalbard. Further, I use Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) to evaluate whether the Svalbard populations are genetically depleted compared to other arctic-alpine populations of the species, investigate their phylogeographic history, and resolve taxonomic problems. All species have larger populations than previously assumed and new populations of C. tenellum and T. pusilla were discovered. Carex capillaris is thriving, and is associated with high substrate moisture and temperature at its only Svalbard locality. Local expansion potential was indicated. The population is genetically depleted, and forms a distinct genetic subgroup of ssp. fuscidula, with <b>N</b> <b>Norway</b> as the most likely source region. The results indicate that C. capillaris may have colonized Svalbard during the warmer early-middle Holocene, but a more recent introduction is also possible. Possible threats include reduced evolutionary potential, inbreeding depression, and stochastic events. Comastoma tenellum is growing in bird cliff vegetation at its three known localities. The populations are genetically depleted, and although clearly related to the most probable source region, NW Russia, they form a distinct genetic subgroup. This suggests an early-middle Holocene introduction of the species to Svalbard, associated with a strong founder effect. Possible threats include reduced evolutionary potential, inbreeding depression, and fluctuating population sizes. The population of P. angustata ssp. palibinii in Bockfjorden has been erroneously classified and belongs to the Svalbard endemic P. svalbardensis. This species exhibits a highly specialized ecology and is locally abundant in other parts of Svalbard. High levels of genetic diversity were detected, and no genetic threats are apparent. Tofieldia pusilla is found in different types of habitats, but temperature might restrict local expansion. The populations are not notably genetically depleted, which indicates that T. pusilla is doing comparatively better than many other thermophilous vascular plants in Svalbard. Based on the results, C. capillaris and C. tenellum were downgraded to less critical Red List categories, and T. pusilla was taken out of the Red List. As temperature probably is the limiting factor to C. capillaris, C. tenellum and T. pusilla in Svalbard, they are expected to benefit from a warmer climate...|$|E
40|$|We relate {{variation}} in the timing of arrival by migrating birds breeding at northerly latitudes to individual differences in the prior accumulation of energy stores. Balancing starvation risks {{early in the season}} against the almost universal declining trend in reproductive prospects with advancing date is seen as an individual decision with fitness consequences. We review three studies implicating events at the staging sites or in winter in setting the individual migratory schedule. Climate change influences the timetable of a pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) population breeding in The Netherlands and wintering in West Africa, followed since 1960. Mean air temperature in the period mid April-mid May (arrival and laying) increased and laying date advanced by 10 days. Still, in recent years most birds did not lay early enough to maximise fitness (determined by recruitment and parental survival) whereas many parents achieved this goal in 1980 – 1985. As the flycatchers have not started to arrive earlier, some ecological constraint further upstream is postulated (possibly the hurdle of the crossing of Sahara and Mediterranean). The ability to follow individual migrants provides a second avenue to assess the fitness implications of migratory schedules. Thus, brightly coloured male bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica) captured in the Dutch Wadden Sea (the intermediate staging site linking a West African wintering area with breeding sites in arctic Russia) and traced with miniature radio-transmitters did not depart early. The ‘best’ males (with bright breeding plumage) were picked up by the listening stations in Sweden 650 km further along the migratory route ten days later than the paler individuals. If early arrival confers the competitive advantage of prior occupancy but increases mortality, the ‘best’ males may be able to afford arriving later and thus avoid some of the survival costs. Return rate of the ‘bright’ males to the staging site in later seasons was indeed higher than for the ‘pale’, early males. Intensive observation of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) fitted with coded neck-collars substantiate the tight relationship between energy stores (fat) accumulated up to final departure from the final staging site (Vesterålen, <b>N.</b> <b>Norway)</b> en route to the nesting grounds (Spitsbergen) and subsequent success. The breeding outcome of individual parents (accompanied by juveniles or not) could be related to observations of body condition before departure (visual ‘abdominal profile index’). Recently, perceived conflicts with agriculture have resulted in widespread harassment by humans. The geese have: drastically shortened their stay on the Vesterålen, fail to achieve the body condition usual a decade ago and reproductive output has fallen. Although the geese are currently pioneering new staging sites, an adequate alternative has not materialised, underlining the critical role of the final take-off site. ...|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} {{reciprocal}} relationship between metals and wild-growing macromycetes. An inter-diciplinary approach was {{needed in order}} to reveal, on the molecular level, how these organisms respond to, and are affected by, potentially toxic metals. This was accomplished by applying a selection of techniques from the fields of analytical chemistry and molecular biology. Samples were collected in the years 1998, 2000, and 2002 near two metal smelters: the still active Outokumpu Norzink zinc (Zn) smelter at Odda, S. W. Norway and the former copper (Cu) smelter at Sulitjelma, <b>N.</b> <b>Norway.</b> In the 1998 collection round, reference samples were collected several km from the emission sources. For subsequent rounds of sampling, reference samples were collected from rural areas in Central Norway. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS, flame mode) and high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS) were used to determine cadmium (Cd), Zn, and Cu in soil and fruiting body tissues. Mercury (Hg) was determined in samples collected at Odda and the reference areas in Central Norway, by cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS). Cytosolic compounds were separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC, =gel permeation chromatography) and anion exchange chromatography, and distribution of endogenous metals was investigated by AAS and CVAFS. Parallel runs of samples spiked with the radiotracer 109 Cd were performed to further study binding of Cd to cytosolic components. Cd-binding proteins from the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) were analyzed with respect to amino acid composition, whereas the N terminal amino acid sequence was determined for a Cd-binding protein from the king bolete (penny bun, Boletus edulis). Cd-binding components from cytosolic extracts, separated by SEC, were further separated and characterized by highperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) Cytosolic Cd-binding capacity (CCBC) was determined, to investigate whether increased synthesis of metal-binding compounds is part of the direct defense against metal toxicity in macromycetes. Furthermore, cytosolic extracts of B. edulis were analyzed with respect to activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), two enzymes important in the cellular defense against free radicals. In the same species, heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP 70, a molecular chaperone), as well as concentrations of glutathione (GSHTOT=GSH + 0. 5 GSSG) and free proline were determined. Two markers of oxidative damage to cellular molecules were determined in B. edulis, in order to make possible conclusions about the effectiveness of the defense systems expressed in this species in handling the increased metal toxicity. These markers were frequency of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA and concentration of lipid hydroperoxides. The results showed elevated concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Cu in surface soil close to both smelters. Hg was elevated near the Outokumpu Norzink Zn smelter at Odda (not determined at Sulitjelma, see above). Metal concentrations in fruiting body tissues were more dependent on species-specific accumulation potentials for metals than on metal concentrations in substrate. Determinations of amino acid composition of Cd-binding proteins of A. muscaria, revealed that these compounds do not belong to the metallothionein (MT) family. The same applies to a Cd-binding protein from B. edulis. HPLC-MS demonstrated the presence of phytochelatins (PCs) in B. edulis growing near the Zn smelter at Odda. This is the first report of PCs in a macromycete. CCBC correlated quite well with exposure to Cd, Zn, Hg, and Cu in 42 samples of B. edulis (Spearman’s p< 0. 001 for all four metals). Furthermore, the difference in CCBC between the exposed group (growing near the Zn smelter at Odda) and the reference group was also statistically significant (Mann Whitney’s p< 0. 001), indicating the induction of Cd-binding cytosolic compounds as a response to metal exposure in this species. In 48 samples of B. edulis, expressions of SOD, CAT, and HSP 70 were significantly positively correlated to the degree of exposure (Spearman’s p< 0. 01 for the association between Cd and SOD, p< 0. 001 for all other correlations between SOD, CAT, or HSP 70 on one side and Cd, Zn, Hg, or Cu on the other). These results indicate that toxic effects arising from metal exposure, are not effectively alleviated by direct defense mechanisms (e. g. PCs) alone. GSHTOT correlated negatively with exposure, suggesting that the intracellular pool of GSH is reduced as a result of PC synthesis. Determination of frequency of AP sites and concentration of lipid hydroperoxides in 31 fruiting bodies of B. edulis showed that both damage parameters were significantly elevated in the exposed group (growing near the Zn smelter at Odda) relative to the reference group (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, the two damage parameters correlated significantly positively with exposure to the four metals (p< 0. 05) and with each other (p< 0. 001). From this, it is concluded that although a host of direct and indirect defense mechanisms is induced against metal toxicity in B. edulis, damage to vital cellular components do occur. Dr. philos.

However, the number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria is increasing, including metallo [...] lactamase (MBL) -producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study MBL-producing P. aeruginosa isolates identified in <b>Norway</b> (<b>n</b> 4) and Sweden (n 9) from 1999 to 2007 were characterized. Two international clonal complexes (CC), CC 111 (n 8) and CC 235 (n 2), previously associated with MBL-producing isolates, were dominant. CC 111 isolates (ST 111 / 229; serotype O 12; blaVIM- 2) included clonally related isolates identified in Skåne County, Sweden (n 6), and two isolates associated with importation from Greece and Denmark. In all CC 111 isolates...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of erectile dysfunction (ED) and sexual problems after radical prostatectomy has differed greatly in reports from different centers and countries; however, {{few studies have}} taken baseline factors into account. We compared the {{incidence of}} ED and sexual problems 2 to 3 years after radical prostatectomy in American, Norwegian, and Spanish men for whom selected clinically relevant demographic and medical pretreatment variables were available. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2003 to 2009, 1077 men (United States, <b>n</b> = 494; <b>Norway,</b> <b>n</b> = 472; and Spain, n = 111) scheduled for prostatectomy responded to an Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire before treatment and 2 to 3 years after prostatectomy. On multivariate analysis, the odds ratios for ED and sexual problems were calculated, adjusted for the pretreatment variables found significant (P <. 01) on univariate analysis. RESULTS: For all patients and for those without ED preoperatively, no statistically significant association was detected between the country of prostatectomy {{and the likelihood of}} reporting post-prostatectomy ED or sexual problems despite the significant differences among the 3 countries in the unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: Adjusting for important pretreatment variables, no intercountry differences were detected. Thus, a thorough knowledge about the pretreatment medical and demographic factors is essential for valid comparisons of the incidence of postprostatectomy ED and sexual problems among different studies.

40|$|A {{consensus}} TaqMan real-time PCR test {{targeting the}} chromosomal flaB gene of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was constructed. The test was {{compared with a}} recently published generic Light Upon eXtension (LUX) 16 S rRNA real-time PCR test (Wilhelmsson et al. in J Clin Microbiol 48 : 4169 – 4176, 2010) on material consisting of 242 Ixodes ricinus ticks collected from dogs and cats in Northern <b>Norway</b> (<b>n</b> = 139) and Telemark County in Southern <b>Norway</b> (<b>n</b> = 103). Ticks positive in either test were further tested by nested PCR amplification of the 5 S- 23 S rRNA intergenic-spacer region followed by sequencing for species identification. A tick was defined as Borrelia positive if two of three tests were positive. Thirty-four of the 242 (14 %) ticks satisfied this definition of positivity. Of these ticks 32 were positive both in the rRNA and flaB test, while two were positive only in the rRNA test. One tick was positive only in the rRNA test and was considered false positive since PCR for sequencing failed. The sensitivity of the flaB test was 94 % and the specificity 100 %. It was possible to determine the species present using Tm analysis. Among ticks from Northern Norway the prevalence of Borrelia was 13 %, whereas the prevalence in Telemark was 16 %. Among identified species (n = 33) B. afzelii was found in 16 (47 %), B. garinii in 15 (44 %) and B. valaisiana in 2 (6 %) ticks, respectively. The flaB test is a rapid, sensitive and specific test for detection and quantification of Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. in I. ricinus ticks. This is the first report on Borrelia prevalence in I. ricinus in Northern Norway...|$|R
40|$|Background. Fast and {{accurate}} work-up {{is crucial to}} ensure the best possible treatment and prognosis for patients with head and neck cancer. The {{presence or absence of}} neck lymph node metastases is important for the prognosis and the choice of treatment. Clinical lymph node (N) -staging is done by palpation and diagnostic imaging of the neck. We investigated the current practice of the initial radiological work-up of patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) in the Nordic countries. Methods. A questionnaire regarding the availability and use of guidelines and imaging modalities for radiological N-staging in OSCC was distributed to 21 Head and Neck centres in Denmark (n = 4), Finland (n = 5), Iceland (<b>n</b> = 1), <b>Norway</b> (<b>n</b> = 4) and Sweden (n = 7). We also asked for a description of the radiological criteria for determining the lymph nodes as clinical positive (cN+) or negative (cN 0). Results. All 21 Head and Neck centres responded to the questionnaire. Denmark and Finland have national guidelines, while Norway and Sweden have local or regional guidelines. Seventeen of the 19 centres with available guidelines recommended computed tomography (CT) of the cN 0 neck. The waiting time may influence the imaging modalities used. Lymph node size was the most commonly used criteria for radiological cN+, but the cut-off measures vary from 0. 8 to 2. 0 cm. Conclusion. Overall, CT is the most commonly recommended and used imaging modality for OSCC. Despite availability of national guidelines the type and number of radiological examinations vary between centres within a country, but the implementation of a fast-track programme may facilitate fast access to imaging. The absence of uniform criteria for determining the lymph nodes of the neck as cN+ complicates the comparison of the accuracy of the imaging modalities. Well-defined radiological strategies and criteria are needed to optimise the radiological work-up in OSCC...|$|R
40|$|A cross-national {{study of}} young adult sexual {{minorities}} {{was conducted in}} order to explore the associations between sexual orientation and measures of depression, suicidality, and substance use. Two nationally representative data sets were explored from the United States (N = 14, 335) and <b>Norway</b> (<b>N</b> = 2423). Results indicated that sexual minorities experienced multiple health disparities (depression, suicidality, and substance use) compared to their heterosexual counterparts. We found similar patterns of depression, suicidality, and substance use for sexual minorities in both the United States and Norway. The highest odds of substance use were among heterosexual-identified Norwegian youth who reported same-sex sexual activity, and the highest odds of suicidality were found for bisexual young adults in Norway. These findings have implications for how we consider culture and social policy as barriers and/or opportunities for sexual minorities...|$|R
