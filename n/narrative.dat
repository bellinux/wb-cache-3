40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to reflect on the use of <b>narratives</b> in case studies. The main {{argument}} developed here is that constructing <b>narratives</b> embodies important theoretical assumptions about the nature of the world and temporal processes. A secondary argument concerns the difference between lay and academic <b>narratives.</b> Although social scientists have little choice but work with linear <b>narratives</b> and standard stories as primary empirical material, theoretically informed <b>narratives</b> should strive to construct more subtle and nuanced <b>narratives</b> about the social world...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the 112 <b>narratives</b> collected from the Corpus Iuris Hibernici. The selection of <b>narratives</b> is based on criteria informed by modern narratological theories. The significant presence of <b>narratives</b> in early Irish law tracts appears at odds with the normal conception of law texts as consisting solely of provisions, and therefore needs to be accounted for. Since no systematic study has been conducted of these legal <b>narratives,</b> this thesis serves as an introduction by giving firstly an index of <b>narratives</b> and secondly a categorisation of them in terms of distribution, dates and functions. It then carries out a general analysis of the relationship between legal <b>narratives</b> and early Irish literature, and a selected case study of the relationship between legal <b>narratives</b> and the legal institutions in the context of which the <b>narratives</b> are located. It has become clearer, with the progress of argument, that the use of <b>narratives</b> {{was an integral part of}} legal writing in medieval Ireland; and the <b>narratives,</b> though having many idiosyncratic features of themselves, are profoundly connected with the learned tradition at large. The legal <b>narratives</b> reveal the intellectual background and compositional concerns of medieval Irish jurists, and they formed a crucial part of the effort to accommodate law tracts into the dynamic tradition of senchas. Two appendices are included at the end: one consists of translations of 34 <b>narratives</b> from the index, and the other is a critical edition of one of the <b>narratives</b> discussed in detail, together with translations of some relevant passages...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 This thesis proposes {{expanding}} the locations where literacy <b>narratives</b> are currently used as readings and as writing assignments and considering broad {{conceptions of the}} types and uses of literacy <b>narratives</b> read in classrooms. In particular, this thesis asserts the value of {{expanding the}} literacy <b>narratives</b> read beyond the current canonical texts and of locating literacy <b>narratives</b> not only in composition but in three other university settings: first-year seminars, introductory courses to the major, and Writing in the Disciplines courses. Within these settings, literacy <b>narratives</b> {{can be used to}} help students develop identities as university students and as professionals within their disciplines. Using the language and theories of New Literacy Studies, a pedagogical framework is proposed for teaching literacy <b>narratives</b> across the disciplines. This framework is then applied to three literacy <b>narratives</b> written by professionals from diverse disciplines, demonstrating the usefulness of this tool for teachers assigning literacy <b>narratives</b> to be read or written within their classes...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{cultural}} <b>narratives</b> through {{which members of}} organizations define legitimacy during prolonged periods of change. We view legitimacy work as a cultural practice and interpretive process that {{takes the form of}} organizational <b>narratives.</b> We show how the shifting configurations of internal power relations shape both the choice and the meaning attached to the varied legitimacy <b>narratives.</b> We investigate the construction of legitimacy through a longitudinal case study based on participant observation of Gamma, a government Research and Development (R&D) organization, during a process of intense change. We provide theoretical insights into the construction and deconstruction of the legitimacy by analyzing the <b>narratives</b> in play during a process of planned change. We claim that legitimation <b>narratives</b> not only evolve in accordance with functional need or, in a sense, that older <b>narratives</b> give room to newer, more updated or relevant <b>narratives,</b> but also that multiple <b>narratives</b> are used by different organization actors alternately and interchangeably as part of internal contestation over legitimation of change...|$|R

5|$|The novelists of the {{dictator}} novel genre combined <b>narrative</b> strategies of both modern and postmodern writing.

The Chorus uses a new <b>narrative</b> style in each of their chapters, beginning with a jump-rope rhyme and ending in a 17-line iambic dimeter poem. Other <b>narrative</b> styles used by the Chorus include a lament, a folk song, an idyll, a sea shanty, a ballad, a drama, an anthropology lecture, a court trial, and a love song.|$|E

The historical <b>narratives</b> are reviewed trough literature about education and textbooks. How children perceive these <b>narratives</b> today are investigated {{based on interviews}} conducted during my fieldwork in Israel and Ramallah, November 2007. 15 interviews were conducted in four different schools during my fieldwork. Because of this, a qualitative research design was used for this study.

The findings in this study suggest that historical <b>narratives</b> of “the other” are not being learned in formal education today. The <b>narratives</b> are learned from other areas of socialisation. The findings also indicate that education, related to <b>narratives</b> and the perception of “the other” is of minor importance since education is interlinked with the society as a hole.
