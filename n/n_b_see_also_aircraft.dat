40|$|The {{dependence}} of the spin reorientation transition in ultra-thin ferromagnetic films on external magnetic fields is studied. For different orientations of the applied field {{with respect to the}} film, phase diagrams are calculated within a mean field theory for the classical Heisenberg model. In particular we find that the spin reorientation transition present in this model is not suppressed completely by an applied field, as the magnetization component perpendicular to the field may show spontaneous order in a certain temperature interval.

30|$|In this work, we combine Biot’s poroelastic {{equations}} and {{the fluid}} mass conservation equations averaged {{to obtain a}} system of differential equations for the pore pressures and saturations of the wetting and non-wetting phases. The theory used here to define the stress–strain relations is a generalization of Biot’s theory and has been developed by Santos et al. (1990 a, <b>b)</b> (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> Carcione et al. 2004). It {{is important to note}} here that the constitutive equations introduced by Santos et al. (1990 a, b) have never been used to simulate fluid-flow phenomena, but only to describe wave propagation. Biot’s wave propagation theory, neglecting the acceleration terms, is equivalent to the consolidation theory if the infinitesimal stresses and pressures are assumed to be their absolute counterparts, since the stress–strain relations can be interpreted as a relation between incremental fields, where stress and strain are increments with respect to a reference stress and strain—the case of wave propagation—or, as relations between the absolute fields (consolidation theory; Biot 1941). Other models accounting for the coupling between the mechanical behaviour of the matrix and the fluid dynamics include the Hassanizadeh model (Hassanizadeh et al. 2002) and the Barenblatt–Biot model (Barenblatt and Gilman 1987).|$|R

However, for a digital covering which does not satisfy a radius 2 local isomorphism, the study of a digital fundamental group of a digital space and its automorphism group remains open. In order to examine this problem, the present paper establishes the notion of an ultra regular covering space, studies its various properties and calculates an automorphism group of the ultra regular covering space. In particular, the paper develops the notion of compatible adjacency of a digital wedge.

40|$|An {{imaginary}} cube is a three dimensional object {{which has}} square projections in three orthogonal directions {{just as a}} cube has. In this paper, we study imaginary cubes and present sculptures based on imaginary cubes. We show that there are 16 kinds of minimal convex imaginary cubes. The list of 16 representative minimal convex imaginary cubes contains, {{as well as a}} regular tetrahedron and a cuboctahedron, a hexagonal bipyramid imaginary cube, which is a double imaginary cube, and a triangular antiprism imaginary cube, which {{plays an important role in}} the construction of the sculptures. Then, we present two Imaginary Cube Sculptures. Each of them is composed of all the 16 representative minimal convex imaginary cubes and forms an imaginary cube as a whole. Thus, they reveal uniform overall structures though they are composed of different shapes. 1 Introduction.

40|$|Here {{we present}} a {{complete}} revision of the species of Baconia. Up until now there have been 27 species assigned to the genus (Mazur, 2011), in two subgenera (Binhister Cooman and Baconia s. str.), with species in the Neotropical, Nearctic, Palaearctic, and Oriental regions. We recognize all these species as valid and correctly assigned to the genus, and redescribe all of them. We synonymize Binhister, previously used for a polyphyletic assemblage of species with varied relationships in the genus. We move four species into Baconia from other genera, and describe 85 species as new, bringing the total for the genus to 116 species. We divide these into 12 informal species groups, leaving 13 species unplaced to group. We present keys and diagnoses for all species, as well as habitus photos and illustrations of male genitalia for nearly all. The genus now contains the following species and species groups: Baconia loricata group [B. loricata Lewis, 1885, B. patula Lewis, 1885, B. gounellei (Marseul, 1887 a), B. jubaris (Lewis, 1901), B. festiva (Lewis, 1891), <b>B.</b> foliosoma sp. <b>n.,</b> <b>B.</b> sapphirina sp. <b>n.,</b> <b>B.</b> furtiva sp. <b>n.,</b> <b>B.</b> pernix sp. <b>n.,</b> <b>B.</b> applanatis sp. <b>n.,</b> <b>B.</b> disciformis sp. <b>n.,</b> <b>B.</b> nebulosa sp. <b>n.,</b> <b>B.</b> brunnea sp. <b>n.</b> ], <b>B.</b> godmani group [B. godmani (Lewis, 1888), B. venusta (J.

40|$|Sumatriptan or {{eletriptan}} produced vasocontraction {{in common}} carotid artery (CCA) by stimulating 5 HT 1 <b>B</b> receptors (<b>see</b> <b>also</b> Akin & Gurdal, this issue). Naratriptan as a 5 HT 1 B/D agonist, {{was unable to}} produce vasocontraction in this artery, but inhibited the vasocontractile response induced by sumatriptan or eletriptan. All these agonists inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production with comparable potencies and maximal responses. This inhibition was mediated by 5 HT 1 B receptors: 5 HT 1 B antagonist SB 216641 (1 [*]μM) completeley antagonized sumatriptan-, eletriptan- or naratriptan-induced cyclic AMP inhibition, but 5 HT 1 D antagonist BRL 15572 (1 [*]μM) did not affect this response. Naratriptan-induced stimulation of 5 -HT 1 B receptors resulted only in adenylate cyclase inhibition, whereas stimulation of these receptors by sumatriptan or eletriptan produced vasocontraction as well. Hence, we concluded that the 5 HT 1 B-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase was not a sufficient condition to couple the receptor stimulation to vasocontraction.

On the mainland, I shall discuss the evidence from Vietnani, Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, but exclude Burma, Laos and Kampuchea for lack of relevant data.

I would argue that the Iron Age as a separate cultural entity is evident on the mainland, but in the islands there is no identifiable Bronze Age preceding the adoption of iron. By the Iron Age, I mean a period associated with iron artefacts, wet rice farming, brisk internal exchange and external trade and, in the lowland at least, a ranked society.

Physics simulation gives both the average numbers ! <b>N</b> <b>b</b> ? of background and ! N s ? of signal events. We find that the proper definition of the significance for ! <b>N</b> <b>b</b> ?; ! <b>N</b> s ? AE 1 is S 12 = p ! N s ? + ! <b>N</b> <b>b</b> ?

We also propose a method for {{taking into account the}} systematical errors related to nonexact knowledge of background and signal cross sections. An account of such systematics is very essential in the search for supersymmetry at LHC. 1 Introduction One of the common goals in the forthcoming experiments is the search for new phenomena.

Our data structure uses O(N=B) disk blocks to store a monotone subdivision of size <b>N,</b> where <b>B</b> {{is the size}} of a disk block. It supports queries in O(log 2 <b>B</b> <b>N)</b> I/Os (worst-case) and updates in O(log 2 <b>B</b> <b>N)</b> I/Os (amortized). We also propose a new variant of B-trees, called levelbalanced B-trees, which allow insert, delete, merge, and split operations in O((1 + b <b>B</b> log M=B <b>N</b> <b>B)</b> log <b>b</b> <b>N)</b> I/Os (amortized), 2 b B= 2, even if each node stores a pointer to its parent.
