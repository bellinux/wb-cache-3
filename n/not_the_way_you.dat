2500|$|Photographing at Art Basel and Art Basel Miami Beach fairs, the Museum of Modern Art, Christie's {{and various}} galleries, Lawler later {{presented}} a behind-the-scenes view of art: the hoisting of a Richard Serra sculpture attended by uniformed handlers; white-gloved hands carefully transporting a Gerhard Richter painting; Maurizio Cattelan's giant Picasso head swathed in plastic {{sitting on the}} floor behind its disconnected body; another Richter painting lying on its side propped against the wall, its public exposure at MoMA at an end; a Damien Hirst spin-painting glimpsed through a closet door. Lawler titled her 2004 survey show at Museum für Gegenwartskunst in Basel [...] "Louise Lawler and Others" [...] in acknowledgement of the artists whose artworks she photographs. Lawler created <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> remembered (Venice) for the exhibition [...] "Sequence One: Painting and Sculpture from the François Pinault Collection (2006–07)"; rather than contributing discrete artworks, these photographs were taken of the exhibition’s early installation process in Venice, depicting works of art in their shipping crates, besides pieces of foam or bubble wrap.|$|E
2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> speak." ...|$|E
