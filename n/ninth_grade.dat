5|$|In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old {{teacher at}} Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade {{students}} {{were unable to}} read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. She thought that, because her students were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them {{by way of a}} television series. She found that her students liked Bewitched, Room 222, and Julia, so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about her idea. Only Bewitched responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher, Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a <b>ninth</b> <b>grade</b> level. Saunders added that Bewitched was the students' favorite television series.|$|E

5|$|Knowing Orlando Chinea, a {{coach who}} had trained some of Cuba's top {{pitchers}} before he defected from Cuba, lived in the area, Jiménez had his son train with Chinea.

Before his senior year in 2011, the Florida High School Athletic Association ruled that Fernández was ineligible, as he entered the <b>ninth</b> <b>grade</b> while in Cuba in 2006 and had therefore exhausted his eligibility. MLB's Cincinnati Reds were prepared to sign Fernández as an international free agent to a $1.3 millionsigning bonus. Fernández won an appeal and was declared eligible for his senior year, ending Cincinnati's pursuit. As a senior, Fernández pitched to a 13–1 win–loss record with a 2.35 earned run average (ERA) and 134 strikeouts. He also threw two no-hitters.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to analyse what strategies are pursued in order to protect self-esteem when it is threatened by a negative self-evaluation of school competence. Participants were 838 secondary-school students from the seventh to the <b>ninth</b> <b>grades.</b> Data were collected using Harter’s Self-Perception Pro le for Adolescents, together with a Scale of Attitudes towards School. Our results show that there are signi cant differences between the self-esteem enjoyed by successful and unsuccessful students in the seventh grade; such differences disappear in the eighth and <b>ninth</b> <b>grades.</b> They also reveal success-related differences in domain-speci c self-evaluation. We also found that students with low levels of academic achievement attribute less importance to school-related areas and reveal less favourable attitudes towards school. We discuss these results in terms of Harter’s self-esteem model and Robinson and Tayler’s self-esteem protection model...|$|R
