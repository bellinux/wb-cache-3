40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} {{the levels of}} free UV filters and selected amino acids in cataract <b>lenses</b> compared with <b>normal</b> <b>lenses.</b> METHODS. Indian cataract lenses (n = 39) and <b>normal</b> <b>lenses</b> (n = 6) were examined by HPLC to quantify levels of UV filter compounds, the UV filter precursor amino acid tryptophan (Trp), as well as tyrosine (Tyr) and uric acid. RESULTS. The levels {{of the two major}} primate UV filters, 3 -hydroxykynurenine glucoside (3 OHKG) and 4 -(2 -amino- 3 -hydroxyphenyl) - 4 -oxobutanoic acid glucoside (AHBG), in cataract lenses were markedly decreased compared with levels in <b>normal</b> <b>lenses.</b> By contrast, the levels of Trp were greatly increased. Mean Trp concentrations were an order of magnitude higher than in <b>normal</b> <b>lenses,</b> with 86 % of dark-colored cataract lens nuclei having Trp concentrations greater than the mean level in the <b>normal</b> <b>lenses.</b> The concentrations of Tyr were also higher in cataract lenses. The levels of Kyn, however, were unchanged, and the uric acid levels were substantially lower. CONCLUSIONS. The levels of the free UV filter compounds 3 OHKG and AHBG, and also of Trp, Tyr, and uric acid were different in cataract <b>lenses</b> compared to <b>normal</b> <b>lenses.</b> These data suggest that the metabolism of a large proportion of patients with cataract may be substantially different than in persons with <b>normal</b> <b>lenses.</b> Although the mechanism of such metabolic defects are unknown, the authors speculate that an amino acid transporter system may be upregulated in patients with cataract. Because kynurenine levels in cataract were not significantly different from those of <b>normal</b> <b>lenses,</b> there may be a defect in the lenticular UV filter pathway at one, or both, of the steps that convert kynurenine to 3 OHKG. 8 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|The Zenit 12-XP With its Helios f2/58mm {{lens and}} cloth shutter was widely sold by US Eastern camera stores. Many with the Zenit name covered with their [...] "USA" [...] brand. This Metallic re-badge was {{easy enough to}} gently pry off to see the true name Zenit. The TTL meter was fairly {{accurate}} and took decent shots. The 1981 price was $110 usa.

2500|$|Following this, {{there were}} two more {{attempts}} to make high-end protographic equipment, namely the Zenit-7 (1968) and Zenit-D (1969).

Each of these had its own bayonet mount ("mount 7" [...] and [...] "mount D" [...] respectively) which helped to utilize the camera's most advanced features. There were plans to develop a full line of optics for these cameras but the new shutter was too complicated and unreliable. Production was cancelled shortly after, and the only lens made for new mounts were the standard types. Ironically, the Start, Zenit-7 and Zenit-D utilized the same <b>normal</b> <b>lens</b> — a Helios-44 2/58. The Zenit-D is one of the rarest Zenit cameras — only 63 cameras were produced.|$|E
2500|$|Gilliam's {{films have}} a {{distinctive}} look, {{not only in}} mise-en-scène but even more so in photography, often recognisable from just a short clip; to create a surreal atmosphere of psychological unrest and a world out of balance, he frequently uses unusual camera angles, particularly low-angle shots, high-angle shots, and Dutch angles. Roger Ebert said that [...] "his world is always hallucinatory in its richness of detail." [...] Most of his movies are shot almost entirely with rectilinear ultra-wide-angle lenses with focal lengths of 28mm or less to achieve a distinctive style defined by extreme perspective distortion and extremely deep focus. Gilliam's long-time director of photography Nicola Pecorini has said, [...] "with Terry and me, a long lens means something between a 40mm and a 65mm." [...] This attitude markedly differs from the common definition in photography, by which 40 to 65mm is the focal length of a <b>normal</b> <b>lens,</b> resembling the natural human field of view, unlike Gilliam's signature style, defined by extreme perspective distortion due to his usual choice of focal length. The 14-mm lens has become informally known as [...] "The Gilliam" [...] among filmmakers because of his frequent use of it at least since Brazil.

40|$|AbstractPyrraline is an {{advanced}} Maillard reaction product {{formed by the}} non-enzymatic reaction initiated by glucose with lysine residues on proteins. This reaction involves an intermediate, 3 -deoxyglucosone, concentration of which is shown to be elevated in plasma and lenses during diabetes. Bovine lens alpha crystallins incubated with 3 -deoxyglucosone showed that pyrraline formation was a major modification and its quantification by two different methods revealed time-dependent accumulation. Pyrraline was quantified in normal, senile cataractous and diabetic lenses. Although a wide variation was observed, the mean value in cataractous lenses (mean ± S. E. : 48. 4 ± 12. 67 pmol/mg protein) was higher than in age-matched <b>normal</b> <b>lenses</b> (30. 9 ± 10. 26 pmol). Surprisingly, in diabetic lenses, the mean value was lower than <b>normal</b> <b>lenses</b> (28. 4 ± 15. 3 pmol).

40|$|In human {{cataract}} lenses the UV filters, 3 -hydroxykynurenine glucoside (3 OHKG) and kynurenine (Kyn) {{were found}} to be covalently bound to proteins and the levels in the nucleus were much higher than in the cortex. The levels of the bound UV filters in cataract nuclei were much lower than those in age-matched <b>normal</b> <b>lenses.</b> 3 -Hydroxykynurenine could not be detected in cataract <b>lenses.</b> As with <b>normal</b> <b>lenses,</b> protein-bound 3 OHKG in cataract lenses was found at the highest levels followed by Kyn. Free UV filter concentrations were also markedly reduced in cataract lenses. This feature may well contribute to the lower protein-bound levels; however, there was no clear relationship between free and bound UV filter contents when individual lenses were examined. We propose that since cysteine is a major site for UV filter binding, the well-documented oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups during the progression of nuclear cataract may account, in part, for the pronounced decrease in bound UV filters in cataract lenses...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{analyze and}} {{identify}} the proteomic differences between liquefied after-cataracts and <b>normal</b> <b>lenses</b> by means of liquefied chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). METHODS: Three <b>normal</b> <b>lenses</b> and three liquefied after-cataracts were exposed to depolymerizing reagents to extract the total proteins. Protein concentrations were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE). The digitized images obtained with a GS- 800 scanner were then analyzed with PDQuest 7. 0 software to detect the differentially-expressed protein spots. These protein spots were cut from the gel using a proteome work spot cutter and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The digested peptide separation was conducted by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The 2 -DE maps showed that lens proteins were in a pH range of 3 - 10 with a relative molecular weight of 21 - 70 kD. The relative molecular weight of the more abundant proteins was localized at 25 - 50 kD, and the isoelectric points were found to lie between PI 4 - 9. The maps also showed that the protein level within the liquefied after-cataracts was at 29 points and significantly lower than in <b>normal</b> <b>lenses.</b> The 29 points were identified by LC-MS/MS, and ten of these proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and database queries: beta-crystallin B 1, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, carbonyl reductase (NADPH) 1, cDNA FLJ 55253, gamma-crystallin D, GAS 2 -like protein 3, sorbitol dehydrogenase, DNA FLJ 60282, phosphoglycerate kinase, and filensin. CONCLUSION: The level of the ten proteins may {{play an important role}} in the development of liquefied after-cataracts...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Long-lived {{proteins}} are {{widespread in}} man, yet {{little is known}} about the processes that affect their function over time, or their role in age-related diseases. METHODS: Racemization of two proteins from normal and cataract human lenses were compared with age using tryptic digestion and LC/mass spectrometry. Asp 151 in αA crystallin and Asn 76 in γS crystallin were studied. RESULTS: Age-dependent profiles for the two proteins from <b>normal</b> <b>lenses</b> were different. In neither protein did the modifications increase linearly with age. For αA crystallin, racemization occurred most rapidly during the first 15 years of life, with approximately half of L-Asp 151 converted to D-isoAsp, L-isoAsp, and D-Asp in a ratio of 3 : 1 : 0. 5. Values then changed little. By contrast, racemization of Asn 76 in γS crystallin was slow until age 15, with isoAsp accounting for only 5 %. Values remained relatively constant until age 40 when a linear increase (1 %/year) took place. When cataract lenses were compared with age-matched <b>normal</b> <b>lenses,</b> there were marked differences in the time courses of the two crystallins. For αA crystallin, there was no significant difference in Asp 151 racemization between cataract and <b>normal</b> <b>lenses.</b> By contrast, in γS crystallin the degree of conversion of Asn 76 to isoAsp in cataract lenses was approximately double that of normals at every age. CONCLUSIONS: Modification of Asn and Asp over time may contribute to denaturation of proteins in the human lens. An accelerated rate of deamidation/racemization at selected sites in proteins, such as γS crystallin, may contribute to cataract formation. Michelle Yu Sung Hooi, Mark J.
