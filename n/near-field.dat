The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using <b>near-field</b> communications—a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones, but has experienced a low adoption rate among users.|$|E

Numerous methods exist to calculate <b>near-fields</b> from two-dimensional objects, however, relatively long computation times are generally required for reasonable accuracy. Computation is slowed {{primarily due to}} the calculation of <b>near-fields</b> using a singular kernel. The proposed work will develop an alternate, more efficient algorithm for calculating the <b>near-fields</b> from surface distributions. The Singularity Extraction Technique (SET) analytically extracts the contribution due to the near-singularity and implements the remaining portion numerically. Additionally, field contributions due to regions {{far removed from the}} field point are extracted out to further reduce the computational time. The implications here are a significant reduction in CPU time as well as improved accuracy. Computer programs are developed to implement and validate the SET.

40|$|We study a {{stochastic}} {{model for the}} self-controlled particle-deposition process induced by optical <b>near-fields.</b> This process was experimentally realized by Yukutake et al. on an electrode of a novel photovoltaic device as Ag deposition under light illumination, in which the wavelength of incident light is longer than the long-wavelength cutoff of the materials composing the device. Naruse et al. introduced a stochastic cellular automaton model to simulate underlying nonequilibrium processes which are necessary to formulate unique granular Ag film in this deposition process. In the present paper, we generalize their model and clarify the essential role of optical <b>near-fields</b> generated on the electrode surface. We introduce a parameter b indicating the incident light power per site and a function representing the resonance effect of optical <b>near-fields</b> depending on the Ag-cluster size on the surface. Numerical simulation shows a transition from a trivial particle-deposition state to a nontrivial self-controlled particle-deposition state at a critical value b_ c, and only in the latter state optical <b>near-fields</b> are effectively generated. The properties of transition in this mesoscopic surface model in nonequilibrium are studied by the analogy of equilibrium phase transitions associated with critical phenomena, and the criteria of transition are reported.

25|$|Having unique {{features}} of tunable resonances and unprecedented <b>near-field</b> enhancement, plasmon is an enabling technique for light management. Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic nanostructures. The improvements are mainly {{attributed to the}} plasmonic-optical effects for manipulating light propagation, absorption, and scattering. The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the active layer due to the localized <b>near-field</b> enhancement around metallic nanostructures. Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a general design rule, tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. The design rule suggests that electron to hole transport length ratio should be balanced with electron to hole mobility ratio. In other words, the transport time of electrons and holes (from initial generation sites to corresponding electrodes) should be the same. The general design rule can be realized by spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices (with the plasmonic-electrical effect). They also demonstrated the breaking of space charge limit in plasmonic-electrical organic solar cell.|$|E

This could been utilized for the recovery of thickness and permittivity of layered films and nanostructures, for the nanoscale profiling of multiphase materials and other subsurface analysis of samples. In other words, nano-FTIR has a unique capability of recovering the same information about thin-film samples that is typically returned by ellipsometry or impedance spectroscopy, yet with nanoscale spatial resolution.|$|E

Further simulations yield a field enhancement map for all materials, which shows that optical <b>near-fields</b> at nanotips are governed by a geometric effect under most conditions, while plasmon resonances play only a minor role.

25|$|Diamond is {{notorious for}} having a {{relatively}} large lattice strain. Strain splits and shifts optical transitions from individual centers resulting in broad lines in the ensembles of centers. Special care is taken to produce extremely sharp N-V lines (line width ~10nbsp&MHz) required for most experiments: high-quality, pure natural or better synthetic diamonds (type IIa) are selected. Many of them already have sufficient concentrations of grown-in N-V centers and are suitable for applications. If not, they are irradiated by high-energy particles and annealed. Selection of a certain irradiation dose allows tuning the concentration of produced N-V centers such that individual N-V centers are separated by micrometre-large distances. Then, individual N-V centers can be studied with standard optical microscopes or, better, <b>near-field</b> scanning optical microscopes having sub-micrometre resolution.|$|E

In the experiment, both antennas were operated in current drive mode, as RF-PSI tends to be higher in this phasing and at similar power (∼ 0. 5 MW). When sweeping the edge magnetic field pitch angle, peaked RF-PSI effects, in the form of 2 - 4 fold increase in the local Be source,are consistently measured with the observation spots magnetically connect to regions of TOPICAL-calculated high <b>near-fields,</b> particularly at the near-antenna limiters. It is also found that similar RF-PSI effects are produced by the two types of antenna on similarly distant limiters.

25|$|Placement of {{the sample}} stage {{into one of the}} {{interferometer}}'s arms (instead of outside of the interferometer as typically implemented in conventional FTIR) is a key element of nano-FTIR. It boosts the weak <b>near-field</b> signal due to interference with the strong reference field, helps to eliminate completely the background caused by parasitic scattering off everything that falls into large diffraction-limited beam focus, and most importantly, allows for recording of both amplitude s and phase φ spectra of the tip-scattered radiation. With the detection of phase, nano-FTIR provides complete information about near fields, which is essential for quantitative studies and many other applications. For example, for soft matter samples (organics, polymers, biomaterials, etc.), φ directly relates to the absorption in the sample material. This permits a direct comparison of nano-FTIR spectra with conventional absorption spectra {{of the sample}} material, thus allowing for simple spectroscopic identification according to standard FTIR databases.|$|E

25|$|Nano-FTIR (nanoscale Fourier {{transform}} infrared spectroscopy) is a {{scanning probe}} technique {{that can be}} considered as a combination of two techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scattering-type scanning <b>near-field</b> optical microscopy (s-SNOM). As s-SNOM, nano-FTIR is based on atomic-force microscopy (AFM), where a sharp tip is illuminated by an external light source and the tip-scattered light (typically back-scattered) is detected as a function of tip position. A typical nano-FTIR setup thus consists of an atomic force microscope, a broadband infrared light source used for tip illumination, and a Michelson interferometer acting as Fourier transform spectrometer. In nano-FTIR, the sample stage is placed in one of the interferometer arms, which allows for recording both amplitude and phase of the detected light (unlike conventional FTIR that normally does not yield phase information). Scanning the tip allows for performing hyperspectral imaging (i.e. complete spectrum at every pixel of the scanned area) with nanoscale spatial resolution determined by the tip apex size. The use of broadband infrared sources enables the acquisition of continuous spectra, which is a distinctive feature of nano-FTIR compared to s-SNOM.|$|E
