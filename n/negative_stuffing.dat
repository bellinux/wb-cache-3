I was like, 'I {{think this is}} fun,' and then I was reading a lot of <b>negative</b> <b>stuff.</b> It's hard {{not to take it}} personally. Than I thought, 'You know what? I am {{not going to do this}} to myself. I'm just going to do the best job I can."—Noelle Beck ...|$|R
2500|$|On 16 April 2016, Daniel Kilkelly and Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy {{confirmed}} Daniel {{would be}} leaving the show, alongside Imogen on 26 April. Phillipps told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap {{that it was not}} his decision to leave Neighbours, and that producers had chosen to write out Daniel so he and Imogen could go together. He explained, [...] "So much <b>negative</b> <b>stuff</b> had happened that the show wanted something positive to come out of it – so with Imogen going, the only real option was for Daniel to go, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Donelly {{broke up}} the band. Speaking to Q, she {{explained}} the reasons behind her decision: [...] "The {{first couple of years}} of Belly were a blast. Star was a big hit and we partied hard. But by the time we went to make King, {{there was a lot of}} <b>negative</b> <b>stuff</b> going on. King was a reaction to the bright shininess of Star and we weren't surprised when it didn't sell. I regret not making another Belly album, but at the time I thought, Screw it, I'm outta here." ...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding {{the state}} of music sampling, Deborah has always {{considered}} it an art, [...] "I think sampling is an art and I think it’s incredible. When I first started, I was told how it was theft. I was told that hip-hop and rap was a phase. That it wasn’t going to be around. All of that horrible, <b>negative</b> <b>stuff.</b> I kept saying “well, a collage, that’s not real art? Jambalaya isn’t real food?” That’s a great meal mixed up of different foods and spices, that’s what sampling is." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} first officially {{released}} in September, 1993 on the band's {{third and final}} studio album, In Utero. The album was recorded by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota in February, 1993, and features Kera Schaley on cello on [...] "Dumb" [...] and [...] "All Apologies." [...] Cobain cited both as examples {{of the type of}} song he wished he had put on previous Nirvana albums, and explained that {{the use of the word}} [...] "happy" [...] in [...] "Dumb" [...] was [...] "a nice twist" [...] on the <b>negative</b> <b>stuff</b> that they had done before.|$|R
5000|$|Following his father's {{murder on}} 8 December 1980, Lennon voiced anger and resentment toward him, saying, I've never {{really wanted to}} know the truth about how dad was with me. There was some very <b>negative</b> <b>stuff</b> talked about me ... like when he said I'd come out of a whiskey bottle on a Saturday night. Stuff like that. You think, where's the love in that? Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit ... more than Dad and I did. We had a great {{friendship}} going {{and there seems to be}} far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad.|$|R
5000|$|Although Ashcroft's {{introduction}} to the book claimed it was [...] "not about settling scores", {{and that he had}} sought Oakeshott's involvement to ensure the book was objective, the book was widely viewed as an act of revenge on Cameron for declining to offer Ashcroft, a major Conservative Party donor, a significant position in government. [...] Allison Pearson, writing for the Daily Telegraph, argued that the nature of the book suggested that Cameron's decision not to promote Ashcroft had been [...] "entirely justified". [...] Oakeshott argued that they had held back publication until after the 2015 General Election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives in the polls. Roy Greenslade, writing for the Guardian, acknowledged the book might have had more impact in the run up to the election, but argued that [...] "most of the <b>negative</b> <b>stuff</b> is historical, unsurprising and of little real consequence".|$|R
2500|$|In a 1990 article {{reflecting}} on the political campaign, Larry Peterson of The Orange County Register noted [...] "Before Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach, won the primary, various detractors: ... Attacked Rosenberg concerning the est human-potential seminar program led by his brother, Werner Erhard. Rosenberg denied the charges, and Erhard's firm sued Cox's campaign, charging libel and slander. The libel charges were dismissed ... Most of the charges were made in slick brochures mailed almost daily to voters in the district. Sometimes, as in Cox's mailing lambasting Rosenberg for links to what it called Werner Erhard's 'destructive cult,' the sender was identified. But sometimes attackers cloaked themselves in anonymity. That shielded candidates who were responsible for them—or on whose behalf they were made—from the wrath of those who might be turned off by smear tactics." [...] Political consultant Eileen Padberg commented on the negative nature of the campaign [...] "They used <b>negative</b> <b>stuff</b> because it works," [...] and consultant Harvey Englander said that [...] "the negative material gave candidates a way to distinguish themselves from their opponents." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{second and}} final single to be {{released}} from the album was [...] "A Mind of Its Own" [...] on 11 February 2002. The single reached number 6 in the UK and sold 56,500 copies. Rumours soon spread that Beckham was to be dropped by her label for not charting in the Top Three. These were strongly refuted at the time. Beckham commented [...] "You know what newspapers are like, they just like to put all the <b>negative</b> <b>stuff</b> in, but as far as I'm concerned and the record company is concerned it is all great." [...] A third single, [...] "I Wish", was promoted but never materialised. The single version was a remix featuring Robbie Craig, and was performed on TV on Friday Night's All Wright. Following the announcement of Beckham's second pregnancy, the single was shelved. Beckham was reportedly dropped by Virgin Records along with fellow Spice Girls Emma Bunton and Melanie B,; but a statement from her publicist denied reports, stating: [...] "No-one has been dropped. The Virgin deal has come to a natural end and both parties have decided not to continue." ...|$|R
5000|$|The third verse by Wickman's same analysis, [...] "whips {{the camera}} around, {{to turn it}} on Macklemore's more ignorant fans," [...] taking on the voice of a white mom [...] "who asks to take a selfie with Macklemore, praising him {{at the expense of the}} rest of hip-hop, which she backhandedly slanders." [...] In this verse, as Black Lives Matter protesters chant outside, the [...] "mom" [...] tells Macklemore, You're the only hip hop I let my kids listen to, because you get it. All that <b>negative</b> <b>stuff</b> isn't cool. Like all the guns and the drugs, the bitches and hoes, and the gangs and the thugs, even the protest outside, so sad and so dumb [...] - [...] if the cop pulls you over, it's your fault if you run! Wickman notes the [...] "irony" [...] with which many fans {{initially}} seemed to endorse the mom's comments literally on song interpretation site Genius, with such annotations as, [...] "Macklemore makes positive hip-hop and doesn't romanticize bad behavior like most rappers do." [...] The section concludes with samples from white critics of the Black Lives Matter movement, skeptical of the concept of white privilege and believing that they live in a post-racial America.|$|R
500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were mostly positive. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio felt that [...] "most of Ortved's work {{provides}} a solid basic history." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a [...] "B+", writing, [...] "you have to admire all the work that went into this unauthorized history." [...] He noted that he [...] "felt a little bad afterward for the central players who got sucker punched. [...] The subsequent testimony about the empire Groening created is contentious and mesmerizing. It's also conflicting and compromised, since {{some of the biggest}} fishies of all did not talk to Ortved. [...] The reader should be wary when sources assert that Groening is little more than an affable frontman for the show or that Brooks sometimes wielded his power imperiously: The guys aren't there to defend themselves. In most cases, though, Ortved amasses quotes from many sources to establish such points, so the <b>negative</b> <b>stuff</b> doesn't seem gratuitous." [...] Michael C. Lorah of Newsarama described the book as a [...] "very effective, very worthwhile read" [...] but felt that Ortved's [...] "editorializing" [...] was [...] "probably the most distracting element {{of the book}}." [...] Michael Hingston of See Magazine called the book [...] "a well-told patchwork that shines formidable light on the show" [...] and gave it three and a half stars. However, he felt the book was released prematurely and should have been published {{after the end of the}} show, also criticizing Ortved's narration and the lack of quotes from Matt Groening or James L. Brooks. Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club pointed out that the book has [...] "numerous factual errors" [...] that [...] "may only trip the alarms of hardcore fans, but even casual readers may be put off by the book's redundancy." [...] He concluded that despite flaws, the [...] "insight into its routines and eccentric personalities can't help but fascinate." ...|$|R
40|$|Childhood neglect has severe, pervasive, {{negative}} outcomes that often continue into adulthood. As a {{potential source of}} support for both children and adults, companion animals (pets) can both give and receive affection and therefore may be sources of healthy attachment for people who were raised in <b>negative</b> situations. Toy <b>stuffed</b> animals, in contrast, can only receive affection but may still be useful as transitional objects, particularly for people who experienced interpersonal neglect in childhood and {{who are in the}} midst of a transition away from the family home and into college. The current study examined the relationships among childhood neglect, companion animal attachment, and attachment to toy stuffed animals. Undergraduate participants (n = 457) from a large regional university answered questionnaires online. The first hypothesis, that self-reported childhood neglect would be positively related to attachment to companion animals, was supported for women only. Neglected women were more attached to companion animals than were non-neglected women, with a medium effect size. For men, there was no significant effect. The second hypothesis was that childhood neglect would be positively related to attachment to stuffed animals; this hypothesis was not supported. The third hypothesis, that women would be more attached to both companion animals and stuffed animals than would men, was supported. Attachment to companion animals and attachment to stuffed animals were positively related. Results are discussed within a framework of attachment and transitional objects as potential aids to therapy in people who were neglected in childhood...|$|R
