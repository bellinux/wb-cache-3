40|$|A {{diabetic}} {{man with}} no previous history of allergy began to suffer itchy, painful swelling at the sites of injection after three months' treatment with bovine insulin. Insulin specific IgE concentrations (1. 2 - 2. 0 U/ml) were higher than in non-allergic diabetics (mean 0. 4 (SD 0. 06) U/ml) but lower than in most other patients allergic to insulin (1. 0 - 19. 0 U/ml). Standard approaches failed to overcome the allergic reaction, and four separate attempts at desensitisation were unsuccessful. The patient was then given oral insulin 800 U thrice daily together with enteric coated aspirin 1300 mg thrice daily for one week, and subsequent desensitisation with <b>neutral</b> <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> was carried out successfully. On stopping the aspirin the original reactions returned, and aspirin was therefore reinstituted as a permanent part of treatment. Whatever the mechanism in this patient, oral desensitisation and aspirin provided a simple method for treating a difficult condition...|$|E

This study evaluated the potential effect of oral vanadyl sulfate (vanadium) on glycemic status and pancreatic BC of normal and diabetic rats. Methods: Rats were divided into five groups of normal and diabetic. Diabetes was induced with streptozocin (40 mg/kg, i. v.). Normal rats used water (CN) or vanadium (1 mg/ml VOSO 4, VTN). Diabetic rats used water (CD), water plus daily <b>neutral</b> protamine Hagedorn <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> (80 U/kg, ITD) or vanadium (VTD). Blood samples were taken for blood glucose (BG, mg/dL) and insulin (ng/dL) measurements. After two months, the pancreata of sacrificed rats were prepared for islet staining. Results: Pre-treated normal BG was 88 ± 2, and diabetic BG was 395 ± 9. The final B...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Proper <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> {{practice}} {{is essential for}} better diabetic control. This study aims to assess the <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> practice of patients with diabetes. Materials and Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Chitwan Medical College Teaching Hospital, Bharatpur, Nepal, from February 2017 to May 2017. Patients injecting insulin through insulin pens (n= 43) {{for a minimum of}} 4 weeks were consecutively recruited. Patients’ baseline characteristics, current <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> technique, <b>insulin</b> transportation practice, complications of <b>insulin</b> <b>injection,</b> disposal practice of used needle, and acceptability of insulin were recorded. Descriptive statistics were performed using IBM-SPSS 20. 0. Results. The <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> technique of patients and their relatives was inadequate. The majority of patients and their relatives (25, 58. 1 %) mentioned that they transport their insulin cartridge without maintaining cold chain. Thirteen patients (30. 2 %, n= 43) reported complications of <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> and the most common complication among those patients was bruising (10, 76. 9 %, n= 13). Almost all patients disposed the used needle improperly, and the common method was disposing the needle in a dustbin and then transferring to municipal waste disposal vehicle.

40|$|History and Objectives: Due {{to higher}} {{incidence}} of diabetes mellitus in Kashan and reported difficulties regarding <b>insulin</b> <b>injections,</b> {{the present study was}} carried out. Materials and Methods: A quasi experiment was carried out in order to assess the effect of education on reduction of problems associated with <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> on 30 diabetic patients referred to the Diabetic Center of Kashan. Questionnaire sheets were used to select patients trial sheets were used to gather population data and a checklist was used to gather information on the side effect of <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> and fasting blood glucose. Then patients participated in a two-week educational program. A 2 -month trial period was selected in order to patients to apply what they have learned in the program. Fasting blood glucose and other information is then recorded. Results: There is a significant difference on lesions due <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> (P< 0. 001), atrophy (P< 0. 001), hypoglycemic signs (P< 0. 05) and fasting blood glucose (P< 0. 05) was recorded before offering of educational program and 2 month after behavioral changes. Conclusion: Since educational program are very effective on reduction of problems associated with self care among diabetic patients, it is suggested that such programs given due attention in all diabetic center in order to reduce <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> related problems...|$|R

Four males and three females with IDDM (X age = 20. 14 yrs) performed three 18 min submaximal stairclimbing tests at 50 % of their predicted V 02 max on a Stairmaster 4000 PT exercise device. Subjects injected 80 % of their usual pre-breakfast dose of insulin (NPH + R) subcutaneously into the thigh, arm, or abdomen, 5 min prior to each exercise bout. Blood samples were collected before <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> (fasting baseline) and every 3 min during exercise via the fingerstick method. Blood samples were then analyzed for blood glucose. ANOVA revealed no significant statistical differences between the last blood glucose value and preexercise level induced by the three exercise test conditions (p > 0. 05), indicating that <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> sites had no influence on these values. These results indicated that subcutaneous <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> into the leg before leg exercise did not induce a significant drop in blood glucose as compared to subcutaneous <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> into the arm or abdomen. However, the study revealed significant clinical differences within and between subjects' blood glucose responses to exercise, suggesting individualized attention to possible risks of hypoglycemia during exercise for these individuals.

30|$|Since 2006, our centre {{developed}} an empiric protocol for intravenous insulin administration comprising approximately 10 [*]IU Actrapid® (<b>neutral</b> <b>insulin,</b> Novo Nordisk) for BGL >[*] 10 [*]mmol/L, with variable adjustment for insulin sensitivity based upon extremes of {{body mass index}} (BMI) and—if applicable—the patient’s usual insulin requirements. The BGL is closely monitored following <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> until a nadir is reached (i.e., BGL clearly rising again), indicating resolution of biologic insulin effect. Although developed over a decade’s experience, limitations of this experiential approach include operator-dependence and lack of generalizability, in addition to potential delays deliberating over the choice of insulin dosage. We subsequently {{developed an}} insulin nomogram based upon {{the principle of the}} “correction factor” and “insulin sensitivity factor” utilised in personalised diabetic insulin pump therapy (see Additional file  1). This personalised insulin calculator (PIC) was introduced in 2015 to calculate an individualised insulin dosage based upon the degree of blood glucose correction required (determined by BGL at presentation) and estimated insulin sensitivity (determined from BMI and overall body weight). The aim of this audit is to establish the real-world safety, efficacy, and departmental workflow impact of this PIC in comparison to our previous practice.|$|R
40|$|Anesthesiologists and intensivists are encountering {{increasing}} number of diabetic patients in daily clinical practice. Majority of such patients may require <b>insulin</b> <b>injections</b> for control of hyperglycemia. Advancements in diabetes management have led to usage of newer <b>insulin</b> <b>injections</b> ranging from human insulin and insulin analogs to glucagon-like peptides- 1 analogs. The adequacy of glycemic control and successful outcome with such therapeutic interventions depends upon the adoption of correct injection techniques and procedures. Peri-operative and critically ill diabetic patients are highly prone to develop acute complications of diabetes if appropriate therapeutic strategies are not formulated and implemented. As such, the in-depth knowledge and awareness about various injection technique guidelines is essential from the patient care and healthcare provider′s perspective in the operative and critical care settings.
