25|$|<b>Network</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Protocol</b> (NTP) is a {{networking}} {{protocol for}} clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP {{is one of}} the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.|$|E
25|$|A {{less complex}} {{implementation}} of NTP, {{using the same}} protocol but without requiring the storage of state over extended periods of time, {{is known as the}} Simple <b>Network</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Protocol</b> (SNTP). It is used in some embedded devices and in applications where full NTP capability is not required.|$|E
50|$|A {{software-based}} clock must be set {{each time}} its computer is turned on. Originally {{this was done}} by computer operators. When the Internet became commonplace, <b>network</b> <b>time</b> <b>protocols</b> were used to automatically set clocks of this type.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>network</b> <b>time</b> <b>protocols</b> such as NTP (at a coarse granularity) and IEEE 1588 (at a fine granularity) gives a relatively consistent global notion {{of time that}} has the potential to significantly change how we design distributed real-time systems. In [4], we present a programming model called PTIDES (Programming Temporally Integrated Distributed Embedded Systems) that uses discrete-event (DE) models as programming specifications for distributed real-time systems and describe an execution model that permits out of order processing of events without sacrificing determinacy and without requiring backtracking. In this paper, we present an interesting networked camera application programmed using PTIDES and show how the execution model in [4] can be used to meet real-time constrains in the system. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper studies {{models of}} computation, {{software}} techniques, and analytical models for distributed timed systems. By “timed systems ” we mean those where timeliness {{is an essential}} part of the behavior. By “distributed systems ” we mean computational systems that are interconnected on a <b>network.</b> Applications of <b>timed</b> distributed systems include industrial automation, distributed immersive environments, advanced instrumentation systems, networked control systems, and many modern embedded software systems that integrate networking. The introduction of <b>network</b> <b>time</b> <b>protocols</b> such as NTP (at a coarse granularity) and IEEE 1588 (at a fine granularity) makes possible time coherence that has not traditionally been part of the computational models in networked systems. The main question we address in this paper is: Given time synchronization with some known precision, how does this change how distributed applications are designed and developed? A second question we address is: How can time synchronization help with realizing coordinated real-time events. ...|$|R
25|$|Not all clocks {{implement}} leap {{seconds in}} the same manner as UTC. Leap seconds in Unix time are commonly implemented by repeating the last second of the day. <b>Network</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Protocol</b> freezes time during the leap second.

25|$|Mills was the {{chairman}} of the Gateway Algorithms and Data Structures Task Force (GADS) and the first chairman of the Internet Architecture Task Force. He invented the <b>Network</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Protocol</b> (1981), the DEC LSI-11 based fuzzball router that was used for the 56 kbit/s NSFNET (1985), the Exterior Gateway Protocol (1984), and inspired the author of ping (1983). He is an emeritus professor at the University of Delaware.|$|E
25|$|Arguments {{against the}} {{proposal}} include the unknown expense {{of such a}} major change {{and the fact that}} universal time will no longer correspond to mean solar time. It is also answered that two timescales that do not follow leap seconds are already available, International Atomic Time (TAI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) time. Computers, for example, could use these and convert to UTC or local civil time as necessary for output. Inexpensive GPS timing receivers are readily available, and the satellite broadcasts include the necessary information to convert GPS time to UTC. It is also easy to convert GPS time to TAI, as TAI is always exactly 19 seconds ahead of GPS time. Examples of systems based on GPS time include the CDMA digital cellular systems IS-95 and CDMA2000. In general, computer systems use UTC and synchronize their clocks using <b>Network</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Protocol</b> (NTP). Systems that cannot tolerate disruptions caused by leap seconds can base their time on TAI and use Precision Time Protocol. However, the BIPM has pointed out that this proliferation of timescales leads to confusion.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} dependency of critical infrastructure on synchronized clocks, <b>network</b> <b>time</b> synchronization <b>protocols</b> have become an attractive target for attackers. We identify data origin authentication as the key security objective and suggest to employ recently proposed high-performance digital signature schemes (Ed 25519 and MQQ-SIG)) as foundation of a novel set of security measures to secure multicast time synchronization. We conduct experiments to verify the computational and communication efficiency for using these signatures in the standard <b>time</b> synchronization <b>protocols</b> NTP and PTP. We propose additional security measures to prevent replay attacks and to mitigate delay attacks. Our proposed solutions cover 1 -step mode for NTP and PTP and we extend our security measures specifically to 2 -step mode (PTP) and show {{that they have no}} impact on time synchronization's precision...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wireless {{sensor network}} (MSN) is a {{wirelessly}} interconnected network. WSN promises {{a wide range}} of potential such as surveillance, military and civilian, to name just a few, applications. A sensor node senses the environment and delivers data to the sink. Energy saving is {{one of the keys to}} challenge <b>network</b> life <b>time.</b> LEACH <b>protocol</b> has been incorporated to extend <b>network</b> life <b>time.</b> This <b>protocol</b> forms clusters of the sensor nodes and elect one of them to become a Cluster Head (CH) to route data cluster to sink. In cluster, communication uses TDMA technique. This latter organizes transmission time (Time Slot) which corresponds to each node member of cluster. When a node dies, time slot corresponding to this node will be free. In this paper, we will present LEACH comportments after a node dies, then we will propose some ideas to invest its time slots by alive node members to maximize data reception time parameter so throughput end-to-end. This parameter is very important for real-time data. Finally, we will simulate this idea with Network Simulator (NS 2) to argue for our propositions.

40|$|Abstract — A {{fundamental}} {{building block}} in distributed wire-less sensor <b>networks</b> is <b>time</b> synchronization. Given resource constrained nature of sensor <b>networks,</b> traditional <b>time</b> synchro-nization <b>protocols</b> {{cannot be used}} in sensor networks. Previous {{research has focused on}} developing various energy efficient <b>time</b> synchronization <b>protocols</b> tailored for these networks. However, many of these protocols have not been designed with security in mind. In this paper, we describe FTSP {{which is one of the}} major <b>time</b> synchronization <b>protocols</b> for sensor networks. We outline the adverse effects of the time synchronization attacks on some important sensor network applications, and explain the set of possible attacks on FTSP. We then propose a number of countermeasures to mitigate the effect of the security attacks. We implement these attack scenarios on a sensor network testbed. We show the extent each attack is successful in desynchronizing the network. Finally, we propose countermeasures and implement them on our sensor network testbed to validate their usefulness in mitigating security attacks. We show that adding a sequence number filter to the original FTSP helps mitigate the effect of attacks on this protocol. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} {{synchronization}} protocols for dense, large-scale sensor networks is presented. The protocols {{build on the}} recent work of Hong, Cheow, and Scaglione [5, 6] in which the synchronization update rules are modeled by a system of pulse-coupled oscillators. In the present work, we define a class of models that converge to a synchronized state based on the local communication topology of the sensor network only, thereby lifting the all-to-all communication requirement implicit in [5, 6]. Under some rather mild assumptions of the connectivity of the <b>network</b> over <b>time,</b> these <b>protocols</b> still converge to a synchronized state when the communication topology is time varying.

The IEEE 802. 11 standard allows {{for the use of}} multiple channels available at the physical layer, but its MAC protocol is designed only for a single channel. A single-channel MAC protocol does not work well in a multi-channel environment, because of the multi-channel hidden terminal problem. Our proposed protocol enables hosts to utilize multiple channels by switching channels dynamically, thus increasing network throughput while increasing <b>network</b> analysis <b>time.</b> The <b>protocol</b> requires only one transceiver per host, but solves the multi-channel hidden terminal problem using temporal synchronization.

In this kind of wireless network, mobile nodes such as mobile phones and PDAs, use the mobility of devices as well as wireless forwarding between intermediate nodes to communicate with each other, hence a complete route between source and destination is not required at any point in time. The design of efficient forwarding protocols for opportunistic networks is a research challenge due to the absence of a priori information about the topological development of the <b>network</b> over <b>time.</b> Forwarding <b>protocols</b> in opportunistic networks usually employ only mobile devices to facilitate data forwarding.

Applications range from oil prospecting and transportation to aquaculture, and include pollution control, climate recording, prediction of natural disturbances, search and survey missions, etc. The high attenuation of electromagnetic waves in underwater medium precludes them from being used as the information vehicle. Therefore, acoustic waves are the most viable alternative for the transmission. Nevertheless, the underwater acoustic channel is not free of drawbacks. On the contrary, it exhibits important obstacles that must be overcome if communication networks are to be implemented in the future.
