5|$|Vermigli's {{move away}} from {{orthodox}} Catholic belief became apparent in 1539 when he preached on 1 Corinthians 3:9–17, a passage commonly used as proof {{of the doctrine of}} purgatory. Vermigli did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> view in his preaching, though he did not openly deny the existence of purgatory. Gaetano da Thiene, an opponent of the spirituali, reported his suspicions of Vermigli to the Spanish viceroy of Naples Don Pedro de Toledo, who prohibited Vermigli's preaching. The prohibition was removed on Vermigli's appeal to Rome, with which he received some help from powerful friends he had made in Padua, such as Cardinals Pole and Bembo. Despite this controversy, Vermigli continued to rise in the Lateran Congregation. He was made one of four visitors by the chapter-general in 1540. The visitors assisted the rector general by inspecting the Congregation's religious houses.|$|E

25|$|By regulation, National Guard {{pilots were}} {{required}} to take and pass an annual physical {{in order to remain}} in flight status, in the three months prior to a pilot's birthday (in Bush's case, July 6).

As a result of his failure to take his physical, his flight status was suspended by his commander on August 1, 1972, confirmed by Col Bobby Hodges on September 5, 1972, and confirmed again by a National Guard Bureau order on September 29, 1972, which meant he no longer was authorized to fly as a pilot.|$|E

25|$|Japan's society prepares {{its people}} to work {{primarily}} {{for the good of}} the whole society rather than just the individual, and the salaryman is a part of that. Salarymen are expected to work long hours, additional overtime, to participate in after-work leisure activities such as drinking and visiting hostess bars with colleagues, and to value work over all else. The salaryman typically enters a company after graduating college and stays with that corporation his whole career. Other popular notions surrounding salarymen include karōshi, or death from overwork. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is the expected career choice for young men and those who do <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word salaryman is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality.|$|E
25|$|By November 1951, Wilkins had {{evidence}} that DNA in cells {{as well as}} purified DNA had a helical structure. Alex Stokes had solved the basic mathematics of helical diffraction theory and thought that Wilkins's X-ray diffraction data indicated a helical structure in DNA. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center. Upon viewing {{the model of the}} proposed structure, Franklin told Watson and Crick that it was wrong. Franklin based this on two observations. First, experiments by J.M. Gulland showed that the CO- and NH2 groups of the bases could not be titrated, and so were probably inaccessible. Secondly, crystallographic evidence showed that the structural units of DNA were progressively separated by the addition of water, leading to the formation of a gel and then a solution. Franklin believed that the simplest explanation of this was for the hydrophilic part of the molecule to be on the outside. Crick tried to get Wilkins to continue with additional molecular modeling efforts, but Wilkins did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> approach.|$|E

500|$|British {{officials}} in Upper Canada were delighted and {{encouraged by the}} success of the Indians, whom they had been supporting and arming for years, and in 1792 Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe proposed that the entire territory, plus a strip of New York and Vermont be erected into an Indian barrier state. While the British government did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> proposal up, it did inform the Washington administration that it would not relinquish the Northwest forts, even if the U.S. paid its overdue debts. Also, early in 1794, the British built a new garrison, Fort Miami, along the Maumee River—about [...] southwest of Fort Detroit—as a show of presence and support for the resistance.|$|E
500|$|Many critics did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> {{explanation}} seriously. UMNO was {{in crisis}} at the time, with Mahathir's faction narrowly defeating Razaleigh's {{in the party}} elections. Razaleigh's supporters filed a lawsuit alleging irregularities in the election process which appeared likely to succeed, triggering new party elections. In this context, one MCA politician charged {{that the government had}} pursued a [...] "hidden agenda," [...] deflecting public attention from UMNO's crisis with a [...] "deviation in the implementation of the Chinese education policy." [...] The Tunku himself claimed that Mahathir used the issue to mobilise the Malays [...] "as a united force to a common enemy — and the imaginary enemy in this case was the Chinese community." ...|$|E
500|$|Controversy also {{arose from}} the YOG {{attendance}} policy in Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School, a local primary school. The school stated that a S$5 refundable deposit was required from students who attend the YOG events on a non-school day. The principal, Clifford Chua, {{said that it was}} to [...] "ensure that our children learn the value of responsibility and <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> rare opportunity for granted, by wasting the ticket and depriving others of the chance". Also, the deposit was returned even if the child did not attend the event. However, the move garnered mixed reactions from parents, who either supported the idea or felt it was not the right way to do things. Some other schools such as Nanyang Girls High School, Bukit View Primary School and Park View Primary School gave free tickets to their students while Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) encouraged co-pay of $1 to $2 by the students to teach them to treasure their tickets.|$|E
