5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an unusual length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, unusual techniques.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2012, Edge (with {{his usual}} long hair cut short) was {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame by Christian, during WrestleMania XXVIII weekend. Edge made a surprise appearance on the April 23, 2012 episode of Raw, confronting his long-time rival John Cena about Brock Lesnar. He mentioned that despite sharing the biggest rivalry of their careers, they always shared mutual admiration for professional wrestling. In an act of motivation, he told Cena to 'wake up' and beat Brock Lesnar. He also mentioned beforehand that he was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the show that night, also declaring that he would no longer be under contract with WWE in a couple of days. After this, his contract with the WWE had legitimately expired. On the September 21, 2012 episode of SmackDown, Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{young woman}} named Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins a new career at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary. She is excited {{to be working in}} Manhattan, but finds herself {{overwhelmed}} by her new surroundings. The office manager, Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), a voluptuously beautiful and capable woman, proves more intimidating than helpful as she gives advice on how to be appealing to the men of the office and how that will lead to both success in the office and a good marriage. Peggy is dismayed to find a secretary in the bathroom crying. A junior account executive named Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, causing Don to rebuke him. On her break, Peggy goes to the office of a doctor recommended by the all-knowing Joan, where she gets a prescription for the recently introduced birth control pill, which at the time was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prescribed to unmarried women or married women without their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a subtle, sexually inviting gesture to Don, but he definitively rejects her advances.|$|E

The Nelson-sung [...] "It's <b>Not</b> <b>Suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> That Way" [...] and [...] "If You Can Touch Her at All" [...] had appeared on Jennings' 1974 album This Time (which Nelson had co-produced), as had the song [...] "Pick Up The Tempo," [...] which is featured on this LP as a duet. Nelson's guitar playing is noticeably absent on the recording.|$|R

Three people were killed, and damage was estimated at over $1 million (1970 dollars). The Soviet ship was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Active Pass, and as such, the Soviet government was forced to compensate BC Ferries.|$|E
25|$|But {{the same}} was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true for light, since Maxwell's {{mathematics}} demanded a single universal speed for the propagation of light, based, not on local conditions, but on two measured properties, the permittivity and permeability of free space, that were assumed {{to be the same}} throughout the universe. If these numbers did change, there should be noticeable effects in the sky; stars in different directions would have different colours, for instance.|$|E

25|$|A {{distinctive}} type of painting, combining {{elements of}} the portrait, history, and genre painting was the tronie. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important, but they might represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. Jan Lievens and Rembrandt, many of whose self-portraits are also tronies (especially his etched ones), were among those who developed the genre.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that Nassau Senior had written the report before the data was collected– therefore evidence was used selectively to meet the pre-written report. Of the questionnaires sent out only 10% replied {{and some of the}} questioned directed a certain response. However, the inquiry was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> impartial, the commission wanted to change the existing system, and keeping the current system was not considered an option. The questionnaires used asked leading questions that were poorly framed leading to responses that were ambiguous or irrelevant.|$|E

25|$|An Estonian oil {{syndicate}} {{became a}} joint Estonian-Soviet enterprise in 1928 and Päts {{was hired by}} it as a legal consultant in 1930. His annual salary was $4,000, which was {{twice as much as}} the State Elder earned and more than eight times as muchs as Päts earned {{as a member of the}} Riigikogu. The purpose of the joint enterprise for the Soviets was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> business-related, but only to attract Päts. This official salary by the Soviet Union has thus been seen as the salary for his long-term cooperation with the Soviets. After Päts's coup d'état, the Soviet Union increased economic cooperation with Estonian enterprises.|$|E
25|$|After {{the body}} of Uthman {{had been in the}} house for three days, Naila, Uthman's wife, {{approached}} some of his supporters to help in his burial, but only about a dozen people responded. These included Marwan, Zayd ibn Thabit, 'Huwatib bin Alfarah, Jubayr ibn Mut'im, Abu Jahm bin Hudaifa, Hakim bin Hazam and Niyar bin Mukarram. The body was lifted at dusk, and because of the blockade, no coffin could be procured. The body was not washed, as Islamic teaching states that martyrs' bodies are <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> washed before burial. Thus, Uthman was carried to the graveyard in the clothes that he was wearing {{at the time of his}} assassination.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{requirement}} that shevi'it produce be consumed for personal use and cannot be sold or put in trash. For this reason, there are various special rules regarding the religious use of products that are normally made from agricultural produce. Some authorities hold that Hannukah candles cannot be made from shevi'it oils because the light of Channukah candles is <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for personal use, while Shabbat candles can be because their light {{can be used for}} personal use. For similar reasons, some authorities hold that if the Havdalah ceremony is performed using wine made from shevi'it grapes, the cup should be drunk completely and the candle should not be dipped into the wine to extinguish the flame as is normally done.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{earliest}} days of the team, the number 31 was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> issued to any other player. The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' In the first three decades of the team's existence, the number 31 was only seen once: in 1969, when reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber damaged his number 36 jersey during a game, equipment manager Tony Marchitte gave him the number 31 jersey to wear while repairing the number 36. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice James (J.D.) Williams wore it for his first two seasons.|$|E
25|$|One {{subject the}} laws did cover {{is how the}} king fit within {{the rest of the}} legal system. The king was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> above the law. In fact, some stipulations applied {{specifically}} to the king. However, as the king was the most powerful individual, and the one with the highest honour in an area, it was difficult to enforce the law against him. Although it might have been possible to proceed against the king as against any other, the laws also had an innovative solution to this quandary. Instead of enforcing against the king directly, a dependent of the king known as an aithech fortha (substitute churl) was enforced against instead, and the king was responsible for repaying the substitute churl. The laws also specified certain cases in which a king lost his honour price. These included doing the work of a commoner, moving around without a retinue, and showing cowardice in battle; again, though, it is unclear how often such stipulations were followed.|$|E
25|$|The Preface to {{the poem}} {{suggests}} that the poem was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> printed, {{that it was a}} fragmentary work that he was unable to complete, and that the work itself was provided to him through involuntary inspiration. When the Preface is dropped, the poem seems to compare the act of poetry with the might of Kubla Khan instead of the loss of inspiration causing the work to have a more complex depiction of the poetic power. Taken together, the Preface could connect with {{the first half of the}} poem to suggest that the poem is from the view of a dreaming narrator, or it could connect with the second half of the poem to show how a reader is to interpret the lines by connecting himself with the persona in a negative manner. The Preface and the poem are different in their locations, as the Preface discusses Coleridge's England while the poem discusses ancient China, but both discuss the role of the poem and his abilities. The poet of the Preface is a dreamer who must write and the poet of the poem is a vocal individual, but both are poets who lose inspiration. Only the poet of the poem feels that he can recover the vision, and the Preface, like a Coleridge poem that is quoted in it, The Picture, states that visions are unrecoverable.|$|E
