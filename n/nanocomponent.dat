The layers of less than 1 monolayer thick contain up to 4 monomeric components. For monocis- and dicisisomers of the dyes studied, which are obtained from the all-trans form upon rotation of fragments of a molecule around different bonds in the conjugated chain, the steric models were constructed.

This type of slow-release formulation is fundamental for anionic herbicide as Imazamox, because its high soil mobility.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the self-assembly of <b>nanocomponents</b> into a virus, nanocapsule, {{or other}} composite structure is analyzed via a multiscale approach. The {{objective is to}} achieve predictability and to preserve key atomic-scale features that underlie the formation and stability of the composite structures. We start with an all-atom description, the Liouville equation, and the order parameters characterizing nanoscale features of the system. An equation of Smoluchowski type for the stochastic dynamics of the order parameters {{is derived from the}} Liouville equation via a multiscale perturbation technique. The self-assembly of composite structures from <b>nanocomponents</b> with internal atomic structure is analyzed and growth rates are derived. Applications include the assembly of a viral capsid from capsomers, a ribosome from its major subunits, and composite materials from fibers and nanoparticles. Our approach overcomes errors in other coarse-graining methods which neglect the influence of the nanoscale configuration on the atomistic fluctuations. We account for the effect of order parameters on the statistics of the atomistic fluctuations which contribute to the entropic and average forces driving order parameter evolution. This approach enables an efficient algorithm for computer simulation of self-assembly, whereas other methods severely limit the timestep due to the separation of diffusional and complexing characteristic times. Given that our approach does not require recalibration with each new application, it provides a way to estimate assembly rates and thereby facilitate the discovery of self-assembly pathways and kinetic dead-end structures.

40|$|Recently, the {{integration}} {{of a wide range}} of <b>nanocomponents</b> has been investigated for building patterned or layered structures on the macroscopic and mesoscopic scale. In order to break through the issues of current devices and develop diverse and reliable applications from nanobiomaterials to nanoelectronics, it is necessary to fabricate nano-devices and systems using <b>nanocomponents.</b> However, traditional fabrication methods have required the modification of these nanomaterials, and need new approaches for the advancement of development for diverse and reliable applications. In this dissertation, two novel methods are demonstrated for pragmatic nano devices and systems : Controlling extrinsic nanoparticle alignment by electrical field deposition, and intrinsic DNA binding through photolithography. First, the use of nanoparticles' electrophoretic deposition (EPD) onto porous biodegradable polymer allows the production of transparent flexible carbon nanotube network films with mechanical strength. Most importantly, after solvent treatment, the opaque substrate changed to transparent with conductivity. Thus, we produced flexible transparent films. Another unique aspect of this process is that after solvent treatment, the substrate can be implanted onto newspapers or cloth. Second, we demonstrate a DNA double write process that represents, which allows DNA to be used as a unique material for UV patterning, with subsequent selfassembly via the hybridization of complementary DNA sequences. This novel method allows true synergy for combining top-down photolithography with bottom-up selfassembly.
