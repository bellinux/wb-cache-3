5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management strategy {{is similar to the}} impact of such <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of biodiversity. This strategy is declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{under which}} <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> occur are {{influenced}} mainly by climate, weather, and location. Fire disturbances will only occur {{in areas where}} there is low precipitation, some form of ignition (typically lightning), and enough flammable biomass to allow fire to spread. Conditions often occur {{as part of a}} cycle and disturbances may be periodic. Other disturbances, such as those caused by humans, invasive species or impact events, can occur anywhere and are not necessarily cyclic. Extinction vortices may result in multiple disturbances or a greater frequency of a single disturbance. Immediately after a disturbance there is a pulse of recruitment or regrowth under conditions of little competition for space or other resources. After the initial pulse, recruitment slows since once an individual plant is established {{it is very difficult to}} displace. Due to the varying forms of disturbance this directly impacts the organisms which will exploit the disturbance and create diversity within an ecosystem.|$|E

40|$|Bottom trawl fishing has {{widespread}} {{impacts on}} benthic habitats and communities. The benthic response to trawling {{seems to be}} smaller or absent in areas exposed to high <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance,</b> leading to the hypothesis that <b>natural</b> and trawl <b>disturbance</b> affect benthic communities in a similar way. However, systematic tests of this hypothesis at large spatial scales and with data from sites spanning a large range of <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance</b> do not exist. Here, we {{examine the effects of}} trawl and natural (tidal-bed shear stress) disturbance on benthic communities over gradients of commercial bottom trawling effort in 8 areas in the North and Irish Seas. Using a traitbased approach, that classified species by life-history strategies or by characteristics that provide a proxy for their role in community function, we found support for the hypothesis that trawl and <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance</b> affect benthic communities in similar ways. Both sources of disturbance caused declines in long-living, hard-bodied (exoskeleton) and suspension-feeding organisms. Given these similar impacts, there was no detectable trawling effect on communities exposed to high <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Conversely, in 3 out of 5 areas with low bed shear stress, responses to trawling were detected and resulted in community compositions comparable with those in areas subject to high <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance,</b> with communities being composed of either small-sized, deposit-feeding animals or mobile scavengers and predators. The findings highlight that knowledge of the interacting effects of trawl and <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance</b> will help to identify areas that are more or less resilient to trawling and support the development of management plans that account for the environmental effects of fishing. </p...|$|R

2500|$|In the United States in 2004 (the {{most recent}} year for which EPA {{statistics}} are available), forests sequestered 10.6% (637 MegaTonnes) of the carbon dioxide released in the United States by the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas; 5657 MegaTonnes).

[...] In Canada, reducing timber harvesting would have very little impact on carbon dioxide emissions because of the combination of harvest and stored carbon in manufactured wood products along with the regrowth of the harvested forests. Additionally, the amount of carbon released from harvesting is small compared to the amount of carbon lost each year to forest fires and other <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{approach was}} used to assess the effect of dredging induced changes in sediment composition, under different conditions of <b>natural</b> physical <b>disturbance,</b> for the structure and function of marine benthic macrofaunal communities. Results showed the sensitivity of macrofaunal communities increased as both the proportion of gravel increased and the level of <b>natural</b> physical <b>disturbance</b> decreased. These findings may be explained by the close association of certain taxa with the gravel fraction, and the influence of <b>natural</b> physical <b>disturbance</b> which, as it increases, tends to restrict the colonisation by these species.

40|$|AbstractEcological {{integrity}} of managed forests includes {{the ability of}} an ecosystem to support a community of organisms with a similar species composition and functional organization as found in nearby natural systems. We developed an indicator system for ecological integrity based on simulated <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance</b> and indicator species to test if forest condition and habitat in managed forests are similar to that found or expected in natural systems. We then applied the method {{in an area of}} the boreal forest (Ontario, Canada) where the objective of Ontario's strategic forest management planning approach is, in part, to conserve ecological integrity through the emulation of the <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance</b> process. Forest condition controls the supply of habitat to support the diversity of native organisms, and historically in boreal forests the <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance</b> process drove forest condition. We selected indicators of forest condition (landscape pattern and compositional mosaic) and habitat function (occupancy rates for a broad range of forest birds), and applied our assessment system to test whether indicators of forest condition and habitat function reflect outcomes expected if <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance</b> processes were successfully emulated. We collected occupancy data in natural and managed forest disturbance types using autonomous acoustic recorders, applied occupancy/detection modeling to estimate corrected occupancy rates (ψ), and then tested for differences in ψ between disturbance types. Some indicators of forest condition were within the range expected under <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance,</b> but we found relatively less old conifer, more young deciduous and greater edge density in managed forests relative to forests of <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance</b> origin. Most species (11 of 14) occurred with equal ψ in habitat originating from the two disturbance types. Brown creeper (Certhia americana), bay-breasted warbler (Mniotilta varia) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus) differed between disturbance types. Brown creeper uses older conifer and occurred at lower rates in managed forest, while red-eyed vireo uses a range of deciduous forest ages, and occurred at higher rates in managed forest. Differences in quantity and/or quality of specific habitat types likely explain the responses. The results suggest what directional changes in the forest pattern and compositional mosaic would improve ecological similarity with natural systems, but also indicate what further research is required. We believe this approach to assessing ecological integrity can be adapted to study the effectiveness of conservation management strategies in other systems, and will contribute to adaptive management approaches and evidence-based policy development...|$|R

50|$|It is also {{important}} to recognize that old-growth forests are not static and may not be a permanent fixture on the landscape.
