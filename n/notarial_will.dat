Chateau-Vieux, {{in spite of}} the <b>notarial</b> protest, <b>will</b> not march a step. As many as four thousand National Guards are dropping or pouring in; uncertain what is expected of them, still more uncertain what will be obtained of them. For all is uncertainty, commotion, and suspicion: there goes a word that Bouille, beginning to bestir himself in the rural Cantonments eastward, is but a Royalist traitor; that Chateau-Vieux and Patriotism are sold to Austria, of which latter M. de Malseigne is probably some agent. Mestre-de-Camp and Roi flutter still more questionably: Chateau-Vieux, far from marching, 'waves red flags out of two carriages,' in a passionate manner, along the streets; and next morning answers its Officers: [...] "Pay us, then; and we will march with you to the world's end!" ...|$|R

The definitive publisher-authenticated version Journal of Social History, 2011, 45 (2), pp. 335 - 344 is available online at: [URL] section centers on the life histories {{of men and women}} who were mobile in and around the Indian Ocean during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The articles that follow focus on soldiers, slaves, convicts, pirates, sailors, rebels, traders and travelers; people who are usually given the briefest of historical mention as somehow typical of a particular community, or who are referred to as evidence of particular historical processes or moments in time. In contrast, the collection's authors seek to piece together archival fragments from across the globe to write a series of individual life histories, and to use them as a means of exploring historically the nature, meaning and lived experiences of empire in the Indian Ocean: Dutch, French, British and Malagasy. The individuals that we center on did not write or record their own auto biographies, but left traces of their lives in the archives. Each author has engaged in piecing together and contextualizing these fragments, to present biographical snapshots produced in and through <b>notarial</b> records, <b>wills,</b> inventories, petitions, letters, diaries, court records and official correspondence [...] . The aim of this collection is not to unveil and present the lives of “typical” men and women of the Indian Ocean. Rather, its ambition is to use life history as a critical perspective to explore the practices and processes associated with imperial expansion in the Indian Ocean and the ways in which individuals lived them.

40|$|The {{battle of}} papers: Notes on the Tensions between Written Procedures and Memory in the Agrarian Regularization of Quilombo Lands in Brazil Abstract This {{article is a}} {{reflection}} on the processes of land regularization enacted by the section 68 of the Temporary Constitutional Provisions Act of 1988 in Brazil and its deployment in the State administrative routines. We believe that new elements have been imposed and we should consider them when thinking about reparation policies and recognition of the recipients of these constitutional provisions. We use the expression “the battle of papers” {{to refer to the}} negotiations obstructed by the State <b>notarial</b> procedures. Efforts <b>will</b> be made to show the situations in which the struggle for social recognition challenges the idea in which it is conceived that the runaway slaves demand is merely territorial. Observed in their various confrontations, these processes conceal a moral vocation, led by the runaway slaves, that overflows the logical demand for the “World of papers” and allows us to visualize the tensions on the ways of materializing, moved from orality to writing, conducted by notions of science and permeated by notary logic. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} Dante’s so-called “debts”, {{the most}} sizeable {{of which were}} guaranteed by his relatives and friends. Out of these loans, those contracted for the highest amounts remained unsettled even decades after the agreed repayment date. The salient features of the Florentine notarial contracts stipulated ex causa mutui during the age of Dante will be discussed. Particular attention {{will be given to}} the difference between the sum of money which was actually given in loan and the sum declared in the document, the duration of the contract, the personal guarantees requested and the relationship between notarial records and private account books. The different uses of the <b>notarial</b> instrumentum mutui <b>will</b> be illustrated, from its implementation on the debtor’s estate to the transfer of the negotiable instrument to third parties. In certain instances, fictive debts (ad defensionem) were contracted with the aid of trusted friends and other individuals who acted as figureheads (in order to defend the assets of the bankrupt, thus damaging the mass of creditors, for example) or else constructed {{in such a way as}} to define a priority of mortgages on the assets of the debtors. Even in this latter case, possible or feared actions undertaken by third parties, which could compromise the debtor’s assets, were immediately deflected in order to avoid repercussions...|$|R

Almost all the Towns and Villages hereabouts are so plundered out, that many a one now has nothing {{but what he}} carries on his body. Plundering was universal: and no sooner was one party away, than another came, and still another; and often the same house was {{three or four times}} plundered. Branderode, a Village two leagues from this [stands on the Field of Rossbach, if we look], is so ruined out, that nobody almost has {{anything}} left: Chief Inspector Baron von Bose's Schloss there, with its splendid appointments, they ruined utterly; took all money, victuals, valuables, furniture, clothes, linen and beds, all they could carry; what could not be carried away, they cut, hewed and smashed to pieces; broke the wine-casks; and even tore up the documents and letters they found lying in the place. Branderode Dorf was twice set fire to by them; and was, at last, with Zeuchfeld, which is an Amtsdorf,--after both had been plundered,--reduced to ashes. The Churches of Branderode and Zeuchfeld, with several other Churches, were plundered; the altars broken, the altar-cloths and other vestures cut to pieces, and the sacred vessels and cups carried away,--except [for we have a <b>notarial</b> exactness, and <b>will</b> exaggerate nothing] {{that in the case of}} Branderode they sent the cup back. Of the pollution of the altars, and of the blasphemous songs these people sang in the churches, one cannot think without horror.|$|R
