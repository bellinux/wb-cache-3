5000|$|A similar game, {{referred}} to as a [...] "Luring Lottery", was actually played by the editors of Scientific American in the 1980s. To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number [...] "1" [...] written on it. They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a single postcard bearing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> they wished to submit. The prize was one million dollars divided by the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry. Thus a reader who submitted a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> increased his or her chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize. It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one's average winnings in this game by submitting a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> equal to the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> <b>of</b> others. Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> being submitted.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase- 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor, {{may have}} various {{effects on the}} central nervous system via the nitric oxide (NO) -cyclic {{guanosine}} monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. Preclinical studies have shown the controversial effect of sildenafil on anxiety-like behavior in animals. This study was undertaken to investigate the acute effect of sildenafil on anxiety-like behavior in mice. Methods: Male mice were intraperitoneally (i. p.) administrated sildenafil (1, 2, or 10 mg/kg), and the control group was given the vehicle 15 min before the plus-maze test. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> into the open arms of the plus-maze, the time spent in the open arms, and the total <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> into the arms were recorded. Results: The results indicated that compared to the control group, the sildenafil-treated mice spent more time in the open arms and had a greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> into open arms. The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> into the arms did not significantly differ between the sildenafil-treated groups and the control group. Discussion: Acute administration of sildenafil could have anxiolytic effects on male mice. This effect might be mediated in a time-dependent manner by the NO/ cGMP/PDE 5 pathway...|$|R
