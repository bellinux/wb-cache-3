5000|$|In September 1996 {{the station}} {{relocated}} to premises in the Somerset Mall {{from where the}} volunteer presenters and a full-time staff of six kept the station going. Radio Helderberg {{has grown from a}} charitable association to a business, flourishing on <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> only.|$|R
25|$|Teddy Johnson – {{joined in}} May 1948 {{and he and}} Everitt ran the English service in Luxembourg by {{themselves}} until 1950 {{due to the lack}} of <b>advertising</b> <b>income.</b> Then Johnson returned to England to develop his singing career and later returned to join Pete Murray.|$|R
5000|$|PRS, {{which is}} now in {{alliance}} with MCPS, collects royalties from music-users and distributes them directly to [...] "song-writers" [...] and [...] "publishers" [...] whose works are performed live, on radio or on TV on a 50:50 basis. MCPS licenses music for broadcast in the range 3 to 5.25% of <b>net</b> <b>advertising</b> revenues.|$|R
50|$|Vanni Treves, Channel 4s former Chairman, {{urged the}} station to cancel the show even though Big Brother was Channel 4s most financially {{successful}} television programme, accounting for around seven per cent of its total £800 million <b>advertising</b> <b>income.</b> However Celebrity Big Brother was suspended on 24 August 2007.|$|R
50|$|BackTrack is {{a monthly}} magazine, {{published}} by Pendragon Publishing, concentrating on researched articles and photographic features about British and Irish railway history. It {{is available through}} newsagents in the UK and by subscription from the publisher, but does not rely on <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> and therefore does not publish an ABC circulation figure.|$|R
5000|$|However, even in {{the largest}} of markets, the decline of AM radio is such that some {{stations}} are no longer economically viable. XEDA-AM in Mexico City signed off in May 2015 after seeing listenership, commercial <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> and federal government advertising all drop; its owner stated that [...] "there's no market for AM".|$|R
50|$|Also {{because of}} all those reasons Ukrainian media depend much on {{political}} advertising, with obvious consequence on its bias. In 2009 direct political advertising for the presidential election accounted {{for as much as}} 23.5% of all television <b>advertising</b> <b>income,</b> but presidential candidates also use hidden advertising widely so real percentage is higher, yet unknown.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, a form {{of racial}} {{discrimination}} exists in NBA basketball, as white players received higher salaries than do blacks related to actual performance. Funk says {{this may be due}} to viewer discrimination. Viewership increases when there is greater participation by white players, which means higher <b>advertising</b> <b>incomes.</b> This explains much of the salary gap.|$|R
50|$|From its {{inception}} in 1955, ITN was originally owned jointly by all the ITV operating companies, the shares split roughly in proportion to each company's <b>advertising</b> <b>income.</b> However the 1990 Broadcasting Act limited the ITV companies to a maximum joint 49% stake, with no single company allowed more than a 20% holding. These requirements were abolished by the Communications Act 2003.|$|R
50|$|As of its 2017 budget, Sound Transit expects {{annual revenue}} of $1.6 billion. 93.3% of that revenue comes from taxes, predominately {{in the form}} of local sales taxes, {{property}} taxes, and motor vehicle excise taxes, levied within its taxing district in portions of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. Passenger fares, investments, and <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> make up the remaining 6.7% of revenue.|$|R
50|$|The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) is a UK-based {{organisation}} {{whose main}} {{role is to}} operate the application process for British universities. It operates as an independent charity, funded by fees charged to applicants and to universities, plus <b>advertising</b> <b>income,</b> and was formed in 1992 through the merger of the former university admissions system UCCA and the former polytechnics admissions system PCAS.|$|R
40|$|Weekly {{newspaper}} from Moore, Oklahoma Territory {{that includes}} local, territorial, and national news along with advertising. The Moore Enterprise, owned and edited by B. W. Williams, ran from July 1904 through September 1905. The paper was issued every Friday and featured eight pages with six columns each. Due {{to lack of}} <b>advertising</b> <b>income,</b> The Enterprise moved from Moore to Indianola and continued on as the Indianola Enterprise...|$|R
50|$|RTVE, {{the public}} broadcaster, had been funded by {{government}} grants and <b>advertising</b> <b>incomes</b> {{since it was}} launched in 1937 (radio) and 1956 (television). Although the state-owner national radio stations removed all its advertising in 1986, its public nationwide TV channels continued broadcasting commercial breaks until 2009. Since 2010, the public broadcaster is funded by government grants and taxes paid by private nationwide TV broadcasters and telecommunications companies.|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, with {{circulation}} down to 20,000 {{copies and}} dropping, the numerous sex ads were spun {{off into a}} separate publication, Spectator Magazine. Freed of the stigma of [...] "adults only" [...] but deprived of <b>advertising</b> <b>income,</b> the Barb {{went out of business}} within a year and a half. The final issue was dated July 3, 1980. Spectator Magazine ceased publication in October 2005.|$|R
50|$|Saint FM Community Radio {{relies on}} <b>advertising</b> <b>income,</b> {{membership}} fees, fundraising and donations {{to keep it}} operational. One such fundraising activity was Tony Leo’s “Radio Marathon”; broadcasting non-stop for 27 hours (apart from five-minute toilet breaks) Tony raised much-needed funds for the station. Tony's record was beaten on 22/23 May 2015 by Les Baldwin who managed 32 hours. Other events have included tea parties, dances, raffles, concerts and a ‘Market Day’.|$|R
50|$|Century Radio, Ireland's first {{licensed}} national solely private-sector broadcaster, began broadcasting in 1990. Minister Ray Burke proposed allocating 25% of {{the television}} licence revenues to private-sector broadcasters. The government rejected this, but agreed instead to cap RTÉ's <b>advertising</b> <b>income.</b> A tribunal of enquiry later established that Oliver Barry, an investor in Century Radio, had given Burke a political donation of £30,000. The advertising cap was lifted in 1993.|$|R
50|$|The Gazettes weekly {{circulation}} is 2,000, {{making it}} Halifax's third-largest free print publication. The Gazette is run, financed {{and published by}} the Dalhousie Gazette Publishing Society, {{a group of students}} made up from The Gazettes editors and contributors. The society operates independently of the Dalhousie Student Union, though the paper does charge an annual student levy through the DSU (approx $5.00 per student each academic year) as a means of complementing its <b>advertising</b> <b>income.</b>|$|R
50|$|With a {{circulation}} of 1,700,000 in the 1930s, Cosmopolitan had an <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> of $5,000,000. Emphasizing fiction in the 1940s, it was subtitled The Four-Book Magazine since the first section had one novelette, six or eight short stories, two serials, six to eight articles and eight or nine special features, while the other three sections featured two novels and a digest of current non-fiction books. During World War II, sales peaked at 2,000,000.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter of 2009, when {{economic}} crisis had already swept through all sections of society including the media industry, CPG was the only publisher among the great publishers in Serbia that recorded a rise in <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> amounting to 33%. However, the recession forced CPG to close down several magazines, such as Moje dete (My Child), Pony, Lepe princeze (Pretty Princesses) and Junior, as well as limit publication of FHM and Bravo Girl to tri-monthly.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Bruce Wood, {{a former}} Champion general manager, {{returned}} as co-publisher. By 2002, the Champion had grown significantly in <b>advertising</b> and <b>income.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Seven {{years of}} {{economic}} recession took a strong toll from the Croatian print media. Some of Croatian editions of international monthlies, like GEO, were shut down. <b>Advertising</b> <b>income</b> halved, while daily circulation figures, at 300,000, are {{one third of}} their late 1990s values. The print media industry lost 40% of jobs since 2007, and employment and revenues figures will likely not be back before 2025. According to IREX, this points to [...] "a contracted advertising market and a media management incapable of coping".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} the daily newspaper industry in order to provide a tentative explanation for the rise of free newspapers. This explanation is based on the growth of <b>net</b> <b>advertising</b> revenues per reader, i. e. of the difference between advertising revenue per reader and unit printing cost. Our analysis explains why the new entrant chooses to enter as a free newspaper with a minimum quality level, rather than as a traditional outlet with a positive price and a quality above the minimum. We also examine the welfare effects of this entry...|$|R
50|$|Radio 531pi {{was set up}} by the Auckland Pacific Island Community Radio Trust (APICRT) in Otahuhu in 1993 as {{a station}} for Auckland's Pacific Island community. According to Massey University {{sociologist}} Paul Spoonley the station reached Pacific communities who were not served by commercial radio, and helped establish a pan-Pacific identity. The station initially sustained on $1.25 million of Government funding each year with limited staff salaries, but by the 2001-02 and 2002-03 financial years it was earning more than $1 million a year in <b>advertising</b> <b>income.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Despite those results, Nolife {{announced}} in June {{of the same}} year that the channel won't be broadcast on CanalSat (almost monopolistic on the French satellite market) due to huge transmission costs, nor on the French cable network Numericable (also almost monopolistic) for [...] "technical reasons". A member of Nolife explained that this actually cut off <b>advertising</b> <b>incomes</b> for Nolife because of a market lock-down: Médiamétrie is the only recognized source for audience figures but it doesn't evaluate DSL IPTV audience despite the fact that at least as much French households receive IPTV as Satellite TV.|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, the staff, {{worried about}} debts, {{questioned}} Varsitys legal status. Solicitors were consulted, who advised that any debts arising from its considerable turnover (<b>advertising</b> <b>income,</b> printing costs etc.) or damages awarded for libel etc. {{would be the}} personal responsibility of the current Editor. Varsity was promptly converted into a limited liability company - [...] "Varsity Publications Ltd", with a share capital of £100. 50% of the shares were taken by the printers, 20% by the Don who was the senior Treasurer and the rest, at £1 per head, by the staff at that time.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940 she briefly {{worked for}} the Nazi {{newspaper}} Das Reich. On 8 June 1941 Das Reich published Noelle-Neumann's article entitled [...] "Who Informs America?" [...] in which she propagated {{the idea that a}} Jewish syndicate ran the American media. She wrote, [...] "Jews write in the paper, own them, have virtually monopolized the advertising agencies and can therefore open and shut the gates of <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> as they wish." [...] She was fired when she exchanged unfavourable photos of Franklin D. Roosevelt for better looking ones. She then {{worked for the}} Frankfurter Zeitung until it was banned in 1943.|$|R
5000|$|The team's {{existing}} probation {{was extended}} to 1990, resulting in essentially two full years of lost appearance, broadcast media, and <b>advertising</b> sponsorship <b>income.</b> Its existing ban from bowl games and live television {{was extended to}} 1989.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Daily Oklahoman newspaper. Caption: "A student "humor" {{magazine}} which appeared last month at Oklahoma State Univ. is reported defunct for lack of <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> after emerging as a one-edition wonder that was the talk of the campus. Carol Smirich, 20, OKC, editor of the magazine "Cowchips" said she considered it a critical success, but a financial failure. The controversial but thought-provoking magazine was put together by Smirich in spite of her refusal to submit the magazine to the authority of campus officials. She let it be known, as the magazine failed, that she will likely leave OSU, and transfer to OU. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2002, The Tartans {{leadership}} {{decided to}} leave the student funding process of Carnegie Mellon University. Advertising revenues were healthy, and the papers leadership was confident that the paper could remain independent so long as future leadership maintained a strong focus on maintaining and growing revenue from advertising and subscriptions. Breaking away was also an attempt to remove the ethical burden of reporting on the same entities that allocated funds to the newspaper. The paper failed to grow and maintain its <b>advertising</b> <b>income,</b> and accumulated a large amount of debt by 2004. The Tartan rejoined the student funding process in the spring of 2004.|$|R
2500|$|The site added {{advertising}} {{over the}} course of late 2004, placed above and to the left and right of material, and, in 2005, in the site's RSS feed as well. Editor Cory Doctorow noted that [...] "John [...] said it's going to be harder to make a little money to pay your bandwidth bills than it will be {{to make a lot of}} money and have a real source of income from this." [...] The <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> during the first quarter was already $27,000, and , Boing Boing still [...] "makes a nice living for its founders and a handful of contract employees," [...] but it is no longer a member of Battelle's blog network Federated Media Publishing, Inc.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} programming on a regional sports network (RSN) consists of live broadcasts of professional and collegiate sporting events, as those games generate an overwhelming percentage of an RSN's <b>advertising</b> <b>income,</b> {{in addition to}} viewership. During {{the rest of the}} day, these channels show other sports and recreation programming (such as news programs covering local and national sports; magazine and discussion programs relating to a team or collegiate conference; fishing and hunting programs; and in-studio video simulcasts of sports radio programs); rebroadcasts of sports events that aired as late as the day prior and paid programming may also be shown. These channels are often the source content for out-of-market sports packages.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{organizations}} {{have called for}} the watershed to apply to various unhealthy foods, including fast foods. In June 2006, the FSA called for laws preventing such food from being advertised on television before 9pm. They also called for the disassociation of television and film characters from fast food and stopping celebrities from appearing in such advertisements. [...] The effect of these campaigns is often denied by the fast food companies and the television networks that carry their advertisements. Some networks have also claimed that tighter regulations would reduce <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> and that would reduce the quality of children's programming. [...] In Sweden, all advertising aimed at the under-12s is banned, including fast food adverts.|$|R

40|$|Many website on the Internet are {{information}} sites. The ease {{at which}} {{users of the}} site get to the information they want could determine {{the success or failure}} of these types of websites. However these sites have a lot of content which becomes difficult to manage and maintain to suite the needs of the users. A site that can transform itself, over time, into structures that aid better use is desirable. The same mechanism that transforms such a site could also be used to structure a site for generating more <b>advertising</b> <b>income,</b> especially since information sites usually do not sell goods or services. This paper will describe an idea as to how to achieve the two goals stated above and determine the impact such a site would have on users...|$|R
5000|$|The Internet {{has also}} gone {{a step further}} than {{television}} in eroding the <b>advertising</b> <b>income</b> of newspapers, as — unlike broadcast media — it proves a convenient vehicle for classified advertising, particularly in categories such as jobs, vehicles, and real estate. Free services like Craigslist have decimated the classified advertising departments of newspapers, some of which depended on classifieds for 70% of their ad revenue. Research has shown that Craigslist cost the newspaper industry $5.4 billion from 2000-2007, and that changes on the classified side of newspaper business led {{to an increase in}} subscription prices, a decrease in display advertising rates, and impacted the online strategy of some newspapers. [...] At the same time, newspapers have been pinched by consolidation of large department stores, which once accounted for substantial advertising sums.|$|R
