5|$|The cartoon has {{inspired}} the play <b>Nobody</b> <b>Knows</b> I'm a Dog by Alan David Perkins.

Scully suddenly feels nauseous, much to Billy's concern, but she quickly shakes it off. Later, while investigating the reported crash site, Scully is lifted and shaken just as Gary was. Mulder finds her nearly passed out on the ground.|$|E

5000|$|The public {{transformed}} a sad but ordinary and expected event into a melodramatic urban legend. Leonhard Frank, who studied with Ažbe in 1904, reproduced the legend in Links, wo das Herz ist (1952): [...] "Nobody ever saw his paintings. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knew</b> {{if he ever}} painted at all. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knew</b> his past. One chilly December night, intoxicated with cognac, he fell asleep in the snow. He {{was found dead in}} the morning. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knew</b> where he had come from." [...] A similar story was retold by Mikhail Shemyakin.|$|R

5|$|After Stiller {{worked with}} Owen Wilson in Zoolander, they joined {{together}} again for The Royal Tenenbaums. Over {{the next two}} years, Stiller continued with the lackluster box office film Duplex, and cameos in Orange County and <b>Nobody</b> <b>Knows</b> Anything! He also guest-starred on several television shows, including an appearance in an episode of the television series The King of Queens in a flashback {{as the father of}} the character Arthur (played by Jerry Stiller). He also made a guest appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment's WWE Raw.|$|E
5|$|In the comedic poem Þrymskviða, Thor again plays {{a central}} role. In the poem, Thor wakes and finds that his {{powerful}} hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki, {{and tells him}} that <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> that the hammer has been stolen. The two go to the dwelling of the goddess Freyja, and so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir, Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak. Freyja agrees, and says she would lend it to Thor {{even if it were}} made of silver or gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.|$|E
5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the sword from the trunk shall receive it as a gift, and he {{who is able to}} pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves the hall, and <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword from the trunk of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|E

5|$|Dot and Abi make a rum {{cake for}} Patrick's {{birthday}} {{but as soon}} as Abi leaves the house for Exeter, Dot trips over Dave and <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> she is seriously injured until another step-granddaughter Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) finds her. Dot is then taken to hospital and Sonia blames the residents for not looking out her and scolds Sharon and Ian. Dot is left worried when the doctor tells her that she will need an operation after her fall has caused problems to her hip. Dot refuses physio and loses her temper with the doctors when they won't let her have a cigarette. Dot is heartbroken when Sonia and Robbie inform her that Dave has died but is relieved when Dave shows up at the hospital alive.|$|E
5|$|Later, Charlie finds Liam high on heroin with groupies. Charlie {{kicks the}} groupies out, and tells Liam that he's {{done with the}} band. Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is Drive Shaft, and that <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> who the bass player (Charlie) is. He goes on to tell Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin Drive Shaft for a {{comeback}} tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie {{to stay with him}} for a few weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and that he can get Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has a plane to catch.|$|E

25|$|During her {{childhood}} {{it was thought}} that the alleged unmarried affair with Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson must be kept secret. Even Anders Underdal, who early on gave an account of his origin to his children, fell silent about that matter later in life. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> why. Sandemo herself doesn't like talking about her ancestry in public.|$|E
25|$|Another scholion {{describes}} natural features {{near the}} hof:Near this temple stands {{a very large}} tree with wide-spreading branches, always green winter and summer. What kind it is <b>nobody</b> <b>knows.</b> There is also a spring at which the pagans are accustomed to make their sacrifices, and into it to plunge a live man. And {{if he is not}} found, the people's wish will be granted.|$|E
25|$|Despite regressing to {{his former}} self, he remembers that he was once a genius. He cannot bear to have his friends and {{co-workers}} feel sorry for him. Consequently, he decides to go to live at the state-sponsored Warren Home School, where <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> about the operation. In a final postscript to his writings, ostensibly addressed to Alice Kinnian, he requests that she put some flowers on Algernon's grave in Charlie's former backyard.|$|E

60|$|Something {{had to be}} done. Jerry Muskrat said so. Grandfather Frog said so. Billy Mink said so. Little Joe Otter said so. Even Spotty the Turtle said so. The Laughing Brook couldn't laugh, and the Smiling Pool couldn't smile. You see, there wasn't water {{enough in}} either of them to laugh or smile, and <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> if there ever would be again. <b>Nobody</b> had ever <b>known</b> {{anything}} like it before, and so <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> what to think or do. And yet they all felt that something must be done.|$|R

Bush awarded Gabor Boritt the National Humanities Medal.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch {{explores the}} city, where nobody realizes {{that it is}} always nighttime. At midnight, he watches as {{everyone}} except himself falls asleep as the Strangers stop time and physically rearrange the city as well as changing people's identities and memories. Murdoch learns that {{he comes from a}} coastal town called Shell Beach, a town familiar to everyone, though <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> how to leave the city to travel there, and all of his attempts to do so are unsuccessful for varying reasons. Meanwhile, the Strangers inject one of their men, Mr. Hand (Richard O'Brien), with memories intended for Murdoch in an attempt to predict his movements and track him down.|$|E
25|$|The {{casualties}} {{on both sides}} were high. There are about 15,000 Germans buried in the cemetery at Halbe, making it the largest war cemetery in Germany from World War II. About 10,000 are unidentified soldiers killed {{during the first half}} of 1945. The Red army claimed to have killed 60,000 German soldiers and taken 120,000 as prisoners. The number of prisoners is confirmed by German official sources, while other sources consider it to be exaggerated. Thousands of Red Army soldiers died trying to stop the breakout; most are buried at a cemetery next to the Baruth–Zossen road (Bundesstraße 96). These are the known dead, but the remains of more who died in the battle are found every year, so the total will never be known. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> how many civilians died, but it could have been as high as 10,000.|$|E
60|$|Ethel started. Mrs. Olcott {{was young}} and pretty; <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> {{anything}} about her husband; Andrew's visits had already excited comment.|$|R
60|$|And what notice {{could have}} been taken of two ladies who came from <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> where, to live in that wild out-of-the-way place, <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> why? They called {{themselves}} mother and daughter, and they called themselves O'Haras;--but {{there was no evidence}} of the truth even of these assertions. They were left therefore in their solitude, and never saw the face of a friend across their door step except that of Father Marty.|$|R

25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. <b>Nobody</b> <b>knows</b> how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
25|$|Near that temple is a {{very large}} tree with {{widespread}} branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is <b>nobody</b> <b>knows.</b> There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled. A golden chain encircles that temple and hangs over the gables of the building. Those who approach see its gleam from afar off because the shrine, which is located on a plain, is encircled by mountains so situated as to give the effect of a theatre. For nine days feasts and sacrifices of this kind are celebrated. Every day they sacrifice one human being in addition to other animals, so that in nine days there are 72 victims which are sacrificed. This sacrifice takes place about the time of the vernal equinox.|$|E
25|$|On January 28, 2007 a {{woman named}} Roberta Shalaby was found badly beaten on the {{sidewalk}} outside the Hells Angels' clubhouse at 77 East Third Street in the East Village, Manhattan. The resulting investigation by the NYPD has been criticized by the group for its intensity. The police were refused access to the Hells Angels clubhouse and responded by closing off the area, setting up sniper positions, and sending in an armored personnel carrier. After obtaining a warrant, the police searched the clubhouse and arrested one Hells Angel who was later released. The group claims to have no connection with the beating of Shalaby. Five security cameras cover {{the entrance to the}} New York chapter's East 3rd Street club house, but the NY HAMC maintains <b>nobody</b> <b>knows</b> how Shalaby was beaten nearly to death at their front door. A club lawyer said they intended to sue the city of New York for false arrest and possible civil rights violations.|$|E
