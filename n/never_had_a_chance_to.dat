5|$|Upon his retirement, Butler {{bought a}} home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where {{he lived with his}} wife. In June 1940, he checked himself into the {{hospital}} after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car so he could see it from the window. He <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Squadron Leader Harris of 149 Squadron and Wing Commander Kellett {{were the}} only {{experienced}} combat leaders. However, Kellett had not flown with No. 9 or 37 Squadrons as a group and had <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> practice formation flying or bombing with these squadrons. He had not been given the time or opportunity to discuss or formulate a plan for bombing naval targets, whether as a group, squadron, or even as flight sections. Nor had he even been able to discuss or pass on any tactical advice about what the formation should do {{in the event of}} fighter attack. He was given command of an incoherent group of squadrons which were highly inexperienced. For the 18 December mission, 24 Wellington Bombers from No. 9, 37 and 149 Squadrons were given to Kellet. The British bombers flew in a diamond shape formation.|$|E

He told Sun Ce that Liu Yao died in regret because he wanted, but <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to,</b> reestablish friendly ties with Sun Ce after settling down in Yuzhang Commandery.

25|$|On Monday 20 March 1972, at 11.45 a.m., a local carpet dealer {{received}} {{a telephone call}} with a warning that a bomb would explode in Belfast city centre's Church Street which was crowded with shoppers, office workers on lunch breaks, and schoolchildren. British Army troops and the RUC were alerted and immediately began to evacuate the people into nearby Lower Donegall Street. The second call to the Irish News newspaper seven minutes later also gave Church Street as the location for the device. When a final call came at 11.55 advising the Unionist News Letter newspaper that the bomb was instead placed outside its offices in Lower Donegall Street to where the crowds were being sent, the warning arrived {{too late for the}} security forces to clear the street. The staff working inside the News Letter were told by the caller that they had 15 minutes in which to leave the building, but they <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> evacuate.|$|E

25|$|Powell came to {{attention}} {{within the world}} of athletics at the 2003 World Championships, when he suffered the ignominy of being 'the other athlete' disqualified for a false start in the quarter-final. This was when Jon Drummond memorably refused to leave the track having suffered the same fate, both athletes moved less than 0.1s after the gun had fired, with Powell's reactions being timed at 0.086s. Six days later Powell {{was added to the}} 4 × 100 m relay team for the semi-final, running as the anchor. He helped the team qualify for the final, recording the second fastest time. Powell <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> run for a medal in the final as the second baton exchange was not executed cleanly and the Jamaican team failed to finish. During the 2003 season, Powell won two IAAF Grand Prix events, one of which was an AF Golden League event. He finished seventh in 10.23 s in the 100 m at the IAAF World Athletics Final.|$|E
25|$|The {{return to}} {{democracy}} allowed Peruvians {{to choose among}} strongly left, strongly conservative, or middle-of-the-road parties. They chose Belaúnde and his party as the middle road, but it led nowhere. The Belaúnde government tried to return the economy to a more open system by reducing barriers to imports, implementing financial reforms intended to foster private markets, and reversing the statist orientation of the Velasco system. But the new approach <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> get very far because {{of a series of}} macroeconomic problems. On one side, the government was rightly concerned about continuing inflation but made the mistake of focusing the explanation on monetary growth arising from the export surplus it inherited at the start. That position made it seem undesirable to continue trying to promote exports and desirable to raise domestic spending and imports. On the other side, President Belaúnde's personal and political objectives included using public investment actively to develop the interior of the country and to answer evident needs for improved infrastructure. Seeing the export surplus as the key macroeconomic source of imbalance, the government decided to eliminate it by removing import restrictions, slowing nominal devaluation to allow the real exchange rate to appreciate, and increasing government investment spending.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{had been}} {{interested}} in producing abstract animation since he saw A Color Box by Len Lye from 1935. He explained the work done in the Toccata and Fugue was [...] "no sudden idea... they were something we had nursed along several years but we <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> try". Preliminary designs included those from effects animator Cy Young, who produced drawings influenced by the patterns {{on the edge of}} a piece of sound film. In late 1938 Disney hired Oskar Fischinger, a German artist who had produced numerous abstract animated films, including some with classical music, to work with Young. Upon review of three leica reels produced by the two, Disney rejected all three. According to Huemer all Fishinger [...] "did was little triangles and designs... it didn't come off at all. Too dinky, Walt said." [...] Fischinger, like Disney, was used to having full control over his work and was not used to working in a group. Feeling his designs were too abstract for a mass audience, Fishinger left the studio in apparent despair, before the segment was completed, in October 1939. Disney had plans to make the Toccata and Fugue an experimental three-dimensional film, with audiences being given cardboard stereoscopic frames with their souvenir programs, but this idea was abandoned.|$|E

500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell me all the time he <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{shooting}} colored what sparse legacy his FSA {{work had}} left him. [...] Colleen McDannell says that, because of it, [...] "Dick {{was the most}} infamous of the FSA photographers."

[...] He <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be himself. It {{was one of the worst}} cases I've ever known in my experience of the wealthy son who couldn't get away from it." [...] Of course, Stryker's memory is poor, as Dick's children were unharmed.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{in a study}} called The Black Worker, Spero and Harris {{observe that}} more strikes [...] have been broken by white workers than by black workers.

[...] While the AFL-CIO is the modern version of the AFL, {{it is much more}} open to membership by women, immigrants, and different nationalities. Other unions, such as the Industrial Workers of the World and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, were created without regard to race from the very start.|$|E

2500|$|The Liberals lost {{support on}} 14 October federal election, being reduced to 77 seats, down from 103 {{won in the}} 2006 election. They {{captured}} only 26.2 per cent of the popular vote— two points lower than the disastrous showing in 1984 under John Turner and only four points ahead of the party's worst ever result in 1867. Dion said that the party lost {{because he did not}} get the Liberal message out, and took responsibility saying “If people are asking why, it's because I failed.” Dion added that he <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> establish his personal image with voters because of the Conservative ads depicting him as a [...] "dithering egghead". Liberal veterans described Dion as a [...] "lone wolf" [...] who dismissed suggestions from his senior advisers to avoid using the Green Shift as an election platform. A party insider also said that Dion was reluctant to emphasize the Liberal team because he felt that he was being overshadowed by leadership rival Bob Rae.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 December 1944 Malta Command regained {{its status}} as an {{independent}} command and it ceased its command relationship with GHQ Middle East in Cairo. The British would remember the war in a somewhat detached and romanticised fashion in films like The Malta Story; the Maltese <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> record their views being viewed as 'plucky' citizens of a British colony. In 1954 Headquarters Malta Command occupied the Auberge de Castille, known locally as [...] "The Castille". Malta Command would be reduced from 1964 and this led to acrimony between the Maltese and British Governments, and the post independence period {{was a period of}} bitterness, British forces on the Island in the front line of Maltese antipathy. Malta Command was largely wound up by 1977 with all major units repatriated to the UK.

2500|$|Writing in the 1940s, Caracostea {{pleaded for}} the poem to be [...] "re-invoked" [...] and kept alive, its themes and hidden {{meanings}} explained to successive generations.

[...] This popular enthusiasm for the poem has been criticized by some scholars, who noted its negative implications. According to Eugen Negrici, the [...] "Eminescu myth" [...] is a resilient element of literary culture, leading from a poète maudit trope to the [...] "aggressive tabooing and delirium about genius." [...] As he notes, Luceafărul was an especially important as autofiction, encouraging [...] "analogical reasoning" [...] among its readers: [...] "the text has produced exhilaration in academia and has stirred affection for the poet, a distortion sparked by the mystique of writings which bear the mark of destiny". Culianu also refers to the [...] "absurdities" [...] and [...] "bewildering speculations" [...] allowed by critical tradition, a [...] "Tower of Babel erected for worshiping Luceafărul." ...|$|E
