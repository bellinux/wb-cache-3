25|$|On October 11, 2006, law {{enforcement}} officials said that blood spatter {{had been found in}} Hans Reiser's house and car. Forensic testing (including DNA analysis) could neither confirm nor rule out Nina Reiser as the source of the blood. Officials had not located the missing passenger seat of his car. They also indicated that they had found in the car two books on homicide investigation purchased by Reiser on September 8 — five days after his wife's disappearance: , by David Simon, and Masterpieces of Murder, by Jonathan Goodman. Daniel Horowitz, a high-profile defense attorney, joined the defense team but dropped the case on November 28, citing Reiser's inability to pay for his services. Namesys's employees stated that Reiser felt the police would suspect him from the start. Reiser was arraigned on Thursday, October 12, where he delayed entering a plea until his next court appearance on November 28. He was held without bail. On November 28, Reiser entered a <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>plea</b> and invoked his right to a speedy trial, forcing the state to schedule a preliminary hearing for December 11.|$|E
25|$|McKittrick {{remained}} at large for several months, but was finally arrested in Dallas on September 21, 1973, after attempting to cash a forged payroll check at a drive-in bank. Under questioning, she corroborated Vandiver's story, and also told Carpenter and Gamino {{that she had}} met Ash Robinson while she was staying with Lilla Paulus in 1972. McKittrick claimed that Robinson had {{said he would do}} anything to get custody of his grandson, but that the only way that would happen was if Hill was dead. She said that Robinson and Paulus had met frequently at Ben Taub Hospital, where money was handed over, and that Robinson had also visited Paulus at her home, where he gave her plans of Hill's home and $7,000 {{on the day of the}} shooting. McKittrick was scheduled to be tried in 1974, alongside Paulus. However, Paulus's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, argued for Vandiver's evidence to be dismissed under the Sixth Amendment, which gives a defendant the right to confront their accuser; the request was granted. DeGuerin also asked for McKittrick's evidence against Paulus to be ruled as inadmissible. But although this request was also granted, presiding Judge Price ruled that McKittrick's evidence could be used in the state's case against her. McKittrick's attorney, John Caperton, then sought consensus for her to enter a <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>plea,</b> but accept a guilty verdict, something to which Bennett agreed. McKittrick was convicted of being Vandiver's getaway driver and given a ten-year jail sentence. She was paroled after serving five years.|$|E

500|$|After {{about three}} months spent in the Tower, on Saturday 3 May 1606 Garnet was {{strapped}} to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to the churchyard of St Paul's. He wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat, and {{spent much of the}} journey with his hands together and eyes closed. Present in the churchyard were the Sheriff of London, Sir Henry Montague, George Abbot and John Overal. When asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons, Garnet replied that he had nothing to say. He rejected any entreatments to abandon his faith for Protestantism, and said that he had committed no offence against the king. [...] The only thing he thought he might be condemned for was for abiding by the terms of the confessional, and if by that action he had offended the king or state, he asked for forgiveness. The recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt, but Garnet reiterated his <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>plea</b> and continued to argue the point.|$|E

500|$|The {{outcome was}} never in doubt. [...] The jury found all the {{defendants}} guilty, and the Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham pronounced them guilty of high treason.

[...] Their genitals would be cut off and burnt before their eyes, and their bowels and hearts removed. [...] They would then be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of their bodies displayed so that they might become [...] "prey for the fowls of the air". [...] Fawkes's and Tresham's testimony regarding the Spanish treason was read aloud, as well as confessions related specifically to the Gunpowder Plot. [...] The last piece of evidence offered was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells. [...] The two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy. [...] When the prisoners were allowed to speak, Fawkes explained his <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>plea</b> as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.|$|E

[...] Only Digby, tried on a separate indictment, pleaded guilty, insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions. [...] He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family. [...] His defence was in vain; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland, and along with his seven co-conspirators, he was found guilty by the jury of high treason.

40|$|Examines factors {{associated}} with early, late, and <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>pleas</b> in the District Court of NSW. Introduction There are well established practical, financial and emotional benefits of obtaining <b>guilty</b> <b>pleas</b> early in criminal proceedings. While criminal proceedings in NSW are most commonly resolved by a <b>guilty</b> <b>plea</b> (e. g., in 2012, 82 % of criminal matters proved in the District Court of NSW were resolved via a <b>guilty</b> <b>plea),</b> approximately one third of <b>guilty</b> <b>pleas</b> are <b>not</b> submitted until after the matter has been committed for trial (NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics & Research, 2012). These late <b>guilty</b> <b>pleas</b> typically involve at least three Local Court appearances prior to committal (including the committal hearing itself) and two appearances in the District Court (including the arraignment and sentence hearing) before being finalised. When a <b>guilty</b> <b>plea</b> is received late (e. g., {{on the first day}} of trial), it is likely that many hours of victim, witness, juror, court, police, and legal practitioner time will have gone to waste. The issue of late <b>guilty</b> <b>pleas</b> has been an ongoing concern for government, legal practitioners and courts for many years in NSW. In 2013, at the direction of the Attorney General, the NSW Law Reform Commission commenced a review into encouraging appropriate early <b>guilty</b> <b>pleas.</b> A consultation paper was released in November 2013 with the purpose of generating discussion on what models could be adopted by NSW to improve the rate of appropriate early <b>guilty</b> <b>pleas...</b>|$|R

2500|$|At arraignment, Hovind claimed incomprehension to the charges, {{telling the}} court: [...] "I still don't {{understand}} what I'm being charged for {{and who is}} charging me." [...] The presiding magistrate judge asked Hovind if he wrote and spoke English, to which Hovind responded, [...] "To some degree." [...] The judge replied that the government adequately explained the allegations and the defendant understands the charges [...] "whether you {{want to admit it}} or not." [...] Hovind stated that he did not recognize the government's right to try him on tax-fraud charges. At first he attempted to enter a plea of [...] "subornation of false muster," [...] but then entered a <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>plea</b> [...] "under duress" [...] when the judge offered to enter a plea for him. When asked about his home, Hovind called it a [...] "church parish", and denied any residence except the [...] "church of Jesus Christ", worldwide. Hovind's passport and guns were seized. Hovind protested, arguing that he needed his passport to continue his evangelism work, and that [...] "thousands and thousands" [...] were waiting to hear him preach in South Africa the following month.

2500|$|When {{the trial}} began in July 2012, Terry entered a <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>plea</b> and {{was acquitted of}} the charge on 13 July 2012.

Terry maintained that he used the words as a form of sarcasm and that he was questioning what he thought had been an allegation of racism from Ferdinand; neither lip reader was able to [...] "identify whether the statement was made as a question or in what type of voice it was said." [...] Justice Riddle concluded that while there was no doubt Terry had uttered those words in anger, [...] "it is impossible to be sure exactly what were the words spoken by [...] at the relevant time" [...] and that {{there was a lack of}} evidence to prove beyond a doubt that Terry had used them as an insult instead of [...] "a challenge to what he believed had been said to him."
