Other key objectives included {{the development of an}} ablative pyrolysis reactor design methodology, mathematical modelling of the ablation process and measurement of empirical ablation rate data at 500 °C. The constructed reactor utilised a rotating blade approach to achieve particle ablation in a 258 mm internal diameter reactor. By fulfilling the key requirements of high relative motion and high contact pressure, pine wood particles of maximum size 6. 35 mm were successfully ablated. Sixteen experiments were carried out: five initial commissioning experiments were used to test the rotating blade concept and to solve char separation problems. Mass balances were obtained for the other eleven experiments with good closures. Based on ablatively pyrolysed dry wood, a maximum organic liquid yield of 65. 9 wt% was achieved with corresponding yields of 12. 4 wt% char, 11. 5 wt% water and 9. 2 wt% non-condensable gas. Reactor throughputs of 2 kg/h dry ablated wood were achieved at 600 °C. The theoretical ablative pyrolysis reactor design methodology was simplified and improved based upon empirical data derived from wood rod ablation experiments. Yields of chemicals were qualitatively similar to those of other fast pyrolysis processes. The product recovery system, comprising hot char removal, liquids collection in two ice-cooled condensers followed by gas filtration and drying, gave good mass balance closures. The most significant problem was char separation and removal from the reactor. This was solved by using a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blow</b> line.

The polymer and the coating agent used were polyetherimide (PEI) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) respectively. The hollow fibers were fabricated via a simple wet spinning technique. The surfaces of the hollow fibers were coated by means of PDMS dissolved in n-hexane applying different protocols. An effort was made to keep the silicon rubber coating layer porous. The membranes were characterized by applying a gas permeation test (GPT) via pure helium, critical entry pressure of water (CEPw), contact angle, a gas absorption test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on the observations, the coating technique resulted in drastic changes in the contact angle and CEPw of the coated membranes for the inside and outside coated hollow fiber membranes. Disregarding the method of coating and even the polymer concentration, the contact angle was enhanced dramatically. The CO 2 absorption results revealed that by <b>blowing</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (600 kPa) through the lumen side of the hollow fibers during the PDMS coating process onto the outside surface, the absorption flux of the membranes was increased.

Traditional asphalt-rubber binders have faced problems ics. in pavement compaction, due to phase separation or sedimentation of undissolved rubber. A homogeneous asphalt-rubber binder is desirable for alleviating this problem. In addition, a blend with a high dissolved rubber content is expected to have better performance properties. A variety of curing processes has been investigated to attain an optimal process, providing a superior asphalt-rubber blend. This research used temperature, time, shear rate, and <b>nitrogen</b> versus air <b>blowing</b> as variables to study the effect of different curing conditions. The effect of rubber content, asphalt type, and air blowing were additional studies. A 1 l asphalt-rubber binders in this research were prepared by a two step curing process. This process consists of two curing processes, called the first and the second curing, and two settling processes. The first curing was used to produce the blends. Then, the settling step was followed to concentrate the undissolved rubber for re-curing in the secondary curing step. Finally, the re-settling step was employed to remove {{a small part of the}} remaining undissolved rubber and to determine the homogeneity after the second cure. The settling rates and the performance grades of the blends were determined to elucidate the effect of curing conditions on the quality of the binders. The high curing temperature resulted in more rubber being disintegrated and dissolved into asphalt, due to increased reaction between asphalt and rubber. Increasing the curing time noticeably increased the size reduction and the solubility of the rubber particles. Mixing rubber with asphalt by using a high shear rate quickened the shortening of rubber chains. However, the performance grade of the binders seemed to be deteriorated by these severe curing conditions. Air blowing was conducted with an expectation of improving high temperature properties while the added rubber benefited low temperature properties. Low molecular weight asphalt or low viscosity asphalt appeared to more efficiently solubilities the ground tire rubber...|$|R
