5|$|Ava {{was also}} {{underneath}} the NOAA-2 and <b>Nimbus</b> 5 weather satellites. NOAA-2 provided photographs {{that were used}} to estimate Ava's maximum windspeeds. Satellite images were useful throughout the cyclone's existence, as did the wind reports of three ships when Ava was a young tropical storm. <b>Nimbus</b> 5 carried an Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer and Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer. Both were used to study Ava. The main data provided by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions. The observations also provided confirmation that clouds that are not vertically developed very much can produce tropical rainfall.|$|E

6000|$|Stephen was not professedly a free-hand draughtsman, but he {{drew the}} human figure with {{correctness}} and skill. In its numerous repetitions on the sides and edges of the leaves, Knight began to notice a peculiarity. All the feminine saints had one type of feature. There were large <b>nimbi</b> and small <b>nimbi</b> about their drooping heads, but the face was always the same. That profile--how well Knight knew that profile! ...|$|R
5|$|On <b>Nimbus</b> III, the Enterprise crew {{discovers that}} renegade Vulcan Sybok, Spock's half-brother, {{is behind the}} hostage crisis. Sybok reveals the hostage {{situation}} was a ruse to lure a starship to <b>Nimbus</b> III. Sybok wants to use a ship to reach the mythical planet Sha Ka Ree, the place where creation began; the planet lies behind a seemingly impenetrable barrier {{near the center of}} the galaxy. Sybok uses his unique ability to reveal and heal the innermost pain of a person through the mind meld to subvert the wills of the hostages and crew members. Only Spock and Kirk prove resistant to Sybok; Spock is unmoved by the experience and Kirk refuses the Vulcan's offer, telling him that his pain is what makes him human. Sybok reluctantly declares a truce with Kirk, realizing he needs his leadership experience to navigate the Enterprise to Sha Ka Ree.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular <b>nimbus</b> are placed at angles which rise outwards and above {{the level of the}} cross.|$|E
5|$|The game {{world is}} set in a {{geographically}} diverse land, which includes mountains and bodies of water. Each region has distinct characteristics held by its inhabitants; Mushroom Kingdom is inhabited by Toads, Moleville is inhabited by moles, Monstro Town is populated by reformed monsters, Yo'ster Isle is where Yoshi and his eponymous species reside, and <b>Nimbus</b> Land is an area inhabited by cloud people. Bowser's Castle is another prominent location in the game, as it holds the portal to the main antagonist's home world.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nimbi</b> Jodhan was {{established}} almost 600 years ago. It {{got its name}} from the names of two early settler families, the Jodhas and Nimbojis. Most residents are Hindu and Muslim. Agriculture is the main income resource, along with local small businesses.|$|R

5|$|Above the chromosphere, {{in a thin}} (about 200km) {{transition}} region, {{the temperature}} rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma. The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of <b>nimbus</b> around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion. The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The American River Division {{is located}} in north-central California, {{on the east side}} of the Great Central Valley. Its {{structures}} use the water of the American River, which drains off the Sierra Nevada and flows into the Sacramento River. The division is further divided into three units: the Folsom, Sly Park and Auburn-Folsom South. The American River Division stores water in the American River watershed, to both provide water supply for local settlements, and supply it to the rest of the system. The dams also are an important flood control measure. Hydroelectricity is generated at Folsom and <b>Nimbus</b> dams, and marketed to the Western Area Power Administration.|$|E
50|$|One MR9L and 21 NS3N/NS3AN <b>Nimbuses</b> are preserved. The {{body from}} one of the Western Welsh {{examples}} was removed by the operator and refitted to the prototype Bristol LHS6L chassis which was registered XBO1F and is now preserved with Thornes Independent of Selby, Yorks.|$|R

This temple was patronized by Krishna Daverayar, and hence inside the Sactum, there is an idol of him.|$|R
5|$|The crew of {{the newly}} {{commissioned}} USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A) are enjoying shore leave after the starship's shakedown cruise goes poorly. At Yosemite National Park James T. Kirk, recently demoted back to Captain after {{the events of the}} previous two films, is camping with Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy. Their leave is interrupted when the Enterprise is ordered by Starfleet Command to rescue human, Klingon, and Romulan hostages on the planet <b>Nimbus</b> III. Learning of the Enterprises mission, the Klingon Captain Klaa decides to pursue Kirk for personal glory.|$|E
5|$|To {{preserve}} {{and restore the}} Orangery, the Trust teamed-up with City of Bath College and <b>Nimbus</b> Conservation Ltd in an innovative partnership, whereby 12 trainee stonemasons worked alongside professional craftsmen to hone their skills and carry out the specialist stonework needed. The Trust also introduced workshops for other restoration professionals, academics and eventually opened them to interested members of the public, where all were educated in a hands-on environment in the skills required to repair the building. For this crafts-based training initiative, in 2011 the Trust won a Daily Telegraph sponsored English Heritage Angel Award.|$|E
5|$|Work {{carried out}} in the 20th and 21st centuries {{included}} full cleaning of the stonework and the reconstruction of the pipe organ by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn. The stonework of the west front had been subject to natural erosion therefore a process of lime-based conservation was carried out during the 1990s by <b>Nimbus</b> Conservation under the guidance of Professor Robert Baker who had previously worked on the west front of Wells Cathedral. Some of the damage to sculptures had been made worse by the use of Portland cement by previous work {{carried out in}} the Victorian era. A statue of St Phillip was beyond repair and was removed and replaced with a modern statue by Laurence Tindall.|$|E
5000|$|In 1931, the GWR {{sold their}} bus company {{shareholdings}} to British Electric Traction, who continued {{expansion of the}} company by acquisition. As with other BET companies, Western Welsh's fleet included {{a significant number of}} AEC and Leyland types, including AEC Bridgemasters and Albion <b>Nimbuses,</b> all of which appeared in the company's familiar all-red livery.|$|R

5|$|Tim Downs scouted {{possible}} {{areas for}} location filming. He {{looked for a}} location that could stand in for three different venues without the production having to move or change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the <b>Nimbus</b> III Paradise City. Downs {{was familiar with the}} Mojave desert and thought that locations near Ridgecrest, California, would serve the production's needs, so he took photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations might look like. Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.|$|E
25|$|The Bristol Siddeley <b>Nimbus,</b> later {{known as}} the Rolls-Royce <b>Nimbus,</b> was a British {{turboshaft}} engine developed under license by Blackburn Aircraft Ltd. from the Turbomeca Turmo in the late 1950s. It was used on the Westland Scout and Westland Wasp helicopters.|$|E

5000|$|Rear Admiral Sir Frederick Bedford, who {{had led the}} British forces against Koko, {{sent the}} {{following}} telegram to the Admiralty from Brass on 23 February: [...] Left Brass on February 20, with HMS Widgeon, HMS Thrush, two steamers of the Niger Company, and the boat of HMS St George, with marines and Protectorate troops; anchored off <b>Nimbi</b> Creek and seized Sacrifice Island the same afternoon; the approach was obstructed by stockades, which are also under construction on the island; 25 war canoes came out and opened an ineffectual fire; three were sunk, and the rest retired. On February 21 the intricate channels were buoyed and the creek reconnoitred. At daybreak on February 22 we attacked, and, after an obstinate defence of a position naturally difficult, a landing was gallantly effected and <b>Nimbi</b> completely burned. In the evening the force was withdrawn, after King Koko's and other chiefs' houses were destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Berrugueteâ€™s {{heavy use}} of gilding and brocade for <b>nimbuses,</b> garments, {{backgrounds}} and architecture {{is also a}} defining element of his artwork as it is present in almost all of his pieces. He uses gilding to highlight the halos of holy figures and often uses it in a brocaded design on the garments of important figures or as a tapestry-like background for important figures.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the thousands of}} grooks he wrote, Piet Hein devised the games of Hex, Tangloids, Tower, Polytaire, TacTix, <b>Nimbi,</b> Qrazy Qube, Pyramystery, and the Soma cube. He advocated the use of the superellipse curve in city planning, furniture making and other realms. He also invented a perpetual calendar called the Astro Calendar and marketed housewares based on the superellipse and superegg.|$|R
25|$|Since Harry plays Quidditch, his broomsticks - a <b>Nimbus</b> 2000 {{and later}} a Firebolt - are {{prominent}} in the series. The <b>Nimbus</b> 2000 was {{given to him by}} special consent of Dumbledore via Minerva McGonagall, who had chosen him as the Gryffindor Seeker. The Firebolt was given to him by his godfather Sirius Black as a Christmas gift after his <b>Nimbus</b> was destroyed by the Whomping Willow tree during a Quidditch match. The Firebolt remains the fastest broom in the world, having surpassed the previous record holder, the <b>Nimbus</b> 2001 (which Draco Malfoy owns and which his father Lucius Malfoy had given as gifts to the entire Slytherin team as a bribe to have Draco as their Seeker). The price of the Firebolt is so high it is only available upon request.|$|E

50|$|The Postal Service bought many, {{using them}} as late as 1972. The Danish police was also a large customer, but phased out their <b>Nimbuses</b> much earlier in the late 1950s and early 1960s, when it became too slow {{to keep up with}} modern cars and motorcycles; the top speed of a stock solo bike was only 120 km/h, and that for brief bursts only.
