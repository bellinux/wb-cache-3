5|$|Ueshiba {{moved to}} Tokyo in 1926, where {{he set up}} the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{comparatively}} famous in martial arts circles, and taught at this dojo and others around Japan, including in several military academies. In the aftermath of World War II the Hombu dojo was temporarily closed, but Ueshiba had by this point left Tokyo and retired to Iwama, and he continued training at the dojo he had set up there. From {{the end of the}} war until the 1960s, he worked to promote aikido throughout Japan and abroad. He died from liver cancer in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Among Waugh's growing {{circle of}} friends were Diana Guinness and Bryan Guinness (dedicatees of Vile Bodies), Lady Diana Cooper and her husband Duff Cooper, Nancy Mitford who was {{originally}} a friend of Evelyn Gardner's, and the Lygon sisters. Waugh had known Hugh Patrick Lygon at Oxford; <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> introduced to the girls and their country house, Madresfield Court, which became the closest {{that he had to}} a home during his years of wandering. In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D'Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer Aubrey Herbert. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family's villa in Portofino, where he first met Gabriel's 17-year-old sister, Laura.|$|E
5|$|It {{had long}} been {{established}} Marcher custom to solve conflicts through private warfare. Hereford's problem, however, was his relative weakness in the Marches, and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> facing open conflict with two different enemies. He therefore {{decided to take the}} issue to the king instead, in a break with tradition. King Edward again ordered Gloucester to stop, but the earl ignored the order and initiated raids on Hereford's lands. Hostilities continued and Hereford responded, until both earls were arrested and brought before the king. The real offense was not the private warfare in itself, {{but the fact that the}} earls had not respected the king's injunction to cease. In the parliament of January 1292, Gloucester was fined 10,000 marks and Hereford 1,000. Gloucester's liberty of Glamorgan was declared forfeit, and confiscated by the crown, as was Hereford's of Brecon.|$|E

And yet--like us all, when we swoon--like us all, every day of our lives when we wake--he is instinctively unwilling to be restored to the consciousness of this existence, and would be left dormant, if he could.|$|R

5|$|Matilda and Henry {{remained}} childless, {{but neither}} party {{was considered to}} be infertile and contemporary chroniclers blamed their situation on the Emperor and his sins against the Church. In early 1122, the couple travelled down the Rhine together as Henry continued to suppress the ongoing political unrest, but by <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> suffering from cancer. His condition worsened and he died on 23 May 1125 in Utrecht, leaving Matilda in the protection of their nephew Frederick, the heir to his estates. Before his death, he left the imperial insignia in the control of Matilda, but it is unclear what instructions he gave her {{about the future of the}} Empire, which faced another leadership election. Archbishop Adalbert subsequently convinced Matilda that she should give him the insignia, and the Archbishop led the electoral process which appointed Lothair of Supplinburg, a former enemy of Henry, as the new King of the Romans.|$|E
5|$|In May 1955, Edwards was {{selected}} for the England squad which travelled to mainland Europe for matches against France, Portugal and Spain, starting all three matches. Upon returning from the tour, he began a two-year stint in the British Army with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. Army service was compulsory at the time for all men of his age under the National Service scheme. He was stationed at Nesscliffe near Shrewsbury along with team-mate Bobby Charlton, but was allowed leave to play for United. He also took part in army matches, and in one season played nearly one hundred matches in total. In the 1955–56 season, despite missing nearly two months of action due to a severe bout of influenza, Edwards played 33 times as United won the championship of the Football League {{by a margin of}} 11 points from Blackpool. The following season, he made 34 league appearances, taking his total past the 100 mark, as United won a second consecutive league title, and was also in the team that contested the 1957 FA Cup Final, in which United missed out on the Double after a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa. He also made seven appearances during United's first ever foray into the European Cup, including a 10–0 win over Anderlecht which remains the club's biggest ever margin of victory. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> also a regular in the England team, featuring in all four of England's qualifying matches for the 1958 World Cup and scoring two goals in the 5–2 win over Denmark on 5 December 1956. He was expected to be a key player for England in the World Cup finals, and was seen as a likely candidate to replace the veteran Billy Wright as national team captain.|$|E

The South African opener thus saw his average fall by seven runs during this series, after his three single-figure scores in the six innings.|$|E
25|$|When Dad's Army {{ended in}} 1977, Lowe {{remained}} much in demand, taking starring roles in television comedies such as Bless Me, Father with Daniel Abineri (1978–1981), as the mischievous Catholic priest Father Charles Clement Duddleswell and in Potter (1979–80) as the busybody Redvers Potter. By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> making many television advertisement commercials, but his later stage career mainly involved touring the provinces, appearing in plays and pantomimes with his wife, Joan.|$|E

By <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the first choice captain for England with 30 caps, and around whom Ramsey was building a team to prove correct his prediction that they would win the 1966 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|The delayed première of Les vêpres Siciliennes, {{in which}} she sang Hélène, took place on 13 June 1855 at the Opéra, with Marc Bonnehée and Louis Guéymard. This was her last great triumph on the public stage. Performances {{continued}} through the year: Charles Santley, en route to Italy to commence his own studies with Lamperti or Nava, delayed in Paris for a day to hear Cruvelli in the Sicilian Vespers on 31 October 1855. On first hearing her, he had thought her a goddess: <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> somewhat disenchanted.|$|E
25|$|During 1968–1969, Tyrannosaurus Rex {{had become}} a modest success on radio and on record, and they {{released}} three albums, the third of which, Unicorn, came {{within striking distance of}} the UK Top 10 Albums. While Bolan's early solo material was rock and roll-influenced pop music, by <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> writing dramatic and baroque songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with Greek and Persian mythology as well as poetic creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain's student union halls.|$|E

25|$|Brumowski {{continued}} amassing victories through May, {{ending the}} month {{with a total}} of eight. By <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> flying a single-seat fighter, the Hansa-Brandenburg D.I. Although better suited for air-to-air combat than the C.1, it still suffered three major disadvantages: the pilot's vision was partially obstructed; the single machine gun was not synchronized to fire through the propeller arc, and it was a difficult craft to fly because it was easy to spin at any altitude. Aiming and firing a gun mounted above and ahead of the pilot was more difficult than simply aiming the airplane at the enemy and firing a synchronized gun.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, the Democrats {{obtained}} {{a majority of}} seats in the State Assembly; and Smith became Majority Leader and Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means.

He became Minority Leader again in 1914 and 1915. In November 1915, he was elected Sheriff of New York County, New York.

His second {{official}} victory came at 9:45am on April 21, followed by his third on May 6, which he shared with Ernst Leman and Alexander Kazakov. He downed a Hansa-Brandenburg C.I near Berezhany, Ukraine in his Nieuport 17. He then scored three more victories in three months - an LVG C.II at Jēkabpils on May 17, another Hansa-Brandenburg C.I near Kozova on June 8, and finally a Rumpler C.I on June 20. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a flying ace, having scored more than five victories.|$|E

The RNII team continued their development work on rocketry, with particular focus on the area of stability and control. They developed automated gyroscope stabilization systems that allowed stable flight along a programmed trajectory. Korolev was a charismatic leader who served primarily as an engineering project manager. He was a demanding, hard-working man, with a disciplinary style of management. Korolev personally monitored all key stages of the programs and paid meticulous attention to detail.|$|E
25|$|During 1812 {{the people}} of the Caribbean provinces in New Granada {{remained}} mostly royalist. Those in the Santa Marta region had built strongholds at Tenerife and Chiriguana on the Magdalena River, leading the revolutionaries of Cartagena to burn the towns. On August 14, 1813, insurgent forces from Cartagena attacked Santa Marta itself, but were repulsed by a flank of royalist defenders near the city. With the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 and the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne, the Spanish authorities, {{at the behest of the}} king, decided to send troops to the Americas to reclaim the territories that had proclaimed themselves independent. From the point of view of the criollos, the king was ignoring the loyalty the American provinces had shown when he was in exile in France, and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> asserting his right to govern as an absolute ruler.|$|E
25|$|Command of {{the ship}} thereby devolved upon the ship's third officer, Charles Rivers, but Rivers, {{apparently}} {{in a state of}} shock, proved incapable of action. Fortunately, one {{of the ship}}'s small complement of passengers, Cornelius L. Brady, was a ships' master himself with recent experience of such a crisis. Brady had been the hero in the shipwreck of the SS Atlantic less than a year prior, where his courageous action in personally establishing a rope to shore was credited with saving as many as 250 lives. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> now about to lead another rescue effort. Brady quickly ordered the crew to secure the damaged upper forward hatches with hatches from the lower deck, in order to stop the further flow of water into the ship. A delegation of the crew then implored Brady to take command, a proposal which he accepted. Brady made his way ondeck to the midships wheelhouse, where he ordered the helmsman to turn the ship into the wind. He then rang the engine room to reduce the ship's speed to dead slow.|$|E
