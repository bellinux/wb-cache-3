5000|$|The Knudsen Paradox {{has been}} {{observed}} in experiments of channel flow with varying channel width or equivalently different pressures. If the <b>normalized</b> <b>mass</b> flux through the channel is plotted over the Knudsen number based on the channel width a distinct minimum is observed around [...] This is a paradoxical behaviour because, based on the Navier-Stokes equations, one would expect the mass flux to decrease with increasing the Knudsen number. The minimum can be understood intuitively by considering the two extreme cases of very small and very large Knudsen number. For very small Kn the viscosity vanishes and a fully developed steady state channel flow shows infinite flux. On the other hand, the particles stop interacting for large Knudsen numbers. Because of the constant acceleration due to the external force, the steady state again will show infinite flux.|$|E

40|$|Dual phase magnesia-zirconia {{ceramics}} were developed, characterized, {{and evaluated}} {{as a potential}} matrix material for use in light water reactor inert matrix fuel intended for the disposition of plutonium and minor actinides. Ceramics were fabricated from the oxide mixture using conventional pressing and sintering techniques. Characterization of the final product was performed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis. The final product was found to consist of two phases: cubic zirconia-based solid solution and cubic magnesia. Evaluation of key feasibility issues was limited to investigation of long-term stability in hydrothermal conditions and assessment of the thermal conductivity. With respect to hydrothermal stability, {{it was determined that}} limited degradation of these ceramics at 300 ^oC occurred due to the hydration of the magnesia phase. <b>Normalized</b> <b>mass</b> loss rate, used as a quantitative indicator of degradation, was found to decrease exponentially with the zirconia content in the ceramics. The <b>normalized</b> <b>mass</b> loss rates measured in static 300 ^oC de-ionized water for the magnesia-zirconia ceramics containing 40, 50, 60, and 70 weight percent of zirconia are 0. 00688, 0. 00256, 0. 000595, 0. 000131 g/cm 2 /hr respectively. Presence of boron in the water had a dramatic positive effect on the hydration resistance. At 300 ^oC the <b>normalized</b> <b>mass</b> loss rates for the composition containing 50 weight percent of zirconia was 0. 00005667 g/cm 2 /hr in the 13000 ppm aqueous solution of the boric acid. With respect to thermal conductivity, the final product exhibits values of 5. 5 - 9. 5 W/(m deg) at 500 ^oC, and 4 - 6 W/(m deg) at 1200 ^oC depending on the composition. This claim is based on the assessment of thermal conductivity derived from thermal diffusivity measured by laser flash method in the temperature range from 200 to 1200 ^oC, measured density, and heat capacity calculated using rule of mixtures. Analytical estimates of the anticipated maximum temperature during normal reactor operation in a hypothetical inert matrix fuel rod based on the magnesia-zirconia ceramics yielded the values well below the melting temperature and well below current maximum temperatures authorized in light water reactors...|$|E

American prison visitation polices are unique among advanced democracies. Other nations, particularly in Western Europe, have far more liberal policies. Prisons in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Finland feature mother/baby units and family visitation centers. In Denmark and Norway, prisoners are granted passes to visit family. These policies encourage visitation. Increased visitation is linked to lower recidivism, so adopting such policies would potentially lower prison populations in the United States.

40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{in support of the}} efforts of Lockheed Idaho Technology Company (LITCO) to vitrify high-level waste calcines. Tests were conducted with three classes of LITCO glass formulations: Formula 127 (fluorine-bearing), Formula 532 (fluorine-free), and 630 series (both single- and mixed-alkali) glasses. The test matrices included, as appropriate, the Product Consistency Test Method B (PCT-B), the Materials Characterization Center Test 1 (MCC- 1), and the Argonne vapor hydration test (VHT). Test durations ranged from 7 to 183 d. In 7 -d PCT-Bs, <b>normalized</b> <b>mass</b> losses of major glass-forming elements for the LITCO glasses are similar to, or lower than, <b>normalized</b> <b>mass</b> losses obtained for other domestic candidate waste glasses. Formula 532 glasses form zeolite alteration phases relatively early in their reaction with water. The formation of those phases increased the dissolution rate. In contrast, the Formula 127 glass is highly durable and forms alteration phases only after prolonged exposure to water in tests with very high surface area to volume ratios; these alteration phases have a relatively small effect on the rate of glass corrosion. No alteration phases formed within the maximum test duration of 183 d in PCT-Bs with the 630 series glasses. The corrosion behavior of the mixed-alkali 630 series glasses {{is similar to that of}} 630 series glasses containing sodium alone. In VHTs, both single- and mixed-alkali glasses form zeolite phases that increase the rate of glass reaction.

Three parameters, namely the ground slope angle and the <b>normalized</b> <b>mass</b> and length of the robot describe its gait.

The robot can maintain this gait indefinitely. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} the generic phase diagrams encoding the topologically distinct localized and delocalized phases of noninteracting fermionic quasiparticles for any symmetry class from the tenfold way in one, two, and three dimensions. To this end, we start from a massive Dirac Hamiltonian perturbed by a generic disorder for any dimension {{of space and}} for {{any one of the}} ten symmetry classes from the tenfold way. The physics of Anderson localization is then encoded by a two-dimensional phase diagram that we deduce from the topology of the space of <b>normalized</b> Dirac <b>masses.</b> This approach agrees with previously known results and gives an alternative explanation for the even-odd effect in the one-dimensional chiral symmetry classes. We also give a qualitative explanation for the Gade singularity and Griffiths effects in the density of states using the first homotopy group of the <b>normalized</b> Dirac <b>masses</b> in two dimensions.

The glass was prepared by melting {{a mixture of}} SRP 165 powdered frit doped with a carrier free solution of Tc- 99 at 1150 {sup 0 }C. Dissolution of portions of the resulting glass indicated that the Tc- 99 was distributed homogeneously throughout the glass. Static leach tests up to 90 days were performed at 90 {sup 0 }C in J- 13 tuff groundwater or WIPP brine A at a SA/V of 100 m{sup - 1 }. <b>Normalized</b> <b>mass</b> losses were calculated for Tc- 99 {{as well as all}} the major elements in the glass. Results indicated that under ambient oxidizing conditions Tc- 99 leached no faster than the glass-forming elements of the glass. In J- 13 water, Tc- 99 leached congruently with B. In WIPP brine A, it leached congruently with Si. Leach rates for Li were higher in both groundwaters, probably due to a contribution from an ion exchange mechanism. Leach tests were performed under reducing conditions in J- 13 water by adding Zn/Hg amalgam to the leachate. In these tests the pH increased significantly, probably because of the reaction of the amalgam with the water. In a 21 -day test, the pH increased to 13 and leach rates for the glass were very high. Even though there was signifcant dissolution of the glass, the <b>normalized</b> <b>mass</b> loss based on Tc- 99 was only 0. 02 g/m{sup 2 }. This result and the fact that reducing conditions at normal pH values do not significantly affect the dissolution of the glass, indicate that the low concentrations for Tc- 99 obtained under reducing conditions are due to is solubility and not due to an increased durability of the glass. 14 refs., 2 figs., 5 tabs...|$|E

Cost manufacturing of every piece is specified. Based on elementary costs the manufacturing cost of whole part is calculated. The second method uses construction similarity theory. The selected part manufacturing costs are functionally depended on main part manufacturing costs. The CAM method is based on time calculation from manufacturing process simulation.
