40|$|TCP {{flows from}} {{applications}} such as the web or ftp are well supported by a Guaranteed Minimum Throughput Service (GMTS), which provides a minimum network throughput to the flow and, if possible, an extra throughput. We propose a scheme for a GMTS using Admission Control (AC) that is able to provide different minimum throughput to different users and that is suitable for "standard" TCP flows. Moreover, we consider a multidomain scenario where the scheme is used {{in one of the}} domains, and we propose some mechanisms for the interconnection with neighbor domains. The whole scheme uses a small set of packet classes in a core-stateless network where each class has a different <b>discarding</b> <b>priority</b> in queues assigned to it. The AC method involves only edge nodes and uses a special probing packet flow (marked as the highest <b>discarding</b> <b>priority</b> class) that is sent continuously from ingress to egress through a path. The available throughput in the path is obtained at the egress using measurements of flow aggregates, and then it is sent back to the ingress. At the ingress each flow is detected using an implicit way and then it is admission controlled. If it is accepted, it receives the GMTS and its packets are marked as the lowest <b>discarding</b> <b>priority</b> classes; otherwise, it receives a best-effort service.

30|$|With TCP-Casablanca [28], the TCP sender marks packets {{with two}} {{different}} <b>discard</b> <b>priorities</b> and intermediate routers drop the packets {{of the lower}} priority first in congestion. Thus the probability distribution of congestion losses will be different for {{the two types of}} packets while that of wireless losses may be similar for both of them assuming the uniform distribution of wireless losses. The TCP sender exploits such a difference when determining the cause of a packet loss. However, TCP-Casablanca requires the change of every router in networks and this makes it hard to be deployed. It discriminates the cause of a packet loss in a stochastic manner, therefore has higher detection failure probability of wireless losses than ELN schemes. Furthermore, under heavy congestion or bursty-loss wireless channel condition, the probability distribution of packet losses may not follow the presumed one and thus the detection failure probability will increase.|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide scientific knowledge basis promoting a policy agenda by assessing current WEEE management trend among households. Survey data has been collected by distributing questionnaires randomly in 7 residential areas in Dhaka, and interviewing 400 households. This study found a very limited knowledge on WEEE among households (i. e. only 9 %). Competitive price, warranty period, brands and installment facilities are found important economic factors during the new purchase of electronic products. The actual life cycle of mobile phone, personal computers and television sets varies from 2 to 6 years. With the presence of informal sector WEEE collection and recycling, this study found that 30 % of the households were selling WEEE items to scrap collectors for economic benefits. More than 20 % of the respondents have thrown WEEE with household waste. Only 5 – 10 % of the respondents are willing to pay for any new WEEE management system. Enacting effective regulations, developing national WEEE inventory database, environmental awareness building through education and stakeholders participation in creating economic value chain; are suggested through this study. This research is one of a kind in investigating the attitudes of the households of a developing nation towards WEEE management and will show the pattern of WEEE generation, disposal and management practice in the most densely populated city in the world, i. e., Dhaka, Bangladesh. Results found from this research are expected to create a primary basis for encouraging scientific discussion and understanding the situation at policy level in Bangladesh and will also pave the way for a successful WEEE management policy making in any similar social and economic conditions...|$|R

These mining activities also produce vast amounts of discard material, better known as tailings material, which is stored in different ways after extraction has taken place. Usually, storage entails the construction of tailings storage facilities, <b>normal</b> <b>discard</b> or tailings dumps. The upper surfaces of these anthropogenic structures are usually unstable and are, in most cases, characterised by different forms of erosion. This can be due to the chemical and physical properties of the materials of which they are constructed, but mainly due to unstable construction geomorphology, steep slopes, which leads to poor water run-off management and subsequent instability. Therefore, these structures need to be actively managed in order to increase and maintain their stability. Grass establishment, as a stabilisation technique, is the most effective out of all of the techniques, but there are certain constraints regarding this method (Titshall et al. 2013). The most costly constraint is nutrient supplementation during aftercare phases. In order to minimize this cost, new and innovative technologies need to be explored, and trialled. The contribution of soil biological processes in this regard was assessed, in order to minimise anthropogenic inputs. These biological processes refer to the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by nodular root bacteria that grow on a group of plants referred to as legumes. These bacteria, also known as rhizobia, live in a symbiotic relationship with the host plant where they receive energy in the form of nutrients by trading nitrogen, which is an essential plant nutrient. Nine different tailings materials from different commodities available from South African Mines were selected. For a control medium, a well-drained soil type with an apedel structure and a clay content of approximately 6 % was selected in order to promote optimal natural growth. These materials were chemically and physically analysed in order to develop a more holistic understanding on a micro scale level, as well as to ascertain possible constraints in this regard. Pot trials were selected as the experimental method in order to apply more specific control over root growth, plant development and growing conditions. The experimental data were collected over one growing season for both live forms. For this study, seven legume species were selected for establishment in the tailings materials in order to investigate their establishment potential in the growth mediums and their ability to fixate nitrogen. Based on the data, specific species were identified as viable options to include in future tailings amelioration projects; it can be assumed that the nitrogen produced by these species will be available in the growth medium for uptake by neighbouring plants that lack this biological function.

Software based desktop videoconferencing tools are developed to demonstrate techniques necessary for video delivery in heterogeneous packet networks. Using the current network infrastructure and no network resource reservation, a one-to-many implementation is designed around a two-layer pyramidal video coder. During periods of congestion, the network routers give priority to the base layer, which by itself allows reconstruction of reasonable quality video. Receiver feedback is used to lower the output rate of the encoder's low priority pyramidal layer when all receivers are suffering high packet loss. Each of the two layers is transmitted on a separate multicast channel. Under persistent congestion, an individual receiver will <b>discard</b> the low <b>priority</b> pyramidal layer, which allows the network to prune the multicast tree 'd congestion. A new scheme is examined where if the other receivers back and avoi are agreeable, the source will respond to a receiver pruning its pyramidal layer by lowering its rate and allowing the receiver to quickly rejoin the pyramidal layer at a quality level higher than what the high priority base layer can provide by itself. Another new scheme is described where an agent on the receiver's local router provides spare capacity information to assist the receiver in its decision to rejoin the pyramidal layer...|$|R

40|$|On-demand routing {{protocols}} are preferred in mobile ad hoc networks where {{resources such as}} energy and bandwidth are constrained. In these protocols, a source discovers a route to a destination typically by flooding the entire or {{a part of the}} network with a route request (RREQ) message. The destination sends a route reply (RREP) message to the source after receiving the RREQ. The RREP travels hop by hop on the discovered route in reverse direction or on another route to the source. Sometimes the RREP can not be sent to the intended next hop by an intermediate node due to the dynamic network topology or network congestion. Existing on-demand {{routing protocols}} handle the undeliverable RREP as a <b>normal</b> data packet- <b>discard</b> the packet and send a route error message to the destination (initiator of the RREP). This is highly unacceptable because a RREP message has a lot at stake- it is obtained by a large number of RREQ transmissions, which is an expensive and time-consuming process. Furthermore, the source may have to start another round of route discovery to establish the route because of the loss of the RREP. This will exacerbate the situation. In this paper, we propose the idea of salvaging route reply (SRR) to improve the performance of on-demand routing protocols. SRR attempts to salvage an undeliverable RREP in two possible ways: looking up the route cache for an alternate path and conducting a one-hop SRR route discovery.

40|$|Studying ontogenetic {{trends in}} diet and habitat use of {{endangered}} sharks and deep-water teleosts is logistically challenging and expensive, {{due to the}} remote and inaccessible nature of the pelagic realm, {{and the extent of}} many marine migrations. Chemical analysis of inert, organic, incrementally formed tissues represents a window to retrospectively study whole life-history ecology, however these tissues are rare or absent in many fishes. The fish eye lens is a unique tissue, formed via the sequential deposition of protein-filled fiber cells, which undergo no subsequent remodelling once formed. Despite having great potential to record chemical variations reflecting foraging behaviour, lenses have received relatively little analytical attention. In this thesis I have explored the suitability of fish lenses for recovery of retrospective ontogenetic chemical information, focusing particularly on pre-birth and early juvenile life histories in elasmobranchs. I have confirmed consistent relationships between the body size and lens diameter of four study species (Aphonopus carbo, Coryphaenoides rupestris, Lamna nasus and Squalus acanthias), which allows recovery of a body size-referenced lens samples. Growth relationships reveal that a large proportion of lens tissue in elasmobranchs is deposited pre-birth, opening a previously unrecognised opportunity to study maternal provisioning from tissues of the offspring as adults. I have confirmed that transects of stable isotope compositions across lenses show bilateral symmetry, reflecting the sequential deposition of eye lens tissue. Muscle-lens tissue offsets were examined in S. acanthias and C. rupestris, identifying the potential for species-specific differences, possibly driven by variability in taxon-specific lens protein expression. I have then applied the validated lens sampling protocol to recover cross-generational life history movement and diet ecology information in three study species. Focusing on pre-birth ecology requires some understanding of the isotopic relationship between maternal and embryonic tissues. With access to gravid female spiny dogfish, isotopic spacing between maternal and offspring tissues was investigated. However, the measured mother-embryo isotopic offsets are confounded by migration across isotopic provinces, introducing considerable temporal de-coupling between nutrient assimilation fuelling maternal tissue remodelling and yolk sac provisioning, particularly in species with a long gestation period. For the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias recovered from the North Sea, lens-derived isotope histories revealed that, whilst the southern and central North Sea represent important foraging areas during mature life history, the northern North Sea is more important during gestation, pupping, and early life history. Similarly, porbeagle (L. nasus) lens chemistry indicates that the mothers of individuals caught in the Celtic Sea region forage over a wide area of the north Atlantic. Attracting mothers from a wide geographical area, this nursery area is likely to be important for the conservation of the endangered northeast Atlantic population, where mitigating <b>discarding</b> is a <b>priority</b> to fisheries managers. The isotopic variability of sequential A. carbo lens samples was also investigated in order to address trends in foraging and location throughout individual life history. Lens data provide further evidence of ontogenetic depth and latitudinal movements, consistent with the species’ ontogenetic migration theory. Obtaining a near whole life history record of information relating to an individual’s trophic and spatial ecology using traditional tagging methods is challenging, if not impossible. The lens therefore represents a valuable chemical repository for high-resolution ecological information that can be analysed retrospectively. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} H. 264 /AVC {{compressed}} video delivery over time-varying and error-prone wireless channels {{is affected by}} packet losses. To support quality of service (QoS) for video delivery over wireless networks cross-layer schemes have been discussed in the literature. We introduce a cross-layer priority-aware packet fragmentation scheme at the medium access control (MAC) layer to {{enhance the quality of}} pre-encoded H. 264 /AVC compressed bitstreams over bit-rate limited error-prone links in wireless networks. Larger fragments {{are more likely to be}} in error but smaller fragments require more overhead. The H. 264 slices are classified in four priorities at the encoder based on their cumulative mean square error (CMSE) contribution towards the received video quality. The slices of a priority class in each frame are aggregated into video packets of corresponding priority at the application (APP) layer. We derive the optimal fragment size for each priority class which achieves the maximum expected weighted goodput at different encoded video bit rates, slice sizes and bit error rates. Priority-aware packet fragmentation invokes slice discard in the buffer due to channel bit rate constraints on allocating fragment header bits. We propose a slice discard scheme using frame importance and slice CMSE contribution to control error propagation effects. Packet fragmentation is then extended to slice fragmentation by modifying the conventional H. 264 decoder to handle partial slice decoding. Priority-aware slice fragmentation combined with the proposed slice discard scheme provides considerable peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and video quality metric gains as compared to priority-agnostic fragmentation. Distortion due to channel errors can be alleviated by assigning stronger channel code rates, at the cost of reduced rate for source coding. Besides MAC layer fragmentation, aggregating H. 264 /AVC slices at the APP layer to form video packets with sizes adapted to their importance can also improve transmission reliability. We present a cross-layer dynamic programming (DP) approach to minimize the expected received video distortion by jointly addressing the priority-adaptive packet formation at the APP layer and rate compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) code rate allocation at the physical layer for pre-encoded prioritized slices of each group of pictures (GOP). Our scheme <b>discards</b> some low <b>priority</b> slices in order to improve protection to more important slices and meet the channel bitrate limitations, whenever necessary. Simulation results show that our proposed approach significantly improves received video quality compared to other error protection schemes. Further, we extend our cross-layer DP-based scheme to slices of each frame by predicting the expected channel bit budget per frame for real-time transmission. The prediction uses a generalized linear model developed over the parameters - CMSE per frame, channel SNR, and normalized compressed frame bit budget determined over a video dataset that spans high, medium and low motion complexity. This predicted frame bit budget is used to derive the packet sizes and their corresponding RCPC code rates for transmission using our DP-based approach. Simulation results show good correlation with the results of our DP-based scheme applied over the GOP. Unique characteristics of video traffic, such as the temporal and spatial dependencies between different video frames and their deadline constraints, pose a challenge in supporting the video quality rendered to the clients over time- varying, bandwidth-limited channels. Scalable Video Coding (H. 264 /SVC) enables the transmission and decoding of partial bit streams to provide video services with lower temporal or spatial resolutions or reduced fidelity while retaining a reconstruction quality that is high relative to the rate of the partial bit streams. We propose a sliding-window based flow control for scheduling the network abstraction layer (NAL) units in the post-encoding buffer of the streaming server for a real-time scalable video transmission scenario over a fast time-varying channel. Our scheduling scheme considers the importance of the NAL unit in terms of (i) its CMSE distortion contributed to the received video quality, (ii) its size in bits, and (iii) its time-to-expiry in seconds. The scheduling problem of determining the appropriate order of transmission is formulated as a 0 - 1 knapsack problem and a DP solution is proposed which runs in polynomial time. Our scheduling approach significantly reduces the number of whole frames discarded as compared to (a) a CMSE-based scheme which considers the importance of the NAL units only in terms of their CMSE contribution, and (b) the earliest deadline first scheme which minimizes the dwelling time of the NAL units in the post-encoding buffer. Simulation results show significant PSNR gains for different video sequences at different pre-roll delay...|$|R
