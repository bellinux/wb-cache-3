50|$|The Eden Valley Museum is a {{local history}} museum housed within a {{preserved}} example of Kentish vernacular architecture that has been Grade II* Listed. It is in the High Street of the historic market town of Edenbridge, Kent. The museum holds notable collections demonstrating the history of cricket ball making, tanning as well as archaeology and an extensive archive of local information. The museum is also notable {{as the home of}} a <b>needlework</b> <b>box</b> made by a German POW during World War Two. The box was featured as part of the BBC's 'A History of the World in 100 Objects' project.|$|E
60|$|The cottage {{internally}} may {{be described}} as a sort of boudoir extracted from the bulk of a mansion and deposited in a wood. The front room was filled with nicknacks, curious work-tables, filigree baskets, twisted brackets supporting statuettes, in which the grotesque in every case ruled the design; love-birds, in gilt cages; French bronzes, wonderful <b>boxes,</b> <b>needlework</b> of strange patterns, and other attractive objects. The apartment was one of those which seem to laugh in a visitor's face and on closer examination express frivolity more distinctly than by words.|$|R
