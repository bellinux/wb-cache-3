50|$|After {{months of}} debate, the court {{concluded}} that in 51 of the cases, excluding those of César Roberto Fierro Reyna, Roberto Moreno Ramos, and Osvaldo Torres Aguilera, the United States had breached their obligation {{as set forth}} under Article 36 paragraph 1 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by not informing the appropriate Mexican consular post without delay. By not doing so, the US had also deprived Mexico {{of the right to}} provide assistance to its nationals. In regards to César Roberto Fierro Reyna, Roberto Moreno Ramos, and Osvaldo Torres Aguilera, by not allowing a review and reconsideration of their convictions and sentences, the United States also violated Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Convention. As reparation in this case, the United States of America was ordered to provide review and reconsideration of convictions and sentences of the Mexican <b>nationals</b> and <b>implement</b> specific <b>measures</b> to ensure non-repetition.|$|R
5000|$|Rakove (1988) {{identifies}} {{several factors}} that explain {{the collapse of}} the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island. Rakove concludes that their failure to <b>implement</b> <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> [...] "stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace." [...] The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.|$|R

Furthermore, it also argues that, even though third pillar instruments are not capable of having direct effect, national courts are under a Union law obligation to scrutinize, and if necessary set aside, <b>national</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> which are inconsistent with fundamental rights as general principles of Union law...|$|E
40|$|This seminar {{is another}} {{excellent}} opportunity for {{those involved in}} preventing chemical weapons production and use to {{learn from each other}} about how the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) can become a foundation of arms control in Africa and around the world. The author is grateful to the staff of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for inviting him to address this distinguished seminar. The views expressed in this paper {{are those of the authors}} alone, and do not represent the position of the government of the US nor or of any other institution. In 1993, as the process of CWC ratification was beginning, concerns arose that the complexity of integrating the treaty with national law would cause each nation to implement the Convention without regard to what other nations were doing, thereby causing inconsistencies among States Parties in how the Convention would be carried out. As a result the Manual for National Implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention was prepared and presented it to each national delegation at the December 1993 meeting of the Preparatory Commission in The Hague. During its preparation, the Manual was reviewed by the Committee of Legal Experts on National Implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a group of distinguished international jurists, law professors, legally-trained diplomats, government officials, and Parliamentarians from every region of the world, including Mica. In February 1998, the second edition of the Manual was published in order to update it in light of developments since the CWC entered into force on 29 April 1997. The second edition 1998 clarified the national implementation options to reflect post-entry-into-force thinking, added extensive references to <b>national</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> that had been enacted by various States Parties, and included a prototype national implementing statute developed by the authors to provide a starting point for those whose <b>national</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> were still under development.

40|$|From Phase 3 (2013 - 20) of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme carbon-intensive {{industrial}} emitters {{will receive}} free allocations based on harmonised, EU-wide benchmarks. This paper analyses and evaluates {{the impacts of}} these new rules on allocations to key energy-intensive sectors. It exploits an original dataset that combines recent data from the <b>National</b> <b>Implementing</b> <b>Measures</b> of 20 Member States with the Community Independent Transaction Log and ETS-installation NACE code data. The analysis reveals that free allocations to benchmarked sectors will be reduced significantly, though not excessively, in Phase 3. This reduction should both increase public revenues from carbon auctions and {{has the potential to}} enhance the economic efficiency of the carbon market. The analysis also shows that changes in allocation vary mostly across installations within, rather than across, countries. Lastly, the analysis finds evidence that the new rules will, as intended, reward installations with better emissions performance, and will improve harmonisation of free allocations in the EU ETS by reducing differences in allocation levels across countries with similar carbon intensities of production...|$|E
40|$|This case note {{relates to}} the recent {{decision}} of the Court of Justice of the European Union (Court of Justice) in Gülay Bollacke v K + K Klaas & Kock B. V. & Co. KG, [2] on {{the interpretation of the}} Working Time Directive (and <b>national</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> and their interpretation) when the individual is unable to access the right to paid annual leave when ill, and who subsequently dies being owed this accrued leave. Ultimately, the individual (or perhaps more accurately his/her beneficiaries) [3] is entitled to receive payment for the leave untaken and national law, as exemplified in Germany in the case before the Court of Justice, must be interpreted accordingly. This case follows on from a series of judgments of the Court of Justice relating to the application of the Working Time Directive and demonstrates how the Court is steadily dismantling the barriers erected by Member States in preventing the complete and correct application of the law. Employers are also reminded of the requirement that they should follow the EU law where inconsistencies exist with national law or face the prospect of legal action, associated costs, and awards being issued against them. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study, {{commissioned}} by the European Parliament’s Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs {{at the request of}} the Committee on Petitions, considers the dilemma of a broad or narrow application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR) to national measures. It considers the way the Court of Justice of the EU (CJ EU) has been interpreting fundamental rights in relation to such measures before and after the Lisbon Treaty and the constitutionalisation of the Charter: currently the CJ EU applies a varied interpretation of the CFR, on the basis of a narrow approach to its applicability to Member States' measures implementing EU law. As a consequence, the Commission’s strict approach in relation to a selection of petitions received by the Committee on Petitions raising issues of alleged CFR violations seems justified in the light of the existing law and CJ EU jurisprudence. The analysis, after examining the considerations that militate in favour and against a narrow interpretation of the Charter and of its Article 51, concludes that a more courageous approach should be taken at EU level when examining <b>national</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> of EU law raising fundamental rights issues, notably until these are not evenly and properly guaranteed across the EU...|$|E

40|$|The EU Directive {{laying down}} rules against tax {{avoidance}} practices that directly affect {{the functioning of}} the Internal Market—the so-called Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD) —was adopted on 12 July 2016. It {{has become one of the}} core vehicles for implementing the output of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, a process led by the G 20 and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), at the EU level. The ATAD has imposed a legally binding obligation upon EU Member States to incorporate the conclusions of Action 2 (hybrid mismatch arrangements), Action 3 (controlled foreign company (CFC) rules) and Action 4 (interest deductions) of the BEPS in their domestic laws and regulations, and it has secured a certain uniformity of <b>national</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> across the EU by imposing a common minimum level of protection. In addition, the ATAD has also set out a general anti-abuse rule (GAAR) and exit tax provisions, which further strengthen the EU’s baseline protection of tax revenues. The potential impact of this milestone Directive on the Internal Market and the tax systems of Member States in a short- to long-term period is still to be evaluated. This article offers preliminary thoughts, focusing primarily on the UK’s perspective. The author first briefly addresses possible consequences for the EU as a whole, and then analyses the ATAD from the UK’s point of view, showing how the adoption of this Directive fits into a broader UK tax policy and law both prior to and following the Brexit vote...|$|E
40|$|This article {{highlights}} how {{the complexity}} of EU secondary law (other than self- executing acts) can cause real difficulties at the stage of its transposition at national level. Two practical examples, involving {{the intervention of the}} Commission, illustrate the problem. It is assumed, on the one hand, that the general principles of law (legal certainty, legitimate expectations and transparency) require the EU legislator to ensure intelligibility and drafting quality, {{and on the other hand}} that these features are of the essence not only for citizens and for business, but also to enable the national authorities to adopt domestic implementing measures in an effective and timely manner. In that perspective, the article outlines some tentative methodological suggestions, while addressing, in the light of the ECJ case-law, the methods of interpreting EU law, the role of recitals, the Commission’s use of soft-law instruments to guide <b>national</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures,</b> as well as the proactive attitude from Member States within and outside the Council. A practical suggestion is made to establish a close connection at national level between the personnel taking part in the drafting of an EU legal act (upstream phase, i. e. those people contributing to the draft of legislation at the Council level) and the personnel engaged in the process of implementing that act at the domestic level (downstream phase). Linking the two phases so as to rely on the same national staff for advising on both appears to be a quite simple scheme to ensure better understanding of the EU legal texts and to sound a warning wherever there is a risk of an infringement due to inadequate implementation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The {{objective of this}} project is to produce a large user-friendly and research-oriented database of the national measures that transpose EU directives into domestic law {{in order to provide}} the basis for large-N theoretically-based academic research on the causes of variance in the timing and quality of national implementation. The pre-existing databases on national transposition were not designed to facilitate academic research. The Commission publishes an annual report on the application of Community law, but it lists only the proportion of directives that have been transposed up to a given year, without providing data on delay of transposition. It also uses cumulative data since 1960, creating a severe upward bias in the national compliance record. The report tends to consider a directive transposed when the first measure has been notified by the Member States. But transposition normally needs more than one national measure, so the Commission’s data are likely overestimated compliance. Finally, no information is provided on the dates and instruments of national transposition. Recently, Celex, the EU legal database, has been opened to the public for free online consultation. The database contains approximately 3, 000 directives, but it is not designed in a way that could be immediately used for research purposes. Fields than contains dates need to be converted from string to date format. Deadlines for the adoption of national measures need to be separated from deadlines for the application. There are no fields containing the dates of adoption of national transposition measures. These need to be deducted from the title of <b>national</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> or by other available means. Moreover, there are no fields that record the types on national measures. Finally, there are mistakes and missing information that need correcting and completing. The project consists of migrating the raw data available from Celex into an appropriately-designed database...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{compares the}} {{implementation}} of European Council Directive 2000 / 43 prohibiting discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin in Britain and Germany. In order {{to shed light on}} the factors that shape anti-discrimination policy in Europe, it tests the theory that anti-discrimination law and policy making in Europe takes place as a cyclical process of ‘cross-fertilisation’. This policy process is characterised by the interaction between the European and the national level and the influence each level exerts on the other proving inspiration or incentives for the continuous development of anti-discrimination and equality law. In proving this thesis, the study begins with an examination of the coverage and the concepts of the Directive as well as its interaction with existing national approaches providing protection from racial discrimination. Questions are asked about the ability of the Directive to reach its goal of aiding the understanding of racism throughout Europe, of creating common tools to combat it and of instigating action at the European level that aid developments at national level. The main part of the project is devoted to a comparison of {{the implementation of}} the Race Directive in the UK and Germany. Since the Directive only constitutes a framework it provides scope for differences in the legal systems to influence the implementation process. The study compares in both countries their original position prior to the drafting of the Directive and assesses the legal and wider implementation of the Directive by analysing the <b>national</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>measures</b> and shifts in national anti-discrimination policy as result of EU equality law in the area of racial discrimination. The study shows that national narratives of race and ethnicity in Germany and the UK shape their discrimination legislation, including proactive approaches to the integration of ethnic minorities. The European anti-race discrimination framework is argued to contain mechanisms through which national implementation outcomes can re-influence European law and policy making, completing the cross-fertilisation cycle...|$|E
