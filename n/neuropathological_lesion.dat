Hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins appears to be an early phenomenom, preceding their aggregation into fibrillar structures. This hyperphosphorylation could result from changes in the activation of signalling cascades.

Methods A systematic review of the methods of population-based neuropathological studies of dementia was carried out. These studies were assessed in relation to their representativeness of underlying populations and the clinical, neuropsychological and neuropathological approaches adopted. Results Six studies were found to be true population-based neuropathological studies of dementia in the older people: the Hisayama study (Japan); Vantaa 85 + study (Finland); CC 75 C study (Cambridge, UK); CFAS (multicentre, UK); Cache County study (Utah, USA); HAAS (Hawaï, USA). These differ in the core characteristics of their populations. The studies used standardised neuropathological methods which facilitate analyses on: clinicopathological associations and confirmation of diagnosis, assessing the validity of hierarchical models of <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesion</b> burden; investigating the associations between neuropathological burden and risk factors including genetic factors. Examples of findings are given although there is too little overlap in the areas investigated amongst these studies to form the basis of a systematic review of the results. Conclusion Clinicopathological studies based on true population samples can provide unique insights in dementia. Individually they are limited in power and scope; together they represent a powerful source to translate findings from laboratory to populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Neurofibrillary tangles and {{senile plaques}} are the {{characteristic}} <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> of Alzheimer's disease. Neurofibrillary tangles {{are composed of}} a microtubule-associated protein, the tau protein. This protein {{plays a role in}} the development of neuronal polarity and the stabilisation of microtubules. In Alzheimer's disease, tau proteins are abnormally phosphorylated on several sites. This abnormal phosphorylation might induce the modifications of the microtubule network observed in affected neurones. The main component of the senile plaque is an amyloid deposit made of a polypeptide (beta/A 4 amyloid) which derives from a larger precursor. The overexpression of this precursor in experimental models or mutations of its gene leads to the development of <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions.</b> The relationships between cytoskeletal abnormalities and beta/A 4 amyloid are further discussed.

It has long been recognized that another genetic abnormality, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), is associated with early and severe development of AD <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions.</b> It remains a challenge, however, to understand how these facts relate to the pathological changes in the brains of AD patients. We used computerized image analysis to examine the size distribution of one of the characteristic <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> in AD, deposits of A beta peptide in senile plaques (SPs). Surprisingly, we find that a log-normal distribution fits the SP size distribution quite well, motivating a porous model of SP morphogenesis. We then analyzed SP size distribution curves in genotypically defined subgroups of AD patients. The data demonstrate that both apoE epsilon 4 /AD and trisomy 21 /AD lead to increased amyloid deposition, but by apparently different mechanisms. The size distribution curve is shifted toward larger plaques in trisomy 21 /AD, probably reflecting increased A beta production. In apoE epsilon 4 /AD, the size distribution is unchanged but the number of SP is increased compared to apoE epsilon 3, suggesting increased probability of SP initiation. These results demonstrate that subgroups of AD patients defined on the basis of molecular characteristics have quantitatively different neuropathological phenotypes...|$|R

The pathogenic mechanisms leading to these abnormalities are not known, but a relation to rapid neuronal damage is assumed. No systematic analysis on brain-derived proteins in the CSF and <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesion</b> profiles has been performed. Methods CSF protein levels of brain-derived proteins and the degree of spongiform changes, neuronal loss and gliosis in various brain areas were analyzed in 57 CJD patients. Results We observed three different patterns of CSF alteration associated with the degree of cortical and subcortical changes. NSE levels increased with lesion severity of subcortical areas. Tau and 14 - 3 - 3 levels increased with minor pathological changes, a negative correlation was observed with severity of cortical lesions. Levels of the physiological form of the prion protein (PrP c) and Aβ 1 – 42 levels correlated negatively with cortical pathology, most clearly with temporal and occipital lesions. Conclusion Our results indicate that the alteration of levels of brain-derived proteins in the CSF does not only reflect the degree of neuronal damage, but it is also modified by the localization on the brain pathology. Brain specific lesion patterns have to be considered when analyzing CSF neuronal proteins. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Over {{the last}} decades, {{considerable}} {{progress has been}} made in the perinatal management of high-risk preterm neonates, changing the landscape of pathological conditions associated with neurological impairments. Major focal destructive lesions are now less common, and the predominant <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesion</b> is diffuse white-matter damage in the most immature infants. Similarly, over the last few years, we have observed a trend towards a decrease in neurological impairment in the absence of treatments specifically aimed at neuroprotection. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether recent changes in treatment strategies in perinatal care during the perinatal period could have had an indirect beneficial impact on the occurrence of brain lesions and their consequences. METHODS: Thus, we reviewed the effects of the most common treatments administered during the perinatal period to the mother or to very preterm infants on brain damage and neurocognitive follow-up. RESULTS: Antenatal steroids and exogenous surfactant are the two main treatments capable of leading to neuroprotection in very preterm infants. Randomized controlled trials are currently investigating the effects of inhaled nitric oxide and erythropoietin, while antenatal magnesium sulphate and caffeine are also likely to provide some neuroprotection, but this needs to be further investigated. Finally, other common treatments against pain, haemodynamic failure and patent ductus arteriosus have conflicting or no effects on the developing brain. CONCLUSION: While specific neuroprotective drugs are still awaited, recent advances in perinatal care have been associated with an unexpected but significant decrease in the incidence of both severe brain lesions and neurological impairment...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} an {{inflammatory}} process {{is involved in}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) was proposed already hundred years ago but only {{the past twenty years}} inflammation-related proteins have been identified within plaques. A number of acute-phase proteins colocalize with the extracellular amyloid fibrils, the so called Aβ-associated proteins. Activated microglia and astrocytes surrounding amyloid deposits express receptors of innate immunity and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this paper we review the evidence for involvement of innate immunity {{in the early stages of}} the pathological cascade of AD. Diffuse plaques, the initial <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesion</b> in the cerebral neocortex, contain next to Aβ also apolipoprotein E, clusterin, α 1 -antichymotrypsin and activated complement proteins. Interestingly, genetic studies have shown gene-loci to be associated with AD for all these proteins, except α 1 -antichymotrpsin. Fibrillar Aβ can, through stimulation of toll-like receptors and CD- 14 on glial cells, activate pathways for increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This pathway, inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines, is under genetic control. The finding that the responsiveness of the innate immunity is higher in offspring with a parental history of late-onset AD indicates heritable traits for AD that are related to inflammatory processes. Prospective epidemiological studies which report that higher serum levels of certain acute-phase proteins are associated with cognitive decline or dementia provide additional evidence for the early involvement of inflammation in AD pathogenesis. The reviewed neuropathological, epidemiological and genetic findings show evidence for involvement of the innate-immunity in the early stages of pathological cascade as well as for the hypothesis that the innate immunity contributes to the etiology of late-onset A...|$|E

40|$|Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a {{characteristic}} <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesion</b> of Alzheimer's disease (AD). They {{are composed of}} a highly-phosphorylated form of the microtubule-associated protein tau. We are investigating the relationship between NFTs and microtubule stability and how tau phosphorylation and function is affected in transgenic models and by co-expression with beta-amyloid precursor protein and presenilins. In most NFT-bearing neurons, we observed a strong reduction in acetylated alpha-tubulin immunoreactivity (a marker of stable microtubules) and a reduction of the in situ hybridization signal for tubulin mRNA. In transfected cells, mutated tau forms (corresponding to tau mutations identified in familial forms of frontotemporal dementias linked to chromosome 17) were less efficient {{in their ability to}} sustain microtubule growth. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that destabilization of the microtubule network is an important mechanism of cell dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. The glycogen synthase kinase- 3 beta (GSK- 3 beta) generates many phosphorylated sites on tau. We performed a neuroanatomical study of GSK- 3 beta distribution showing that developmental evolution of GSK- 3 beta compartmentalization in neurons paralleled that of phosphorylated tau. Studies on transfected cells and on cultured neurons showed that GSK- 3 beta activity controls tau phosphorylation and tau functional interaction with microtubules. Tau phosphorylation was not affected in neurons overexpressing beta-amyloid precursor protein. Transgenic mice expressing a human tau isoform and double transgenic animals for tau and mutated presenilin 1 have been generated; a somatodendritic accumulation of phosphorylated transgenic tau proteins, as observed in the pretangle stage in AD, has been observed but NFTs were not found, suggesting that additional factors might be necessary to induce their formation.

In FVB mice, vacuolation was less intense but more widely distributed, with numerous lesions in the hippocampus and cerebellar white matter. This constellation of widespread neuropatho-logic changes was similar to that found in FVB mice inoculated with Rocky Mountain Laboratory (RML) prions, a strain derived from a sheep with scrapie.

However, despite extensive clinical and genomic studies, the molecular basis of AD development and progression remains elusive. METHODS: To elucidate molecular systems associated with AD, we developed a large scale gene expression dataset from 1053 postmortem brain samples across 19 cortical regions of 125 individuals with a severity spectrum of dementia and neuropathology of AD. We excluded brain specimens that evidenced neuropathology other than that characteristic of AD. For the first time, we performed a pan-cortical brain region genomic analysis, characterizing the gene expression changes associated with a measure of dementia severity and multiple measures of the severity of <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> associated with AD (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and constructing region-specific co-expression networks. We rank-ordered 44, 692 gene probesets, 1558 co-expressed gene modules and 19 brain regions based upon their association with the disease traits. RESULTS: The neurobiological pathways identified through these analyses included actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, and nervous system development. Using public human brain single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we computed brain cell type-specific marker genes for human and determined that many of the abnormally expressed gene signatures and network modules were specific to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons. Analysis based on disease severity suggested that: many of the gene expression changes, including those of oligodendrocytes, occurred early in the progression of disease, making them potential translational/treatment development targets and unlikely to be mere bystander result of degeneration; several modules were closely linked to cognitive compromise with lesser association with traditional measures of neuropathology. The brain regional analyses identified temporal lobe gyri as sites associated with the greatest and earliest gene expression abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: This transcriptomic network analysis of 19 brain regions provides a comprehensive assessment of the critical molecular pathways associated with AD pathology and offers new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying selective regional vulnerability to AD at different stages of the progression of cognitive compromise and development of the canonical <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> of AD...|$|R

We find that Aβ deposits are cleared first and subsequently reemerge prior to the tau pathology, indicative of a hierarchical and direct relationship between Aβ and tau. The clearance of the tau pathology is mediated by the proteasome and is dependent on the phosphorylation state of tau, as hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates are unaffected by the Aβ antibody treatment. These findings indicate that Aβ immunization may be useful for clearing both hallmark lesions of AD, provided that intervention occurs early in the disease course...|$|R

In this cross-sectional study, we describe clinical and neuropathological variables related to cognitive impairment in 1, 092 participants (mean age = 74 y, 49 % male, 69 % white, and mean education = 4 y). Cognitive function was investigated using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE); neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Associations between <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> and cognitive impairment were investigated using ordinal logistic regression.

Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), hippocampal sclerosis, lacunar infarcts, hyaline atherosclerosis, siderocalcinosis, and Lewy body disease were independently associated with cognitive impairment. Higher NPC scores were associated with worse scores in the CDR sum of boxes (β = 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 20 - 1. 46), IQCODE (β = 0. 14, 95 % CI 0. 13 - 0. 16), and NPI (β = 1. 74, 95 % CI = 1. 33 - 2. 16).

40|$|NFTs (neurofibrillary tangles) in Alzheimer's {{disease and}} in tauopathies are {{hallmark}} <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> whose relationship with neuronal dysfunction, neuronal death {{and with other}} lesions [such as Abeta (amyloid beta-peptide) pathology] are still imperfectly understood. Many transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type or mutant tau proteins have been generated to investigate the physiopathology of tauopathies. Most of the mice overexpressing wild-type tau do not develop NFTs, but can develop a severe axonopathy, whereas overexpression of mutant tau leads to NFT formation, synaptic loss and neuronal death in several models. The association between neuronal death and NFTs has, however, been challenged in some models showing a dissociation between tau aggregation and tau toxicity. Cross-breeding of mice developing NFTs with mice developing Abeta deposits increases NFT pathology, highlighting the relationship between tau and amyloid pathology. On the other hand, tau expression seems to be necessary for expression of a pathological phenotype associated with amyloid pathology. These findings {{suggest that there is}} a bilateral cross-talk between Abeta and tau pathology. These observations are discussed by the presentation of some relevant models developed recently.

40|$|Amyloid plaques, {{composed}} of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ), are hallmark <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> in Alzheimer disease (AD) brain. Aβ fulfills {{a central role in}} AD pathogenesis, and reduction of Aβ levels should prove beneficial for AD treatment. Aβ generation is initiated by proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β-secretase enzyme BACE 1. Bace 1 knockout (Bace 1 –/–) mice have validated BACE 1 as the authentic β-secretase in vivo. BACE 1 is essential for Aβ generation and represents a suitable drug target for AD therapy, especially because this enzyme is up-regulated in AD. However, although initial data indicated that Bace 1 –/– mice lack an overt phenotype, the BACE 1 -mediated processing of APP and other substrates may be important for specific biological processes. In this minireview, topics range from the initial identification of BACE 1 to the fundamental knowledge gaps that remain in our understanding of this protease. We address pertinent questions such as putative causes of BACE 1 elevation in AD and discuss why, nine years since the identification of BACE 1, treatments that address the underlying pathological mechanisms of AD are still lacking...|$|R
40|$|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a spongiform {{encephalopathy}} that affects about 1 in 10 (6) inhabitants in most countries. Recently, a new variant of CJD {{has been linked}} to the epidemic of bovine {{spongiform encephalopathy}}. Therefore, vigilance concerning the disease's incidence has been increased. We conducted a comprehensive, nation-wide and retrospective study. In 79 Belgian autopsies, we found the characteristic triad of spongiosis, neuronal loss and reactive gliosis. The occipital cortex was most affected, while the cerebellum was mostly spared. Immunohistochemistry was performed using hydrated autoclave pretreatment and several monoclonal antibodies directed against the prion protein. We identified prion-immunoreactive patterns and locations reflecting the important heterogeneity, independently of the antibody that was used. Granular prion immunoreactivity was observed in astrocytes. We studied the regional intensity of the prion immunostaining and determined that the frontal cortex with 95 % positive immunoreactivity was best suited for a biopsy. We studied the disease duration in sporadic CJD patients who showed <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> of other neurodegenerative disorders (such as Alzheimer's disease). The study shapes the framework in which a prospective neuropathological registry will be able to function. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Distinct prion strains often exhibit {{different}} incubation {{periods and}} patterns of <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions.</b> Strain characteristics are generally retained upon intraspecies transmission, but may change on transmission to another species. We investigated the inactivation of two related prions strains: BSE prions from cattle and mouse-passaged BSE prions, termed 301 V. Inactivation was manipulated by exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), variations in pH, and different temperatures. Infectivity was measured using transgenic mouse lines that are highly susceptible to either BSE or 301 V prions. Bioassays demonstrated that BSE prions are up to 1, 000 -fold more resistant to inactivation than 301 V prions while Western immunoblotting showed that short acidic SDS treatments reduced protease-resistant PrP Sc from BSE prions and 301 V prions at similar rates. Our findings argue that despite being derived from BSE prions, mouse 301 V prions are not necessarily a reliable model for cattle BSE prions. Extending these comparisons to human sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and hamster Sc 237 prions, we found that BSE prions were 10 - and 10 6 -fold more resistant to inactivation, respectively. Our studies contend that any prion inactivation procedures must be validated by bioassay against the prion strain for whic...|$|R

It is known that excessive accumulation of neurotoxic β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in the brain is the hallmark of AD and the deposition of Aβ causes <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> in the brain of patients with AD [3]. These patients often exhibit psychiatric symptoms along with cognitive decline [4]. Emotional symptoms like anxiety and phobia contribute significantly to the clinical profile in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [5, 6]. Emotional behavior critically depends on the amygdala, a region of the temporal lobe that is affected by Aβ and neurofibrillary tangle pathology at early stages of AD [7, 8]. Intraneuronal Aβ accumulation in the amygdala enhanced fear and anxiety in AD transgenic mice [9]. Moreover, Aβ accumulation in the basolateral amygdala also contributed to an increase in anxiety in AD transgenic mice [10]. Previously published dat...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggregation}} {{of specific}} proteins plays {{a pivotal role}} in the etiopathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptide-containing plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated protein tau are the two main <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> in Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, Parkinson's disease is defined by the presence of intraneuronal inclusions (Lewy bodies), in which α-synuclein (α-syn) has been identified as a major protein component. The current literature provides considerable insights into the mechanisms underlying oligomeric-related neurodegeneration, as well as the relationship between protein aggregation and ND, thus facilitating the development of novel putative biomarkers and/or pharmacological targets. Recently, α-syn, tau and Aβ have been shown to interact each other or with other "pathological proteins" to form toxic heteroaggregates. These latest findings are overcoming the concept that each neurodegenerative disease is related to the misfolding of a single specific protein. In this review, potential opportunities and pharmacological approaches targeting α-syn, tau and Aβ and their oligomeric forms are highlighted with examples from recent studies. Protein aggregation as a biomarker of NDs, in both the brain and peripheral fluids, is deeply explored. Finally, the relationship between biomarker establishment and assessment and their use as diagnostics or therapeutic targets are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Summary: As {{the scope}} of the problem of Alzheimer's disease (AD) grows due to an aging population, {{research}} into the devastating condition has taken on added urgency. Rare inherited forms of AD provide insight into the molecular pathways leading to degeneration and have made possible the development of transgenic animal models. Several of these models are based on the overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilins, or tau to cause production and accumulation of amyloid-β into plaques or hyperphosphorylated tau into neurofibrillary tangles. Producing these characteristic <b>neuropathological</b> <b>lesions</b> in animals causes progressive neurodegeneration and in some cases similar behavioral disruptions to those seen in AD patients. Knockout models of proteins involved in AD have also been generated to explore the native functions of these genes and examine whether pathogenesis is due to loss of function or toxic gain of function in these systems. Although none of the transgenic lines models the human condition exactly, the ability to study similar pathological processes in living animals have provided numerous insights into disease mechanisms and opportunities to test therapeutic agents. This chapter reviews animal models of AD and their contributions to developing therapeutic approaches for AD...|$|R
