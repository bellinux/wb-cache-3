5|$|Catalytic {{variants}} employing stoichiometric diallylcarbonate {{and other}} allylic carbonates {{have also been}} developed, primarily by Jiro Tsuji. For these the choice of solvent is essential: <b>nitrile</b> solvents produce the desired enones while ethereal solvents produce α-allyl ketones instead.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino <b>nitrile</b> as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the <b>nitrile</b> in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E
50|$|Inorganic {{compounds}} {{containing the}} −C≡N group are not called <b>nitriles,</b> but cyanides instead. Though both <b>nitriles</b> and cyanides {{can be derived}} from cyanide salts, most <b>nitriles</b> are not nearly as toxic.|$|R
2500|$|Organic {{cyanides}} {{are usually}} called <b>nitriles.</b> In <b>nitriles,</b> the CN group is linked by a covalent bond to carbon. [...] For example in acetonitrile, the cyanide group is bonded to methyl (CH3). Because {{they do not}} release cyanide ions, <b>nitriles</b> are generally far less toxic than cyanide salts. [...] Some <b>nitriles,</b> which occur naturally as cyanohydrins, release hydrogen cyanide.|$|R
25|$|In IUPAC nomenclature, organic {{compounds}} that have a–C≡N functional group are called <b>nitriles.</b> Thus, <b>nitriles</b> are {{organic compounds}}.|$|R
5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme {{that occurs in}} humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is <b>nitrile</b> hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of <b>nitrile,</b> latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nitriles</b> occur {{naturally}} in a diverse set {{of plant and}} animal sources. Over 120 naturally occurring <b>nitriles</b> have been isolated from terrestrial and marine sources. <b>Nitriles</b> are commonly encountered in fruit pits, especially almonds, and during cooking of Brassica crops (such as cabbage, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower), which release <b>nitriles</b> through hydrolysis. Mandelonitrile, a cyanohydrin produced by ingesting almonds or some fruit pits, releases hydrogen cyanide and is responsible for the toxicity of cyanogenic glycosides.|$|R
40|$|Enrichment {{cultures}} were obtained, after prolonged incubation on a {{shale oil}} {{as the sole}} source of nitrogen, that selectively degraded <b>nitriles.</b> Capillary gas chromatographic analyses showed that the mixed microbial populations in the enrichments degraded the homologous series of aliphatic <b>nitriles</b> but not the aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, or heterocyclic-nitrogen compounds found in this oil. Time course studies showed that lighter <b>nitriles</b> were removed more rapidly than higher-molecular-weight <b>nitriles.</b> A Pseudomonas fluorescens strain isolated from an enrichment, which was able to completely utilize the individual <b>nitriles</b> undecyl cyanide and undecanenitrile as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen, was unable to attack stearonitrile when provided alone as the growth substrate. A P. aeruginosa strain, also isolated {{from one of the}} enrichments, used <b>nitriles</b> but not aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons when the oil was used as a sole nitrogen source. However, when the shale oil was used as the sole source of carbon, aliphatic hydrocarbons in addition to <b>nitriles</b> were degraded but aromatic hydrocarbons were still not attacked by this P. aeruginosa strain...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a related}} dehydration, {{secondary}} amides give <b>nitriles</b> by the von Braun amide degradation. In this case, one C-N bond is cleaved.The dehydration of aldoximes (RCH=NOH) also affords <b>nitriles.</b> Typical reagents for this transformation are triethylamine/sulfur dioxide, zeolites, or sulfuryl chloride.

25|$|As α-cyano carbanions {{may be used}} in many of {{the same}} {{contexts}} as α-sulfonyl anions, reductive decyanation methods offer a viable alternative to reductive desulfonylation. Dissolving metal reductions are most useful for the decyanation of tertiary <b>nitriles</b> (primary and secondary <b>nitriles</b> give the corresponding amines in addition to decyanated products), but potassium is a more general reducing agent that reduces primary, secondary, and tertiary <b>nitriles.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Nitriles</b> are {{important}} building {{blocks in the}} construction of amines, amides, ketones, carboxylic acids, and esters. For example, 1, 2 -diarylimidazoles as the potent anti-inflam-matory agent, 1 thiazole analogues as the inhibitor of super-oxide, 2 benzamidines with activity of fibrinogen antagonist, 3 (R) -amides and (S) -acids as the enzyme, 4 and glutarimides with pharmacological effects 5 were all prepared from <b>nitriles.</b> Occasionally, <b>nitriles</b> have been synthesized from alde-hyde.

25|$|The trimerization {{of a part}} of a <b>nitrile</b> {{molecule}} and {{two parts}} of acetylene into pyridine is called Bönnemann cyclization. This modification of the Reppe synthesis can be activated either by heat or by light. While the thermal activation requires high pressures and temperatures, the photoinduced cycloaddition proceeds at ambient conditions with CoCp2(cod) (Cp = cyclopentadienyl, cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) as a catalyst, and can be performed even in water. A series of pyridine derivatives can be produced in this way. When using acetonitrile as the <b>nitrile,</b> 2-methylpyridine is obtained, which can be dealkylated to pyridine.|$|E
25|$|Amygdalin is {{classified}} as a cyanogenic glycoside because each amygdalin molecule includes a <b>nitrile</b> group, which can be released as the toxic cyanide anion {{by the action of}} a beta-glucosidase: when eaten by people amygdalin releases the cyanide which poisons them.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of the effect of}} isothiocianates and <b>nitriles</b> derived from some glucosinolates, namely epi-progoitrin, sinalbin, glucotropaeolin, glucocheirolin and glucoraphenin, on human erythroleukemic in vitro cultured cells was studied. Many studies have in fact evidenced that a consumption of vegetable containing glucosinolates could reduce the development of colorectal cancer. In the experimental conditions used, the production of isothiocianates and <b>nitriles</b> from glucosinolates is almost quantitative as confirmed by HPLC or GC-MS analysis. The obtained results demonstrated that in general <b>nitriles</b> are considerably less potent than the corresponding isothiocyanates in inhibiting cancer cell growth. Particularly, the isothiocianates inhibitory activity on K 562 cells growth is higher in the case of products derived from epi-progoitrin, glucotropaeolin, glucoraphenin and glucocheirolin; whilst for <b>nitriles</b> the higher activity in inhibiting K 562 cells growth is showed by sinalbin derived product. Considering the antiproliferative activity found for isothiocianates and <b>nitriles,</b> further studies will be aimed to the possible application of glucosinolate derived products as chemopreventive cancer agents for the reduction of colorectal cancer...|$|R
40|$|Biofumigation {{is based}} on the use of glucosinolate-containing plants for the control of soil-borne pest and diseases. Upon tissue damage, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by {{endogenous}} enzymes (myrosinase) and a range of biologically active compounds are formed. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) are the quantitatively dominating products formed at neutral pH. Most of these compounds are volatile and only sparingly soluble in aqueous systems, and depending on the R-group structure and the presence of nucleophiles, further transformation of ITCs occurs. At lower pH and in the presence of certain molecules able to deliver two redox equivalents, the proportion of <b>nitriles</b> increases at the expense of ITC. The effect of ascorbic acid and glutathione on the production of <b>nitriles</b> at pH 5 was investigated by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC). The presence of 0. 25 µmol ascorbic acid increased the production of <b>nitriles</b> although at higher concentrations the proportion of <b>nitriles</b> decreased.
