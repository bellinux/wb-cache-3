The contralateral and ipsilateral <b>negative</b> <b>waves</b> consist of a positive and negative component. The contralateral and ipsilateral waves frequently have two peaks. In 120 % of electrode penetrations a positive wave was recorded medial to the medial superior olive with contralateral stimulation. The positive and <b>negative</b> <b>waves</b> produced with click stimulation are due to postsynaptic activity. The positive components of the contralateral and ipsilateral <b>negative</b> <b>waves</b> {{may be due to}} presynaptic activity. The S-shaped superior olivary nucleus contributes to the potential recorded with ipsilateral stimulation when the electrode track passes through the area where the S-shaped nucleus lies close to the medial superior olive.

Initial <b>negative</b> and reflected <b>waves</b> continue to affect each other and produce a complex wave field. In addition to this phenomenon, water particles also split from the main waterbody and interact again during the collision process due to the properties of the Lagrangian model; hence, this may increase the nonlinearity of phenomenon.|$|R

40|$|Background: Surgical {{approach}} to the intramedullary tumors and cavities are microsurgical techniques of dorsal myelotomies, which entails the risk of damage to the dorsal columns and the central spinal cord gray matter. The aim {{of the study is}} to analyze the clinical sensory dysfunction before surgery and the changes of the intraoperative SEP (somatosensory potentials) before myelotomy. These data would be of help to neurosurgeons in planning the myelotomy – dorsomedial or dorsolateral. Methods: 16 patients were operated on for deafferentation pain syndromes, intramedullary tumors and syringomyelia of the cervical spinal cord. Preoperatively the patients sensory system of dorsal columns and central gray matter was examined for vibration and position sense dysfunction and pain and temperature damage. Before myelotomy the intraoperative SEP from the dorsal surface of the spinal cord after the stimulation of the median and tibial nerves were recorded. Results: After median nerve stimulation the N 13 wave was partially or completely absent, and fast <b>negative</b> <b>waves</b> appeared instead. The presence and absence of N 13 was in association with pain and temperature dysfunction or with dissociative sensory loss. The mean duration of the SEP potential was shorter than normal (p < 0. 0005, n = 11). After tibial nerve stimulation the first <b>negative</b> <b>waves</b> were most stabile, fast <b>negative</b> <b>waves</b> as the most prominent element of the normal SEP were partially or completely absent. This change was in association with diminution or loss of vibration and posture senses. The duration of the conductive SEP was shorter than normal (p = 0. 064, n = 5). Conclusions: Dissociative sensory loss is associated with absence of the N 13 in median nerve SEP and connected to the central cord destruction. The loss of vibration and posture senses affects the fast <b>negative</b> <b>waves</b> of tibial SEP and points toward damage of the dorsal columns. The dorsolateral myelotomy is justified in cases of central cord destruction, and dorsomedial myelotomy in cases of dorsal columns damage. </p...|$|R

Patients with early or late T-wave normalization had similar event-free survival curves that diverged rapidly from that of patients with persistent <b>negative</b> T <b>waves,</b> who had a worse outcome (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether persistent versus early or delayed T <b>wave</b> normalisation of <b>negative</b> T <b>waves</b> after {{acute myocardial infarction}} {{is determined by the}} myocardial state, the treatment strategy, or both. DESIGN: 127 consecutive patients with a first acute myocardial infarction and > or = 2 <b>negative</b> T <b>waves</b> on the 24 - 36 hour ECG were studied. They underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography and coronary angiography during the first week. ECG was recorded at hospital discharge and at a mean (SD) of 4 (1) months. SETTING: University hospital. RESULTS: T wave normalisation was observed in 88 patients (early at discharge in 19 and delayed at four months in 69). Early T wave normalisation was associated with sustained contractile reserve during dobutamine stress (13 of 19 (68 %)), whereas delayed T wave normalisation was observed mainly in patients with an ischaemic response (49 of 69 (71 %)). The persistence of <b>negative</b> T <b>waves</b> was associated with an ischaemic response (21 of 39 (54 %)) or persistent akinesis (17 of 39 (44 %)).

The pathologic implications {{of the difference between}} restored positive T <b>waves</b> and persistent <b>negative</b> T <b>waves</b> in leads with Q waves has not, until now, been given much careful study. Methods. Of 17 patients with anterior or anteroseptal myocardial infarction confirmed by autopsy, 8 (group P) had positive and 9 (group N) had <b>negative</b> T <b>waves</b> in precordial leads with Q waves ≥ 1 year after the onset of myocardial infarction. The appearance and extent of the infarct area and the degree of coronary artery stenosis were evaluated in both groups. Results.

In most simulations, the residual (the difference between the original EEG and the EEG after correction) is smaller in amplitude and variance for the vandenBerg method than for the Jervis method. When eye movements and blinks are given different factors, the blinks are not removed completely. For both methods, the residual of the blinks increases with the differences between the model parameters for the blinks and for eye movements.

For SEP, two negative potentials were recorded after median nerve stimulation. The mean latency of the first negative potential (n 1) was 14 msec, and the n 1 wave form coincided fairly well with the inverted P 13 / 14 far field potential obtained from noncephalic (scalp) recording. Nasopharyngeal electrodes were located at the ventral brain stem at approximately {{the same level of}} the medial lemniscus that generates the P 13 / 14. Thus, the origin of n 1 was suspected to be the medulla oblongata similar to P 13 / 14.

Methods. Twenty-nine patients with apical hypertrophy (26 men, 3 women, mean age ± SD 50. 4 ± 8. 2 years) who showed left precordial giant <b>negative</b> T <b>waves</b> (≤− 10 mm) and tall R waves (≥ 26 mm) and spade configuration in the left ventriculogram were followed up for 10. 9 ± 3. 7 years. Results. The intermediate follow-up ECGs (5 to 9 years) showed disappearance of giant <b>negative</b> T <b>waves</b> in 31 % and of tall R waves in lead V 5 in 6 %. At the long-term follow-up study (≥ 10 years), loss of giant <b>negative</b> T <b>waves</b> increased to 71 %, with average T wave negativity in lead V 4 or V 5 decreasing from − 16. 5 ± 5. 1 to − 6. 9 ± 4. 2 mm. These T wave changes were associated with decreases in R wave amplitude in lead V 5 from 40. 7 ± 9. 6 to 26. 1 ± 13. 8 mm, with loss of tall R waves in lead V 5 in 38 % of patients and development of abnormal Q waves in two patients. Conclusions. During the long-term follow-up of the Japanese form of apical hypertrophy, giant <b>negative</b> T <b>waves</b> disappeared in association with decreases in R wave amplitude in lead V 5, indicating that these ECG hallmarks are clinical features that evolve progressively during the natural course of the disease...|$|R
