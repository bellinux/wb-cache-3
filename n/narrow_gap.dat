These are prized by collectors for the crispness of their decoration. The motifs on kilims woven in this way are constrained to be somewhat angular and geometric.|$|E
5|$|When Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13thcentury, new walls {{surrounding}} the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, with a <b>narrow</b> <b>gap</b> {{between them in}} the west and south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.|$|E
5|$|Four {{sections}} of the Flodden Wall survive: {{to the north and}} south of the Grassmarket; in Greyfriars Kirkyard; and along Drummond Street and the Pleasance. North of the Grassmarket the wall runs alongside Granny's Green Steps and has been incorporated into later buildings, including the former Greyfriars Mission Kirk. A line of granite paving across the Grassmarket marks the line of the wall where it was uncovered during construction work in 2008. In the Vennel the last remaining bastion of the town walls survives. The Flodden Tower, as it is sometimes known, comprises two remaining walls with a total length of , pierced by crosslet gunloops and a 19th-century window. Sections of the Flodden Wall can be seen within Greyfriars Kirkyard, adorned with 16th and 17th century tombstones. At the junction of Forrest Road and Bristo Street a line of cobbles and a <b>narrow</b> <b>gap</b> in the later buildings mark the line of the wall. The longest section is in Drummond Street and the Pleasance, where it originally enclosed the Blackfriars Monastery. At the corner of the wall a blocked archway is probably the entrance to a demolished bastion. The site of the Netherbow is marked with an outline of brass blocks at the junction of the Royal Mile and St Mary's Street.|$|E

40|$|Viscous fluid {{model and}} {{potential}} flow model {{with and without}} artificial damping force (f = −µV, µ the damping coefficient and V the local averaging flow velocity) are employed in this work to investigate the phenomenon of fluid resonance in <b>narrow</b> <b>gaps</b> between multi-bodies in close proximity under water waves. The numerical results are compared with experimental data available in the literature. The comparison demonstrates that both the viscous fluid model and the potential flow model are able to predict the resonant frequency reasonably well. However the conventional potential flow model (without artificial damping term) significantly over-predicts the wave height in <b>narrow</b> <b>gaps</b> around the resonant frequency. In order to calibrate the appropriate damping coefficient used for the potential model and make it {{work as well as}} the viscous fluid model in predicting the resonant wave height in <b>narrow</b> <b>gaps</b> but with little computational efforts, the dependence of damping coefficient µ on the body geometric dimensions is examined considering the parameters of gap width B g, body draft D, body breadth ratio B r and body number n (n = 2, 3), where B r = B B/B A for the case of two bodies (Body A and Body B) with different breadths of B A and B B, respectively. It was confirmed that the damping coefficient used for the potential flow model is not sensitive to the geometric dimensions and spatial arrangement. It was found that µ ∈ [0. 4, 0. 5] may guarantee the variation of H g/H 0 with kh to be generally in good agreement with the experimental data and the results of viscous fluid model, where H g is the excited wave height in <b>narrow</b> <b>gaps</b> under various dimensionless incident wave frequencies kh, H 0 is the incident wave height, k = 2 π/L is the wave number and h is the water depth...|$|R

The case of Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999) identified two particular issues for judges to be mindful of– special knowledge and legal sophistication. The authors concluded their analysis by suggesting that the true importance of the matter lies not in which test is used, but in ensuring that judges have taken into account all relevant circumstances and excluded extraneous considerations which {{would not have been}} applicable to the general public.|$|E

And when old Waramaug finally joined his ancestors many sad years later, legend says that he, too, was laid to rest near the ill-fated couple.

25|$|Halabiye {{experienced}} {{its heyday}} during the Roman and Byzantine periods. Before {{the site was}} incorporated into the Palmyrene Empire, it was a Roman garrison town known as Birtha. It {{was taken over by}} Palmyra in the 3rd century CE because of its strategic location on the river where it flows through a <b>narrow</b> <b>gap.</b> The city was named after the Palmyrene queen Zenobia (240–274). Halabiye was captured by the Romans in 273 CE during the war that broke out after Palmyra had asserted its independence from Rome. The fortress may have been repaired under Emperor Diocletian (244–311), who tried to strengthen the Limes Arabicus north of Palmyra, and again during the reign of Anastasius I (430–518). Emperor Justinian I (483–565) refortified Halabiye {{toward the end of his}} reign as part of his program to strengthen the border with the Sassanid Empire in the east.|$|E
25|$|Stripe-patterned polymer films can {{be formed}} on solid {{substrates}} by casting diluted polymer solution. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, {{and has no}} restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a <b>narrow</b> <b>gap</b> filled with a polymer solution. The upper plate is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100µm/s. A thin liquid film of solution is continuously formed {{at the edge of}} the sliding glass following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100µm/s created width and groove spacings of 2.2 and 6.1µm, 3.6 and 8.4µm, and 4.3 and 12.7µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100nm. Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on film coated with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2µm, spacing: 6.1µm). However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3µm, spacing: 12.7µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the growth direction, the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.|$|E

Here we will give an overview of successful demonstrations of cavitation as a microfluidic tool. Cavitation can pump and mix liquids very rapidly, move objects such as cells, rupture plasma membranes, probe elastic properties in micro-rheology, study coalescence, and even create arbitrary superpositions of shock waves. In all areas, bubbles are created with a focused laser which allows precise temporal and spatial control. With the usage of digital holography arbitrary configurations of bubbles can be created such as bubble clusters, squarish, toroidal, or even linear cavitation bubbles. Interestingly, even in very <b>narrow</b> <b>gaps</b> of a few tens of microns most of the bubble dynamics can be described with potential flow.
