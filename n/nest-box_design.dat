40|$|Shortage of {{breeding}} sites {{is an important}} limiting factor of bird populations. Artificial breeding platforms, nest-boxes or man-made twig nests often present solutions with remarkable results, however long-term sustainability of these populations remains to be resolved. Furthermore, the question whether the inference of results of studies conducted on birds breeding in artificial breeding sites can be generalized to other populations, still remains open. Here we present the history, {{and the results of}} a 20 year old (1995 - 2015) nest-box programme initiated to increase potential breeding possibilities of Red-footed Falcons in an area, where nest-site shortage was a severe limiting factor. We show how various other species (Jackdaws, Kestrels and Long-eared Owls) have utilized these resources, and present descriptive statistics on their reproductive performance. Analysing the data of a total of 1432 breeding attempts, we show that Red-footed Falcons have similar clutch sizes, and nesting success (i. e. ratio of nests with at least on fledgling), however fledging success (ratio of the number of eggs/fledged nestlings) was different in artificial nest-boxes. When we excluded closed box types from artificial nests, this difference was not apparent. In case of Kestrels (n= 1626 breeding attempts) clutch size was significantly higher in artificial nests, while we found no difference in fledging or nesting success. When only comparing open boxes to natural nests, the difference in clutch size was no longer significant. We also analysed the effect of nest box design on reproductive parameters of the two species using regression trees. Inter annual effects were the most important in shaping clutch size and fledging rate of both falcon species, however we also found <b>nest-box</b> <b>design</b> effects, but only in Red-footed Falcons. In years when mean clutch size was high, these birds had lower clutch size in an older, darker nest-box type compared to an alternative design, and to open boxes. However, fledging rate in the same years was lower for both open boxes and older nest-boxes. We conclude that artificial colonies are an important and successful tool in Red-footed Falcon conservation, and that the breeding parameters measured in artificial colonies depend on <b>nest-box</b> <b>design.</b> We present correlative evidence that closed boxes have a significant positive species specific effect on reproduction, probably due to their protection against weather. We also show that birds may have a preference for a certain <b>nest-box</b> <b>design,</b> and that the breeding success in the less favoured box type may be similar to that in open nests. We recommend that future studies incorporate nest-type and <b>nest-box</b> <b>design</b> effects in all comparisons made on reproductive performance in case of Red-footed Falcons and Kestrels...|$|E
40|$|Nest boxes {{have been}} {{recognised}} as research and management tools for arboreal marsupials in Australia for over 20 years. We review the published literature {{with the aim}} of describing the scope of studies conducted in Australia thus far and providing guidance to future research. We recognise three types of application in research: (1) detection of species, (2) study of a species 2 ̆ 7 ecology, and (3) investigation of box designs preferred by different species. Several species of arboreal marsupial may be detected more readily in nest boxes than by conventional survey techniques, allowing description of key aspects of their ecology; e. g. feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus) and brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa). Identifying the most favoured <b>nest-box</b> <b>design</b> for any species has implications for detection and management uses of nest boxes. More research is needed but preliminary findings suggest that species prefer narrow entrance holes, while height of the nest box above 3 m may be inconsequential. We recognise three types of management application: (1) species introduction, (2) support of populations of endangered species, and (3) strategic placement such as to enhance habitat connectivity. Currently there have been few attempts to use nest boxes to manage arboreal marsupials but {{further research is needed to}} realise their potential as a management tool. © CSIRO 2006...|$|E
40|$|Context. Nest {{boxes are}} {{a useful tool}} in the reintroduction, {{conservation}} and monitoring of many hollow-using species. Aims. All forms of nest-box monitoring involve some form of invasion, often upsetting their continued use by occupants. We conducted a pilot study to investigate and validate the innovative use of temperature dataloggers (iButtons®) to remotely monitor nest-box use, leaving the nest-box occupants untouched. Methods. In captivity, iButton recordings revealed the duration and time of day when {{each of the three}} <b>nest-box</b> <b>designs</b> was occupied by Pseudocheirus occidentalis (western ringtail possums); the accuracy of occupancy data was validated by unobtrusive infrared video recording. In the field, where translocated P. occidentalis and naturally occurring Trichosurus vulpecula (common brushtail possum) populations are present, hair sampling at the nest-box entrances (in addition to iButton recording) was used to identify the mammal species present. Key results. Nest-box use by captive P. occidentalis validated iButtons as a useful remote-monitoring tool, with 10 h) periods of continuous occupancy (T. vulpecula only). In addition to the convenience (to researcher and animal) of continuous (24 -h) monitoring with minimal disturbance, a major advantage from using iButtons is that occupancy can be matched with environmental temperature or rainfall records, as well as other events (e. g. storms or frost). Conclusions. iButtons are a useful remote-monitoring tool of nest boxes, and it is possible that their use in this manner may be extended to tree-hollow occupation. Most importantly, this approach can inform us as to the conditions under which the nest boxes are used by fauna, as well as preferences for different <b>nest-box</b> <b>designs.</b> Implications. It {{is important to note that}} the criteria used for determining the presence or absence in the nest box (i. e. temperature difference, Tin - Tout, of 2 °C) in the present study will not be relevant for all <b>nest-box</b> <b>designs</b> and before using these methods, the thermal properties of the nest box or tree hollow will require investigation...|$|R
40|$|During {{the spring}} 2015, {{a pair of}} Common Redstarts Phoenicurus phoenicurus {{successfully}} raised a five-chick brood in an artificial <b>nest-box</b> <b>designed</b> for and occupied {{by a pair of}} Common Swifts Apus apus in southern Sweden. The breeding was monitored by a nest-box camera, which recorded close interactions between the two species. The Common Redstarts initiated the breeding first and had young in the nest when the Common Swifts arrived and initiated breeding by laying their eggs in a nearby nest cup. The breeding overlapped by 15 days between the second and the fourth week of June when all five of the nestlings of the Common Redstart fledged. The Common Swifts raised two young which fledged in early August...|$|R
40|$|The puaiohi {{or small}} Kauai thrush (Myadestes palmeri) is an {{endangered}} bird endemic {{to the island}} of Kauai, Hawaii. The sole population of about 500 birds is currently restricted to remote, higher elevation areas of the Alakai Plateau. Puaiohi nest primarily on steep streamside cliffs, and their distribution and abundance are limited by availability of suitable nesting sites. Black rats (Rattus rattus) cause nest failure and mortality of nesting female puaiohis, and ground-based rodent control has not been effective at reducing nest predation. In 2007, we investigated whether artificial nest structures might be {{a viable alternative to}} rodent control by testing <b>nest-box</b> <b>designs</b> to find one that was resistant to rats. In laboratory trials, we evaluated 3 designs that were currently being deployed as artificial nest boxes for puaiohi and found that they were not rat resistant. From these results, we developed and tested an improved design. Captive rats were unable to enter a nest box made from a 36 -cm length of 15 -cm-diameter plastic pipe with an overhanging entrance cut at an angle of 49 °...|$|R
5000|$|Bat boxes {{differ from}} bird <b>nest-boxes</b> in typical <b>design,</b> {{with the larger}} opening on the {{underside}} of the box, and are more often referred to as bat boxes, although in regard to the rearing of young, they serve the same purpose. Some threatened bat species can be locally supported with the provision of appropriately placed bat-boxes, however species that roost in foliage or large cavities will not use bat boxes. Bat boxes are typically made out of wood, and there are several designs for boxes with single or multiple chambers. Directions for making the open bottom bat houses for small and large colonies, as well as locations to purchase them are available on the internet. [...] Colour and placement is important to ensuring that bat boxes are used; bat boxes that are too shaded will not heat up enough to attract a maternity colony of bats. Australian bat box projects have been running for over 12 years in particular at the Organ Pipes National Park. Currently there are 42 roost boxes using the [...] "Stebbings Design" [...] which have peaked at 280 bats roosting in them. The biggest problem with roosting boxes of any kind is the ongoing maintenance; problems include boxes falling down, wood deteriorating, and pests such as ants, the occasional rat, possums, and spiders.|$|R
