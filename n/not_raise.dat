5|$|In September 1958 VAT, {{together}} with other Finnish companies, participated in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair. The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid-engined VLK550 bus chassis. Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> interest among the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the bus chassis returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 1933, a {{crowd of}} 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site, and {{excavation}} soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.|$|E

During the lock-out, team owner {{and chairman of the}} board, Harley Hotchkiss, attempted to save the season by engaging in discussions with National Hockey League Players Association president Trevor Linden. While their discussions failed to save the season, Hotchkiss was credited with easing tensions that allowed for a successful negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{government}} did <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> the Homeland Security Advisory System terrorist threat level, orange {{at the time}} (high risk of terrorist attacks), following the attack. The Department of Homeland Security said that additional security measures would be {{in place for the}} remainder of the Christmas travel period. The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E
5|$|French troops entered Korçë on November 29, 1916 {{during a}} {{military}} operation that aimed to connect the Allied front in Thessaloníki in the Macedonian front to the region in south Albania, which was held by the Italian troops. French troops in Korçë were under General Maurice Sarrail, and under direct command of Colonel Descoins. There were two groups of rebels active {{in the region of}} Korçë, one was led by Themistokli Gërmenji and another by Sali Butka. In the meantime, Albanian irregular bands, headed by Butka and cooperating with the Austrian forces, completely ravaged Moscopole, and threatened that if Korçë would suffer the same fate if it did <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> the Albanian flag and surrender to Albanian authorities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, {{unmarried}} sisters Catherine and Margaret Flannagan ran a rooming house at 5 Skirving Street, Liverpool. The household {{in the final}} months of 1880 consisted of the two sisters, Catherine's son John, and two lodger families – hod carrier Thomas Higgins and his daughter Mary, and Patrick Jennings and his daughter Margaret. John Flannagan, 22 and previously healthy, died suddenly in December 1880. His death did <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> any particular comment; Catherine collected £71 (worth roughly £ in 2012 pounds) from the burial society with {{which he had been}} registered and he was interred shortly thereafter.|$|E

In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census of all of the survivors.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{marched to}} Naples in February. The {{citizens}} {{offered him a}} ceremonious entry, but he refused, threatening to let his soldiers sack the town if they did <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> the taxes. He adopted the traditional titles of the kings of Naples"King of Sicily and Jerusalem, Duke of Apulia and Prince of Capua"and administered the kingdom from the Castel Nuovo, garrisoning his mercenaries in the most important forts. He used unusually brutal methods of investigation to capture all accomplices {{in the death of}} his brother, according to Domenico da Gravina. Most local noble families (including the Balzos and the Sanseverinos) refused to cooperate with him. The pope refused to confirm Louis's rule in Naples, which would have united two powerful kingdoms under Louis's rule. The pope and the cardinals declared Queen Joanna innocent of her husband's murder at a formal meeting of the College of Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the company could not cover the cost of repaying loans.|$|E

5|$|Some therapies {{for other}} forms of cancer {{increase}} the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2–3%. Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, {{has been associated with}} endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer. A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. Raloxifene, a similar drug, did <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> the risk of endometrial cancer. Previously having ovarian cancer is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration have determined that it does <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories {{for the sale of}} goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E
5|$|Through {{relatives}} Playford met {{his future}} wife Lorna Clark, who lived with her family in Nailsworth. Although both families were religiously devout, the Clarks were {{even more so than}} the Playfords, and a long courtship ensued. Taking her out on his Harley Davidson motorcycle at night, the two were forced to leave the theatre halfway through performances so as to <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> the ire of the Clarks. Before their wedding on 1 January 1928, they were engaged for three years. During their engagement, Playford built their new house on his property, mostly by his own hands and indented in the hills themselves; it remained their home throughout their lives.|$|E

5|$|Yen {{described}} the {{role as the}} most emotionally and mentally difficult in his career. He spent months preparing for the role by going on a strict diet which consisted of eating one meal a day, training in Wing Chun, and learning more about Ip Man through his two sons. This was all {{in the hopes of}} portraying an erudite and cultured Ip Man, as well as bringing out the special traits of Wing Chun. Yen even went as far as to stay in character after filming, wearing his costume and changing his voice and movement patterns. While rehearsing a fight scene, Yen was reportedly injured when an axe wielder accidentally slashed the side of his left eye. Yen also had a masseur on set as he could <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> his right shoulder due to an injury.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{cash from}} Rothschild, {{the company could}} <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in George Street, nearer the edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that it unlikely to recoup its construction costs.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did <b>not</b> <b>raise</b> their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models in this study was Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E
