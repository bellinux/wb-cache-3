Visual acuity and both monocular and binocular stereo-acuity were measured when viewing the instrument directly and via a videoconferencing link.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a multi-faceted {{view on the}} characterization of the waveform distortion in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) plants from experimental results. The focus is set on the characterization of the waveform distortion occurring under different operating conditions in field measurements and laboratory tests. The assessment is carried out by considering the system-based point of view, {{on the basis of}} the measurements gathered at the interface between the PV plant and the grid or the supply point in the laboratory. New methodological hints on the formulation of the experimental tests are provided. The results of the waveform distortion analysis for harmonic currents and voltages are compared to the requirements of present power quality standards, indicating that in practical cases the current distortion can be significantly higher than in <b>normal</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> Furthermore, the key aspect concerning harmonic and interharmonic modelling of multiple grid-connected PV inverters is addressed.

40|$|Liquid crystal {{thermography}} (LCT) {{has been}} widely used for the determination of surface heat transfer distribution. However, this technique is sensitive to illumination and viewing angle and therefore limited to surfaces with only slight curvature. A liquid crystal calibration technique using true-colour image processing system has now been developed to alleviate the effect of viewing angle on oblique/curved surfaces. Application of the calibration and transient liquid crystal thermographic techniques and uncertainty analysis to a heated air slot jet impinging on a semi-cylindrical convex surface has been demonstrated. It is shown that the local heat transfer coefficient may be overestimated by up to 39. 1 % at a viewing angle of 69 ° from the <b>normal</b> under <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, the overall uncertainty in heat transfer coefficient can be significantly reduced from the maximum value of 36. 3 % to within 11. 1 % by using the implemented viewing calibration technique.

40|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{systemic}} or reliable procedure for school speech clinicians to evaluate {{whether or not the}} elementary age child should be released from or retained in articulation therapy. Traditional techniques of estimating whether or not a child has established automatization of correct phoneme production which will carry-over into speaking situations outside the therapy room have proven to be less than reliable and in many cases impractical. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to obtain additional data on a procedure designed to estimate the automatization of correct articulatory production. It was hypothesized that when correct production of the phonemes /r/ and /s/ was not disrupted by auditory masking, automatization of these phonemes may be assumed; when correct production of the phonemes was disrupted, automatization may not be assumed. Subjects included 76 elementary school children ranging from first to sixth grade with a mean age of 8 years, 6 months. Testing procedures consisted of three separate experimental conditions. Under condition I all potential subjects with both /r/ and frontal /s/ misarticulations were administered the McDonald Deep Test of Articulation under <b>normal</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> After calculating the percentage of correct articulations, those subjects which scored 90 % or better correct production of their particular target phoneme (/r/ or /s/) then participated in condition II. The children from both the /r/ and frontal /s/ experimental groups that achieved the 90 % correct production criteria during condition I were then divided into two separate groups for <b>testing</b> under <b>condition</b> II. Condition II took place during the same session as condition I and required a readministration of the McDonald Deep Test. During this condition, however, two different sound levels of competing speech (85 dB SPL and 65 dB SPL) were presented binaurally to children in both the /r/ and /s/ experimental groups. The competing speech consisted of a tape recording of several individuals speaking at the same time. Condition III took place in September after three months of summer vacation. During condition III the McDonald Deep Test of Articulation was again readministered without auditory masking to each subject who participated in condition II.

40|$|Over {{the last}} year, the European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee Working Group 12 has {{assessed}} and reviewed {{the performance of}} the enhanced anthropomorphic test device for lateral impacts, EUROSID- 2 (ES- 2). The objectives for this work have been the following: - To verify whether the proposed design is addressing the shortcomings of the regulatory test device EUROSID- 1 as identified previously by EEVC and NHTSA - To make sure that the original EUROSID- 1 biofidelity and performance in <b>normal</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> is preserved. - To reach a well-balanced conclusion, the working group has undertaken a test program to assess the most important requirements for the ES- 2 dummy, biofidelity, sensitivity, repeatability, handling, durability, certification and full-scale performance in comparison with EUROSID- 1. In addition, but no less important, the working group has reviewed and explored the findings of full-scale tests conducted at several member organisations within ACEA. ACEA has reported the most important findings in September 2000. Subsequently, WG 12 has further investigated the issues raised in this report. On the basis of this work, the working group has concluded the following with regards to the ES- 2 specifications and performance: The ES- 2 prototype as tested is superior to current test device EUROSID- 1 and, hence, a more appropriate test device for regulatory testing. The important shortcomings of the EUROSID- 1 have been satisfactorily addressed with ES- 2, whilst biofidelity is maintained, in some areas even somewhat improved. It should be noted, however, that the assessment of thorax biofidelity was based on deflection and force-time data only, and does not incorporate an assessment of V*C. It is recommended to adopt the hardware design without further modification and to use the new proposed certification procedures, {{with the exception of the}} high velocity pelvis test. Overall test results in full-scale tests have shown that some critical dummy measurement values for ES- 2 have increased compared to EUROSID- 1, in particular rib deflection, 17 %, and V*C, 23 % 1 on average. Other values on the other hand have brought down such as the pubic force (10 %) due to improved leg interaction. Contrary to the full-scale results, the ES- 2 gave equal or lower values for all critical measurements in the biofidelity tests. For the large majority of vehicles tested, the different results would not affect pass or fail with respect to current regulatory limits. It should be noted, however, that, maintaining the rating levels in consumer testing, ES- 2 results would lead motoring consumers to believe the protection offered in side impact has decreased while in fact the safety performance of these vehicles has not changed. A force transducer has been developed to measure the force applied to the back plate. It is recommended to use the force transducer in full vehicle assessment. Finally, the working group believes the ES- 2 dummy forms a solid basis for interim harmonisation and will further support activities to help realise this objective...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} treatment for degenerative disc disease (DDD) and disc herniation is spinal fusion, a process consisting of fusing two {{segments of the}} spine together. Arthroplasty treatments that preserve the natural motion of the spine {{are still in the}} early stages of development. Cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) involves removal of the existing damaged disc and replacement with an articulating implant. The materials used for implants must possess excellent biocompatibility, strength, and wear resistance properties. Spinal implants in particular should also allow precise post-operative imaging because surgeons rely on imaging tools to check for migration of the implant and nerve impingement post-operatively. The purpose of the current thesis is to investigate the wear behaviour of three different versions of poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK), a radiolucent polymer that does not distort MRI images, articulating against themselves. The materials tested include: PEEK OPTIMA (OPT), carbon-fiber reinforced (CFR) PEEK and carbon-nanofiber (CNF) PEEK. A series of wear tests were performed on a pin-on-plate apparatus that imposed reciprocating crossing-path motion to the articulating specimens. The first series of wear tests, “normal conditions tests”, consisted of application of 80 N for 2. 0 million cycles (Mc). Continuation of testing was aimed at evaluating the tribological behaviour of the materials under “adverse conditions”. The adverse conditions involved increasing the load every 0. 15 Mc until the material showed significant surface damage. The materials were tested in a 12 g/L protein concentration alpha calf fraction serum, at 37 ˚C. The wear of the specimens were evaluated using volumetric wear calculations and microscopy. The lowest wear, at the end of the normal conditions test, occurred with the articulation of CFR PEEK-on-CFR PEEK, and the highest wear, after 2. 0 Mc, occurred with CNF PEEK-on-CNF PEEK. The adverse conditions revealed the highest wear value for PEEK OPT. Surface damage was apparent on both the PEEK OPT and CFR PEEK specimens; however, volumetric wear measurements performed on the specimens did not indicate a rise in wear for CFR PEEK, though surface damage was visibly noted. CNF PEEK was not tested to failure, although surface damage was evident as the material neared the end of the adverse conditions test. The PEEK OPT wear values after the normal conditions test are similar to those reported for spine simulator studies on a PEEK OPT-on-PEEK OPT all-polymer lumbar nucleus implant. This tentatively suggests that the <b>normal</b> <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> represent a clinically realistic range. CFR PEEK shows the most promise for application in cervical disc arthroplasty. The other versions of PEEK possess excellent imaging qualities but had inferior wear resistance compared with CFR PEEK. However, wear volumes found in the present thesis for all three versions of PEEK after the “normal conditions” test were considerably lower than those found for stainless steel (SS) in similar testing.

40|$|AbstractThe {{testing of}} {{assemblies}} {{for use in}} cryogenic systems commonly includes evaluation at or near operating (therefore cryogenic) temperature. Typical assemblies include valves and pumps for use in liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen rocket engines. One frequently specified method of cryogenic external leakage testing requires the assembly, pressurized with gaseous helium (GHe), be immersed in a bath of liquid nitrogen (LN 2) and allowed to thermally stabilize. Component interfaces are then visually inspected for leakage (bubbles). Unfortunately the liquid nitrogen will be boiling under <b>normal,</b> bench-top, <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> This boiling tends to mask even significant leakage. One little known and perhaps under-utilized property of helium is the seemingly counter-intuitive thermodynamic property that when ambient temperature helium is bubbled through boiling LN 2 at a temperature of − 195. 8 °C, {{the temperature of the}} liquid nitrogen will reduce. This paper reports on the design and testing of a novel proof-of-concept helium injection control system confirming {{that it is possible to}} reduce the temperature of an LN 2 bath below boiling point through the controlled injection of ambient temperature gaseous helium and then to efficiently maintain a reduced helium flow rate to maintain a stabilized liquid temperature, enabling clear visual observation of components immersed within the LN 2.

Dose-response curve data were obtained with fentanyl, clonidine, xylazine, dexmedetomidine, and 40. 00 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide and were compared under <b>normal</b> TWR <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> and during immobilization or immobilization with continuous painful stimulation. Data were analyzed in terms of ah-or-none criteria as well as percentage maximum possible effect (%MPE) analysis over the total measurement period or at any specific time point during testing. The results indicate that stress, induced by immobilization and immobilization with long-term-applied paw pressure, unmasked possible antinociceptive properties of the various alpha(2) -adrenoceptor agonists and potentiated the effects of fentanyl. Stress also unmasked the positive effects of benzodiazepines. The manner of data analysis was shown to significantly affect the outcome measured in stress and nonstress conditions. The MPE analysis, particularly at one time point, appeared much more sensitive than the ah-or-none criteria. The data indicate that the housing and handling conditions of animals during testing, together with data analysis, may affect the outcome of different classes of compounds in the TWR test, and this knowledge may help control for false positive results.

40|$|The {{deleterious}} effects of prolonged sleep deprivation on behavior and cognition are a concern in modern society. Persons {{at risk for}} impaired performance and health-related issues resulting from prolonged sleep loss would benefit from agents capable of reducing these detrimental effects {{at the time they}} are sleep deprived. Agents capable of improving cognition by enhancing brain activity under normal circumstances may also have the potential to reduce the harmful or unwanted effects of sleep deprivation. The significant prevalence of excitatory a-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamatergic receptors in the brain provides a basis for implementing a class of drugs that could act to alter or remove the effects of sleep deprivation. The ampakine CX 717 (Cortex Pharmaceuticals), a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, was tested for its ability to enhance performance of a cognitive, delayed match-to-sample task under normal circumstances in well-trained monkeys, as well as alleviate the detrimental effects of 30 – 36 h of sleep deprivation.

40|$|A {{total of}} 387 {{clinical}} strains of erythromycin-resistant (MIC, ≥ 1 μg/ml) Streptococcus pyogenes, all isolated in Italian laboratories from 1995 to 1998, were examined. By the erythromycin-clindamycin double-disk test, 203 (52. 5 %) strains {{were assigned to}} the recently described M phenotype, 120 (31. 0 %) {{were assigned to the}} inducible macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B resistance (iMLS) phenotype, and 64 (16. 5 %) were assigned to the constitutive MLS resistance (cMLS) phenotype. The inducible character of the resistance of the iMLS strains was confirmed by comparing the clindamycin MICs determined under <b>normal</b> <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> and those determined after induction by pregrowth in 0. 05 μg of erythromycin per ml. The MICs of erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, josamycin, spiramycin, and the ketolide HMR 3004 were then determined and compared. Homogeneous susceptibility patterns were observed for the isolates of the cMLS phenotype (for {{all but one of the}} strains, HMR 3004 MICs were 0. 5 to 8 μg/ml and the MICs of the other drugs were > 128 μg/ml) and those of the M phenotype (resistance only to the 14 - and 15 -membered macrolides was recorded, with MICs of 2 to 32 μg/ml). Conversely, heterogeneous susceptibility patterns were observed in the isolates of the iMLS phenotype, which were subdivided into three distinct subtypes designated iMLS-A, iMLS-B, and iMLS-C. The iMLS-A strains (n = 84) were highly resistant to the 14 -, 15 -, and 16 -membered macrolides and demonstrated reduced susceptibility to low-level resistance to HMR 3004. The iMLS-B strains (n = 12) were highly resistant to the 14 - and 15 -membered macrolides, susceptible to the 16 -membered macrolides (but highly resistant to josamycin after induction), and susceptible to HMR 3004 (but intermediate or resistant after induction). The iMLS-C strains (n = 24) had lower levels of resistance to the 14 - and 15 -membered macrolides (with erythromycin MICs increasing two to four times after induction), were susceptible to the 16 -membered macrolides (but resistant to josamycin after induction), and remained susceptible to HMR 3004, also after induction. The erythromycin resistance genes in 100 isolates of the different groups were investigated by PCR. All cMLS and iMLS-A isolates tested had the ermAM (ermB) gene, whereas all iMLS-B and iMLS-C isolates had the ermTR gene (neither methylase gene was found in isolates of other groups). The M isolates had only the macrolide efflux (mefA) gene, which was also found in variable proportions of cMLS, iMLS-A, iMLS-B, and iMLS-C isolates. The three iMLS subtypes were easily differentiated by a triple-disk test set up by adding a josamycin disk to the erythromycin and clindamycin disks of the conventional double-disk test. Tetracycline resistance was not detected in any isolate of the iMLS-A subtype, whereas it was observed in over 90 % of both iMLS-B and iMLS-C isolates...|$|R

40|$|The inter-comparability of the {{stability}} measurements of organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies in dark is addressed. Four primary {{factors that affect}} the reproducibility of the ageing rate determination and inter-comparison are discussed: production/encapsulation of the samples, current-voltage (IV) characterization, <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> for ageing and lifetime determination from a decay curve. Results of inter-laboratory ageing studies of roll-to-roll and spin coated samples with correspondingly flexible plastic packaging and glass encapsulation tested under dark <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> among 7 laboratories are presented. ISOS <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> proposed recently as guiding protocols for testing OPV stability, are applied in the study. The reproducibility of the performance versus the production and encapsulation techniques is firstly studied. The results reveal a significant improvement in the reproducibility when going from manual spin coating to roll-to-roll production. Furthermore, the reproducibility of current-voltage (IV) measurement and preconditioning (light soaking treatments) are addressed. Additionally, the inter-comparison of the degradation rates of the samples tested under three different dark <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> (ambient, dry/heat, damp heat) reported by different groups are analyzed revealing a reasonable agreement on the degradation rates of {{the stability}} curves for each <b>test</b> <b>condition.</b> Finally, a logarithmic diagram for OPV lifetime associated with common time units is proposed that allows conveniently categorizing and intercomparing the stability performance of different samples tested under different <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> JRC.

30|$|Eyewitness {{confidence}} is frequently {{used to determine}} the accuracy of eyewitness memory. However, metamemory judgments of confidence can be assessed at numerous times and how well these judgments predict eyewitness accuracy is likely to vary. In the legal system, the focus has been on eyewitness confidence collected {{at the time of the}} identification test (i.e. postdictive confidence) because what happens at this stage is typically better documented. Under unbiased <b>testing</b> <b>conditions,</b> eyewitnesses can accurately assess the strength of their memories at test, with high confidence indicative of high accuracy. These unbiased <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> include using a double-blind procedure, showing a fair lineup, and collecting confidence immediately after the initial identification (Wixted & Wells, 2017). In addition, semi-contaminated <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> also produce a reliable confidence-accuracy relationship, although the utility of a high confidence identification is still better in unbiased than biased <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> (Mickes, Clark, & Gronlund, 2017; Wixted & Wells, 2017).|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{presentation}} modality and response format were investigated using visual and auditory {{versions of the}} word stem completion task. Study presentation conditions (visual, auditory, non-studied) were manipulated within participants, while <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> (visual/written, visual/spoken, auditory/written, auditory/spoken, recall-only) were manipulated between participants. Results showed evidence for same modality and cross modality priming on all four word stem completion tasks. Words from the visual study list led to comparable levels of priming across all <b>test</b> <b>conditions.</b> In contrast, words from the auditory study list led to relatively low levels of priming in the visual/written <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> {{and high levels of}} priming in the auditory/spoken <b>test</b> <b>condition.</b> Response format was found to influence priming performance following auditory study in particular. The findings confirm and extend previous research and suggest that, for implicit memory studies that require auditory presentation, it may be especially beneficial to use spoken rather than written responses...|$|R
