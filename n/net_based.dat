The basic idea is that rather than providing a proof of completely correct operation, each server provides strong evidence of its correct operation by revealing a pseudorandomly selected subset of its input/output relations. Randomized partial checking is exceptionally e#cient compared to previous proposals for providing robustness; the evidence provided at each layer is shorter than the output of that layer, and producing the evidence is easier than doing the mixing. It works with mix <b>nets</b> <b>based</b> on any encryption scheme (i. e., on public-key alone, and on hybrid schemes using public-key/symmetric-key combinations).

As the physical memory gets full, the OS writes rarely-used {{parts of it}} to disk, {{so that it can}} reallocate it to another application, a process known as paging or swapping. But if the memory does need to be used, it must be reloaded from disk. If several applications are all making large demands, the OS can spend much of its time merely moving data between main memory and disk, a process known as disk thrashing. Since the garbage collector has to examine all of the allocations to decide which are in use, it may exacerbate this thrashing. As a result, extensive swapping can lead to garbage collection cycles extended from milliseconds to tens of seconds. This results in usability problems.|$|E
