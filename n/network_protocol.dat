25|$|The Ethernet {{physical}} layer {{has evolved over}} its existence starting in 1980 and encompasses multiple physical media interfaces and several orders of magnitude of speed. The speed ranges from 1Mbit/s to 100Gbit/s, while the physical medium can range from bulky coaxial cable to twisted pair and optical fiber. In general, <b>network</b> <b>protocol</b> stack software will work similarly on all {{physical layer}}s.|$|E

For every <b>network</b> layer <b>protocol</b> used, a separate <b>Network</b> Control <b>Protocol</b> (NCP) is provided in order to encapsulate and negotiate options for the multiple <b>network</b> layer <b>protocols.</b> It negotiates network-layer information, e.g. network address or compression options, after the connection has been established.|$|R
25|$|Each Net-Lib {{supported}} <b>network</b> <b>protocol</b> has {{a separate}} driver (not {{to be confused}} with a device driver), and has support for a session layer in its protocol stack. There are two general types of Net-Lib: the primary and the secondary. The primary Net-Lib consists of a Super Socket Net-Lib and the Shared Memory Net-Lib, while there are numerous secondary Net-Libs, including TCP/IP and named pipes network libraries (named pipes are a method of communicating with other processes via a system-persistent pipeline that is given an identity). The Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server (SQLOLEDB) communicates via primary Net-Libs.|$|E
25|$|The {{microkernel}} {{concept was}} introduced {{in an effort to}} reverse the trend towards larger kernels and return to a system in which most tasks were completed by smaller utilities. In an era when a standard computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a data terminal for input and output (I/O), the Unix file model worked quite well, as most I/O was linear. However, modern systems include networking and other new devices. As graphical user interfaces developed, the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a mouse. In the 1980s, non-blocking I/O and the set of inter-process communication mechanisms were augmented with Unix domain sockets, shared memory, message queues, and semaphores. In microkernel implementations, functions such as network protocols could be moved out of the kernel, while conventional (monolithic) Unix implementations have <b>network</b> <b>protocol</b> stacks as part of the kernel.|$|E
25|$|The South African Air Force's Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter {{aircraft}} are also equipped with PS-05/A pulse-doppler X-band multi-mode radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi. This all-weather radar system {{is capable of}} locating and identifying air targets 120km away and surface targets 70km away. It is also able to automatically track multiple targets in {{the upper and lower}} spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. It can guide several beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously (although the Air Force still lacks modern beyond visual range missile capability). When deployed operationally on combat missions and air patrols the aircraft can link their systems to the South African National Defence Force's digital <b>network</b> <b>protocol,</b> Link ZA, to share data with other radar systems to help create a wider picture as to the situation in the air and on the ground in order to rapidly adapt to a change in short term situations.|$|E
