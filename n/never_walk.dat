5|$|Liverpool erected the 15-foot high {{cast-iron}} Shankly Gates {{in front}} of the Anfield Road stand. Inscribed You'll <b>Never</b> <b>Walk</b> Alone, they were opened by Nessie Shankly at a low-key ceremony in August 1982. In 1997, a seven-foot tall bronze statue of Shankly was unveiled outside the stadium.|$|E
5|$|With Bran now awake, Old Nan {{tells him}} {{a tale of}} a long-ago endless winter, when the White Walkers first {{appeared}} riding their dead horses and raising Wights from the men they slaughtered. Her story is interrupted by Robb who sadly confirms to Bran that his injuries are permanent, and he'll <b>never</b> <b>walk</b> again. Bran, saying {{he is unable to}} remember anything about his fall, wishes he were dead.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the newest}} traditions on the UCF campus {{pertains}} to the Pegasus seal {{in the center of}} the main floor of the Student Union. From their first day on campus for orientation, new students are told to <b>never</b> <b>walk</b> on the Pegasus. As the tradition is told, those who step on the seal will never graduate from UCF. Usually the seal is roped off with heavy black velvet ropes, but when the ropes are not in place, students can be seen carefully avoiding the seal. In 2005, Florida Leader magazine named this new tradition the best college superstition in Florida.|$|E

5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} {{at a cost}} of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built {{at a cost of}} £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked {{them for the first time}} on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll <b>Never</b> <b>Walk</b> Alone, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.|$|E

25|$|After {{his return}} to the United States in 1910, Harold Weston was {{stricken}} by polio. His left leg was paralyzed. But Weston refused to take the advice of doctors who declared that he would <b>never</b> <b>walk</b> again. Through a regime of physical conditioning and the use of leg braces and a cane, Weston learned how to walk (albeit with a pronounced limp). He began to hike, clinging to trees as he went up and down hill.|$|E
25|$|This {{accident}} left Hogan, age 36, with a double-fracture of the pelvis, {{a fractured}} collar bone, a left ankle fracture, a chipped rib, and near-fatal blood clots: he would suffer lifelong circulation problems and other physical limitations. His doctors {{said he might}} <b>never</b> <b>walk</b> again, let alone play golf competitively. While in hospital, Hogan's life was endangered by a blood clot problem, leading doctors to tie off the vena cava. Hogan left the hospital on April 1, 59 days after the accident.|$|E

25|$|In 1976 Williams {{was wounded}} in a drive-by {{shooting}} in Compton {{by members of the}} Bloods. While sitting on the porch of his house one evening as he'd let his dog out for a walk, a carload of Bloods drove by the house and opened fire on Williams. Attempting to avoid getting hit, Williams dove from the porch and {{was wounded in}} both of his legs. Despite being told by doctors that he would <b>never</b> <b>walk</b> again, Williams began a nearly year-long process of physical rehabilitation and an intense workout regimen, ultimately regaining his ability to walk.|$|E
25|$|Irritability is {{most often}} noticed along with {{the first signs of}} nervous system impairment. Within {{the first few years of}} life, {{extrapyramidal}} involvement causes abnormal involuntary muscle contractions such as loss of motor control (dystonia), writhing motions (choreoathetosis), and arching of the spine (opisthotonus). Signs of pyramidal system involvement, including spasticity, overactive reflexes (hyperreflexia) and extensor plantar reflexes, also occur. The resemblance to athetoid cerebral palsy is apparent in the neurologic aspects of LNS. As a result, most individuals are initially diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The motor disability is so extensive that most individuals <b>never</b> <b>walk,</b> and become lifelong wheelchair users.|$|E
25|$|Randi {{was born}} on August 7, 1928 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Marie Alice (née Paradis) and George Randall Zwinge. He has a younger brother and sister. He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone Sr. and reading conjuring books while {{spending}} 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors who expected he would <b>never</b> <b>walk</b> again. Randi often skipped classes and, at 17, {{dropped out of high}} school to perform as a conjurer in a carnival roadshow. He practised as a mentalist in local nightclubs and at Toronto's Canadian National Exhibition and wrote for Montreal's tabloid press.|$|E

25|$|On October 29, 1901, outside Lexington, North Carolina, {{a freight}} train crashed into one unit of the train {{carrying}} Buffalo Bill's show from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Danville, Virginia. The freight train's engineer had thought that the entire show train had passed, not realizing it was three units, {{and returned to the}} tracks; 110 horses were killed in the crash or had to be killed later, including his personal mounts Old Pap and Old Eagle. No people were killed, but Annie Oakley's injuries were so severe that she was told she would <b>never</b> <b>walk</b> again. She did recover and continued performing later. The incident put the show out of business for a while, and this disruption may have led to its eventual demise.|$|E
25|$|Yonakor {{grew up in}} the Dorchester {{neighborhood}} of Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest son of immigrants from lithuania. At the age of 10, he came down with a leg infection after cutting himself while ice skating. He was too embarrassed to tell his mother about the injury and hoped it would go away, but it worsened {{to the point where he}} could no longer walk. Doctors drained fluid from his body by puncturing his toe, and Yonakor spent a year as an invalid; doctors told him he may <b>never</b> <b>walk</b> again. Starting out by crawling, however, Yonakor gradually regained his strength and his health. He went on to play three seasons of football at Mechanic Arts High School, and spent one year at Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut at the prompting of Frank Leahy, then the head football coach at Boston College. Yonakor was set to go to Boston College, but chose the University of Notre Dame instead when Leahy became head football coach there in 1941.|$|E
