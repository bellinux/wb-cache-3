5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface plication (C.striatus has a more pronounced plication), the <b>nodular</b> arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E
5|$|Large nodules were {{previously}} {{referred to as}} cysts, and the term nodulocystic {{has been used in}} the medical literature to describe severe cases of inflammatory acne. True cysts are in fact rare in those with acne and the term severe <b>nodular</b> acne is now the preferred terminology.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underlying}} form of thyroid disease associated with TPP is Graves' disease, a syndrome {{due to an}} autoimmune reaction that leads to overproduction of thyroid hormone. TPP has also been described in people with other thyroid problems such as thyroiditis, toxic <b>nodular</b> goiter, toxic adenoma, TSH-producing pituitary adenoma, excessive ingestion of thyroxine or iodine, and amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at a {{large and}} important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed <b>nodular</b> skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though {{it was unclear whether}} it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (<b>nodular</b> dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E
5|$|Liver AVMs may be {{suspected}} {{because of}} abnormal liver function {{tests in the}} blood, because the symptoms of heart failure develop, or because of jaundice or other symptoms of liver dysfunction. The most reliable initial screening test is Doppler ultrasonography of the liver; this has a very high sensitivity for identifying vascular lesions in the liver. If necessary, contrast-enhanced CT {{may be used to}} further characterize AVMs. It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on liver scans, most commonly due to focal <b>nodular</b> hyperplasia (FNH), as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population. FNH is regarded as harmless. Generally, tumor markers and additional imaging modalities are used to differentiate between FNH and malignant tumors of the liver. Liver biopsy is discouraged in people with HHT as the risk of hemorrhage from liver AVMs may be significant. Liver scans may be useful if someone is suspected of HHT, but does not meet the criteria (see below) unless liver lesions can be demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe <b>nodular</b> acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} a {{courtship}} flight conducted above the trees. The pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending {{while the other}} is descending, both calling constantly. After display, the birds land on a branch for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills, followed by the female hanging upside-down for a variable period of time, and then copulation while the male holds the female's neck. The flight and mating rituals have been recorded for three-coloured and red-throated parrotfinches, and may be typical for the genus. The nest is built with fresh grass blades, and is domed with a side entrance. It is always hidden in thick foliage, but can be at any height from the ground. The normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs. Chicks are naked and have pinkish skin; the distinctive gape has blue <b>nodular</b> spots technically termed as papillae or tubercles at {{the upper and lower}} corners, and the yellow palate has a ring of five black spots. Most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held against the side, but juvenile parrotfinches lift the wing on the side away from the feeding parent. This behaviour may restrict competition for food from other nestlings.|$|E
25|$|Macroscopically, {{liver cancer}} {{appears as a}} <b>nodular</b> or infiltrative tumor. The <b>nodular</b> type may be solitary (large mass) or {{multiple}} (when developed as a complication of cirrhosis). Tumor nodules are round to oval, gray or green (if the tumor produces bile), well circumscribed but not encapsulated. The diffuse type is poorly circumscribed and infiltrates the portal veins, or the hepatic veins (rarely).|$|E
25|$|Pyoderma faciale, {{also known}} as rosacea fulminans, is a conglobate, <b>nodular</b> disease that arises {{abruptly}} on the face.|$|E
25|$|Rosacea conglobata is {{a severe}} rosacea that can mimic acne conglobata, with hemorrhagic <b>nodular</b> abscesses and {{indurated}} plaques.|$|E

25|$|CT scan {{may show}} <b>nodular</b> and {{irregular}} thickening of the folds in the distal stomach and proximal small bowel, but these findings {{can also be}} present in other conditions like Crohn's disease and lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Sporotrichosis is a {{fungal disease}} caused by Sporothrix schenckii that affects both dogs and humans. It {{is a rare}} disease in dogs, with cat and horse infections predominating in {{veterinary}} medicine. The disease in dogs is usually <b>nodular</b> skin lesions {{of the head and}} trunk.|$|E
25|$|Silicosis (previously miner's phthisis, grinder's asthma, potter's rot {{and other}} occupation-related names) {{is a form}} of {{occupational}} lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust, and is marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of <b>nodular</b> lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of pneumoconiosis.|$|E
25|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} {{is thought}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH, T4, and antithyroid antibodies. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves’ disease and nontoxic <b>nodular</b> goiter.|$|E
25|$|Degenerative (myxomatous) {{mitral valve}} disease* {{is a common}} cause of {{congestive}} heart failure in dogs, especially small, older dogs. The leaflets of the valve become thickened and <b>nodular,</b> leading to mitral valve regurgitation and volume overload of {{the left side of the}} heart. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and Dachshunds have an inherited form of this disease.|$|E
25|$|Gross {{morphological}} {{changes within}} the thyroid {{are seen in}} the general enlargement which is far more locally <b>nodular</b> and irregular than more diffuse patterns (such as that of hyperthyroidism). While the capsule is intact and the gland itself is still distinct from surrounding tissue, microscopic examination can provide a more revealing indication {{of the level of}} damage.|$|E
25|$|The goiter in Graves' {{disease is}} often not <b>nodular,</b> but thyroid nodules are also common. Differentiating common forms of {{hyperthyroidism}} such as Graves' disease, single thyroid adenoma, and toxic multinodular goiter is important to determine proper treatment. The differentiation among these entities has advanced, as imaging and biochemical tests have improved. Measuring TSH-receptor antibodies with the h-TBII assay has been proven efficient and was the most practical approach found in one study.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} the shell is valvatiform. The shell is {{thin-walled}} and glossy. The shell has 2–2.5 rapidly but regularly growing whorls. The spire is low or very low. The umbilicus is very wide, with the earlier whorls visible inside. The teleoconch is very finely sculptured with weakly marked growth lines. The protoconch has about 1¼ whorls growing slowly; {{the border between the}} proto- and teleoconch is indistinct; the protoconch surface is <b>nodular.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} diagnosis of BPH {{is based on}} a history of LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms), a digital rectal exam, and exclusion of other causes of similar signs and symptoms. The degree of LUTS does not necessarily correspond {{to the size of the}} prostate. An enlarged prostate gland on rectal examination that is symmetric and smooth supports a diagnosis of BPH. However, if the prostate gland feels asymmetrical, firm, or <b>nodular,</b> this raises concern for prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|CT scans may {{more rarely}} reveal mosaic-appearance attenuation, centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud opacities and pleuropulmonary {{fibrosis}} (a finding consistent with CPA, a disease with ABPA as a known precursor). Rarely other manifestations {{can be seen}} on CT scans, including military <b>nodular</b> opacities, perihilar opacities (that mimic hilar lymphadenopathy), pleural effusions and pulmonary masses. Cavitation and aspergilloma are rarer findings, not exceeding 20% of patients, and likely represent a shift from ABPA to CPA if accompanied by pleural thickening or fibrocavitary disease.|$|E
25|$|Concretions {{are found}} {{in a variety of}} rocks, but are {{particularly}} common in shales, siltstones, and sandstones. They often outwardly resemble fossils or rocks that look as if they do not belong to the stratum in which they were found. Occasionally, concretions contain a fossil, either as its nucleus or as a component that was incorporated during its growth but concretions are not fossils themselves. They appear in <b>nodular</b> patches, concentrated along bedding planes, protruding from weathered cliffsides, randomly distributed over mudhills or perched on soft pedestals.|$|E
25|$|Turquoise {{is nearly}} always cryptocrystalline and massive and assumes no {{definite}} external shape. Crystals, {{even at the}} microscopic scale, are exceedingly rare. Typically the form is vein or fracture filling, <b>nodular,</b> or botryoidal in habit. Stalactite forms have been reported. Turquoise may also pseudomorphously replace feldspar, apatite, other minerals, or even fossils. Odontolite is fossil bone or ivory that has been traditionally {{thought to have been}} altered by turquoise or similar phosphate minerals such as the iron phosphate vivianite. Intergrowth with other secondary copper minerals such as chrysocolla is also common.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound is {{routinely}} {{used in the}} evaluation of cirrhosis. It may show a small and <b>nodular</b> liver in advanced cirrhosis along with increased echogenicity with irregular appearing areas. Other liver findings suggestive of cirrhosis in imaging are an enlarged caudate lobe, widening of the fissures and enlargement of the spleen. An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), which normally measures less than 11–12cm in adults, is suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension, in the right clinical context. Ultrasound may also screen for hepatocellular carcinoma, portal hypertension, and Budd-Chiari syndrome (by assessing flow in the hepatic vein).|$|E
25|$|The chest (thoracic cavity) {{progressively}} slopes outwards {{from the}} thoracic inlet (atop the breastbone) and above {{to the lowest}} ribs that support the breasts. The inframammary fold, where the lower portion of the breast meets the chest, is an anatomic feature created by the adherence of the breast skin and the underlying connective tissues of the chest; the IMF is the lower-most extent of the anatomic breast. Normal breast tissue typically has a texture that feels <b>nodular</b> or granular, to an extent that varies considerably from woman to woman.|$|E
25|$|After a thyroid nodule {{is found}} during a {{physical}} examination, {{a referral to}} an endocrinologist or a thyroidologist may occur. Most commonly an ultrasound is performed to confirm {{the presence of a}} nodule and assess the status of the whole gland. Measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis present, a known cause of a benign <b>nodular</b> goiter. Measurement of calcitonin is necessary to exclude the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Finally, to achieve a definitive diagnosis before deciding on treatment, a fine needle aspiration cytology test is usually performed and reported according to the Bethesda system.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} {{are caused by}} an allergic reaction of the host's body to mite proteins, though exactly which proteins remains a topic of study. The mite proteins are also present from the gut, in mite feces, which are deposited under the skin. The allergic reaction is both of the delayed (cell-mediated) and immediate (antibody-mediated) type, and involves IgE (antibodies, it is presumed, mediate the very rapid symptoms on reinfection). The allergy-type symptoms (itching) continue for some days, and even several weeks, after all mites are killed. New lesions may appear {{for a few days}} after mites are eradicated. <b>Nodular</b> lesions from scabies may continue to be symptomatic for weeks after the mites have been killed.|$|E
25|$|Warts {{caused by}} the Xipapillomavirus group have a cauliflower-like {{appearance}} and can attain {{the size of a}} fist; most common on the head, neck and shoulders, they may also occur in other locations. Cutaneous fibropapillomas caused by Deltapapillomavirus group have a <b>nodular</b> appearance. Although unsightly, most skin warts rarely cause problems except in show animals. However, large warts may bleed, potentially leading to secondary infections, and florid warts of the teat can cause mastitis and interfere with suckling and milking. Fibropapillomas can be troublesome when present in the genital area, causing pain and sometimes loss of reproductive functions as well as interfering with calving. Chronically immunosuppressed animals may develop extensive papillomatosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which can cause difficulties with eating and breathing.|$|E
25|$|Gapes of {{juvenile}} altricial birds are often brightly coloured, sometimes with contrasting spots or other patterns, {{and these are}} believed to be an indication of their health, fitness and competitive ability. Based on this, the parents decide how to distribute food among the chicks in the nest. Some species, especially in the families Viduidae and Estrildidae, have bright spots on the gape known as gape tubercles or gape papillae. These <b>nodular</b> spots are conspicuous even in low light. A study examining the nestling gapes of eight passerine species found that the gapes were conspicuous in the ultraviolet spectrum (visible to birds but not to humans). Parents may, however, not rely solely on the gape coloration, and other factors influencing their decision remain unknown.|$|E
25|$|A {{physical}} examination, {{including a}} pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An adnexal mass {{is a significant}} finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, <b>nodular,</b> irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis. Another indicator may be {{the presence of a}} pleural effusion, which can be noted on auscultation.|$|E
