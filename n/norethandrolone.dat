Androgens, used {{in the treatment of}} aplastic anemia, have been reported to block proliferation of and initiate differentiation in AML cells. We report the results of a multicenter, phase III, randomized open-label trial exploring the benefit of adding androgens to maintenance therapy in patients 60 years of age or older. Patients and Methods A total of 330 {{patients with}} AML de novo or secondary to chemotherapy or radiotherapy were enrolled in the study. Induction therapy included idarubicin 8 mg/m 2 on days 1 to 5, cytarabine 100 mg/m 2 on days 1 to 7, and lomustine 200 mg/m 2 on day 1. Patients in complete remission or partial remission received six reinduction courses, alternating idarubicin 8 mg/m 2 on day 1, cytarabine 100 mg/m 2 on days 1 to 5, and a regimen of methotrexate and mercaptopurine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive <b>norethandrolone</b> 10 or 20 mg/day, according to body weight, or no <b>norethandrolone</b> for a 2 -year maintenance therapy regimen. The primary end point was disease-free survival by intention to treat. Secondary end points were event-free survival, overall survival, and safety. This trial was registered at www.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{the illegal}} growth promoter ethylestrenol (EES) was evaluated in bovine liver cells and subcellular fractions of bovine liver preparations. Incubations with bovine microsomal preparations revealed that EES is extensively biotransformed into <b>norethandrolone</b> (NE), another illegal growth promoter. Furthermore, incubations of monolayer cultures of hepatocytes with NE indicated that NE itself is rapidly reduced to 17 α-ethyl- 5 β-estrane- 3 α, 17 β-diol (EED). In vivo tests confirmed that, after administration of either EES or NE, EED is excreted as a major metabolite. Therefore, it was concluded that, both in urine and faeces samples, EED {{can be used as}} a biological marker for the illegal use of EES and/or NE. Moreover, by monitoring EED in urine or faeces samples, the detection period after NE administration is significantly prolonged.

40|$|Studies of {{the effect}} of <b>norethandrolone</b> on the {{transport}} and peripheral metabolism of thyroxine were carried out in four patients lacking thyroxine-binding globulin. Before <b>norethandrolone</b> administration, values for serum protein-bound iodine (PBI) were decreased (1. 8 ± 0. 5 μg/ 100 ml) and the proportion of free thyroxine increased (0. 036 ± 0. 008 %). As a result, values for the absolute concentration of free thyroxine iodine were {{at the lower end of}} the normal range (0. 63 ± 0. 12 mμg/ 100 ml). During the control thyroxine-turnover study, the thyroxine distribution space was strikingly increased (18. 2 ± 7. 9 liters) and the fractional rate of thyroxine turnover moderately increased (17. 1 ± 11. 3 %/day), as compared to the expected mean values for normal subjects. Therefore, calculated values for the daily rate of thyroxine clearance were increased even more, ranging between 255 and 500 % of normal values. However, owing to the low PBI in these patients, the daily disposal of thyroxine iodine was similar to that expected in normals on the basis of age and weight. During the administration of <b>norethandrolone,</b> the thyroxine-binding capacity of the thyroxine-binding prealbumin increased strikingly in all patients, values averaging 162 % of those found during the control period. This increase was associated with a highly significant increase in PBI (133 % of control values) and a small but significant decrease in the proportion of free thyroxine, resulting in no significant change in the absolute concentration of free thyroxine iodine. In all four patients, administration of <b>norethandrolone</b> was associated with a pronounced decrease in the thyroxine distribution space to values which averaged 69 % of those found during the control period. Values for the fractional rate of thyroxine turnover increased slightly. As a result, thyroxine-clearance rate decreased in all patients. Owing to the reciprocal changes in clearance rate and PBI, no significant change in total daily thyroxine disposal was observed. The present studies reveal that when the thyroxine-binding prealbumin is increased in patients lacking thyroxine-binding globulin, several indices of peripheral thyroxine transport and metabolism are altered. However, these changes were small, even in the absence of thyroxine-binding globulin. It is suggested, therefore, that the effect of changes in thyroxine-binding prealbumin would be even smaller in individuals in whom thyroxine-binding globulin is present...|$|E

The effects of NED were also examined in isolated hepatocytes in suspension culture. NED infusion induced total cholestasis by 3 hours. Canalicular alterations commonly associated with cholestasis were found in in vivo infused liver and in isolated hepatocytes. Pericanalicular microfilament changes were also noted in both, with loss of filament structure and replacement by a granular zone. In isolated canalicular membrane fractions prepared from NED-treated animals, the normal investment of pericanalicular filaments was no longer present.

(b) There was a distinctively abnormal pattern of cortisol metabolites, not previously observed in other illnesses: tetrahydrocortisone was decreased to 14 % of the enzyme hydrolysate (normal 26 %); cortolones were increased to 34 % (normal 19 %), owing entirely {{to an increase in}} cortolone (20 α) formation, since β-cortolone (20 β) was not significantly increased; Reichstein's substances U and epi-U were increased, averaging 2. 6 % for the former and 4. 7 % for the latter; tetrahydrocortisol, allotetrahydrocortisol and cortols were normal. This pattern was independent of the degree of decreased glucosiduronate formation and also independent of {{the presence or absence of}} a portacaval shunt. (c) Cortisol production, determined by isotope dilution, was normal in each of six cirrhotic patients. From these data, taken in conjunction with our previously reported findings concerning the influence of <b>norethandrolone</b> on cortisol metabolism, the following conclusions were drawn: (a) Cirrhotic patients have decreased A-ring reduction of cortisone to tetrahydrocortisone and correspondingly increased 20 -ketone reduction of cortisone to Reichstein's substances U and epi-U and then to the cortolones. (b) Intrahepatic cholestasis, a regular pathophysiological feature of cirrhosis, may be responsible for the observed abnormal cortisol metabolite pattern in this disease.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between ultrasonication and microwave irradiation as tools {{to achieve a}} rapid sample treatment {{for the analysis of}} banned doping substances in human urine by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed. The following variables were studied and optimised: (i) time of treatment, (ii) temperature, (iii) microwave power and (iv) ultrasonic amplitude. The results were evaluated and compared with those achieved by the routine method used in the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accredited Antidoping Laboratory of Rome. Only under the effect of the ultrasonic field was it possible to enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction rate of conjugated compounds. Similar reaction yield to the routine method was achieved after 10 min for most compounds. Under microwave irradiation, denaturation of the enzyme occurs for high microwave power. The use of both ultrasonic or microwave energy to improve the reaction rate of the derivatisation of the target compounds with trimethyliodosilane/methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (TMSI/MSTFA/NH 4 I/ 2 -mercaptoethanol) was also evaluated. To test the use of the two systems in the acceleration of the reaction with TMSI, a pool of 55 banned substances and/or their metabolites were used. After 3 min of ultrasonication, 34 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to those obtained with the classic procedure that lasts for 30 min (Student's∈t test, n∈=∈ 5), 18 increased to higher silylation yields, and for the compounds 13 β, 17 α-diethyl- 3 α, 17 β-dihydroxy- 5 α-gonane (norboletone metabolite 1), metoprolol and metipranolol the same results were obtained increasing the ultrasonication time to 5 min.

In this case, 30 of the 55 compounds had recoveries similar to the classic procedure (Student's t test, n∈=∈ 5) whilst 18 had higher silylation yields. For the compounds 3 α-hydroxy- 1 α-methyl- 5 α-androstan- 17 -one (mesterolone metabolite 1), 17 α-ethyl- 5 β-estrane- 3 α, 17 β, 21 -triol (<b>norethandrolone</b> metabolite 1), epioxandrolone, 4 -chloro- 6 β, 17 β- dihydroxy- 17 α-methyl- 1, 4 -androstadien- 3 -one (chlormetandienone metabolite 1), carphedon, esmolol and bambuterol the same results were obtained after 5 min under microwave irradiation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
