40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to model the}} electrochemical characteristics of a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyser. The electrochemical characteristics, which include the Ohmic, activation and concentration losses, are modelled {{by means of an}} equivalent electric circuit impedance. The equivalent electric circuit impedance under consideration is the RandleseWarburg (RW) cell and the parameters are obtained through the current interrupt (CI) method. The CI method consists of two parts, 1) the natural voltage response (NVR) method to model the Ohmic losses, and 2) the current switching (CS) method to model the activation and concentration losses. A simulation model of the RW cell is used to verify and validate the CI method. Thereafter, the CI method is practically implemented and the results presented. Results show that the Ohmic losses correlates well with existing literature. The paper furthermore illustrates the capability of the CI method to visually illustrate the RW impedance through <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagrams.</b> <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagrams</b> are used to illustrate the concentration losses and indicate the degradation state of the PEM at specific operating conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{measurement}} of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy used in situ is a suitable technique for {{the characterization of}} oil and water-in-oil emulsions. <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagrams</b> for dehydrated oils are characterized by the formation of one semi-circle. The equivalent circuit proposed for the dehydrated oil is a resistance and capacitor (ROCO) in parallel. The resistance and conductivity of the oil calculated by impedance were 2. 96 Gohm and 486 nSm− 1, respectively. <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagrams</b> for {{the system composed of}} water emulsions in oil are mainly characterized by two semi-circles with different relaxation for oil and water-in-oil emulsions. The equivalent circuit is formed by RO and CPEO in parallel and in series with the arrangement of RW/O and CPEW/O in parallel, where RO and CPEO represents the oil, and RW/O and CPEW/O represents water-in-oil emulsions. The resistance of oil (RO) and water-in-oil (RW/O) emulsions increase with the increasing amount of water in the preparation. The increase in resistance shows that the emulsions become more stable with the addition of water. This result is consistent with the formation of rigid films on water–oil interfaces. The impedance measurements were applied to the analysis of the demulsification of the water-in-oil emulsions under an electrostatic field...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{deals with}} the robust control of active magnetic bearings (AMB). Methods are developed for the control system synthesis and analysis for subcritical machines. A new synthesis method is developed for the position control loop. In the method, linearization is achieved using two rotation matrices, and two controllers are designed using SISO (single-input, single-output) methods. The controller structure {{is based on the}} H∞-optimal controller, which is the best solution with respect to the stated physical performance limits. A generalized <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagram,</b> based on the numerical range, is used to analyze the system. This diagram gives highly nonconservative stability robustness estimates and is mathematically elegant. The effect of the most important nonlinearity, i. e. power amplifier saturation, is carefully analyzed. For unbalance compensation a simple algorithm is proposed which has only one tuning parameter. By using the generalized <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagram,</b> it is shown that this simple algorithm generally works in the case of subcritical machines, also at the rigid-body resonance speeds. The single feedback coefficient and robustness can be easily determined using the generalized <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagram.</b> Finally, AMB is used in mechanical balancing of an elastic rotor. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|To {{control a}} remote (dynamical) system, data {{networks}} can be used. This has some advan-tages, but also introduces a time-delay between the controller and the plant. Systems, that use a network {{to close the}} control loop, are called Networked Control Systems (NCSs). This research treats the experimental validation {{of the influence of}} constant time-delays on the stability of an NCS. Under certain assumptions concerning the properties of a network, a model is formulated, representing an NCS with constant time-delays. A second-order dynamical system (an in-ertia controlled by a PD controller) is used to analyze the stability properties for different controller gains and different constant time-delays. The stability analysis for this system shows that the maximum allowable velocity feedback gain for a stable system varies with the amount of delay in a remarkable manner. It increases until a delay δt = 0. 25 h, with h the sample time, and then decreases for increasing delay. This peak in the stability region can be explained {{with the aid of a}} Bode and <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The Bode and <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagrams</b> show that a time-delay lowers the phase of the system response, but also the magnitude...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} to interpret frequency response measurements of a deformed transformer winding due to conductors tilt. To achieve that, geometrical parameters of a three phase prototype transformer {{is used to}} simulate the frequency response {{of one of the}} windings using the multi-conductor transmission line model. To simulate the response, inter-turn, inter-disc and inter-winding capacitances of the winding based on normal and deformed conditions are computed using finite element method. Using the computed values, the frequency response for both normal and deformed conditions are simulated. The simulated responses are studied by subdividing into four frequency regions and compared using the correlation coefficient. For further analysis, the vector fitting algorithm was implemented to approximate the transfer function of each response. All transfer functions are then represented in the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagram</b> to analyse the shape of each plot. From the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>diagram,</b> it was observed that the real minimum of each plot increases as the winding deformation increases.
