50|$|The Canadian {{tax system}} {{is based on}} {{voluntary}} compliance or self-assessment system. Every taxpayer is obligated to file their tax returns on time.

The CRA processes most tax returns with very limited review and promptly issues a <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Assessment.</b> The <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Assessment</b> is a legal document and provides a summary of each entity's income, credits and deductions. If a taxpayer disagrees with an assessment, they may file an appeal which may lead to challenging the assessment in tax court. Once a tax return is assessed, it {{may be subject to}} review.

40|$|Extract] To {{facilitate}} {{the determination of}} a person's liability to taxation it is required that taxpayers provide the ATO with certain information in a return so that the ATO may calculate the amount refundable or payable, and issue a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> that <b>assessment</b> (in the absence <b>of</b> a deemed <b>assessment).</b> Subsequently there is a confirmation <b>of</b> that <b>assessment</b> by the ATO from sources external to the return. Where discrepancies occur, the assessment is varied by amendment action {{in accordance with the}} provisions of s 170 and a penalty may be imposed. Section 161 (1) contains the authority for the ATO to require that a return be lodged. It permits the requirement to be publicised by way <b>of</b> a <b>notice</b> in the Government Gazette. Section 161 (1 A) authorises the ATO to, within the notice, exempt from the obligation to furnish returns classes of persons not liable to pay income tax. Section 161 (2) makes it clear that if a person is absent from Australia or otherwise unable to lodge a return as required by the notice, due to a physical or mental infirmity, they may satisfy their lodgment obligations by authorising another person (such as a tax agent) to lodge on their behalf...|$|R
40|$|My {{colleague}} Jim Butcher, in {{a recent}} “get-acquainted ” session of faculty and new clinical students, alluded to this excellent volume as giving them advance <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> what psychological <b>assessment</b> will look like in the year 2000. To say that confidently, like editing this book, takes not only foresight and cognitive flexibility but considerable courage. (Being an unreconstructed believer in traits, I conjecture this relates to Jim’s being a flier and a therapist interested in crisis intervention.) One may anticipate resistance {{to some of the}} book’s ideas, partly ideological and partly Luddite; but no clinical psychologist or psychiatrist, whether mainly a teacher or practitioner, can afford to remain ignorant of the matters here explained. It would be strange, and embarrassing, if clinical psychologists, supposedly sophisticated methodologically and quantitatively trained, were to lag behind internal medicine, investment analysis, and factory operations control in accepting the computer revolution. The authors invited to contribute are of the highest competence in their areas of expertise, which range widely over such diverse domains as adaptive testing of abilities, Rorschach interpretation, lifestyle assessment using micro-computers, an...|$|R
5000|$|The Senior Courts Costs Office, which quantifies {{legal costs}} {{pursuant}} to orders for costs, serves all divisions. Such Costs Office {{is part of}} the High Court. Because the Costs Office {{is part of the}} High Court, generally all detailed assessment proceedings commenced in the Costs Office are subject to provisional assessment. Exceptions from provisional assessment are detailed assessment proceedings in which the costs claimed are large (greater than £75,000) or in which the potential paying party does not respond to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{a return}} is not filed after the {{computer}} generated letters, such as TX11 and TX14, a non-filer officer could arbitrarily prepare a tax {{return for the}} taxpayer, normally generating a larger tax bill than what the taxpayer would expect. A <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> under subsection 152(7) of the Income Tax Act will be issued. This 152(7) assessment {{is commonly known as}} an arbitrary assessment. Collection actions may follow. The taxpayer could file an amended tax return to reduce the tax bill. Once amended returns are filed, an audit is normally triggered.|$|E
5000|$|For {{more complex}} cases a process, {{formerly}} called a taxation of costs, {{now known as}} detailed assessment, is used. It is unrelated to [...] "tax" [...] {{in the sense of}} a method of raising government revenue. The successful party must file with the court (unless the other party fails to respond to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment)</b> a detailed breakdown of the costs and disbursements incurred, known as a bill of costs which sets out the successful party's claim. The bill is usually prepared by a law costs draftsman, whose skill is often as essential to successful recovery of costs as the skill of a solicitor or barrister is essential to success on the principal issues of the litigation. An officer of the court, Costs Judge or District Judge will then assess the reasonableness of the costs (unless the potential paying party failed to respond to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment)</b> with reference to a statutory schedule of limits of entitlements of costs, together with legal precedents, unless the costs can be agreed between the parties. The level of reduction can mean that the bill is reduced in some instances substantially, but in most cases at least 80% of the costs originally sought will be allowed. A court order for costs is enforceable as a debt against the unsuccessful party.|$|E

40|$|The “conclusive evidence” {{provisions}} in the taxation legislation {{have the effect of}} establishing conclusively (except in Pt IVC proceedings) that the amount and all the particulars in a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> produced by the Commissioner are correct. Provision is made in Pt IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) (TAA) for objections to assessments and for reviews by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and appeals to the Federal Court. Together, the conclusive evidence provisions and Pt IVC of the TAA give voice to a legislative policy in respect of the interface between the creation of a liability to tax upon assessment under statute by an officer of the Executive, the Commissioner and the constitutionally necessary ability for the recipient of an assessment to be able to challenge that asserted liability by an invocation of judicial power. Sections 14 ZZM and s 14 ZZR of the TAA also give voice to a legislative policy in respect of this legislative interface. This paper examines the operation of this legislative interface and highlights that the current taxation regime does not adequately address the protection of taxpayers against the impact of erroneous assessments.

40|$|Since the Transplantation Law {{came into}} effect in the year 1997 the living kidney {{donation}} is increasing. The Transplantation Law requires – among other things – a legally effective enlightenment of the donor by the responsible physician. This enlightenment includes not only medical but also social medical aspects like questions concerning the social insurance and pension law. After giving a review about the different social contribution carriers relevant for the living organ donors the two laws applying to the living kidney donation are described: the Severe Disability Law and the Victim Indemnity Law. According to the Severe Disability Law the assessment of disability is possible for living kidney donors. The <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> provides a disability degree of 25 following the „Basis for Medical Experts in Social Indemnity Law and Severe Disability Law". Possible compensation of disadvantages available for living kidney donors are described in detail. According to the Federal Pension Law a living kidney donor receives public assistance in case of damage or loss of the remaining kidney {{as a result of}} an intentional illegal assault. The detailed requirements for the application of this law and the assessment as a result of damage are explained. The pension administration is still a rarely known social contribution carrier in connection with living kidney donation whose inclusion should complete the social medical coverage in future...|$|E
40|$|One area of {{procedure}} encompassed by the topic, Tax Administration, is the statutory assessment. It is {{that area of}} Tax Administration to which this thesis is directed. The making of an income tax assessment is probably {{to be regarded as}} the primary function of the Commissioner of Taxation under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Almost every action and procedure undertaken by the Commissioner has some relationship to his duty to make assessments. The assessment-making procedure, which is fundamental (in the scheme of the Act) to the creation of an enforceable obligation to pay income tax, includes a process of applying the provisions of the Act to a state of facts with a view to determining the liability of the taxpayer concerned. The nature of the assessment is discussed by reference to the statutory provisions which authorise the making of and objection to an assessment. The thesis proceeds by way of examination of the following topics: the assessment, the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessment,</b> validity in procedure and "assessment", authority to make an assessment, amended assessment, right to challenge an assessment. (The final chapter considers the assessment {{in the context of the}} review procedure of Part V of the Income Tax Assessment Act). A theme of the thesis is that the Income Tax Assessment Act is concerned only with a valid assessment, that is, one made intra vires, and further, that not every assessment-like calculation or determination is the assessment contemplated by the Act. Thus, if the requirements of "assessment" are not satisfied then there is no "assessment" even though there is jurisdiction to assess in the particular circumstances. Where there is jurisdiction to assess then any assessment made will be a valid assessment, and this notwithstanding any identifiable mala fides or impropriety on the part of the Commissioner of Taxation or his delegate which is associated with the making of that assessment.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area of this termination. The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law <b>of</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination.
