In the second round Campas scored a knockdown, the second knockdown in Trinidad's career. Following this Trinidad exchanged several combinations, injuring Campas' face and breaking his <b>nose.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> fourth round, the referee stopped the fight, the first defeat in Campas' career.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the war he}} was put {{in charge}} of {{analyzing}} technical advances at home and abroad and his enthusiasm for innovation earned him the nickname Armee Modernissimus ("the army modernization fanatic"). Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never tested on the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of his approach. At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him, and as late as November 1944, he gave the U.S. 12th Army Group a bloody <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E
5|$|On March 10, 2005, London {{became the}} number one {{contender}} for Chavo Guerrero's WWE Cruiserweight Championship, which he later won in a cruiserweight battle royal. Guerrero challenged London for the title at Judgment Day, where London emerged victorious. During another title match with Guerrero on June 23, The Mexicools stormed the ring, attacking both London and Guerrero. On the July 14 episode of SmackDown!, London teamed with Scotty 2 Hotty and Funaki to face The Mexicools. The ending of the match saw Juventud perform the 450° splash on London for the win, but landed his knee onto London's face and legitimately broke his <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. London lost the Cruiserweight Title on the August 4 episode of Velocity to Nunzio. Later in the night, London cut a heel promo encouraging the fans to protest his title loss. London went on a losing streak before returning as a face and teaming with the newly rehired Brian Kendrick.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this work}} is to control odor {{emissions}} from a landfill plant by implementing a system for process management using advanced sensor technologies. Gaschromatography-Olfactometry/Mass Spectrometry (GC-O/MS), dynamic olfactometry and electronic noses using two different technologies (Metal Oxide Semiconductors and polymer/black carbon nano composite arrays) have been integrated. Results shows the potential of electronic <b>noses</b> <b>in</b> discriminating <b>the</b> sources and monitor both in-situ and <b>in</b> real time, <b>the</b> odorous emissions. An intelligent system, able to react <b>in</b> <b>the</b> critical operations of management of the plant can be developed, by implementing an intelligent network of sensors adequately trained to identify the odor emissions of any type of industrial activity. This approach has shown the full applicability of electronic <b>noses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process control of wastes having odor impacts...|$|R

25|$|On November 27, 2004, Morales fought Barrera for {{the third}} time in a bout for the WBC Super Featherweight title. Their highly {{anticipated}} third battle drew a capacity crowd of over 11,000. Barrera started fast and rocked Morales late in the first round and bloodied his <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second. Morales came back strongly in the second half of the fight and won four of the last six rounds on two judges' scorecards. However, the judges scored the bout 114–114, 114–115, 113–115 in favor of Barrera, in what was justifiably a very, very close, but non-controversial and justifiable win for Barrera. Their third meeting was once again named The Ring Fight of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Treatments for {{the plastic}} repair {{of a broken}} nose are first {{mentioned}} in the Edwin Smith Papyrus, a transcription of an Ancient Egyptian medical text, the oldest known surgical treatise, dated to the Old Kingdom from 3000 to 2500 BC. Rhinoplasty techniques were carried out in ancient India by the ayurvedic physician Sushruta (c. 800 BC), who described reconstruction of the <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sushruta samhita (c. 500 BC), his medico–surgical compendium. The physician Sushruta and his medical students developed and applied plastic surgical techniques for reconstructing noses, genitalia, earlobes, et cetera, that were amputated as religious, criminal, or military punishment. Sushruta also developed the forehead flap rhinoplasty procedure that remains contemporary plastic surgical practice. In the Sushruta samhita compendium, the physician Sushruta describes the (modern) free-graft Indian rhinoplasty as the Nasikasandhana.|$|E
25|$|The {{stronger}} undercarriage {{legs were}} angled 2inches (5.08cm) forward when extended, making the Spitfire more stable {{on the ground}} and reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its <b>nose.</b> <b>In</b> addition <b>the</b> retractable landing lights were no longer fitted. Structural hard-points were added outboard of the wheel-wells, allowing racks to be fitted under each wing which were capable of carrying one 250lb (113kg) bomb each.|$|R

25|$|The M.52's single pilot, who, for the {{intended}} first flight, {{would have been}} test pilot Eric Brown, would have flown the aircraft from a small cockpit which was set inside the shock cone at {{the nose of the}} aircraft. The pressurised cockpit, in which the pilot would have had to fly the aircraft in a semi-prone position, was complete with a curved windscreen that was aligned with the contours of the bullet-shaped <b>nose.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event of an emergency, the entire section could be jettisoned, the separation from the rest of aircraft being initiated via multiple cordite-based explosive bolts. Air pressure would force the detached capsule off the fuselage while a parachute would slow its descent; during the capsule's descent, the pilot would bail out at a lower altitude and then parachute to safety. In order to serve its role as a research aircraft, the M.52 was to be equipped with comprehensive flight instrumentation, including automated instrument recorders and strain gauging throughout the structure connected to an oscilloscope.|$|E
25|$|Long {{aluminium}} beadings on {{the sides}} were painted cream, a visual device to make the locomotive's high sides appear more slender {{and add to the}} impression of speed. Three curved chevrons on each <b>nose,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same cream, added to that effect. To British eyes, the locomotive's styling was reminiscent of American locomotives, such as the EMD E-unit or ALCO PA designs (partly because English Electric initially planned to offer the type for export), with high noses and small, somewhat swept-back cab windows set behind them. To add to the American look of the locomotive, a large headlight was to have been fitted to each nose (the lights were never installed but would have been of the rotating 'Mars Light' type as fitted to North American locomotives of the era). Two 18-cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, derated from the 1,750 horsepower (1.3 MW) of the marine engines in minesweepers to 1,650 horsepower (1.2 MW) each, generating 3,300 horsepower (2.5 MW) total. This derating reduced the stress on the engines, thereby increasing the service life and length of time between overhauls.|$|E
25|$|Morales then tasted {{defeat for}} the first time in his 42nd {{professional}} fight when he lost (this time) a controversial majority decision and his WBC title against Lineal Champion, Marco Antonio Barrera in June 2002, in a re-match of their February 2000 fight. Morales constantly pressed forward and dominated much of the first half of the fight (clearly winning at least 4 of the first 6 rounds). He was cut on the bridge of the <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2nd round, and cut and swollen over his right eye in the 8th. However, he punched Barrera to the canvas during the middle rounds but this was called a slip. Barrera fought cautiously in the early rounds, but rallied as the fight progressed, although Morales seemed to narrowly win rounds 10 and 11, which when including his dominance in the first half of the fight, seemed to seal him the close victory on the score-cards. HBO's unofficial ring-side scorer: Harold Lederman, scored the fight 115–113 (7 rounds to 5) for Morales.|$|E

25|$|Divers may {{test whether}} a mask {{is a good}} fit by placing it on their face, without using the straps, and gently inhaling through their nose. If the mask stays on without any help this {{indicates}} that no air is being drawn in and that the skirt is in sufficient contact with the facial skin all the way round the mask. Optimum sealing requires that hair strands do not cross under {{the edge of the}} seal, as they can provide a path for water to leak into the mask. This is more a problem with the forehead hairline than with lower facial hair, as water from the top tends to run into the eyes, while water pooling at the bottom is easily purged by exhaling a small volume of air through the nose. Most bearded divers learn to manage the slight leakage without difficulty, inconvenience, or greasing the moustache. Other factors affecting a comfortable fit are sufficient space for the <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nose pocket, no contact between the rigid mask frame and the bridge of the nose, and no excessive pressure on the forehead. There should also be sufficient space between the mask lenses and the face that the eyelashes do not contact the glass noticeably when blinking.|$|E
500|$|Vedaranyam has {{an average}} {{elevation}} of [...] and {{is located on}} the Coramandel coast of Bay of Bengal. The Vedaranyam swamp is located parallel to the Palk Strait for [...] The river Cauvery was flowing south easterly direction from Trichy and had its confluence at Vedaranyam due to the emergence of Vedaranyam nose (the nose shaped stretch from Vedaranyam to Kodiyakarai) during the pleistocene period. Due to the rise of teritiary rocks in the Pattukottai – Mannargudi region and also due to the increase of sediments in the Vedaranyam area, the river migrated northwards. There is lesser marine activity in the Vedaranyam shore due to the presence of Vedaranyam <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north and Sri Lanka in the south, both causing weak shore currents.|$|E
500|$|While the artilleries kept {{up their}} noisy exchange, holding the Duke's attention, Frederick sent scouts {{to find a}} decent {{crossing}} of the Saale, since the one at Weissenfels was not usable. [...] There was little he could do at the burned bridge; to cross the river under Saxe-Hildburghausen's <b>nose,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of fire, would have been foolish. Across the river, the Allies had a physical barrier to protect them; they could also use their position to watch Frederick's movement. Inexplicably, though, Saxe-Hildburghausen gave up this advantage and retired toward Burgweben and Tagewerben, counting on the intervening hills to protect him. Soubise had advanced from Reichardswerben through Kaynau, and they met up at Gross Körbetha. Their advanced guard patrolled Merseburg, and sought some information from the local inhabitants. Although the local Saxon peasants might have disliked the Prussians, they disliked the French and Austrians more, and they gave up little information. Neither Saxe-Hildburghausen nor Soubise had an idea what Frederick intended, or indeed, what he was doing. [...] Marshal Keith reached Merseburg and found the bridge there destroyed, with the Austrians and French prepared to hold {{the other side of}} the river. [...] By the night of 3 November, Frederick's engineers finished their new bridges and the entire Prussian line advanced across the Saale. As soon as Frederick had crossed the river, he sent 1,500 cavalry under the command of Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz to raid the Allied camp. He planned to attack it the next day, but the surprise raid frightened Soubise into moving during the night to a more secure position. On 4 November, Frederick moved to his camp at Rossbach.|$|E
