5000|$|Meanwhile, the {{indicator}} unit (usually {{mounted on the}} dashboard) is measuring and displaying the amount of electric current flowing through the sending unit. When the tank level is high and maximum current is flowing, the <b>needle</b> <b>points</b> to [...] "F" [...] indicating a full tank.

50|$|The battery also powered the camera's coupled 'match-needle' {{exposure}} metering system. This {{consisted of}} two <b>needles</b> <b>pointing</b> along a vertical shutter-speed scale visible in the viewfinder. In manual mode, a black <b>needle</b> <b>pointed</b> out the shutter speed recommended by the built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter, while a translucent green needle showed the current (actual) shutter speed setting of the camera. The photographer would then adjust the shutter speed and/or the lens aperture until the needles aligned, at which point correct exposure would be achieved.|$|R

Similar litmus and {{turmeric}} paper {{points were}} now placed upon glass plates, and {{connected by a}} string six feet long, both string and paper being moistened in solution of sulphate of soda; a <b>needle</b> <b>point</b> connected with the machine was brought opposite the litmus paper point, and another <b>needle</b> <b>point</b> connected with the discharging train brought opposite the turmeric paper. On working the machine, acid appeared on the litmus, and alkali on the turmeric paper; but the latter was not so abundant as in former cases, {{for much of the}} electricity passed off from the string into the air, and diminished the quantity discharged at the turmeric point.|$|E
60|$|When {{the pair}} reached the Rocket a {{consultation}} was held, {{and it was}} decided to start for <b>Needle</b> <b>Point</b> Island on the following morning. Jack Parsons said it would take from five to six hours to reach the locality.|$|E
60|$|It {{was on the}} day {{following}} Christmas that Dick {{brought out}} the brass-lined money casket which he had {{picked up in the}} cave on <b>Needle</b> <b>Point</b> Island, in Lake Huron, as related in a previous volume of this series.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is honest," [...] {{answered}} Dick, and thereupon told of {{the adventure}} on <b>Needle</b> <b>Point</b> Island and of the map on the table, and how it had disappeared, and of the finding of the second map in the brass-lined money casket later on.|$|E
60|$|At noon Parsons {{announced}} that they were within three miles of <b>Needle</b> <b>Point</b> Island. Dinner was ready, {{but it must be}} confessed that Dick was almost too excited to eat. Half a dozen vessels had thus far been sighted, but not one which looked like the Peacock.|$|E

5000|$|The FE is a manual-focus SLR with manual {{exposure}} control or aperture-priority autoexposure, and electromechanical components. As such, the FE requires batteries (two S76 or A76, or LR44 or SR44, or one 1/3N) to power its electronically controlled shutter. The batteries also power the FE's [...] "match-needle" [...] exposure control system. This {{consists of two}} <b>needles</b> <b>pointing</b> along a vertical shutter speed scale {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder. In manual mode, a black <b>needle</b> <b>points</b> out the shutter speed recommended by the built-in, open aperture, through-the-lens (TTL), silicon photodiode (SPD) light meter, with 60/40 percent centerweighting, while a translucent green needle shows the actual camera-set shutter speed. The photographer adjusts the shutter speed and/or the lens aperture f-stop until the needles align.|$|R
5000|$|Once the mix {{is drawn}} into the syringe, air bubbles should be removed by {{flicking}} the barrel with the <b>needle</b> <b>pointed</b> upwards and pressing the plunger to expel the bubbles that pool at the top. This is done to prevent injection of air into the bloodstream.|$|R
60|$|While speaking, Tom {{had taken}} the pains to display the pistol taken from the sailor at the cave. Sam now took up a short iron bar lying near, and both boys showed that they meant to remain masters of the situation. The Canadians noted this, but said nothing, for they felt {{something}} was wrong and they wished to get into no trouble. A few minutes later the anchor was brought up, the sails hoisted, and the Wellington stood away from <b>Needle</b> <b>Point</b> Island.|$|E
6000|$|After their {{stirring}} adventures on the Great Lakes, {{and especially}} on <b>Needle</b> <b>Point</b> Island in Lake Huron, the Rover boys were glad {{enough to get}} back to dear old Putnam Hall and to their studies, even though the latter were something of a [...] "grind," [...] as Tom declared. They all loved Captain Victor Putnam, the owner of the institution, and it may be added here that the captain thought as much of the Rovers as he did of any of the scholars under him, and that was a good deal.|$|E
60|$|With this caution {{they were}} marched {{into the cabin}} and then on deck. At first the strong light blinded them, but soon they became {{accustomed}} to this, and made out a small bay just ahead, surrounded by cedar trees and various bushes. Back of the trees was a hill, and off to the southward a rocky elevation ending in a needle-like point. It was this elevation which gave to the island the name of <b>Needle</b> <b>Point.</b> By the Indians of days gone by the island was called Arrow Head.|$|E

60|$|Compressing {{his lips}} {{like a man}} resolved, the {{commander}} of the Coquette bent further forward, and glanced at the wheel.

60|$|That {{was full}} permission. Ever since Honora {{had been able}} to combine a narration, Humfrey had been the recipient, though she seldom knew whether he attended, and from her {{babyhood}} upwards had been quite contented with trotting {{in the wake of his}} long strides, pouring out her ardent fancies, now and then getting an answer, but more often going on like a little singing bird, through the midst of his avocations, and quite complacent under his interruptions of calls to his dogs, directions to his labourers, and warnings to her to mind her feet and not her chatter. In the full stream of crusaders, he led her down one of the multitude of by-paths cleared out in the hazel coppice for sporting; here leading up a rising ground whence the tops of the trees might be overlooked, some flecked with gold, some blushing into crimson, and beyond them the <b>needle</b> <b>point</b> of the village spire, the vane flashing back the sun; there bending into a ravine, marshy at the bottom, and nourishing the lady fern, then again crossing glades, where the rabbits darted across the path, and the battle of Damietta was broken into by stern orders to Fly to come to heel, and the eating of the nuts which Humfrey pulled down from the branches, and held up to his cousin with superior good nature.|$|E

40|$|We {{welcome the}} useful and {{attentive}} comments of Vannacci and colleagues concerning our study of acupuncture to {{lower blood pressure}} in mild to moderate hypertension. 1 Their criticism that Taiyang is not a unilateral but a bilateral <b>needling</b> <b>point</b> is correct, and this <b>point</b> was actually <b>needled</b> bilaterally. We apologize for this misclassification in the text. Active and sham <b>needling</b> <b>points</b> can be easily recognized from Figure 1 of our article, which shows Taiyang at its correct location. Concerning the nomenclature of acupuncture points, Vannacci and colleagues were not satisfied with our use of German abbreviations. There are various acupuncture point nomenclatures in use world-wide, and the World Health Organization system 2 is not universally used. This is precisely {{the reason why we}} included a figure showing the location of the points. We think, however, that the desire for a unified nomenclature is reasonable and therefore offer the followin...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{declination}} or {{variation is}} the angle on the horizontal plane between magnetic north (the direction {{the north end}} of a compass <b>needle</b> <b>points,</b> corresponding to the direction of the Earth's magnetic field lines) and true north (the direction along a meridian towards the geographic North Pole). This angle varies depending on position on the Earth's surface, and changes over time.|$|R
50|$|Grid {{north is}} a navigational term {{referring}} to the direction northwards along the grid lines of a map projection. It is contrasted with true north (the direction of the North Pole) and magnetic north (the direction in which a compass <b>needle</b> <b>points).</b> Many topographic maps, {{including those of the}} United States Geological Survey and Great Britain's Ordnance Survey, indicate the difference between grid north, true north, and magnetic north.|$|R
