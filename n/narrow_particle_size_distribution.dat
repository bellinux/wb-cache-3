50|$|Depending on {{the layer}} thickness, the coating with iron oxide leads to bronze-, copper- or red-colored effect {{pigments}}. The pigments obtainable {{at the market}} possess a <b>narrow</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of about 5 to 30 µm {{as well as a}} high aspect ratio. The sparkle effect referred to above has its origin in the optimized thickness of all layers in the pigment structure, including the Al2O3substrate. Analytical investigations show that the thickness range of the aluminum oxide platelets and the resultant pigments can be controlled very precisely.|$|E
50|$|In rheology, the Farris Effect {{describes}} the decrease of the viscosity of a suspension upon increasing the dispersity {{of the solid}} additive, at constant volume fraction of the solid additive. That is, that a broader particle size distribution yields a lower viscosity than a <b>narrow</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution,</b> for the same concentration of particles. The phenomenon is names after Richard J. Farris, who modeled the effect. The effect is relevant whenever suspensions are flowing, particularly for suspensions with high loading fractions. Examples include hydraulic fracturing fluids, metal injection molding feedstocks, cosmetics, and various geological processes including sedimentation and lava flows.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>narrow</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> {{obtained}} in the oleic acid-based synthesis of hexagonal phase β-NaREF 4 nanocrystals (RE = Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb) has been investigated. Compared to the standard synthesis, the growth conditions were simplified by using small purified particles of either α-NaREF 4 (cubic phase) or β-NaREF 4 (hexagonal phase) as single-source precursors, thereby avoiding the complications arising from the simultaneous presence of molecular educts and intermediately formed small particles. The study shows that α-phase as well as β-phase particles grow by Ostwald-ripening but <b>narrow</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> of the β-NaREF 4 product particles are only obtained when α-phase precursor particles are employed. Since the small particles are also formed as intermediate products in the standard synthesis of β-NaSmF 4, β-NaEuF 4, β-NaGdF 4 and β-NaTbF 4 particles, their crystal phase is an important parameter to obtain a narrow <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> in these systems...|$|R

50|$|Thermospray was {{originally}} developed for coupling liquid chromatography to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Thermospray is the controlled partial vaporization of a liquid as it flows through a heated capillary tube. The nebulization {{is accomplished by}} pumping a liquid sample at moderately high pressure through an electrothermally heated capillary tube. When sufficient power is coupled to the flowing sample stream, a partially vaporized mixture is produced consisting of some fraction of vaporized sample and some remaining liquid sample. Upon exiting the heated capillary, the rapidly expanding sample vapor converts the remaining liquid stream to an aerosol. The vapour so produced acts as a nebulizing ‘gas’ and aids {{the breakup of the}} liquid stream into droplets, in a process similar to pneumatic nebulization. Thus, conceptually this {{can be thought of as}} a pneumatic process where the expanding solvent vapor is used as a nebulization gas. The solution leaves the tube as a supersonic jet or spray of very small droplets in solvent vapor. Qualitatively, the aerosols appear dense with a moderately <b>narrow</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{required}} coal fineness, {{there are two}} types of classifier that may be selected for a vertical roller mill. The dynamic classifier, which consists of a stationary angled inlet vane assembly surrounding a rotating vane assembly or cage, is capable of producing micrometer-fine pulverized coal with a <b>narrow</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution.</b> In addition, adjusting the speed of the rotating cage can easily change the intensity of the centrifugal force field in the classification zone to achieve coal fineness control real-time to make immediate accommodation for a change in fuel or boiler load conditions. For the applications where a micrometer-fine pulverized coal is not necessary, the static classifier, which consists of a cone equipped with adjustable vanes, is an option at a lower cost since it contains no moving parts. With adequate mill grinding capacity, a vertical mill equipped with a static classifier is capable of producing a coal fineness up to 99.5% or higher <50 mesh and 80% or higher <200 mesh, while one equipped with a dynamic classifier produces coal fineness levels of 100% <100 mesh and 95% <200 mesh, or better.|$|E

For optimal conditions silicon nanoparticles with a geometric standard deviation of 1. 06 were synthesized at a production rate of 0. 7 g/h.

The results show that <b>narrow</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> can only be obtained in the temperature range between 900 and 1100 °C, as long as both the initial silane concentration (1 mbar silane partial pressure) and the reactor total pressure a re low (25 mbar).

40|$|Hypothesis: Microfluidic {{techniques}} {{are expected to}} provide <b>narrower</b> <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> than conventional methods for the preparation of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles. Besides, it is hypothesized that the <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles influences the settling behavior and rheological properties of its aqueous dispersions. Experiments: For the preparation of PLGA particles, two different methods, microfluidic and conventional oil-in-water emulsification methods were employed. The <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> and <b>particle</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of PLGA <b>particles</b> prepared by microfluidics were studied {{as a function of}} the flow rate of the organic phase while particles prepared by conventional methods were studied as a function of stirring rate.

40|$|AbstractThe {{iron oxide}} {{nanoparticles}} have been synthesized by coprecipitation and solvothermal reduction methods. The particles obtained differ in size, the mean <b>size</b> of <b>particles</b> coprecipitated is of 13 nm and the particles, prepared by solvothermal reduction method have a size of 20 nm. Both kinds of nanoparticles demonstrate <b>narrow</b> <b>particles</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>distribution.</b> The <b>particles</b> which are prepared by coprecipitation method have <b>narrow</b> <b>particles</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>distribution</b> with mean <b>size</b> diameter of 13 nm and the particles, prepared by solvothermal reduction method have a size of 20 nm. The X-ray diffraction data {{analysis revealed that}} highly crystalline and single-phase magnetite nanoparticles are formed by solvothermal reduction technique, whereas coprecipitation leads {{to the formation of}} multi-phase composition of a magnetite (72 %) and maghemite (28 %). According to the size of nanoparticles obtained, they are in superparamagnetic state for iron oxides. The saturation magnetization of solvothermal prepared particles is higher than those for coprecipitated due to their higher crystallinity and phase purity. Nevertheless, the glycerol dispersion of particles coprecipitated shows higher SLP values than the dispersion of the particles, synthesized by solvothermal reduction method. The heating efficiency of nanoparticles based dispersions is explained by the <b>particles</b> <b>size</b> effect and properties of carrier medium...|$|R
30|$|As a result, {{for both}} {{solvents}} (DW and EG), {{changes in the}} MW irradiation time mainly affected the particles' stability, rather than their size.
