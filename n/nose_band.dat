50|$|The {{idea for}} the book came in 1966, when Marion Halpenny was at a race meeting and heard one woman asking another why a certain horse was wearing a <b>nose</b> <b>band,</b> it {{occurred}} to her {{at the time that the}} majority of people going to meetings knew very little about the details of racing and she thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to put all the information together in a book. So began the task of collecting the necessary information, sifting through it, selecting items and preparing them for the book. She did all this without knowing it would ever be published and was pleasantly surprised when the first publisher she sent the manuscript to accepted it straight away.|$|E

Taking {{the name of the}} band from a Dutch children's book by Annie Schmidt called The Island of <b>Nose,</b> the <b>band</b> consisted of Plaskett on drums, Charles Austin and Drew Yamada on guitar, Andrew Glencross on keyboard and Tim Stewart on bass. They cited King Tubby, Kraftwerk, Pink Floyd, Ray's Chicken Pita and Willie Nelson as influences. The goal of the band was to mix conventional song structure with experimentation inspired by krautrock, stoogian protoplasm and the subtractive mixing techniques of [...] "version" [...] reggae. The band released one album, the self-titled Neuseiland, recorded and released in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rules of}} play in 1893 were more like rugby than what might be {{considered}} modern football. The rules called for eleven players on a side with a scrimmage line dividing the teams. The team on offense was required to begin a play by kicking the ball either forward or backward to the quarterback. The quarterback couldn't run with the ball, but he could hand it off. In order to keep possession, the offensive team had to either gain five yards in three downs or not lose ten yards. Forward passing was not allowed. Touchdowns counted for 4 points, with 2 points for a goal after a touchdown, 4 points for a field goal, and 2 points for a safety. Players wore an assortment of [...] "football armor" [...] such as [...] "shin guards, rubber <b>noses,</b> head <b>bands,</b> ankle protectors, elbow and hip pads, ear guards, and mouth pieces. The game consisted of two 45-minute halves.|$|R

5000|$|The M1912 Carbine / M1912/16 Carbine / M1912/18 Carbine, [...] "short rifle", {{was made}} after {{it became clear}} that the long barreled M1894 left {{something}} to be desired. The M1912 was adopted after experiments with shorter, thicker barrels and different projectiles. It differed from the earlier models by being stocked all the way to the muzzle; the bracket for the bayonet was moved from the barrel to under the stock. The M1912 carbine also featured an improved (strengthened) action which differed from the M/94 action on several points. It was soon clear that the <b>nose</b> <b>band</b> was too weak, which led to the /16 and /18 modifications of the basic design. A total of 30,118 were produced in the military serial number range between 1913 and 1926. It was also decided that any further production would be of this model. About 1592 M1912 were produced in a special serial number range for sale to civilians.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDetecting lame cows is {{important}} in improving animal welfare. Automated tools are potentially useful to enable identification and monitoring of lame cows. The goals {{of this study were}} to evaluate the suitability of various physiological and behavioral parameters to automatically detect lameness in dairy cows housed in a cubicle barn. Lame cows suffering from a claw horn lesion (sole ulcer or white line disease) of one claw of the same hind limb (n= 32; group L) and 10 nonlame healthy cows (group C) were included in this study. Lying and standing behavior at night by tridimensional accelerometers, weight distribution between hind limbs by the 4 -scale weighing platform, feeding behavior at night by the <b>nose</b> <b>band</b> sensor, and heart activity by the Polar device (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) were assessed. Either the entire data set or parts of the data collected over a 48 -h period were used for statistical analysis, depending upon the parameter in question. The standing time at night over 12 h and the limb weight ratio (LWR) were significantly higher in group C as compared with group L, whereas the lying time at night over 12 h, the mean limb difference (△weight), and the standard deviation (SD) of the weight applied on the limb taking less weight were significantly lower in group C as compared with group L. No significant difference was noted between the groups for the parameters of heart activity and feeding behavior at night. The locomotion score of cows in group L was positively correlated with the lying time and △weight, whereas it was negatively correlated with LWR and SD. The highest sensitivity (0. 97) for lameness detection was found for the parameter SD [specificity of 0. 80 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 84]. The highest specificity (0. 90) for lameness detection was present for Δweight (sensitivity= 0. 78; AUC= 0. 88) and LWR (sensitivity= 0. 81; AUC= 0. 87). The model considering the data of SD together with lying time at night was the best predictor of cows being lame, accounting for 40 % of the variation in the likelihood of a cow being lame (sensitivity= 0. 94; specificity= 0. 80; AUC= 0. 86). In conclusion, the data derived from the 4 -scale-weighing platform, either alone or combined with the lying time at night over 12 h, represent the most valuable parameters for automated identification of lame cows suffering from a claw horn lesion of one individual hind limb...|$|E
2500|$|The {{continuous}} military {{campaigns and}} the intensive diplomatic efforts {{finally began to}} yield results {{in the early spring}} of 1877 as large numbers of northern bands began to surrender. In April 1877, an aide of General Crook's wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now fully satisfied that the great Sioux War is now ended and that we will have once more a chance to have peace." [...] A large number of Northern Cheyenne, led by Dull Knife and Standing Elk, surrendered at the Red Cloud Agency on April 21, 1877. They were shipped to Indian Territory the following month. Touch the Clouds and Roman <b>Nose</b> arrived with <b>bands</b> at the Spotted Tail Agency. Crazy Horse surrendered with his band at Red Cloud on May 5.|$|R
50|$|These {{projectiles}} {{consist of}} two major components, a warhead filled with 16 pounds of Composition B high explosive (M549) or 15 pounds of TNT high explosive (M549A1), and a solid propellant rocket motor. These components are threaded together so that the outer steel shells of both form a streamlined ogive. A supplementary charge is installed in the deep cavity of the <b>nose.</b> A rotating <b>band</b> encircles the assembled projectile near the base. A rocket cap is threaded into the base. The cap is removed prior to firing to allow ignition of the rocket motor for extended range. The rocket motor body contains seven pounds of solid rocket propellant arranged in two segmented grains. Each of the three segments of the forward grain contains an ignition pellet. The motor nozzle is recessed {{in the center of}} the boat-tail rocket motor base of the projectile, and thrust is along the longitudinal axis.|$|R
40|$|Detecting nose tip {{location}} {{has become}} an important task in face analysis. However, for a 3 D face model with presence of large rotation variation, detecting nose tip location is certainly a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method to detect nose tip region in large rotation variation based on the geometrical shape of a nose. Nose region has always been considered as the most protuberant part of a face. Based on convex points of face surface, we use morphological approach to obtain nose tip region candidates consist of highest point density. For each point of each region candidate, a signature is generated and evaluated with trained <b>nose</b> tip tolerance <b>band</b> for matching purpose. The region that contains the point which scores the most is chosen as the final nose tip region. This method can handle large rotation variation, facial expression, combination of all rotations (yaw, pitch and roll) and large non-facial outliers. Combination of two databases has been used; UPMFace and GavabDB as training data set and test data set. The experimental results show that 95. 19 % nose tip region over 1300 3 D face models were correctly detected...|$|R
50|$|The video {{begins with}} the band walking in a hallway {{in a high school}} and a clown as well {{sometimes}} holding something on his <b>nose.</b> Then the <b>band</b> starts playing in a locker room which appears to be happening at night. Jonathan Davis is seen singing and in some clips he is sitting in the locker room in the dry shower but with a few people spraying a little tiny bit of water on his hair to tease him. This represents some of his painful experiences in high school of being teased. It also features the band in a gym and clips of jocks in their football jerseys and cheerleaders seen by someone who walks in the halls. One of the cheerleaders goes into the bathroom and starts smiling in the dark room with a little light and starts brushing her hair with her hands. Clips also show the band performing in a dark room. The video ends off with the cheerleader in the bathroom taking off her shirt showing a tattoo on her back showing the band's logo. The music video most likely could be them in a school after a football game at night. The music video aired in 1996 and was directed by McG.|$|R
