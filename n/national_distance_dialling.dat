50|$|Direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> (DDD) is a {{telecommunication}} service feature {{in which a}} caller may, without operator assistance, call any other user outside the local calling area. Direct dialing by subscribers typically requires extra digits to be dialed as prefixes than for dialing within the local area or within an area code. DDD also extends {{beyond the boundaries of}} national public telephone network, in which case it is called international direct dialing or international direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> (IDDD).|$|R
50|$|Toronto {{telephone}} numbers were six digits (2L+4N) with named exchanges. They were lengthened to seven (2L+5N) in the 1950s to accommodate direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
50|$|Melvin Leslie Denning (1895-1986) 1948 to 1953. He {{made the}} first long {{distance}} call {{from coast to coast}} using the new direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The initial 86 area codes were {{assigned}} in 1947 as routing codes for operator calls; the first cross-country Bell System direct <b>distance</b> <b>dial</b> call {{was made in}} 1951. The system was based on fixed-length numbers; a direct-dial long distance call consisted of a three-digit area code and a seven-digit local number. Numbers in 2L+4N cities (such as Montr√©al and Toronto) were systematically lengthened to seven digits in the 1950's, a few exchanges at a time, so that all local numbers were seven digits when direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialling</b> finally came to town.|$|R
50|$|Note: Routing {{tables are}} {{constructed}} with no duplicate numbers, so that direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> service {{can be provided}} to all network subscribers. This may {{require the use of}} 10-digit telephone numbers.|$|R
5000|$|... 1951 New Jersey Bell was {{the first}} Bell Operating Company to deploy Direct <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialing</b> for long <b>distance</b> {{telephone}} calls in Englewood, NJ. Previously, all long distance calls had to be handled through an operator.|$|R
50|$|Frank Osborne was {{the mayor}} of Alameda, California. He was the {{recipient}} of the first phone call to use the direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> telephone facility in 1951 dialed by Mayor M. Leslie Denning of Englewood, New Jersey.|$|R
50|$|Melvin Leslie Denning (1895-1986) was the Mayor of Englewood, New Jersey. On November 11, 1951, Denning {{became the}} first to use the direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> {{telephone}} facility in 1951 to contact Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California.|$|R
25|$|PCI {{continued}} in use for tandem purposes, decades after its original need had disappeared. In the 1950s auxiliary senders were added for storing {{more than eight}} digits, and sending by multi-frequency (MF) signaling for direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> (DDD).|$|R
50|$|The term {{subscriber}} trunk dialling {{is used in the}} United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, India and South East Asia. The corresponding term in the North American Numbering Plan, e.g. in the United States and Canada, {{is direct}} <b>distance</b> <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
50|$|While the {{national}} numbering plan of the NANP {{was designed as a}} 10-digit closed plan, international direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> (IDDD) was accomplished by extensive modifications in switching systems to accommodate an open inter{{national numbering plan}} for telephone numbers from 7 to 12 digits.|$|R
25|$|Four {{telecommunication}} companies provide {{local and}} international direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> and fax services. Inter island communications is available through the government's telegraph network and the Provincial Radio Communication System. In addition, there are 19 post offices, a number of cargo forwarders provide air parcel and freight services.|$|R
50|$|Direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> (DDD) {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1972, just 21 years after its initial introduction in Englewood, New Jersey, and 14 years after introduction to Canada at Toronto and Montreal. DDD became available on {{all but a handful}} of exchanges by the spring of 1980.|$|R
5|$|In 1948 Shive {{invented the}} {{phototransistor}} that used {{a beam of}} light, instead of a wire, as the emitter of a point contact transistor, generating holes that flow to the collector. It was not announced until 1950. This invention embodies the modern day nationwide direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Automatic message {{accounting}} (AMA) provides detailed {{accounting for}} telephone calls. When direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> (DDD) {{was introduced in}} the US, message registers no longer sufficed for dialed telephone calls. The need to record the time and phone number of each long distance call was met by electromechanical data processing equipment.|$|R
50|$|Until 2005, some localities {{still used}} a seven-digit local number (nnn-nnnn). Until the 1990s, {{there were also}} certain regions with three-digit area codes and five- (n-nnnn) or six-digit (nn-nnnn) phone numbers. Even shorter numbers used to exist in {{previous}} decades, especially in small towns and before direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> became universal.|$|R
50|$|Between 1983 and 1989, DMS-100 Digital {{switches}} {{were installed}} {{throughout the country}} and, {{as a result of}} this new technology, training of employees became a significant factor. The new technology saw the introduction of new services such as International Direct <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialling</b> and Vertical Services (Call Waiting, Call forwarding and Conference Calling).|$|R
50|$|As a result, the area's low {{requirements}} {{were met}} by long distance switching as part of southern area codes - 403 {{in the west and}} 819 in the east. The Yukon was also covered by 403, not 604, since its lines were handled, prior to Direct <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialing,</b> by operators in Edmonton, Alberta.|$|R
50|$|Area code 201 was the first-assigned {{numbering}} plan area (NPA) {{code of the}} original NPAs when AT&T devised the North American Numbering Plan in 1947. It {{was also the first}} area code with Direct <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialing</b> (DDD) service, when in 1951 the first direct-dialed long-distance call was made from Englewood, New Jersey to Alameda, California.|$|R
5000|$|The {{international}} dialing prefix is [...] "8~10" [...] - callers dial '8', {{wait for a}} tone, and then dial '10', followed by the country code, area code and number. The long <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> prefix is [...] "8" [...] - callers dial '8', wait for a tone, and then dial the area code and number.|$|R
5000|$|The Signaling System No. 5 (SS5) is a {{multi-frequency}} (MF) {{telephone signaling}} {{system that was}} in use from the 1970s for International Direct <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialing</b> (IDDD). Internationally it became known as CCITT5 or CC5. [...] It was also nicknamed Atlantic Code because it {{was used for the}} first IDDD connections between Europe and North America.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{short time}} in the early 1950s, area code 318 was {{temporarily}} used, initially by customers in Englewood, New Jersey, participating in the first customer direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> experiment to reach San Francisco {{as well as some}} areas north of the Golden Gate. In 1953, the entire Bay Area was [...] "reunited" [...] in using area code 415.|$|R
50|$|Bell Canada, Alberta Government Telephones, and B.C. Tel {{completed}} most conversions {{of existing}} numbers {{during the first}} half of the 1960s. In Toronto, historically 2L+4N before numbers were lengthened to accommodate the 1957 introduction of direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialling,</b> the March 1966 directory had no exchange names. Typically in larger communities, conversions would be timed with issues of the telephone directory.|$|R
50|$|As direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> {{expanded}} {{to a growing}} number of communities, local numbers (often four, five or six digits) were extended to standardized seven-digit named exchanges. A toll call to another area code was eleven digits, including the leading 1. In the 1950s, AT&T conducted extensive studies of product engineering and efficiency and concluded that push-button dialing was preferable to rotary dialing.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} {{publication}} {{date back to}} 1945 as Notes on Nationwide Operator Toll Dialing. AT&T published a new edition in 1955 under the title Notes on Nationwide Dialing, and then in later editions as Notes on <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialing</b> in 1956, 1961, 1968 and 1975. The first use of the title Notes on the Network was for the 1980 edition.|$|R
50|$|In smaller {{communities}} with four- or five-digit numbers {{and a single}} city exchange, central office names appeared {{for the first time}} in the late 1950s, and then solely to match the North American direct <b>distance</b> <b>dial</b> standard of a three-digit area code and seven-digit local number. The names, usually chosen from standard Bell System lists, had no local significance and were short-lived; phase-out began soon after 1960.|$|R
50|$|In the United States and Canada, the Bell System network {{topology}} was the switching system hierarchy implemented and operated {{from the late}} 1940s to the 1980s {{for the purpose of}} integrating the diverse array of local telephone companies and telephone numbering plans to achieve nationwide Direct <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialing</b> (DDD) by telephone subscribers. It was the precursor of the world-wide interconnected public switched telephone network (PSTN).|$|R
25|$|In December 1930, New York City {{became the}} first city in the United States to adopt the two-letter, five-number format (2L-5N), which became the {{standard}} after World War II, when the Bell System administration designed the North American Numbering Plan to prepare the United States and Canada for Direct <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialing</b> (DDD), and began to convert all central offices to this format. This process was complete by the early 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Before direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> (DDD) all long-distance {{calls were}} {{established}} by special switchboard operators (long-distance operators) even in exchanges where calls within the local exchange were dialed directly. Completion of long-distance calls was time-consuming and costly as each call was handled by multiple operators in multiple cities. Record keeping was also more complex, as {{the duration of}} every toll call had to be manually recorded for billing purposes.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, as this seven-digit {{numbering}} {{was gradually}} implemented throughout the continent (being standard {{in all but}} the most isolated or rural areas by 1970), and Direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> was introduced to customers, the switching system could determine, from the second digit dialed (or the second digit that followed the trunk code), whether the call was being dialed as seven digits (without an area code) or ten digits (with an area code).|$|R
50|$|In December 1930, New York City {{became the}} first city in the United States to adopt the two-letter, five-number format (2L-5N), which became the {{standard}} after World War II, when the Bell System administration designed the North American Numbering Plan to prepare the United States and Canada for Direct <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialing</b> (DDD), and began to convert all central offices to this format. This process was complete by the early 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Nominally, northwestern Quebec‚Äîone of the {{few areas}} of North America without {{telephone}} service‚Äîwas shifted to 418 from 514 in 1957. From the 1950s to the 1970s, 418 was also nominally the area code for the eastern Northwest Territories. However, in the 1970s, as direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialling</b> {{was introduced to the}} far northern and western portions of 418, these points were shifted to area code 819, leaving the present area.|$|R
50|$|New Brunswick and Newfoundland {{were split}} from 902 to area code 506 in 1955. Newfoundland and Labrador split off {{as its own}} area code, 709, in early 1962. Canadian direct <b>distance</b> <b>dial</b> {{locations}} came on-line gradually during the next several years, beginning with the largest cities (Montr√©al and Toronto) in 1958. The area codes served mostly for operator routing purposes until customer <b>dialling</b> of long <b>distance</b> calls became commonplace in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Operator Toll Dialing {{eliminated}} {{the need for}} intermediate and inward operators to complete toll calls to distant central offices. Initially this system involved step-by-step routings to set up each circuit, but later was improved {{by the development of}} area codes with machine translation which helped to standardize dialing across the network. The system was implemented in the USA beginning in 1946 and was gradually superseded by Direct <b>Distance</b> <b>Dialing</b> (DDD) by 1965.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{telephone}} network was that, in most cases, direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialing</b> for long-distance calls was not possible. Although area codes were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for local calls and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.|$|R
50|$|The initial area codes {{were created}} in 1947 as routing codes for operator-assisted calls. Qu√©bec and Ontario were the only provinces that {{received}} multiple area codes. Quebec was split between area codes 514 and 418. 514 originally covered the entire western half of Quebec, from the Canada-US border to the Hudson Strait. This area nominally included several remote areas in the far northern portion of the province which, at the time, didn't have telephone service. The first Bell System direct <b>distance</b> <b>dial</b> call was made in 1951, from Englewood, New Jersey to Alameda, California, using a system based on fixed-length area codes plus seven-digit local numbers. Montreal and Toronto, the largest Canadian cities, were six digits (2L+4N) at the time. Between 1951 and 1958, numbers were lengthened by adding a digit (2L+5N) in preparation for deployment of direct <b>distance</b> <b>dialling.</b> The 514 area code was split in 1957 to create area code 819 for most of western Quebec, from Estrie (Sherbrooke) to the Ontario border, with the then-unserved far northern portion nominally added to 418 (and later moved to 819). 514 was reduced to the region surrounding Montreal.|$|R
