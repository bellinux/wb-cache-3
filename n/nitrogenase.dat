5|$|A {{vanadium}} <b>nitrogenase</b> {{is used by}} some nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms, such as Azotobacter. In this role, vanadium replaces {{more common}} molybdenum or iron, and gives the <b>nitrogenase</b> slightly different properties.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fixing {{carbon dioxide in}} photosynthesis, some bacteria also fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme <b>nitrogenase.</b> This environmentally important trait {{can be found in}} most bacteria of the metabolic types listed above.|$|E
5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons <b>nitrogenase</b> enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived {{in large quantities}} in Earth's air and water, organisms that continued to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions isolated and protected their nitrogen-fixing enzymes from too much oxygen in heterocysts or equivalent structures. This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation reactions in aerobic organisms continues to the present.|$|E
50|$|Vanadium <b>nitrogenases</b> {{have also}} been shown to catalzye the {{conversion}} of CO into alkanes through a reaction comparable to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.|$|R
50|$|The iron-molybdenum {{cofactor}} (FeMoco) of <b>nitrogenases</b> {{contains an}} Fe6C unit {{and is an}} example of an interstitial carbide found in biology.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nitrogenases</b> are enzymes (...) {{that are}} {{produced}} by certain bacteria, such as cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). These enzymes {{are responsible for the}} reduction of nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3). <b>Nitrogenases</b> are the only family of enzymes known to catalyze this reaction, which is a key step in the process of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation is required for all forms of life, with nitrogen being essential for the biosynthesis of molecules (nucleotides, amino acids) that create plants, animals and other organisms.|$|R
5|$|Azotobacter {{produces}} pigments. For example, Azotobacter chroococcum forms a dark-brown water-soluble pigment melanin. This process {{occurs at}} high levels of metabolism during the fixation of nitrogen, and is thought to protect the <b>nitrogenase</b> system from oxygen. Other Azotobacter species produce pigments from yellow-green to purple colors, including a green pigment which fluoresces with a yellow-green light and a pigment with blue-white fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} a dinitrogen complex to be {{discovered}} was 2+ (see figure at right), and soon many other such complexes were discovered. These complexes, in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one {{lone pair of electrons}} to a central metal cation, illustrate how N2 might bind to the metal(s) in <b>nitrogenase</b> and the catalyst for the Haber process: these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role of molybdenum in living organisms is as a metal heteroatom at the active site in certain enzymes. In bacterial nitrogen fixation, the <b>nitrogenase</b> enzyme involved in the terminal step of reducing molecular nitrogen usually contains molybdenum in the active site (though replacement of molybdenum with iron or vanadium is also known). The structure of the catalytic center of the enzyme {{is similar to that}} in iron-sulfur proteins: it incorporates a Fe4S3 and multiple MoFe3S3 clusters.|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{affects the}} {{expression}} of the three different <b>nitrogenases</b> in Azotobacter vinelandii. Molybdenum repressed the vnfH and anfH operons relatively more at 30 °C than at 20 °C; at 14 °C molybdenum did not repress these genes at all. Similarly, V repressed the anf operon at 30 °C but not at 20 or 14 °C. Mo was poorly transported into cells grown at the lower temperatures. A. vinelandii thus has the potential to synthesize any of the three <b>nitrogenases</b> at 14 to 20 °C regardless of the presence of Mo or V...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation, catalyzed by <b>nitrogenases,</b> {{contributes about}} half of the nitrogen needed to global agriculture. For forty years synthetic chemists and theoreticians have tried to understand and model the structure and function of this important metalloenzyme. Ten years after the first report on the crystal structure of the MoFe protein, scientists still {{have not been able to}} synthesize a chemical equivalent of the FeMo cofactor nor the structure knowledge revealed the key to its catalytic activity. This paper with 104 references presents a review of the most relevant advances in chemical nitrogen fixation and their relation with the <b>nitrogenases...</b>|$|R
5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include <b>nitrogenase,</b> the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E
25|$|Cysteine is an {{important}} source of sulfide in human metabolism. The sulfide in iron-sulfur clusters and in <b>nitrogenase</b> is extracted from cysteine, which is converted to alanine in the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{enzyme that}} {{converts}} protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide is protochlorophyllide reductase, EC 1.3.1.33. There are two structurally unrelated proteins with this activity: the light-dependent and the dark-operative. The light-dependent reductase needs light to operate. The dark-operative version {{is a completely}} different protein, consisting of three subunits that exhibit significant sequence similarity to the three subunits of <b>nitrogenase,</b> which catalyzes the formation of ammonia from dinitrogen. This enzyme might be evolutionary older but (being similar to <b>nitrogenase)</b> is highly sensitive to free oxygen and does not work if its concentration exceeds about 3%. Hence, the alternative, light-dependent version needed to evolve.|$|E
40|$|Phenolic acids {{are one of}} {{the many}} {{secondary}} metabolites causing toxic upon the growth and development of plant. Phenolic acids are produced by plant and subsequently released into soil, and appears to be involved in biochemical interaction between plants and other living organisms in soil. The research was conducted to study the effect of various kinds and doses of phenolic acids on <b>nitrogenases</b> activities and cholorophyll content of mungbean. Research was done in the glass house of Soil Science Departemen, Faculty of Agriculture, Gadjah Mada University (GMU) from April to June 2004. The experiment was arranged by randomized block design in three replications. The treatment consist of four kinds phenolic acid i. e. vanilic, p-coumaric, ferulic and p- 1 hydroxybenzoic with concentration at 250, 500, 1000 and 1500 mg kg-Â respectively. One treatment was without phenolic acids as control. Result indicated that phenolic acids could reduce <b>nitrogenases</b> activities and chlorophyll content up to 53. 35 % and 29. 98 % respectively. The toxicity of p-hydroxybenzoic against both <b>nitrogenases</b> activities and chlorophyll content was higher than other phenolic acids...|$|R

A. cylindrica fraction I protein complemented fraction II protein from C. ethylicum. However, the reciprocal cross between C. ethylicum fraction I and A. cylindrica fraction II was negative...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{molybdenum}} cofactor (pictured) {{is composed}} of a molybdenum-free organic complex called molybdopterin, which has bound an oxidized molybdenum(VI) atom through adjacent sulfur (or occasionally selenium) atoms. Except for the ancient <b>nitrogenases,</b> all known Mo-using enzymes use this cofactor.|$|R
25|$|Other organisms require {{additional}} metals as enzyme cofactors, such as vanadium in the <b>nitrogenase</b> of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria {{of the genus}} Azotobacter, tungsten in the aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase of the thermophilic archaean Pyrococcus furiosus, and even cadmium in the carbonic anhydrase from the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii.|$|E
25|$|Leghemoglobin: In leguminous plants, such as alfalfa or soybeans, the {{nitrogen}} fixing {{bacteria in the}} roots are protected from oxygen by this iron heme containing oxygen-binding protein. The specific enzyme protected is <b>nitrogenase,</b> which is unable to reduce nitrogen gas {{in the presence of}} free oxygen.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} is strongly exothermic, so the equilibrium constant decreases with temperature. However, {{a temperature of}} around 400°C is {{required in order to}} achieve a reasonable rate of reaction with currently available catalysts. Formation of ammonia is also favoured by high pressure, as the volume decreases when the reaction takes place. It {{is interesting to note that}} the same reaction, nitrogen fixation, occurs at ambient temperatures in nature, when the catalyst is an enzyme such as <b>nitrogenase.</b> Much energy is needed initially to break the nitrogen–nitrogen triple bond even though the overall {{reaction is}} exothermic.|$|E
50|$|The only molybdenum-containing {{enzymes that}} do not feature molydopterins are the <b>nitrogenases</b> (enzymes that fix nitrogen). These contain an iron-sulfur center of a very {{different}} type, which also usually contains molybdenum. However, if molybdenum is present, it is directly bonded to other metal atoms.|$|R
50|$|All {{biological}} {{nitrogen fixation}} is done by way of metalloenzymes called <b>nitrogenases.</b> These enzymes contain iron, often with a second metal, usually molybdenum but sometimes vanadium. Microorganisms that can fix nitrogen are prokaryotes (both bacteria and archaea, distributed throughout their respective Domains) called diazotrophs. Some higher plants, and some animals (termites), have formed associations (symbiosis) with diazotrophs.|$|R
40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation {{is the primary}} source of new N in terrestrial arctic ecosystems and is fundamental to the long-term productivity of arctic plant communities. Still, relatively {{little is known about the}} nitrogen-fixing microbes that inhabit the soils of many dominant vegetation types. Our objective was to determine which diazotrophs are associated with three common, woody, perennial plants in an arctic glacial lowland. Dryas integrifolia, Salix arctica, and Cassiope tetragona plants in soil were collected at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island, Canada. DNA was extracted from soil and root samples and a 383 -bp fragment of the nifH gene amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Cloned genotypes were screened for similarity by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Nine primary RFLP phylotypes were identified and 42 repre-sentative genotypes selected for sequencing. Majority of sequences (33) were type I <b>nitrogenases,</b> whereas the remaining sequences belonged to the divergent, homol-ogous, type IV group. Within the type I <b>nitrogenases,</b> nifH genes from posited members of the Firmicutes were most abundant, and occurred in root and soil samples from all three plant species. nifH genes from posited Pseudomonads were found to be more closely associated with C. tetragona, whereas nifH genes from putative alpha-Proteobacteria were more commonly associated with D. integrifolia and S. arctica. In addition, 12 clones likely representing a unique clade within the type I <b>nitrogenases</b> were identified. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report on the nifH diversity of arctic plant-associated soil microbes...|$|R
25|$|A {{classic example}} of {{mutualism}} is the interaction between rhizobia soil bacteria and legumes (Fabaceae). In this interaction, rhizobia bacteria induce root nodule formation in legume plants via an exchange of molecular signals. Within the root nodules, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the <b>nitrogenase</b> enzyme. The legume benefits from a new supply of usable nitrogen from the rhizobia, and the rhizobia benefits from organic acid energy sources from the plant {{as well as the}} protection provided by the root nodule. Since the rhizobia live within the legume, {{this is an example of}} endosymbiosis, and since both the bacteria and the plant can survive independently, it is also an example of facultative symbiosis.|$|E
500|$|<b>Nitrogenase</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation. Azotobacter species have several types of <b>nitrogenase.</b> The basic one is molybdenum-iron <b>nitrogenase.</b> An alternative type contains vanadium; it is independent of molybdenum ions and is more active than the Mo-Fe <b>nitrogenase</b> at low temperatures. So it can fix nitrogen at temperatures as low as 5°C, and its low-temperature activity is 10 times higher than that of Mo-Fe <b>nitrogenase.</b> An important role in maturation of Mo-Fe <b>nitrogenase</b> plays the so-called P-cluster. Synthesis of <b>nitrogenase</b> is controlled by the nif genes. Nitrogen fixation is regulated by the enhancer protein NifA and the [...] "sensor" [...] flavoprotein NifL which modulates the activation of gene transcription of nitrogen fixation by redox-dependent switching. This regulatory mechanism, relying on two proteins forming complexes with each other, is uncommon for other systems.|$|E
500|$|Root nodules {{containing}} Rhizobium bacteria {{have been}} found on R. regia trees in India. [...] The presence of rhizobia-containing root nodules is usually associated with nitrogen fixation in legumes; {{this was the first}} record of root nodules in a monocotyledonous tree. [...] Further evidence of nitrogen fixation was provided by the presence of <b>nitrogenase</b> (an enzyme used in nitrogen fixation) and leghaemoglobin, a compound which allows <b>nitrogenase</b> to function by reducing the oxygen concentration in the root nodule. [...] In addition to evidence of nitrogen fixation, the nodules were also found to be producing indole acetic acid, an important plant hormone.|$|E
50|$|They are {{significant}} contributions {{to the understanding of}} the function and structure of important metal-sulphur proteins such as ferredoxins, <b>nitrogenases</b> and metallothioneins. An important recent research project concerns the synthesis and practical development of novel platinum complexes as possible antitumor agents. Bernt Krebs was able to develop a number of highly interesting new compounds with promising properties, e.g., without nephrotoxic side effects.|$|R
25|$|In certain organisms, ammonia is {{produced}} from atmospheric nitrogen by enzymes called <b>nitrogenases.</b> The overall process is called nitrogen fixation. Although {{it is unlikely}} that biomimetic methods that are competitive with the Haber process will be developed, intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation. The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe7MoS9 ensemble.|$|R
50|$|Diazotrophs are {{scattered}} across bacterial taxonomic groups (mostly in the Bacteria {{but also a}} couple of Archaea). Even within a species that can fix nitrogen there may be strains that do not fix nitrogen. Fixation is shut off when other sources of nitrogen are available, and, for many species, when oxygen is at high partial pressure. Bacteria have different {{ways of dealing with}} the debilitating effects of oxygen on <b>nitrogenases,</b> listed below.|$|R
500|$|Azotobacter {{species have}} {{a full range of}} enzymes needed to perform the {{nitrogen}} fixation: ferredoxin, hydrogenase, and an important enzyme <b>nitrogenase.</b> The process of nitrogen fixation requires an influx of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate. Nitrogen fixation is highly sensitive to the presence of oxygen, so Azotobacter developed a special defensive mechanism against oxygen, namely a significant intensification of metabolism that reduces the concentration of oxygen in the cells. Also, a special nitrogenase-protective protein [...] protects <b>nitrogenase</b> and is involved in protecting the cells from oxygen. Mutants not producing this protein are killed by oxygen during nitrogen fixation {{in the absence of a}} nitrogen source in the medium. Homocitrate ions play a certain role in the processes of nitrogen fixation by Azotobacter. position in MoFe-protein of Azotobacter vinelandii ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} and activity of nitrogenases is very highly regulated, both because nitrogen fixation {{is an extremely}} energetically expensive process (16–24 ATP are used per [...] fixed) and due to the extreme sensitivity of the <b>nitrogenase</b> to oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} can {{be found}} distributed throughout nearly all bacterial lineages and physiological classes but is not a universal property. [...] Because the enzyme <b>nitrogenase,</b> responsible for nitrogen fixation, is very sensitive to oxygen which will inhibit it irreversibly, all nitrogen-fixing organisms must possess some mechanism to keep the concentration of oxygen low.

5000|$|In {{animals and}} plants these enzymes use {{molybdenum}} bound at the active site in a tricyclic molybdenum cofactor.
