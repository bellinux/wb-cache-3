We find that <b>net</b> <b>official</b> flows have a large but plausible effect on current account balances.

40|$|Portfolio {{investment}} has {{played an important}} role in the rapid growth of Asia’s emerging economies. It has also played a key — if uncertain — role in the Asian Crisis; and is expected to play a significant role in Asia’s recovery and restructuring. Therefore understanding portfolio investment behaviour and key factors shaping such behaviour, could make an important contribution to an understanding of Asia’s sustainable recovery. To put this in context, total net portfolio equity investment in emerging markets stood in 1996, just prior to the crisis, at $ 33. 7 billion, or approximately 4. 6 times <b>net</b> <b>official</b> flows. For Asia/Pacific emerging economies net portfolio equity investment in 1996 was $ 17. 2 billion, or over 2. 7 times <b>net</b> <b>official</b> flows.

This paper uses QUEST III, a multi-region global DSGE model, to study the macroeconomic effects of a gradual equalization of official foreign reserves between dollars and euros. We simulate a scenario of a shift in the composition of foreign reserves holdings from the present ratio of 65 percent dollars and 25 percent euros to equal 45 percent shares over a 10 years period. We assume imperfect substitutability between financial assets to allow this shift to have real effects.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{stability}} of international macroeconomic policies of developing countries in the post-Bretton Woods period. We use the simple geometry of the classic, open-economy trilemma to construct a new, univariate measure of inter- national macroeconomic policy stability, and to characterize international macroeconomic arrangements {{in terms of their}} semblance to definitive policy archetypes; and, we use the trilemma constraint to provide a new gauge of monetary sovereignty. Using these measures, we find that the greatest international macroeconomic stability among developing economies exists where there are capital controls and limited exchange rate flexibility. The least stable policies occur in the economies with flexible exchange rates and open financial markets. We also find that <b>official</b> <b>holdings</b> of foreign exchange re- serves seem to be weakly linked to greater policy stability, and their link is further weakened where financial markets are open.

The new stability gauge reflects the simultaneity of a country’s choices of exchange rate fixity, financial openness, and monetary sovereignty.

We use the new stability gauge in nonlinear panel estimates to examine the post- Bretton Woods period, and we find that trilemma policy stability is linked to <b>official</b> <b>holdings</b> of foreign exchange reserves in low income countries.

In this paper we investigate whether aid has affected the political regime of recipient countries. To this end, we use annual data on <b>Net</b> <b>Official</b> Development Assistance covering 64 aid-recipients. Because of data limitations, we cover the 1967 – 2002 period. We find that aid flows decreased the likelihood of observing a democratic regime in a recipient country. This effect is sensitive to economic and social conditions.
