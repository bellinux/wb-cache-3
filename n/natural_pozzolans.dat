Por ejemplo, hormigones con 33 % de puzolanas en reemplazo del cemento presentaron una resistencia a compresión 27 % inferior a la del hormigón sin puzolanas; sin embargo, su impermeabilidad fue aproximadamente 200 % superior a las de los hormigones sin puzolanas. Los ensayos de permeabilidad a iones cloruro y absorción capilar, presentaron baja variabilidad y buena correlación con las reacciones puzolánicas.

40|$|The {{challenge}} for the civil engineering community {{in the near future}} will be to realize the building of structures in harmony with the concept of sustainable development, through the use of high performance materials which have low environmental impact and can be produced at reasonable cost. Geopolymers are novel binder materials that could provide a route towards this objective. Although research on geopolymer has advanced, most of the previous research conducted on geopolymers has dealt with pastes and concentrated on the material's chemistry and microstructure. There is little information available concerning the engineering and durability properties of geopolymer concrete and none considering the use of <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolans</b> for production of geopolymer concrete. This investigation has studied the potential of using five <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolans</b> from Iran as geopolymer precursors. Most of the raw materials contain zeolites and clay minerals and have a high loss on ignition. Therefore, trials were made where samples were calcined at 700, 800 and 900 °C. The solubility of both the raw and calcined materials in an alkaline solution was used as an indicator for pozzolanic activity. Improvements in pozzolanic properties due to heat treatment and elevated curing temperatures (20, 40, 60, and 80 °C) were studied by using alkali solubility, XRD and compressive strength tests. It has been found that geopolymer binders can be synthesized by activating <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolans</b> and condensing them with sodium silicate in a highly alkaline environment. A new model is presented which allows the prediction of the alkali activated pozzolan strength from information on their crystallinity, chemical compositions and alkali solubility. Two types of Iranian <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolans,</b> namely Taftan which can be activated without calcination and Shahindej which was calcined were selected for further activation to study the effect of the alkaline medium on the strength of the alkali-activated natural pozzolan. The effect of the type, form, and concentration (molarities = 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 M) of the alkaline hydroxide, the modulus of sodium silicate (Si 02 INa 20 ratio = 2. 1, 2. 4, 3. 1) and different curing conditions on the geopolymerisation of the above two <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolans</b> were studied. The optimum range and contributions for each factor is suggested based on their effect on compressive strength. An optimum paste formulation has been developed for concrete mixing together with the procedure of addition of the raw materials to the reaction mixture and suitable curing methods for producing the geopolymer concrete derived from them. The properties of this geopolymer concrete in both the fresh and hardened states have been investigated in terms of setting time, workability, air content, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, static modulus of elasticity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and drying shrinkage. Studies related to durability such as gas permeability, chloride ion penetration, and sulphate resistance have been undertaken and compared to these for typical OPC concretes. Some problems were encountered in applying the standard concrete durability tests.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{kinetics}} of geopolymerisation in an inorganic polymeric binder {{based on a}} <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolan.</b> The heat released by the exothermic geopolymerisation reaction process is monitored under isothermal temperature conditions, maintained in a differential scanning calorimeter using a water circulation cell. Calorimetric data are obtained isothermally at 65, 75, and 85 °C with various Na 2 O/Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 /Na 2 O molar ratios and in the presence and absence of small amounts of calcium aluminate cement (used as an efflorescence control admixture in these binder systems). The first stage of reaction, which is rapid and strongly exothermic, is shortened as the temperature increases. The total heat of reaction increases in the mixes containing calcium aluminate cement, but the apparent activation energy calculated using a pseudo-first-order reaction model is lower than without added calcium aluminate cement. At a constant overall SiO 2 /Na 2 O molar ratio, the apparent activation energy is decreased as the Na 2 O/Al 2 O 3 molar ratio increases. Calcium aluminate cement, therefore, reduces the minimum energy required to initiate geopolymerisation reactions of this <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolan</b> and facilitates {{the progress of the}} reactions which lead to formation of a cementitious product...|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{different}} amounts of lime and <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolan</b> on geotechnical properties of a silty sand soil has been investigated. To do this, 20 treatments were prepared with adding five lime levels of 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 % (by weight) and four levels of pozzolan including; 0, 5, 10 and 15 %. Compaction characteristics, compressive strength and bearing capacity of the treatments were determined using standard test procedures. For evaluation of compressive strength, cylindrical specimens (3.5  cm in diameter and 7  cm in length) were made and cured for three different ages including 7, 14 and 28  days in three replication. Result of compaction tests showed that adding of both lime and pozzolan alone and with together increase optimum moisture content and decrease the maximum dry density of treated soil samples. Statistical analysis using SPSS software showed that although adding of <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolan</b> and lime to the soil increases the compressive strength significantly, but adding of them with together is more effective. So that the compressive strength of a treatment having 3 % lime and 15 % pozzolan {{was found to be}} 16 times of untreated sample. Furthermore, the results of California Bearing Ratio, CBR test showed that the values of CBR in different treatment increased up to 12 times of untreated sample.|$|R
40|$|The use of pozzolans offers {{promising}} {{signs for}} a change in the cement industry. <b>Pozzolan</b> in its <b>natural</b> and artificial forms can be used to improve cement properties or to synthesize new cement. This study investigates the use of pozzolans in portland cement concrete and inorganic polymer mortar (geopolymer mortar). This thesis is divided into two phases. Phase 1 investigates the use of <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolan</b> as a partial replacement of portland cement in concrete. In this phase two types of class N pozzolan are used separately to develop concrete mixtures contain different percentages of class N pozzolan. Fresh concrete properties are evaluated along with hardened concretes properties. The properties of the new concretes are compared to those of a control concrete mixture made without the use of pozzolan. Phase 2 focuses on synthesizing geopolymer mortars using artificial pozzolan as well as <b>natural</b> <b>pozzolan</b> in two separate applications. The pozzolan was used as a base material to synthesize the geopolymer binder. An alkaline solution and heat curing were deployed to enhance the polymerization process. Geopolymer mortars were synthesized using different alkaline solutions and curing temperatures. Some of the geopolymer mortar specimens then were exposed to 800 °C to study the geopolymer mortars resistance to heat. Factors that affect the geopolymer mortars properties were investigated. Geopolymer mortars properties were evaluated before and after they were exposed to 800 °C...|$|R
