40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the consequences of}} the adoption of a <b>new</b> <b>pension</b> system that considers the number of children born in Austria. Combining a demographic family <b>model</b> with a <b>pension</b> <b>model</b> and cost profiles of social security expenditures, a policy simulation tool is obtained which allows the testing of different social security policies. The feasibility of the suggested pension reform is examined on both the system level and the individual level to determine under which circumstances such a policy is reasonable and affordable. The first conclusion is that the <b>new</b> <b>pension</b> system would be cost neutral. Secondly, provided a certain response to the pronatalist character of the new system {{in the form of an}} increase in fertility, the performance of the social security system would improve. Thirdly, the new system would significantly change the income distribution of retired women to the extent that single and divorced women with children are no longer discriminated. Thus, the emancipatory goal of the policy is fulfilled...|$|R

40|$|In this Working {{paper we}} {{summarized}} research activities undertaken during {{further development of}} the <b>pension</b> <b>model.</b> Substantial part of time was devoted to {{the completion of the}} pension module. With constructed matrix of the conditions for old-age retirement for both genders separately, the module enables simulation of the continuation of the reform of the existing pension system, which will be fully implemented by 2024. An additional sub-module was added that allows simulation of the system of notional accounts. The next very important step in developing the model was the integration of all developed modules into a single system that allows the use of dynamics. In parallel, developed graphic interface in practice links the modules into a microsimulation <b>pension</b> <b>model</b> as well as links the two <b>models</b> - <b>pension</b> <b>model</b> and model of generational accounts. At the same time, it allows independent work with each module separately, as well as the work with the basic data stored in a data warehouse. Developed simulation platform enables elimination of restrictions on the applicability of the static micro-simulation model and generational accounts model arising from a static approach and the cohort level. It is in fact the result of the necessity to adequately adapt both tools to be able to provide a quality assessment of the proposed changes of the pension system. Developed simulation platform represents the first such tool and provides the first dynamic microsimulation <b>pension</b> <b>model</b> developed in Slovenia. nrpages: 77 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The EU Open {{method of}} Coordination (OMC) {{represents}} one strategy for pension reform that ideally combines agreement on common objectives with different institutional and national approaches as means of reaching these objectives. This paper {{will focus on}} the OMC in pensions, seen as representing a pension policy discourse, and how it relates to national pension policy in three particular countries; two member states; Germany and the UK and one non-member country; Norway. Each of the three countries represents different welfare state and <b>pension</b> <b>models,</b> i. e. the Bismarck-, the Beveridge-, and the Nordic model respectively. Two key questions are addressed: Does the OMC process promote a particular kind of <b>pension</b> system <b>model</b> through its goal of providing adequate, sustainable and modernized pensions? How does it compare to and does it challenge existing national systems as found in the three selected cases in terms of their institutional and normative foundations? In addition the paper briefly discusses in what way the OMC in pension potentially impact national pension debates and reforms. The empirical material applied for analysis focuses mainly on the National Strategy Reports and the Joint reports by the Commission and the Council. Theoretically an institutional perspective is followed stressing the interaction between different institutions of pension provision and the adhering discourses surrounding these institutions. Thus, institutions are seen as instruments for solving problems (for instance income security in old age) {{and at the same time}} they are expressing a normative content inherent in their specific solutions. In this way each pension pillar (seen as an institution) contains its own more or less particular discourse. This paper distinguishes between three particular discourses: Social right-, status security-, and a private pension discourse. Analysing the OMC pension discourse as laid out in the Joint reports, the following key elements are identified: Firstly, the issue of financial sustainability takes precedence over the goal of adequacy. To obtain sustainability there is a need to raise employment rates and to stem growth in public pension expenditures. Secondly, this argumentation implies a <b>new</b> division of <b>pension</b> pillars by increasing the role of occupational and private pensions. In addition, it entails internal normative changes of pension pillars by strengthening traits known from private pension insurance. Thirdly, the goal of adequacy is shaped by the financial sustainability discourse and its focus on public pension expenditures. Fourthly, seen as a <b>pension</b> <b>model</b> the OMC on pensions promotes a hybrid <b>model</b> of <b>pension</b> provision containing elements from all three pension systems, but with the important qualification that it is really «hybridization with a bias». This means that the <b>model</b> represents a <b>new</b> <b>pension</b> blend that contains fewest traits from the Bismarckian model and with more prominence to elements known from multi-pillar systems as well as minimum pension guarantees as found in the new postreform Nordic model. From this follows that this hybrid <b>pension</b> <b>model</b> has various implications in terms of challenges to national paradigms: In the German case we find a clear move away from public first pillar provision and increasing reliance on second and third pillar provision. In addition, focus on minimum security challenge the status security orientation of the German system. For the UK there is no confrontation in terms of financial sustainability, implying a continuance of the tradition of pension privatisation, and providing a complex system of means tested benefits to secure minimum security. For the Norwegian case the hybrid OMC paradigm represents a challenge in terms of increasing reliance on occupational pension provision in providing standard security and by containing future public pension spending...|$|R

40|$|The {{pension system}} in Sweden {{underwent}} {{a dramatic change}} during the 1990 s. Replacing the traditional welfare model of {{a more or less}} collective solution for all Swedes, an individual-focused <b>pension</b> <b>model</b> was launched in 2000. As one part of this <b>new</b> <b>pension</b> system, Swedes were given the possibility to place their future pension assets in commercial stock and interest funds, which are supervised by the government. The pensions in Sweden are nowadays on the market. The old pension system was labeled "the greatest victory for the [Swedish] workers' movement" when the decision to introduce it followed the referendum in 1957. The new system has been called "a victory of popular capitalism" and is seen as "a world away" from the traditional Swedish model of collectivism. The <b>new</b> <b>pension</b> system has been accompanied by a creation of a new governmental agency, the Premium Pension Authority. The Authority is responsible for the maintenance of the fund system, and functions as a filter between the citizens and the commercial fund companies. The Authority is also expected to provide information about the new model to the Swedes. During the first four years of the pension system, a large body of texts has been produced and delivered to the Swedish citizens. A large website has also been constructed, with detailed information on it. This paper deals with the expected shift of responsibility from the State to the individual via what I call the domestication of pension funds. The texts of the Premium Pension Authority are meant to be informative and instructive and they carry themes of individualization and appeal of pension funds. By using methods of corpus linguistics, it is possible to describe the ways of addressing the reader in the texts and also show how the reader is constructed in them (a "Model Reader"). Additionally, the analysis of verbs and verb forms that are attributed to the Model Reader permits a scrutiny of the presupposed actions of such Reader. The analysis is applied to a collected body of texts from the Premium Pension Authority. The themes of domestication and individualization are seen as textual strategies used by the Authority...|$|R
