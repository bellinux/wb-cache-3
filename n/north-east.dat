5|$|After marrying Robin Petyarre, {{brother of}} artist Gloria Petyarre, Josepha Petrick {{moved to the}} region of Utopia, <b>north-east</b> of Alice Springs, which is where she was living when she began {{painting}} around 1990. They had seven children, one of whom, Damien Petrick, {{went on to become}} an artist like his mother. By 2008, Josie Petrick's husband had died, and Petrick was dividing her time between Alice Springs and Harts Range, to its <b>north-east.</b>|$|E
5|$|A. n. nisus, the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{was described}} by Linnaeus in 1758. It breeds from Europe and west Asia to western Siberia and Iran; northern populations winter south to the Mediterranean, <b>north-east</b> Africa, Arabia and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are {{widespread}} and often abundant in north and <b>north-east</b> Australia, especially <b>north-east</b> Queensland, and are common {{as far south}} as Victoria. They are also found in southern New Guinea and as rare vagrants in New Zealand and the northern part of Western Australia. The population in northern Australia is estimated at between 20,000 and 100,000 birds and in southern Australia, 1,000 birds. The numbers of individuals in New Guinea are unknown. Until 1961, Brolgas were thought to be the only species of crane in Australia, until the Sarus Crane showed up.|$|E

5|$|In response, {{steps were}} taken to better protect the tankers from attack, but losses {{continued}} to mount until, in April 1942, they were banned by the Navy from operating the <b>north-east</b> sea routes. The government and industry took steps to maximise {{the use of the}} railroads, increasing the amount of oil carried on them more than ten-fold, but there were shortages of rail tank cars, and the existing fleet of cars was in poor condition. Instead, the United States government began to examine options for the use of pipelines to fulfil the demand for petroleum in the <b>north-east.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{the route}} that {{eventually}} became the Victoria line {{date from the}} 1940s. A proposal for a new underground railway line linking <b>north-east</b> London with the centre {{was included in the}} County of London Plan in 1943. Between 1946 and 1954, a series of routes were proposed by different transport authorities to connect various places in south and north or <b>north-east</b> London. Each of these connected the three main line termini at King's Cross, Euston and Victoria. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962.|$|E

5|$|The <b>north-east</b> and north-west towers, {{now only}} one-storey tall, {{were covered with}} turf, turning {{the rear of the}} outer ward into a flat, grassed esplanade. The {{southern}} tower was reduced in height to two storeys, but remained in use as a gun platform. The covered corridors between the keep and the towers were now one-storey high as well, linking to the buried towers in the <b>north-east</b> and north-west bastions. The upper storeys of the gatehouse were rebuilt, although the ground floor remained in its 16th-century condition.|$|E
5|$|The <b>north-east</b> {{coast of}} the United States {{depended}} on these supplies of oil, importing both crude and refined products. Across most of Texas, there had been little interest in building pipelines to transport oil, and petroleum was typically moved from the south-west to the <b>north-east</b> coast using a mixture of sea freight and railroad transport. In early 1941, 70,000 barrels of oil were moved on the railroads each day, but this method was expensive, and {{the bulk of the}} oil was moved using barges, some with a capacity of up to 15,000 barrels, operating up and down rivers and the Atlantic Coast.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{man-made}} waterways, or Lodes nearby, including Wicken Lode and Soham Lode. Researchers suggest the Fenland Lodes are Roman in origin—almost certainly Soham Lode. Other researchers disagree, presenting {{a case for}} such lodes being Anglo-Saxon or later. The Thetford catchwater (drain), constructed in 1838, runs south-west to <b>north-east</b> around {{the eastern edge of}} the built-up part of the village. It drains by gravity, into the River Great Ouse <b>north-east</b> of the village, at the Braham Dock drain.|$|E
5|$|Wells is {{situated}} at the junction of three numbered routes. The A39 goes <b>north-east</b> to Bath and south-west to Glastonbury and Bridgwater.

Wells is served by FirstGroup bus services to Bristol, Bristol Temple Meads, Bath, Frome, Shepton Mallet, Yeovil, Street, Bridgwater, Taunton, Burnham on Sea and Weston-super-Mare, {{as well as providing}} some local service. Some National Express coach services call at Wells. The bus station is in Princes Road.
