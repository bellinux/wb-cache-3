40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the economy-wide {{implications}} of a carbon tax applied on the Chilean electricity generation sector. In order to analyse the macroeconomic impacts, both an energy sectorial model and a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model have been used. During the year 2014 a carbon tax of 5 US$/tCO 2 e was approved in Chile. This tax and its increases (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 US$/tCO 2 e) are evaluated in this article. The {{results show that the}} effectiveness of this policy depends on some variables which are not controlled by policy makers, for example, <b>non-conventional</b> renewable <b>energy</b> investment cost projections, natural gas prices, and the feasibility of exploiting hydroelectric resources. For a carbon tax of 20 US$/tCO 2 e, the average annual emission reduction would be between 1. 1 and 9. 1 million tCO 2 e. However, the price of the electricity would increase between 8. 3 and 9. 6 US$/MWh. This price shock would decrease the annual GDP growth rate by a maximum amount of 0. 13 %. This article compares this energy policy with others such as the introduction of <b>non-conventional</b> renewable <b>energy</b> sources and a sectorial cap. The results show that the same global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction can be obtained with these policies, but the impact on the electricity price and GDP are lower than that of the carbon tax...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{the need for the}} design of more {{sustainable}} processes and the development of alternative reaction routes to reduce the environmental impact of the chemical industry has gained vital importance. Main objectives especially regard the use of renewable raw materials, the exploitation of alternative energy sources, the design of inherently safe processes and of integrated reaction/separation technologies (e. g. microreactors and membranes), the process intensification, the reduction of waste and the development of new catalytic pathways. The present PhD thesis reports results derived during a three years research period at the School of Chemical Sciences of Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Dept. of Industrial Chemistry and Materials (now Dept. of Industrial Chemistry “Toso Montanari”), under the supervision of Prof. Fabrizio Cavani (Catalytic Processes Development Group). Three research projects in the field of heterogeneous acid catalysis focused on potential industrial applications were carried out. The main project, regarding the conversion of lignocellulosic materials to produce monosaccharides (important intermediates for production of biofuels and bioplatform molecules) was financed and carried out in collaboration with the Italian oil company eni S. p. A. (Istituto eni Donegani-Research Center for <b>non-Conventional</b> <b>Energies,</b> Novara, Italy) The second and third academic projects dealt with the development of green chemical processes for fine chemicals manufacturing. In particular, (a) the condensation reaction between acetone and ammonia to give triacetoneamine (TAA), and (b) the Friedel-Crafts acylation of phenol with benzoic acid were investigated. ...|$|R
