40|$|INTRODUCTION: Nursing is {{the largest}} {{healthcare}} profession in Malawi with more than 11, 000 registered nurses (RNs), nurse technicians and midwives (NTM) practicing in hospitals and other settings like nursing colleges nationwide. Student preparation is mostly done by <b>nursing</b> <b>tutors</b> in all the nursing colleges using numerous types of teaching aids. METHODS: Descriptive exploratory design which utilized both qualitative and sequential quantitative methods was applied to Iterated Purposive Probability Sampling (IPPS) of 10 nursing colleges in Malawi. This was done to 129 students and 82 <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> in two structured questionnaires, 40 <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> in-depth interviews and 10 students focus groups. There were 32 variables for the teaching aids under five ranked Likert scale and the Cronbach’s Alpha {{was found to be}} 0. 932 without standardisation and it was 0. 952 after standard-disation. RESULTS: Although <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> show that they use manikins to teach (0. 011 < p = 0. 05), students seem not to agree on the utilization of the manikins during teaching both in class and at the clinical area (0. 05; p = 0. 05). There is also increased discrepancy between students and <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> on internet utilization as the teaching aid as the Beta Coefficient value was (B = 0. 202) for the <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> and (B = 1. 061) for the students basing on their experience. Use of patient as a teaching aid is very common in Malawi and both the <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> and students agree that it is the realistic and best way in teaching and has a strong binary logistic regression with a model outcome of (OR = 1. 431; 95 %CI (0. 890 ± 2. 304); p = 0. 139). CONCLUSION: There is a need to develop the teaching strategies that would be conducive with the current scarcity of the teaching aids. Use of patients if ethically followed remains the most effective and efficient teaching aid in developing countries. Department of HE and Training approved lis...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the experiences of remaining <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> at the Free State School of Nursing during the transformation of Nursing Colleges and downsizing of personnel. The study aimed at describing the experiences of individuals during changes in their work environment, {{with the purpose of}} contributing to the identification of guidelines for 'surviving' transformation and downsizing at the workplace. Three themes emerged from this study through the narrative descriptions and unstructured interviews. The first theme, affective responses, dealt with emotions, low morale, depressive moods and anxiety caused by transformation and downsizing. The second theme, cognitive and perceptual view, revealed the thoughts, beliefs, and opinions of remaining <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> regarding transformation and downsizing. Perceptions of and opinions on how nursing education and human dignity were affected were also expressed. The third theme portrayed the coping responses, which described work-related personal and social adjustments <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> made during the transformation of nursing colleges. Recommendations included communication, participation and counseling of <b>nurse</b> <b>tutors</b> and to meet the requirements of nursing colleges during transformation and downsizing.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: nurse tutors must {{encourage}} {{teaching and}} learning discovery through deliberate interactive teaching actions. However, Some outcome actions or interactive behavior of the <b>nurse</b> <b>tutor</b> are much to be desired in most nursing colleges in Malawi. METHODOLOGY: Descriptive exploratory design which utilized both qualitative and sequential quantitative methods was applied to Iterated Purposive Probability Sampling (IPPS) of 10 nursing colleges in Malawi. This was done to 129 students and 82 nurse tutors in two structured questionnaires, 40 in-depth interviews and 10 focus groups. There were over 30 variables for the challenges of student <b>nurse</b> <b>tutor</b> interactions under five ranked Likert scale. The Cronbach`s Alpha {{was found to be}} 0. 909 without standardisation and it was 0. 862 after standardisation. RESULTS: <b>nurse</b> <b>tutor</b> challenges of teaching interaction in Malawi colleges of nursing are stressfully existing. Rudeness and aggression among nurse tutors is becoming so common due the pressure of work despite the <b>nurse</b> <b>tutor</b> experience. It has been found that nurse tutors are not reflective in teaching process in Malawi nursing colleges Moreover, nurse tutors are not compassionate to students’ welfare in Malawi nursing colleges.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} how ”drama in training” is experienced by student nurses and nurse tutors as well as to describe whether the students feel that there is a connection between their participation in drama, their personal development and their own preparation for their future profession. The study´s starting point has been that the students need support with regard to their personal development in order for a growth in professional ability to occur. The main research postulation can be viewed as qualitative, even though certain aspects of quantitative data can be found, inspired by ethnographical as well as phenomenographical research. The study stretches over one year, at two universities in the southern part of Sweden. In total, the study consists of participants from three student groups with a total of 71 students (65 female and 6 male). The average age of the groups is between 25 and 43 years old at the start of the study. Groups 1 and 2 were student nurses on the Health and Medical Care course at a nursing university. Group 3 were trainee nurse tutors on a three-term <b>nurse</b> <b>tutor</b> course, intended to result in a University Diploma in Nursing Education. The analysis of data is based on the students´ diaries (292) written in conjunction with their participation in drama during their normal training, as well as the results of a questionnaire. The main result consists of four different themes of content and a number of sub-categories: The first theme ”The group´s development” contains experiences that emphasise the group and its development. In the first category ”Get to know one another” it is emphasised that the participants have got to know one another better than before. In the second category ”Community and confidence” a sense of community and confidence had developed in the group. In the theme ”Development of knowledge” there are experiences that emphasise a growth in knowledge. In the category ”Future profession”, learning, understanding and reflection relating to the future profession is emphasised. In the theme ”Personal development” there are experiences such as increased ”Self-knowledge”, increased ”Self-esteem” and increased ”Empathy and sensitivity”. The fourth category reflects an increased awareness of the body, in the group of student nurses it dealt with the category ”Intra- and intercorporality” whilst for the trainee <b>nurse</b> <b>tutor</b> it was a case of the category ”Intracorporality”. The theme ”Ambivalent development” contains the category ”Doubtfulness” for both student groups. In addition, a further category ”Worry and joy” has been created for the student nurse group. More than half of the students felt that there is a connection between drama, personal development and their own preparations for their future profession according to the students own judgement. The pedagogical implications that one can find as a result of this study are for example: Drama can be a powerful way of promoting the growth of the students´ professional competence...|$|E

40|$|Within {{portfolios}} used by nurse education programmes {{of higher}} education for practice learning and assessment, reflective narrative accounts are considered evidence of practice learning outcomes. Evaluation research of portfolios used in nurse education programmes is {{for the most part}} based on student perceptions which show students are conflicted on the inclusion of reflective accounts in the portfolio. This paper examines how structural influences of the practice learning milieu shape the reflective practice capability of the learner based on an analysis of 15 reflective narrative accounts from five practice learning and assessment portfolios of an undergraduate professional development programme for specialist community nursing in the United Kingdom. Ethnomethodology provided an orientation for single case textual analysis of related interactional sequences. Findings from a case comparison {{take the form of a}} local practice learning scene showing two structural patterns of orientation: a learning practice and the formal programme. These orientations can be differentiated by the accomplishments of reflective thinking-for-action, reflective thinking-for-evaluation and reflective thinking-for-critical enquiry. Reflective practice capability as an accomplishment of how the local practice learning milieu constitutes the portfolio approach to practice learning and assessment is presented through a case comparison of some interactions, roles and outcomes. The analysis draws attention towards theoretical sensitivity to client outcomes for enhancing the portfolio as an enquiry based approach for the accomplishment of reflective practice capability and the need for further investigation into the role of the academic <b>nurse</b> <b>tutor</b> in the portfolio approach...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{numerous}} teaching strategies that suit the pedagogical learning, {{but not all}} can yield the desired outcome and be properly applied by nurse tutors in both classroom and clinical area. Therefore, identifying the utilization of the teaching strategy for nurse tutors is very detrimental in nursing education. METHODS: Descriptive exploratory design which utilized both qualitative and sequential quantitative methods was applied to Iterated Purposive Probability Sampling (IPPS) of 10 nursing colleges in Malawi. This was done to 129 student and 82 nurse tutors in two structured questionnaires, 40 in-depth interviews and 10 focus groups. There were 56 variables for the teaching strategy under five ranked Likert scale and the Cronbach’s Alpha {{was found to be}} 0. 964 without standardisation and it was 0. 963 after standardisation. RESULTS: Direct teaching strategies like the lecture method are very common although nurse tutors prefer to combine with other interactive instructions. There is statistical association of use of role play and group discussion methods and <b>nurse</b> <b>tutor</b> work experience with odds ratios of OR ≤ 1. 624; CI(0. 576 ± 4. 579); p ≥ 0. 359 and OR ≤ 1. 397; CI(0. 882 ± 2. 306); p ≥ 0. 147 respectively. The ability to use different teaching strategies competently is still very limited among nurse tutors in Malawi nursing colleges. This compromises quality of learning among nursing students in the colleges. CONCLUSION: Developing a new teaching strategy that could combine the different attributes in the variety of the teaching instructions can promote the quality of nursing education in Malawi.

40|$|A {{considerable}} number of students undertaking pre-registration nurse education in the UK are international students from Zimbabwe. The {{aim of this study}} is to listen to their narratives in order both to understand their experiences and to make suggestions for improving their educational management. The context from which the Zimbabwean students have migrated is discussed, outlining the current Zimbabwean educational and health care systems; prevailing social mores, religion and kinship ties; and the more recent sharp economic downturn in the Zimbabwean economy and the effects of the prevalence of HI VIA IDS in Southern Africa. Nine pre-registration nursing students from Zimbabwe attending one UK university, and one further respondent who had qualified as a nurse and was practising in the same locality were recruited to take part in life-history interviews. The interviews covered experiences in Zimbabwe leading to migration to the UK; accounts of arriving in the UK and challenges experienced in starting the course, working in health care settings as placements, and becoming reconciled to life in the UK. Factors prompting migration to the UK are reported to include the emphasis on education as a means of social mobility; the economic crisis, and the disruption of family ties by the HIV epidemic. Educational courses for nursing are the means to prevent their aspirations for professional occupation floundering on current economic and political instability in Zimbabwe, rather than a positive career choice. The reliance of the NHS on internationally-recruited students to cover shortfalls in labour in the UK contributes to this process. Experiences upon arrival in the UK include problems with visas, immigration officials and banking facilities. Zimbabwean students find it challenging to adapt to self-directed learning styles, to combine studying in a context without their familiar domestic help, and under financial pressure to remit monies home. They also report experiences of racism both in the college and in placement settings. Despite these challenges the next step seems more likely to be to work in nursing in the UK and to bring family to join them when financially possible. These life-histories have implications for the educational management of Zimbabwean nursing students at the level of the University, the University International Office, the School of Nursing and Midwifery, the individual <b>nurse</b> <b>tutor,</b> and the local NHS placement settings. They also have implications for the future prospects of Zimbabwe after the Mugabe regime. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
