30|$|In conclusion, {{our study}} showed that {{patients}} with MS improved their HRQoL after fampridine, suggesting a real benefit in their lives. Both <b>non-respondent</b> and respondent groups improved their HRQoL although important effects were seen only in the respondent group. To finish, the contributions to overall HRQoL improvement seem different after fampridine between the <b>non-respondent</b> and respondent groups. The Fatigue and Relationship difficulties indices contributed significantly to overall improvement for HRQoL in the respondent group whereas, in the <b>non-respondent</b> group, it was Time perspective that seemed to better contribute to overall improvement in HRQoL.|$|E

40|$|The Fukushima Medical University {{conducted}} {{a mental health}} care program for evacuees after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. However, the mental health status of <b>non-respondents</b> has not been considered for surveys using questionnaires. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to clarify the characteristics of <b>non-respondents</b> and respondents. The target population of the survey (FY 2011 - 2013) is people living in the nationally designated evacuation zone of Fukushima prefecture. Among these, the participants were 967 people (20 years or older). We examined factors that affected the difference between the groups of participants (i. e., <b>non-respondents</b> and respondents) using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Employment was higher in <b>non-respondents</b> (p= 0. 022) and they were also more socially isolated (p= 0. 047) when compared to respondents; <b>non-respondents</b> had a higher proportional risk of psychological distress compared to respondents (p< 0. 033). The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, within the participants there was a significant association between employment status (OR= 1. 99, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 12 - 3. 51) and psychological distress (OR= 2. 17, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 4. 66). We found that <b>non-respondents</b> had a significantly higher proportion of psychological distress compared to the respondents. Although the <b>non-respondents</b> were the high-risk group, it is not possible to grasp the complexity of the situation by simply using questionnaire surveys. Therefore, in the future it is necessary to direct our efforts towards the mental health of <b>non-respondents</b> and respondents alike...|$|R

30|$|From the {{perspectives}} of gait and HRQoL, even after classifying patients into <b>non-respondent</b> and respondent groups, we found an improvement. However, large effect sizes for different spatiotemporal gait parameters and HRQoL indices were found for the respondent group. Furthermore, the respondent group surpassed the threshold of Minimally Important Clinical Difference (MICD) reported by Coleman et al. (2012) (i.e., for walking velocity d =  0.49). In spite of this fact, the <b>non-respondent</b> group was nearly {{twice as fast as}} the respondent group and should not be selected for fampridine treatment. As suggested by a previous study (Allart et al. 2015), fast walkers seem to benefit less from fampridine based on walking velocity as a unique point of view. It is important to bear in mind that, even in this <b>non-respondent</b> group, gait velocity was still impaired when compared with normative values. Indeed, the walking velocity assessed in the fast condition in this study for the <b>non-respondent</b> group corresponds to the velocity of a group of women (n =  5013) aged 10  years more and at their self-selected velocity as reported in the Bohannon and Andrews meta-analysis (Bohannon 2006).|$|E
30|$|To finish, {{it seems}} that there is no convincing {{clinical}} profile of patients’ responsiveness to fampridine with our study. The EDSS was the only clinical factor which was significantly different between the <b>non-respondent</b> and respondent groups. The only difference was that individuals in the <b>non-respondent</b> group were categorized as “Disability precludes full daily activities” whereas those in the respondent group were categorized as “Assistance required to walk”. This difference was not found in previous studies which did not identify any predictive factors for effectiveness (Allart et al. 2015; Goodman et al. 2009, 2010) in spite of the EDSS mean values which had in all cases a worse value in the respondent group.|$|E

40|$|Non-response is {{a growing}} issue in RDD {{telephone}} surveys, with the current literature describing how completed interviews are increasingly difficult to obtain. It is usually taken for granted, however, that survey respondents will be similar enough to <b>non-respondents</b> so that non-response bias is small. This paper uses data from ‘Poetry in America’, a national RDD survey conducted by NORC, to quantify exactly how survey respondents differ from <b>non-respondents.</b> We present a method that employs geographic information systems (or ‘GIS’) to compare the geographic and demographic characteristics of respondents and <b>non-respondents</b> through geocoding, the appending of census data, as well as spatial visualization. Examples of examined census-derived variables include race/ethnicity, income, and urbanicity. Because, by definition, <b>non-respondents</b> do not disclose useful information, there is usually no means of learning what data are missing due to non-response. Our data demonstrate that increases in response rate would not necessarily change the geographic and attribute distribution of survey data measurably. We argue that geographic examination adds value by enabling some quantification {{of the differences between}} respondents and <b>non-respondents...</b>|$|R

Early respondents were those participating in the cohort study after standard recruitment procedures. Late respondents were <b>non-respondents</b> that were converted through individual encouraging telephone contact. Early respondents, non-consenters and silent refusers were compared to late respondents using logistic regressions. Relative non-response biases for early respondents only, for respondents only (early and late) and for consenters (respondents and silent refusers) were also computed. RESULTS: Late respondents showed generally higher patterns of substance use than did early respondents, but lower patterns than did non-consenters and silent refusers. Converting initial <b>non-respondents</b> to respondents reduced the non-response bias, which might be further reduced if silent refusers were converted to respondents. CONCLUSION: Efforts to convert refusers are effective in reducing non-response bias. However, converted late respondents cannot be seen as proxies of <b>non-respondents,</b> and are at best only indicative of existing response bias due to persistent <b>non-respondents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Non-response in survey {{studies is}} a growing problem and, being usually selective, it leads to under- or {{overestimation}} of health outcomes in the follow-up. We followed both respondents and <b>non-respondents</b> by registry linkage {{to determine whether there}} is a risk of death, related to non-response at baseline. Methods Sample data of biennial surveys to 12 - 18 -year-old Finns in 1979 – 1997 were linked with national death registry up to 2001. The number of respondents was 62 528 (79. 6 %) and <b>non-respondents</b> 16 081 (20. 4 %). The average follow-up was 11. 1 years, totalling 876 400 person-years. The risk of death between <b>non-respondents</b> and respondents was estimated by hazard ratios (HR). Results The number of deaths per 100 000 person-years were 229 in <b>non-respondents</b> and 447 in respondents (HR 2. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 5 – 2. 6). The hazard ratios of death were for intoxication 3. 2 (95 % CI: 1. 9 – 5. 4), for disease 3. 1 (95 % CI: 2. 2 – 4. 1), for violence-related injury 2. 0 (95 % CI: 1. 5 – 2. 6) and for unintentional injury 1. 8 (95 % CI: 1. 3 – 2. 4) in <b>non-respondents</b> vs. respondents. The association between non-response and death increased with age at baseline, and the increase persisted after the age of 25. Conclusion Our study demonstrated significantly increased rates of death among adolescent <b>non-respondents</b> in a follow-up. The highest hazard ratios were seen in disease- and violence-related deaths. The death rate varied between respondents and <b>non-respondents</b> by death type.

40|$|Introduction: Proton pump {{inhibitor}} (PPI) use {{is associated}} with the development of fundic gland polyps (FGPs); discontinuing PPIs {{is associated with}} regression of FGPs. Here, we report a rare case of <b>non-respondent</b> FGPs after discontinuation of PPI that were successfully treated using an argon plasma coagulator (APC). Presentation of case: We present the case of a 68 -year-old woman with a history of polycytheamia vera. She also had gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and had been taking 10 [*]mg of omeprazole daily for the past three years. Esophagogastroduedenoscopy (GF) revealed over 100 pedunculated polyps in the gastric body and fundus. Histological examination of the specimens showed dilated oxyntic glands with flattened parietal and mucous cells. Based on these findings and the clinical history, a diagnosis of FGPs was made. Omeprazole use was then discontinued. Repeat GF performed 6 months and 1 [*]year later showed {{a significant increase in the}} number and size of the polyps. APC treatment was performed every 6 months for 3 years. Further GF showed a significant decrease in the number and size of the FGPs 4 years after discontinuing PPI. Discussion: We conclude that PPI use is a strong risk factor for the development of FGPs and discontinuing PPI is associated with regression of FGPs, but not in patients with polycythaemia vera. However, the mechanism involved in the interaction between FGP and polycytheamia vera remains unknown. Conclusion: <b>Non-respondent</b> FGPs after discontinuation of PPI use may be successfully treated using APC...|$|E

The first {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine differences in socio-economic and health profiles among respondents and <b>non-respondents.</b> The second purpose is to investigate the effect of non-response on estimates of trends. Methods:Socio-economic and health profile between respondents and <b>non-respondents</b> in the WHO MONICA Project final survey were compared. The potential effect of non-response on the trend estimates between the initial survey and final survey approximately ten years later was investigated using both MONICA data and hypothetical data. Results: In most of the populations, <b>non-respondents</b> were more likely to be single, less well educated, and had poorer lifestyles and health profiles than respondents. As an example of the consequences, temporal trends in prevalence of daily smokers are shown to be overestimated in most populations if they were based only on data from respondents. Conclusions: The socio-economic and health profiles of respondents and <b>non-respondents</b> differed fairly consistently across 27 populations. Hence, the estimators of population trends based on respondent data are likely to be biased. Declining response rates therefore pose a threat to the accuracy of estimates of risk factor trends in many countries...|$|R

The Australian Vietnam Veterans Health Study {{was set up}} {{to examine}} the post-war health of former {{soldiers}} 20 or more years after service and to examine the relation of combat exposure to physical and mental health. Method. A prospective cohort study of a simple random sample of 1000 male Australian Army Vietnam veterans used information gathered from Army records, from personal interview and questionnaires. Military records were used to examine response bias by determining the differences between 641 interviewed veterans, 50 known deceased veterans and 309 <b>non-respondents</b> (including 48 refusers and 213 non-traceable). Results. Differences were evident between respondents and <b>non-respondents,</b> with logistic regression modelling point-ing to pre-enlistment employment, antisocial behaviour, intelligence and post-Vietnam AWOL (absent without leave) as the most important discriminants, with <b>non-respondents</b> performing worse.

Methods: The research was undertaken as a postal questionnaire survey of the FTSE 350 companies and selected public sector organizations in the UK. This was followed up by telephone calls to a random selection of non-respondents to obtain <b>non-respondent</b> data. Results: There is a difference in opinion among managers and occupational health professionals about the services provided by occupational health. Taking into account <b>non-respondent</b> data to partially adjust for overestimation biases, the level of provision of occupational health services among the FTSE 350 companies is 69 % and in public sector organizations is 95 %, giving an average provision of 72 %. Sixteen per cent of respondents thought there was a trend towards outsourcing of services. The most frequently cited reason for provision of an occupational health service was that it was for the benefit of employees. Conclusions: There remains room for improvement in the level of occupational health services provision in large UK private sector organizations. By bridging the gap between the different stakeholders' perceptions of the remit and benefits of the service, a higher level of provision in the private sector similar to that of public sector organizations can be achieved. © The Author 2007.

First of all, our results pointed out that fampridine can improve HRQoL in patients with MS as well as their gait. Secondly, contrary to what we could expect, HRQoL improved in both <b>non-respondent</b> and respondent groups. However, for the same rate of overall improvement in HRQoL in both groups, the HRQoL sub-indices that showed significant improvement after treatment were different between the two.
