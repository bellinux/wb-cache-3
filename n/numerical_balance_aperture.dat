I describe an alternative, diagrammatic approach in which pupils do not assess statements but instead use them to make substitutions of notation. I report on two trials of a computer-based task conducted with pairs of pupils and highlight two findings. First, the pupils found it useful to articulate the distinct substitutive effects of commutative (‘swap’, ‘switch’) and partitional (‘split’, ‘separate’) statements when working on the task. Secondly, the pupils did not notice that some of the statements presented were in fact false, which suggests their substituting activities were independent of numerical equivalence conceptions. This demonstrates that making substitutions offers task designers a mathematical utility for equality statements that is distinct from, but complementary to, assessing <b>numerical</b> <b>balance...</b>|$|R

Results obtained using conventional and deviatoric forms of the conservative non-linear shallow water equations (SWEs) are compared for cases where the bed has a varying topography.

A further comparison is undertaken between the TVD-MacCormack model and an alternating direction implicit (ADI) model for cases involving steep-fronted shallow flows.

The TVD-MacCormack model reproduces all flow regimes accurately. Finally, the TVD-MacCormack model is used to predict a laboratory-scale dyke break undertaken at Delft University of Technology.

A method of decomposing these changes into components due to sex differentials in fertility, mortality and migration is described and applied. The study describes the gradual feminisation of the Australian population over a century, and gives an account of how the ratio of the sexes differs by age and how long it takes to exhaust the numerical superiority of males at birth. The study explains these changes by examining long-term trends in the sex ratio of births, deaths and net migration for successive cohorts. The relatively high mortality of males, and the emerging pattern of feminine net migration since the 1970 s, explain the transformation of the Australian population from its highly masculine past to its contemporary state of greater balance between the sexes. 17 page(s...|$|R

Whereas the ethnic groups in Lijphart’s consociational model constitute the basic units on which the political structure is built, the political structure in Horowitz’s integrative model transcends ethnic divisions. The Dayton Agreement that ended the war in Bosnia contains elements of both approaches, and the balance between them has been changing in the course of its implementation. Bosnia constitutes a very suitable case for a comparison of the effect on stability of the two approaches: elements of each approach can be isolated and their effects compared, and the interplay between the approaches and the effect of international involvement can also be analysed. An international dimension and the phase of (de) escalation of the conflict are variables missing from both approaches, {{but it is important to}} include them when analysing a postwar situation. Owing to the deep divisions in the population, the <b>numerical</b> <b>balance</b> between the groups and the maximalist objectives of the dominant parties, the consociational model has been more effective in fostering stability in Bosnia. Currently, a change to an integrative structure seems premature, but a mix of the approaches has been demonstrated to be able to foster moderation...|$|R

Even in the absence of such extraordinary circumstances, the pyramid-like nature of most European football league systems can still create knock-on effects at the regional level. For example, in a higher league with a large geographical footprint and multiple feeder leagues each representing distinct geographical regions, should most or all of the relegated teams in the higher division come from one particular region then the number of teams to be promoted and/or relegated from each of the feeder leagues may have to be adjusted and/or one or more non-promoted and non-relegated team(s) playing near the [...] "boundary" [...] between the feeder leagues may have to transfer from one feeder league to another to maintain <b>numerical</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|R

Thus, we developed Foxp 3 gfp “knock-in” mice and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35 – 55 /IAb tetramers to track autoantigen-specific effector T cells (T-eff) and T-reg in vivo during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Following immunization with the encephalitogenic peptide MOG 35 – 55 emulsified in complete Freund 2 ̆ 7 s adjuvant, MOG 35 – 55 -tetramer-reactive, Foxp 3 + T-reg expanded in the peripheral lymphoid compartment and readily accumulated in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), but did not prevent the onset of disease. During disease onset, the MOG-tetramer+ T-eff population in the CNS increased faster than the population of antigen-specific T-reg. At the peak of disease, the ratio of T-reg vs. T-eff was 1 : 17 which dramatically changed into 1 : 2 at the beginning of recovery. Foxp 3 + T-reg isolated from the CNS were fully competent in suppressing naive MOG-specific T cells.
