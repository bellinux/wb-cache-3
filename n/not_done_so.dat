5|$|Clark's {{successor}} as MP, Stewart Jackson, was re-elected in 2010 with {{an increased}} majority, which then fell in 2015. The 2017 result {{marks the first time}} since 1929 that Peterborough has voted Labour in an election where the Conservatives won the national popular vote, and the first time it has ever elected a Labour MP in a year in which Labour did not form the government. Furthermore, Peterborough became one of five constituencies, the others being Croydon Central, Enfield Southgate, Leeds North West and Reading East, which elected Labour MPs in 2017 having <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> since 2001.|$|E
5|$|Korene Hinds {{participated in}} the women's 3000meters steeplechase, an {{obstacle}} run event. Born in the former Jamaican capital of Spanish Town, Hinds participated in Beijing at age 31. She had not previously participated in any Olympic events. During the August 15 qualification round, Hinds {{was placed in the}} third heat, which was composed of 17 athletes. She was the only Jamaican in the heat. However, Hinds did not finish the race, and was one of three athletes in the heat (along with Brazil's Zenaide Vieira and Bulgaria's Dobrinka Shalamanova) do have <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E

5|$|Woods {{had a much}} {{anticipated}} {{return to}} golf in 2009, when he performed well. His comeback included a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup, but he failed to win a major, the first year since 2004 that he had <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> After his marital infidelities came to light and received massive media coverage {{at the end of}} 2009 (see further details below), Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf. In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior. During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.|$|E
5|$|Although Hancock won Georgia's {{popular vote}} easily, {{there was an}} {{irregularity}} in that state’s electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the Constitution, “The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” In 1792, Congress had set the date for the Electoral College {{to vote on the}} first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia’s electors failed to cast their ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had they <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so,</b> Hancock’s electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.|$|E
5|$|In the UK Control Risks, a British {{security}} company—paid by {{an anonymous}} donor {{to assist the}} McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.|$|E

5|$|In polling, Dodd {{has seemed}} unable {{to break through}} to the top tier. In Nationwide polls he usually only polls at or around 1%. A November 7, 2007 Gallup poll placed him in last place, behind both Joe Biden and Dennis Kucinich at 1%. At the state level, Dodd has also <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> well. In a November 18, 2007 Iowa poll {{conducted}} by ABC news, he registered with 1% the same number from a similar poll done by ABC news on July 31, 2007. In New Hampshire, a poll conducted by CNN placed Dodd at 1% constant from a September poll but up from polls in June and July. However, on the straw poll level, Dodd was able to gain a victory during an event in South Carolina on March 5, 2007. He won the York County straw poll by receiving 28% of the 100 votes cast. Barack Obama came in second with 24%. Hillary Clinton got 18% and John Edwards received 11%. The victory came two days after Dodd visited the county which probably secured him the win.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, {{the use of a}} Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} cadmium {{is composed}} of 8 isotopes. Two of them are radioactive, and three are expected to decay but have <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are 113Cd (beta decay, half-life is 7.7 × 1015 years) and 116Cd (two-neutrino double beta decay, half-life is 2.9 × 1019 years). The other three are 106Cd, 108Cd (both double electron capture), and 114Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes– 110Cd, 111Cd, and 112Cd– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are 109Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and 115Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5 hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known meta states, with the most stable being 113mCd (t1⁄2= 14.1 years), 115mCd (t1⁄2= 44.6 days), and 117mCd (t1⁄2= 3.36 hours).|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{deportation}} order, the British government {{found that}} it could not deport Stanley, because no country was willing to receive him.

Stanley had <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so,</b> and in addition, the Polish Foreign Ministry announced {{that he would not be}} allowed to return.

25|$|A mass fall {{occurred}} as the climbers began the traverse. George Bell slipped {{and fell on}} a patch of hard ice, pulling off his rope-mate Tony Streather. As they fell their rope became tangled with those connecting Houston, Bates, Gilkey and Molenaar, pulling all these climbers off as well. Finally the strain came onto Pete Schoening, who had been belaying Gilkey and Molenaar. Quickly wrapping the rope around his shoulders and ice axe, Schoening held all six climbers, some of whom had by that point fallen over 100m. Had he <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>so,</b> the entire team, apart from Craig who was unroped, would have fallen around 2000m to the Godwin-Austen Glacier.|$|E
