5|$|Institute of Psychiatry Library: The {{library is}} largest {{psychiatric}} library in Western Europe, holding 3,000 print journal titles, 550 {{of which are}} current subscriptions, as well as access to over 3,500 electronic journals, 42,000 books, and training materials. The collections focus on psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, <b>neurology,</b> genetics and psychotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Physiology is {{the study}} the {{interaction}} of how, for example, the nervous, immune, endocrine, respiratory, and circulatory systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with such medically oriented disciplines as <b>neurology</b> and immunology.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} not fully understood, and {{research}} is ongoing. Neuroscientists, along with researchers from allied disciplines, study how the human brain works. The boundaries between the specialties of neuroscience, <b>neurology</b> and other disciplines such as psychiatry have faded as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience.|$|E
5|$|The {{creators of}} the show set up a real online wedding {{registry}} to mark the wedding of Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd. Instead of buying gifts fans were encouraged to donate money to the American Academy of <b>Neurology</b> Foundation.|$|E
5|$|He {{headed the}} Boston Psychopathic Hospital {{when it opened}} in 1912, {{pioneering}} the study of brain pathology with particular interests in shell shock and schizophrenia. Southard published several books, including Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems with nearly 1,000 case histories. He was president of the American Medico-Psychological Association and the Boston Society of Psychiatry and <b>Neurology,</b> and held advisory positions with the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service and the Eugenics Record Office.|$|E
5|$|In most cultures, {{persons with}} {{epilepsy}} have been stigmatized, shunned, or even imprisoned; in the Salpêtrière, {{the birthplace of}} modern <b>neurology,</b> Jean-Martin Charcot found people with epilepsy side-by-side with the mentally ill, those with chronic syphilis, and the criminally insane. In ancient Rome, epilepsy {{was known as the}} morbus comitialis ('disease of the assembly hall') and was seen as a curse from the gods. In northern Italy, epilepsy was once traditionally known as Saint Valentine's malady.|$|E
5|$|Southard {{traveled}} to New York City on February 1, 1920 to lecture to medical societies. He {{spoke to the}} Society of <b>Neurology</b> of New York on February 3, and delivered a mental-hygiene lecture at the New York Academy of Medicine the following day before developing pneumonia on February 5. Despite care by three Presbyterian Hospital physicians at the Prince George Hotel, Southard died on February 8, {{at the age of}} 43.|$|E
5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in <b>Neurology</b> in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In both cases, the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in <b>neurology,</b> and the small size of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.|$|E
5|$|He {{served in}} a {{strategic}} advisory role with the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service during World War I, attaining the rank of major. Southard was {{a past president of}} the American Medico-Psychological Association, and was president of the Boston Society of Psychiatry and <b>Neurology</b> at his death. Other professional memberships included the American Genetic Association, the National Epilepsy Association, the American Association of Pathologists, the Massachusetts Medical Society and the Society of Experimental Biology. He {{served in a}}n editorial capacity for several publications, including the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan joined Tan Tock Seng Hospital as a {{consultant}} neurosurgeon in 1991, where he reorganised the way stroke patients were treated, arranged for the neurosurgical intensive care unit to be computerised, introduced stereotactic brachytherapy for dealing with brain tumours, and chaired the National Neuroscience Institute's planning committee. In 1994, he moved into private practice at Gleneagles Hospital, establishing the first stereotactic radiosurgical treatment system driven by a linear particle accelerator in Singapore. He also worked with medical device manufacturer Siemens to develop image-guided surgical systems. He published more than 50 scientific papers and chapters in <b>neurology</b> books.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in <b>neurology</b> had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that {{it might be possible to}} construct an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{neuroscience}} encompasses all approaches {{that seek to}} understand the brain {{and the rest of}} the nervous system. Psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior, and <b>neurology</b> is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders. Cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as computer science (artificial intelligence and similar fields) and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Cumings, and {{simultaneously}} the New Zealand neurologist Derek Denny-Brown, {{working in the}} United States, first reported effective treatment with metal chelator British anti-Lewisite in 1951. This treatment had to be injected but {{was one of the}} first therapies available in the field of <b>neurology,</b> a field that classically was able to observe and diagnose but had few treatments to offer. The first effective oral chelation agent, penicillamine, was discovered in 1956 by British neurologist John Walshe. In 1982, Walshe also introduced trientine, and was the first to develop tetrathiomolybdate for clinical use. Zinc acetate therapy initially made its appearance in the Netherlands, where physicians Schouwink and Hoogenraad used it in 1961 and in the 1970s, respectively, but it was further developed later by Brewer and colleagues at the University of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Nansen studied zoology at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania (renamed Oslo in 1925), {{and later}} {{worked as a}} curator at the University Museum of Bergen where his {{research}} on {{the central nervous system}} of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish modern theories of <b>neurology.</b> After 1896 his main scientific interest switched to oceanography; {{in the course of his}} research he made many scientific cruises, mainly in the North Atlantic, and contributed to the development of modern oceanographic equipment. As one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the ending of Norway's union with Sweden, and was instrumental in persuading Prince Carl of Denmark to accept the throne of the newly independent Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.|$|E
5|$|Non-human {{primates}} (NHPs) {{are used}} in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of <b>neurology,</b> behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation. They {{are caught in the}} wild or purpose-bred. In the United States and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred. The European Commission reported that in 2011, 6,012 monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 71,188 monkeys in U.S. laboratories in 2016. 23,465 monkeys were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including 929 who were caught in the wild. Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques; but marmosets, spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and chimpanzees {{are used in}} the US. As of 2015, there are approximately 730 chimpanzees in U.S. laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in <b>Neurology.</b> The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{has contributed}} money {{and support for}} {{research}} and treatment of multiple sclerosis, from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward {{the creation of a}} new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative <b>Neurology</b> Clinic. In 2010 she donated a further £10million to the centre. For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of multiple sclerosis in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers. In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.|$|E
5|$|Wilder {{was drafted}} into the Army on September 10, 1956. At the end of recruit training, he was {{assigned}} to the medical corps and sent to Fort Sam Houston for training. He was then given the opportunity to choose any post that was open, and wanting to stay near New York City to attend acting classes at the HB Studio, he chose to serve as paramedic in the Department of Psychiatry and <b>Neurology</b> at Valley Forge Army Hospital, in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. In November 1957, his mother died from ovarian cancer. He was discharged from the army a year later and returned to New York. A scholarship to the HB Studio allowed him to become a full-time student. At first living on unemployment insurance and some savings, he later supported himself with odd jobs such as a limousine driver and fencing instructor.|$|E
5|$|Balaji Sadasivan {{was born}} on 11 July 1955 in Singapore, the son of Indian immigrants. A student at Raffles Institution, Siglap Secondary School (1969–1971) and National Junior College (1972–1973), he {{subsequently}} studied medicine at the University of Singapore. In his second year, he won an essay competition organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and received the opportunity to attend a healthcare workshop in Minamata, Japan, where he learned about the devastating effects of Minamata disease, a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. This led him to specialise in neurosurgery later on, which was not a popular discipline at the time. In 1979, Sadasivan graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), {{and two years later}} embarked on further studies at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S.) in 1984. He trained at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between 1985 and 1990, obtaining a diploma from the American Board of <b>Neurology</b> Surgery and becoming a fellow at Harvard University in 1990. He also worked at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard, and at the Children's Hospital Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1997, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. (Hons.)) from the University of London.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of <b>Neurology.</b> Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed {{when he had to}} do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical <b>neurology,</b> and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the NFL {{established}} the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later {{replaced by the}} Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating {{that there is not}} enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because {{he did not have a}} background in <b>neurology</b> and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that the study was conducted by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries. A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.|$|E

25|$|Salinas {{completed}} his <b>neurology</b> residency at Harvard from 2011 to 2015, training at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He served as Chief Resident in <b>Neurology,</b> {{followed by a}} fellowship in Behavioral <b>Neurology</b> and Neuropsychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. He earned a Master of Science in Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in 2016.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his fellowship, Salinas joined {{the staff of}} the Massachusetts General Hospital’s <b>Neurology</b> Department, serving as neurologist in the Cognitive Behavioral <b>Neurology</b> Unit and the Institute for Brain Health.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the first}} American {{physician}} to devote himself entirely to <b>neurology,</b> {{the author of the}} first American treatise about <b>neurology,</b> and {{one of the founders of}} the American Neurological Association.|$|E
25|$|Neuropsychiatry is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} that deals with mental disorders attributable to diseases of the nervous system. It preceded the current disciplines of psychiatry and <b>neurology,</b> which had common training, however, psychiatry and <b>neurology</b> have subsequently split apart and are typically practiced separately. Nevertheless, neuropsychiatry has become a growing subspecialty of psychiatry {{and it is also}} closely related to the fields of neuropsychology and behavioral <b>neurology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Salinas’s awards {{include the}} American Academy of Neurology's prestigious Robert Katzman Research Training Fellowship Award in Alzheimer’s and Dementia Research in 2017 {{as well as}} local {{recognition}} for excellence in clinical <b>neurology,</b> patient safety, and clinical teaching in <b>neurology.</b>|$|E
