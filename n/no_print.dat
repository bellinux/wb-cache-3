5|$|In {{addition}} to its commercial success, Kalidas was a major breakthrough for Rajalakshmi's career, and made her a bankable singing star. Because <b>no</b> <b>print,</b> gramophone record, or songbook {{of the film is}} known to survive, it is a lost film.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Keechaka Vadham {{prompted}} Nataraja Mudaliar {{to make a}} series of similar historical films. Mudaliar's works inspired other filmmakers like Raghupathi Surya Prakasa and J. C. Daniel. Because <b>no</b> <b>print</b> of it is known to survive, this makes it a lost film.|$|E
5|$|Miss Malini marked Narayan's {{earliest}} use {{of story}} elements that would recur {{in some of}} his later novels. It was later rewritten by him as the 1949 novel Mr. Sampath– The Printer of Malgudi, which in turn was adapted into the Hindi film Mr. Sampat (1952) directed by S. S. Vasan, and a 1972 Tamil film directed by Cho Ramaswamy. Although <b>no</b> <b>print</b> of Miss Malini is known to survive, which makes it a lost film, surviving artefacts include its songs, along with a few stills and newspaper advertisements.|$|E

At the same time, most traditional LGBT media has ceased operating; there are currently <b>no</b> <b>print</b> magazines or newspapers.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Aunor made six movies most of {{them are}} romantic-comedy like the blockbusters Totoo ba ang Tsismis with Gabby Concepcion, Ibalik ang Swerti, with the ReyCards Duet, Dalaga si Mister, Binata si Misis with Christopher de Leon, and Rock N Roll, which was the {{official}} entry to the 1981 Metro Manila Film Festival. This film {{was also one of the}} top grosser of the said film fest. Aunor made only one serious drama that year, Bakit bughaw ang langit?. Aunor received her 10th FAMAS Best Actress nomination and 5th nomination from Gawad Urian for her performance in this film. She won best actress from the Catholic Mass Media Awards. Unfortunately, <b>no</b> <b>print</b> of this film is known to officially exist.|$|E
25|$|The {{forensics}} reinforced this theory. On {{a record}} player atop the stack was a thumb-shaped bloodstain. It had <b>no</b> <b>print,</b> suggesting whoever left it was wearing gloves to avoid leaving identification. But {{the blood was}} Rasmussen's, suggesting the equipment had been stacked after the struggle and shooting. They had been left behind, the detectives realized, to make the crime look like something other than what it really was. From the four bound volumes of the case file they developed a list of five women who might be suspects. Nuttall was taken aback when Ruetten told him over the phone that Lazarus was a police officer. By then, Lazarus had been promoted {{to a higher level}} of detective, and was working art theft cases as part of the elite Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD).|$|E

500|$|The {{arrival of}} sound in South Indian cinema, {{with the release}} of Kalidas, {{triggered}} a migration of theatre artists into cinema. Kalidas was the only Tamil film to be produced and released in 1931. <b>No</b> <b>print</b> or gramophone record of the film is known to survive, making it a lost film. The Indian Express stated in 2014 that the film had [...] "turned to dust" [...] long before the National Film Archive of India was established in 1964.

2500|$|Since May 2005 Forster {{has had a}} {{parallel}} career as a music critic, he began writing for the Australian magazine, The Monthly and its sister publication The Saturday Paper in 2014. Previously he had virtually <b>no</b> <b>print</b> experience, with only a column on hair care for a fanzine in the 1980s to his credit. He was asked by then-editor of The Monthly, Christian Ryan, to write a regular column. Forster later recalled [...] "usic journalism was something that always interested me but only as a reader. I thought about music and I would almost run ideas through my head when I listened to a record or saw a concert, but I never put any of thoughts to paper". On 25 October 2006 Forster won the Pascall Prize for Critical Writing for his columns. In 2009 he collated some of his critiques, written from 2005 to 2009, on international artists The Rolling Stones, Nana Mouskouri, Neil Diamond and Cat Power as well as Australian acts Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Mark Seymour and Paul Kelly.
