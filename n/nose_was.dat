5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> raised to horizontal, the visor would rise {{in front of the}} cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Following his injury, Loxton played in neither; Australia won both by an innings. While in Scotland, Loxton's <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> {{operated}} on in Edinburgh. Following his injury, Loxton eschewed the sweep shot and advised {{students to do}} the same, exhorting them to move onto the front foot to drive instead.|$|E
5|$|A {{controller}} in {{the cockpit}} allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E

5|$|Amelia is a {{domestic}} novel taking place largely in London during 1733. It describes the hardships suffered {{by a young}} couple newly married. Against her mother's wishes, Amelia marries Captain William Booth, a dashing young army officer. The couple run away to London. In Book II, William is unjustly imprisoned in Newgate, and is subsequently seduced by Miss Matthews. During this time, it is revealed that Amelia was in a carriage accident and that her <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> ruined. Although this brings about jokes at Amelia's behalf, Booth refuses to regard her as anything but beautiful.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with the cockpit {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the external side of the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E

5|$|Edward habitually smoked twenty {{cigarettes}} and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a rodent ulcer, {{a type of}} cancer affecting the skin next to his <b>nose,</b> <b>was</b> cured with radium. Towards {{the end of his}} life he increasingly suffered from bronchitis. He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909. In March 1910, he was staying at Biarritz when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high. On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu a week later on 5 May.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the design}} was further {{modified}} to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red searchlight for the Spanner Anlage infrared detection system. The infrared lamp in the <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> used {{to illuminate the}} target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the target. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner infrared detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E
5|$|The He 111P {{incorporated}} the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed nose section, including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine gun that replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with a roomier and more aerodynamic glazed stepless cockpit {{over the entire}} front of the aircraft. This smooth glazed <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475km/h (295mph) at 5,000m (16,400ft) and a cruise speed of 370km/h (230mph), although a full bomb load reduced this figure to 300km/h (190mph). The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.|$|E
50|$|A Rhinectomy is the {{surgical}} {{removal of a}} nose. If {{only part of the}} <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> removed it is called a partial rhinectomy, while entire <b>nose</b> removal <b>is</b> called a total rhinectomy. Often, a <b>nose</b> prosthesis <b>is</b> required for rehabilitation.|$|R
50|$|Wry <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> a {{deviation}} of the rostral maxilla, {{meaning that the}} upper jaw and <b>nose</b> <b>are</b> deviated to one side. This usually causes the nasal septum (the cartilage plate that separates {{the right and left}} nasal passageways) to be deviated as well, resulting in obstruction of the airway, and breathing difficulties. Wry <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> most obvious in species with long faces, such as horses and cattle. It is a congenital abnormality, meaning that it is present at birth.|$|R

5|$|Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, a black dwarf. He is {{descendant}} of Ginarrbrik, who served the White Witch, and bears {{one of his}} rings, which was passed down from each generation. Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics, to allow Davis {{to ward off the}} audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because the grass is filled with ticks, so he put elastic bands to hold his trousers against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E
5|$|During the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for {{the first}} time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> broken when he was hit by a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.|$|E
5|$|Later {{variants}} of the Z model were developed. The Z-6 {{was to be}} a reconnaissance aircraft, although it was only built as a prototype. During the war only a few were converted from existing combat variants. The type was selected for weather check flights. It was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 variants, but offensive armament was omitted and extra fuel cells fitted. This increased the fuel load to 2,890 l (578 Imperial Gallons). As flights required higher altitude, the oxygen supply was increased from 20 to 24 bottles. For long-range flights over water, the larger dinghy of the Z-5 with its updated emergency escape equipment was mandatory during operations. The Z-6s were also used for night fighter operations. Some of the few converted Z-6s had the Ju 88C-6 nose installed and were equipped with machine guns and cannons. The nose proved to be unsatisfactory, and it was redesigned. In the tip of the new <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> an infrared spotlight which was soon made redundant after the introduction of Lichtenstein radar which was fitted to some of the Z-6.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999 Don King and Oscar De la Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, agreed to co-promote a mega-fight for the Lineal, WBC and IBF welterweight championships on September 18, 1999, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. Early in the fight De la Hoya {{employed}} boxing to connect combinations while avoiding Trinidad's attacks. The second round began with both boxers trading punches but De la Hoya quickly returned to his previous tactic, which he employed in the third round. In the fourth round Trinidad pressured the offense while De la Hoya tried to avoid his punches by moving, both boxers eventually exchanged punches. In the fifth round Trinidad continued in the offensive while De la Hoya attempted {{to remain on the}} outside corners of the ring, Trinidad's eye was swollen following a trade of punches, and his <b>nose</b> <b>was</b> also bleeding. Trinidad was having a lot of problems finding De La Hoya and couldn't connect as flush as usual with his punches, although he scored at times, Oscar's movement was not letting him land in combination and it was proclaimed by many to have been a lackluster fight. In the eighth round the swelling on Trinidad's eye was worsening. Oscar was scoring on Trinidad but halfway through the tenth, De La Hoya stopped sticking and basically disengaged. De La Hoya gassed out and had remained on his toes {{for the remainder of the}} bout, and Trinidad won all the final rounds.The judges gave Trinidad a very controversial majority decision, with scores of 115–113, 115–114 and 114–114.|$|E

50|$|Anatomically, a <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> a {{protuberance}} in vertebrates {{that houses}} the nostrils, or nares, which receive and expel air for respiration alongside the mouth. Behind the <b>nose</b> <b>are</b> the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses. Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared with the digestive system, {{and then into the}} rest of the respiratory system. In humans, the <b>nose</b> <b>is</b> located centrally on the face and serves as an alternative respiratory passage especially during suckling for infants. On most other mammals, it is located on the upper tip of the snout.|$|R
