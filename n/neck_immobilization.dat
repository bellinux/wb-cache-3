5000|$|The pre-hospital setting {{provides}} unique {{challenges to}} {{management of the}} airway including tight spaces, <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization,</b> poor lighting, and often the added complexity of attempting procedures during transport. When possible, basic airway management should be prioritized including head-tilt-chin-lift maneuvers, and bag-valve masking. If ineffective, a supraglottic airway can be utilized to aid in oxygenation and maintenance of a patent airway. An oropharyngeal airway is acceptable, however nasopharyngeal airways should be avoided in trauma, particularly if a basilar skull fracture is suspected. Endotracheal intubation carries with it many risks, particularly when paralytics are used, as maintenance of the airway becomes a challenge if intubation fails. It should therefore be attempted by experienced personnel, only when less invasive methods fail or when it is deemed necessary for safe transport of the patient, to reduce risk of failure and the associated increase in morbidity and mortality due to hypoxia.Management of the airway in the emergency department is optimal given the presence of trained personnel from multiple specialties, as well as access to [...] "difficult airway equipment" [...] (videolaryngoscopy, eschmann tracheal tube introducer, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, surgical methods, etc.). Of primary concern is the condition and patency of the maxillofacial structures, larynx, trachea, and bronchi as these are all components of the respiratory tract and failure anywhere along this path may impede ventilation. Excessive facial hair, severe burns, and maxillofacial trauma may prevent acquisition of a good mask seal, rendering bag-valve mask ventilation difficult. Edema of the airway can make laryngoscopy difficult, and therefore in those with suspected thermal burns, intubation is recommended in attempts to quickly secure an airway prior to progression of the swelling. Furthermore, blood and vomitus in the airway may prove visualization of the vocal cords difficult rendering direct and video laryngoscopy, as well as fiberoptic bronchoscopy challenging. Establishment of a surgical airway is challenging {{in the setting of}} restricted neck extension (such as in a c-collar), laryngotracheal disruption, or distortion of the anatomy by a penetrating force or hematoma. Tracheotomy in the operating room by trained professionals is recommended over cricothyroidotomy in the case of complete laryngotracheal disruption or {{children under the age of}} 12.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization</b> on activities of daily living. An intra-subject experimental design was used. Twenty normal females, ranging in age from 19 to 21 years, participated in this study. Their mean height was 158. 46 with a standard deviation of 3. 78 cm. A neck collar was used for the <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization.</b> Three experimental procedures were followed. The first was to pick up from the floor a tea cup, which was just in front of the toes of the subjects while they were standing and moving the tea cup to their mouths. The second was to pick up the tea cup from the floor 50 cm in front of the feet. The third was to go up, turn, and go down two steps. The time required for these procedures-was measured with a stopwatch. These activities in the three procedures were timed when performed with or without collar conditions five times each. The findings showed a statistically significant increase in the time required to perform all these procedures when the neck was immobilized. Procedure 1 needed 2. 14 ±. 32 sec. without a collar, and 2. 35 ±. 40 sec. with collar, with the t-value showing a significant difference (p<. 01). Procedure 2 needed 2. 12 ±. 21 sec. without a collar, and 2. 32 ±. 28 sec. with, for a significant t-value of p<. 001. Procedure 3 needed 3. 64 ±. 55 sec. without a collar, and 4. 03 ±. 59 sec. with, also showing a. 1 % level of significance. There was also a significant correlation between body height and the time required for the step task (without collar:. 459, p<. 05, with collar:. 475, p<. 05).

30|$|Second, {{to predict}} {{difficult}} airways, several factors including blood/vomitus/secretion in the airway, cervical <b>immobilization,</b> <b>neck</b> trauma/mass or vocal cord palsy, 3 - 3 - 2 rule, short neck, obesity, limited mouth opening, small mouth and large tongue, were assessed before intubation. It is usually considered {{that no single}} factor can accurately predict difficult airway as each factor individually has a rather low positive predictive value. If a patient has more predictors of difficult airway at the same time, however, the likelihood of difficult airway will increase [3]. For this reason, the National Emergency Airway Management Course has developed a LEMON score for identification of difficult airways in the emergency setting [4].|$|R
40|$|Cervical {{spondylosis}} {{is caused}} by degenerative disc disease and usually produces intermittent neck pain in middle-aged and elderly patients. This pain usually responds to activity modification, <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization,</b> isometric exercises, and medication. Neurologic symptoms occur infrequently, usually in patients with congenital spinal stenosis. For these patients, magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred initial diagnostic study. Because involvement of neurologic structures on imaging studies may be asymptomatic, consultation with a neurologist is advised to rule out other neurologic diseases. In most cases of spondylotic radiculopathy, the results of conservative treatment are so favorable that surgical intervention is not considered unless pain persists or unless there is progressive neurologic deficit. If indicated, a surgical procedure may be done through the anterior or posterior cervical spine; results are gratifying, with long-term improvement in 70 % to 80 % of patients. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy {{is the most serious}} and disabling condition of this disease. Because many patients have nonprogressive minor impairment, <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization</b> is a reasonable treatment in patients presenting with minor neurologic findings or in whom an operation is contraindicated. This simple remedy will result in improvement in 30 % to 50 % of patients. Surgical intervention is indicated for patients presenting with severe or progressive neurologic deficits. Anterior cervical approaches are generally preferred, although there are still indications for laminectomy. Surgical results are modest, with good initial results expected in about 70 % of patients. Functional outcome noticeably declines with long-term follow-up, which raises the question of whether, and how much, surgical treatment affects the natural course of the disease. Prospective randomized studies are needed to answer these questions...|$|E
40|$|Address all {{correspondence}} to Dr. Waters. The clinicopathological features of cervical fractures in 56 dogs were reviewed. “Hit by car” (HBC) {{was the most}} common inciting cause, and the axis and atlas were the vertebrae most frequently affected. Surgical treatment was associated with high (36 %) perioperative mortality. However, all dogs that survived the perioperative period achieved functional recovery. Functional recovery was achieved in 25 (89 %) of 28 nonsurgically treated dogs with adequate follow-up. Overall, severity of neurological deficits (nonambulatory status) and prolonged interval (five days or longer) from trauma to referral were associated with poorer outcome. Nonsurgical treatment is a viable therapeutic approach for many dogs with cervical fractures. Early <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization</b> and prompt referral are recommended, because delay in referral decreases the likelihood of functional recovery. J Am Anim Hosp Assoc 1999; 35 : 135 – 46.

40|$|Introduction. Spinal simple bone cysts, {{also known}} as solitary cysts, are {{extremely}} unusual benign primary bone tumors with few cases reported in the literature. Case Presentation. Incidental Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) finding of a C 2 Simple bone cyst in a 13 -year-old female patient is reported. Complementary studies suggested the benign nature of the lesion. Patient underwent cervical curettage followed by tumor excision. A lateral submandibular approach to the upper cervical spine was used and careful bone resection was possible with a radiofrequency assisted burr and no instrumentation or fixation was required. The stability of the defect was ensured by filling it with bone allograft and by prescribing a postsurgical plastic cervical collar to maintain <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization.</b> Histological examination supported the diagnosis of simple bone cyst. At 6 – 12 -month follow-up the patient presented no recurrence or symptomatology. Conclusions. Solitary bone cysts are infrequent entities in the cervical vertebrae and preservation of spine stability without instrumentation to avoid neurological complications is often challenging. In this case, {{the proximity of the}} cyst to the right vertebral artery and the risk of injury were high; however the surgical approach used was successful and no recurrence or instability was evidenced on postoperative MRI...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preclinical {{evaluation of a}} novel immobilization system for patients undergoing external beam radiation treatment of head and <b>neck</b> tumors. An <b>immobilization</b> mask is manufactured directly from a 3 -D model, built using the CT data routinely acquired for treatment planning {{so there is no}} need to take plaster of Paris moulds. Research suggests that many patients find the mould room visit distressing and so rapid prototyping could potentially improve the overall patient experience. Evaluation of a computer model of the immobilization system using an anthropomorphic phantom shows that > 99 % of vertices are within a tolerance of ± 0. 2 mm. Hausdorff distance was used to analyze CT slices obtained by rescanning the phantom with a printed mask in position. These results show that for > 80 % of the slices the median “worse-case” tolerance is approximately 4 mm. These measurements suggest that printed masks can achieve similar levels of immobilization to those of systems currently in clinical use...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the Pentax AWS, and the LMA CTrach, in comparison with the Macintosh laryngoscope, when performing tracheal intubation in patients with <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization</b> using manual in-line axial cervical spine stabilization. Ninety patients undergoing anaesthesia who required tracheal intubation were randomly assigned to undergo intubation using a Macintosh (n= 30), LMA CTrach (n= 30), or AWS (n= 30) laryngoscope. All patients were intubated by one of the three anaesthetists familiar with the use of each laryngoscope. The intubation difficulty scores were significantly higher with the Macintosh laryngoscope and were significantly lower with the AWS compared with the LMA CTrach. All 30 patients were successfully intubated with the Macintosh and the AWS device, compared with 27 patients with the LMA CTrach. The duration of both the first and the successful tracheal intubation attempts was significantly longer with the LMA CTrach compared with the AWS and Macintosh laryngoscopes. A greater number of optimization manoeuvres were required to facilitate tracheal intubation with the LMA CTrach compared with the AWS laryngoscope. The AWS group had a significantly better Cormack and Lehane glottic view obtained at laryngoscopy compared with both other devices. The AWS laryngoscope has several advantages over the Macintosh laryngoscope, or LMA CTrach, in patients undergoing cervical spine immobilization...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the Pentax AWS, Glidescope, and the Truview EVO 2, in comparison with the Macintosh laryngoscope, when performing tracheal intubation in patients with <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization</b> using manual in-line axial cervical spine stabilization. One hundred and twenty consenting patients presenting for surgery requiring tracheal intubation were randomly assigned to undergo intubation using a Macintosh (n= 30), Glidescope (n= 30), Truview EVO 2 (n= 30), or AWS (n= 30) laryngoscope. All patients were intubated by one of the three anaesthetists experienced in the use of each laryngoscope. The Glidescope, AWS, and Truview EVO 2 each reduced the intubation difficulty score (IDS), improved the Cormack and Lehane glottic view, and reduced the need for optimization manoeuvres, compared with the Macintosh. The mean IDS was significantly lower with the Glidescope and AWS compared with the Truview EVO 2 device, and the IDS was lowest with the AWS. The duration of tracheal intubation attempts was significantly shorter with the Macintosh compared with the other devices. There were no differences in success rates between the devices tested. The AWS produced the least haemodynamic stimulation. The Glidescope and AWS laryngoscopes required more time but reduced intubation difficulty and improved glottic view over the Macintosh laryngoscope more than the Truview EVO 2 laryngoscope when used in patients undergoing cervical spine immobilization...|$|E
40|$|Context: The {{cervical}} spine {{has to be}} stabilized {{in patients}} with suspected cervical spine injury during laryngoscopy and intubation by manual in-line axial stabilization. This has the propensity to increase the difficulty of intubation. An attempt {{has been made to}} compare TruView EVO 2 and McCoy with cervical spine immobilization, which will aid the clinician in choosing an appropriate device for securing the airway with an endotracheal tube (ETT) in the clinical scenario of trauma. Aims: To compare the effectiveness of TruView EVO 2 and McCoy laryngoscopes when performing tracheal intubation in patients with <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization</b> using manual in-line axial cervical spine stabilization. Settings and design: K. M. C. Hospital, Mangalore, This was a randomized control clinical trial. Methods: Sixty adult patients of either sex of ASA physical status 1 and 2 who were scheduled to undergo general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were studied. Comparison of intubation difficulty score (IDS), hemodynamic response, Cormack and Lehane grade, duration of the tracheal intubation and rate of successful placement of the ETT in the trachea between TruView EVO 2 and McCoy laryngoscopes was performed. Results: The results demonstrated that TruView has a statistically significant less IDS of 0. 33 compared with an IDS of 1. 2 for McCoy. TruView also had a better Cormack and Lehane glottic view (CL 1 of 77 % versus 40 %) and less hemodynamic response. Conclusions: The TruView blade is a useful option for tracheal intubation in patients with suspected cervical spine injury...|$|E
40|$|Study Design: A {{clinical}} trial of 30 consecutive patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Objectives: To evaluate {{the effect of}} directed physical exercise in patients with CSM and to measure severity of myelopathy before and after an exercise program. Setting: Christian Medical College and Hospital, India. Participants: Thirty patients with CSM (mean age- 54. 1 years) with Nuricks Grade 2 and 3. Background: Myelopathy of the spinal cord {{can be caused by}} degenerative process of the cervical vertebrae and it is {{the most common type of}} dysfunction of the spinal cord in adult population. CSM usually develops insidiously and the natural history is not well understood, there is debate over the indication for operative Vs non operative management. Method: Patients participated in a 6 -week exercise program, consisting of active exercises to upper and lower extremities, scapulothoracic muscles, and gentle stretches, sub maximal isometric exercises of the deep neck flexors, relaxation and immobilization with a cervical collar. Main Outcome Measures: The mJOA (modified Japanese orthopaedic association score) and ASIA motor and sensory scoring. The results were processed by using Wilcoxon sign rank test. Results: After comparing the values at the beginning and end of the program a satisfactory neurological result (sensorimotor/motor and sensory) was obtained in all thirty patients. Conclusion: The exercise program had a positive impact for most of the variables of the study. Exercise intervention with <b>neck</b> <b>immobilization</b> may be a treatment of choice in early stages of CSM. Future randomized controlled studies would provide insight into the effectiveness and clinical relevance of this intervention...|$|E
