5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} the text and {{conversation}} exchange is reciprocal: text needs conversation and vice versa for the process of communication to occur. Text, or content, must have context to be effective and a conversation, or discourse, <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> beginning, middle and end. Individuals create the beginning, middle and end by using punctuation, bracketing or framing. When conversation is coupled with text, or meaning, communication occurs. Taylor submits this process is a translation process of: translation of text to conversation and the translation of conversation into text.|$|E

Its bulk is actually implemented in user mode, in the Plug and Play Service, which handles the often complex tasks of installing the appropriate drivers, notifying services and applications of the arrival of new devices, and displaying GUI to the user.|$|E
25|$|In Simple Electromagnetic Analysis (SEMA) attacks, the {{attacker}} deduces the key directly by observing the trace. It is very effective against asymmetric cryptography implementations. Typically, {{only a few}} traces are needed, though {{the attacker}} <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strong understanding of the cryptographic device and of {{the implementation of the}} cryptographic algorithm. An implementation vulnerable to SEMA attacks will perform a different operation depending on whether the bit of the key is 0 or 1, which will use different amounts of power and/or different chip components. This method is prevalent in many different types of side-channel attacks, in particular, power analysis attacks. Thus, the attacker can observe the entire computation of encryption and can deduce the key.|$|E
25|$|This sort of scheme <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> far broader base than is {{currently}} the case, it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One {{of the problems is}} once a demand for a waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a “waste” but a sellable commodity which often prices itself out of the market, c.f waste cement kiln dust and N-viro (lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer). In the former East Germany, organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state's control of agriculture; the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued.|$|E

25|$|Historically, in many countries, a {{contract}} <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> stamp affixed {{to make it}} valid. The charge for the stamp is either a fixed amount or {{a percentage of the}} value of the transaction. In most countries, the stamp has been abolished but stamp duty remains. Stamp duty is levied in the UK on the purchase of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments, and certain partnership transactions. Its modern derivatives, stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty land tax, are respectively charged on transactions involving securities and land. Stamp duty has the effect of discouraging speculative purchases of assets by decreasing liquidity. In the United States, transfer tax is often charged by the state or local government and (in the case of real property transfers) can be tied to the recording of the deed or other transfer documents.|$|E

They argued that these sensorimotor skills are essential to higher level skills like commonsense reasoning and that abstract reasoning was actually the least interesting or important human skill (see Moravec's paradox). They advocated building intelligence [...] "from the bottom up." ...|$|E

[...] The one firm conclusion to be drawn from the Guidance is that every commercial organisation that might be subject to the rigours of the Act <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> code of conduct in place that appropriately reflects the Guidance and to ensure its personnel are fully conversant with the risks and adequately trained.

He questioned the song choices, writing {{that the person who}} made the decision to not include [...] "Papi" [...] <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> [...] "long, hard look in the mirror", although it's [...] "hard to argue with most of what's on offer", Lopez [...] "slipping effortlessly into different guises with each song". He concluded by stating that: [...] "A cipher for good songs rather than the reasons those songs are good she may be, but there are few that do it better". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy too questioned the decisions of which songs appeared on the album, but wrote that: [...] "the very fact that she can't fit all her classics on to one disc can be seen as nothing more than a testament to her enduring career". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine pointed out that Lopez's other well or moderately charted songs such as [...] "Play", [...] "I'm Gonna Be Alright", [...] "I'm Glad", and [...] "Hold You Down" [...] were not present on the compilation, while also writing that her older hits didn't fit neatly with her newer songs and that it's sequencing was [...] "scattershot". Erlewine, nonetheless, said that [...] " [...] does have the familiar tunes, so it serves its purpose".|$|E
500|$|Although many of {{his works}} are orchestral, Jack Wall has worked {{in a wide variety}} of styles, {{including}} [...] "heavy metal meets orchestral" [...] and [...] "tribal percussion". For Jade Empire, he focused on using Chinese instruments and Taiko drums. When writing a video game score, Wall prefers a collaborative approach with the game designers to creating the music, as he feels that the [...] "tug back and forth of ideas" [...] makes the music stronger. He notes, however, that he has to be flexible, and willing to create his own vision for the music. As part of this, he prefers to be able to see illustrations and game design documents before beginning, as they provide insight into the feel of the game so that his music can mesh in with it. He also believes that a good video game music composer <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of technical sound production skill to be successful. Wall has said that the Myst and Mass Effect soundtracks are his favorites that he has created. Wall stated that he was primarily interested in scoring games that are [...] "interesting", and that his main concern was creating something original. Although he has worked with live orchestras and synthetic orchestras, Wall recommends that game developers use a live one, despite the expense, as he feels they add a much more dynamic sound to the music and allow the composer more freedom than synthesizer samples. He also wrote the book Legendary Bim Bang, the man who invented music. A picture book for ages 1 to 7 ...|$|E

2500|$|Team SA {{is defined}} as [...] "the degree to which every team member {{possesses}} the SA required {{for his or her}} responsibilities" [...] (Endsley, 1995b, p.39; see also Endsley, 1989). The success or failure of a team depends on {{the success or failure of}} each of its team members. If any one of the team members has poor SA, it can lead to a critical error in performance that can undermine the success of the entire team. By this definition, each team member <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> high level of SA on those factors that are relevant for his or her job. It is not sufficient for one member of the team to be aware of critical information if the team member who needs that information is not aware.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the issues}} Western {{designers}} have with the proa {{is the need to}} manipulate the sail when shunting. Even Munroe's early sails discarded the curved yards of the traditional crabclaw for the more familiar straight yards of the lateen and lug sails. Munroe's designs likely lacked the tilting mast because he was unaware of it, but many designers since have use a fixed mast, and provided some other way of adjusting the center of effort. [...] Most sailboats are designed with the center of effort of the sails slightly ahead of the center of area of the underwater plane; this difference is called [...] "lead." [...] In a proa hull, and in all fore and aft symmetric foils, the center of resistance is not at or even {{near the center of the}} boat, it is well forward of the geometric center of area. Thus the center of effort of the sails needs to also be well forward, or at least <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sail which is well forward which can be sheeted in to start the boat moving, allowing the rudders to bite and keep the boat from heading up when the entire sail area is sheeted in. [...] Jzero, for example, and all of Russell Brown's other designs, use a sloop rig and hoist a jib on whichever end is the current [...] "bow". Other designs use a schooner rig for the same effect.|$|E
