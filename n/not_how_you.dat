On July 30, 2012, Hamilton released a collaboration mixtape entitled Cinematic Hallucinations: The Bully And The Pet with rapper S.K.E. The Heistman. On August 17, 2012 during an interview Hamilton talked about his change in his music stating [...] "When I was incarcerated, my songs got a little more aggressive, but after I did some time and came back to NYC, I was a little upset at my fans because they were saying some pretty harsh things about me when I was locked up. This is <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> should approach somebody whos been showing you guys free love". Hamilton also talked about how mental illness and drug use didn't {{have anything to do with}} him taking a step back from music stating [...] "People were blaming insanity because certain details didn't hit the surface, but it had nothing to do with drugs, it had nothing to do with alcohol". Hamilton also discussed about his former deal with Interscope Records stating [...] "MC Lyte said it best it was a fight to get me off Interscope. I put out more projects than the entire Interscope roster from 2008 to 2010, and it took Eminem to come out and trump that, as far as getting physical sales numbers. Interscope had to choose between traditional and the new wave, and I said this new wave costs yall less money and less compromise but it took people on the inside to say to Interscope yall don't know what you're doing with this kid. A lot of the inner workings weren't made clear to me, and I took it very personally". On December 21, 2012 Hamilton released his extended play entitled The Come Down.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{said the}} Warden, [...] "that should {{depend upon the}} {{strength}} of your ground; and I understand {{you that there is}} some link wanting to establish it.

6000|$|... "I fear me {{that your}} money, or much of it, {{is in danger}} for Deleroy's bond is worthless, and since the land is already pledged without my knowledge, I have nowhere to turn for gold.

6000|$|... "Your news {{does not}} {{surprise}} me, and though I know <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> came by it, I {{fear that it}} is true. The news that the city gates have been all shut and are being guarded by strong parties of the butchers' rabble, shows but too surely that there is danger in the air.

6000|$|... "Friend Ana, we {{have passed}} a {{stirring}} hour together, the first perhaps of many, or mayhap the last. Also {{we were born}} upon the same day and therefore, unless the astrologers lie, as do other men--and women--beneath the same star.

6000|$|... "By {{the faith}} of Calvin, thou didst confess it, before all this goodly company! Wilt thou deny thine own words, knave, in the very face of justice? Thou canst read--thou hast it in thy countenance, and I would go nigh to swear, too, that thou hast some inkling of the quill, were the truth {{honestly}} said. Signor Grimaldi, I know <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> find this affair {{on the other side}} of the Alps, but with us, our greatest troubles come from these well-taught knaves, who, picking up knowledge fraudulently, use it with felonious intent, without thought of the wants and rights of the public." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "City, town, or village, {{you must}} sleep under no forest tree, sir. Let us ride on.

I know <b>not</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> may feel, sir, but a ten hours' ride when I was only prepared for half the time, and that, too, in an autumn night, makes me somewhat desirous of renewing my acquaintance with the kitchen-fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't as crafty {{as most of}} them, so I had to hold my own by brute force, and I did it; but, gad, how I {{accomplished}} it. The idea {{of fighting}} fair," [...] he laughed at the thought, [...] "was utterly unknown to me. If I'd ever have tried it I'd have seen my finish in a hurry. No one fought fair in my gang, {{or in any other}} gang that I ever ran up against. It was an honor to kill a man, and if you accomplished it by kicking him to death when he was unconscious it detracted nothing from the glory of your exploit--it was WHAT you did, <b>not</b> <b>HOW</b> <b>you</b> did it, that counted.|$|E
6000|$|He flung himself {{upon his}} knees before her, {{and tried to}} take her hand. [...] "You do <b>not</b> know <b>how</b> <b>you</b> have humbled me," [...] he groaned.|$|R
