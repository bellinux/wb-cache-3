A fine tuning of parameters will never balance a bad definition of the solution set, of the <b>neighbourhood</b> or the <b>cost</b> function. In this paper we try to compare two well known neighbourhood operators applied to the timetabling problem.

40|$|Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) is {{the centre}} for various major {{activities}} in Thailand including political, industry, agriculture, and commerce. Consequently, the BMR {{is the highest}} and most densely populated area in Thailand. Thus, the demand for houses in the BMR is also the largest, especially in subdivision developments. For these reasons, the subdivision development in the BMR has increased substantially in the past 20 years and generated large numbers of subdivision developments (AREA, 2009; Kridakorn Na Ayutthaya & Tochaiwat, 2010). However, this dramatic growth of subdivision development has caused several problems including unsustainable development, especially for subdivision neighbourhoods, in the BMR. There have been rating tools that encourage the sustainability of neighbourhood design in subdivision development, {{but they still have}} practical problems. Such rating tools do not cover the scale of the development entirely; and they concentrate more on the social and environmental conservation aspects, which have not been totally accepted by the developers (Boonprakub, 2011; Tongcumpou & Harvey, 1994). These factors strongly confirm the need for an appropriate rating tool for sustainable subdivision neighbourhood design in the BMR. To improve level of acceptance from all stakeholders in subdivision developments industry, the new rating tool should be developed based on an approach that unites the social, environmental, and economic approaches, such as eco-efficiency principle. Eco-efficiency is the sustainability indicator introduced by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) since 1992. The eco-efficiency is defined as the ratio of the product or service value according to its environmental impact (Lehni & Pepper, 2000; Sorvari et al., 2009). Eco-efficiency indicator is concerned to the business, while simultaneously, is concerned with to social and the environment impact. This study aims to develop a new rating tool named "Rating for sustainable subdivision neighbourhood design (RSSND) ". The RSSND methodology is developed by a combination of literature reviews, field surveys, the eco-efficiency model development, trial-and-error technique, and the tool validation process. All required data has been collected by the field surveys from July to November 2010. The ecoefficiency model is a combination of three different mathematical models; the neighbourhood property price (NPP) model, the <b>neighbourhood</b> development <b>cost</b> (NDC) model, and the <b>neighbourhood</b> occupancy <b>cost</b> (NOC) model which are attributable to the neighbourhood subdivision design. The NPP model is formulated by hedonic price model approach, while the NDC model and NOC model are formulated by the multiple regression analysis approach. The trial-and-error technique is adopted for simplifying the complex mathematic eco-efficiency model to a user-friendly rating tool format. Credibility of the RSSND has been validated by using both rated and non-rated of eight subdivisions. It is expected to meet the requirements of all stakeholders which support the social activities of the residents, maintain the environmental condition of the development and surrounding areas, and meet the economic requirements of the developers...|$|R

40|$|Shelter {{is a major}} cost in most family budgets. The amount a {{household}} is able or willing topay for housing determines not only {{the quality of the}} dwelling but also the choice of community or <b>neighbourhood.</b> Indeed, housing <b>costs</b> affect dispos-able income, access to jobs, health status, and general inclusion in society (Carter and Polevychok 2004). However, housing costs are not uniform, with owners and renters differing sharply. A little over 20 % of the household budget goes to shelter costs among renters but only 13 % among homeowners. 1 Determining housing affordability is complex. For example, some households may choose to spend more on housing because they feel they can afford to, while others may not have a choice. Traditionally, affor-dability has been based on a ratio of housing costs to total household income. A household paying 30 % o...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{increase}} of imperviousness {{in urban areas}} and the {{increase of}} heavy storm events trigger the urge for more sustainable urban water systems to combat flooding in Brazil. In developed countries source control measures {{have been developed to}} combat the negative impact of these two factors and more sustainable urban water systems are developed. In developing countries, however, this is not the case. Most solutions in developing countries still focus on end-of-pipe measures. Rapid urbanization during the last decades, without adequate urban planning, has resulted in severe hydrologic and environmental impacts in Brazilian cities. This has already led to drought and flooding problems. Continuing this developing pattern, by increasing the imperviousness in urban areas, as well as expanding cities by low-density developments, will lead to exacerbation of these problems and does not lead to a sustainable water system. The sanitary philosophy, by which urban drainage systems are based on the concept of draining the water from urban surfaces as quickly as possible, is still much applied in Brazil. Canalization of urban streams, clandestine urban flood plain occupation, a lack of environmental awareness, a large sediment production and a large amount of solid waste disposal into the drainage system have lead to a systematic degradation process of urban streams. The triplet applied in The Netherlands of first retaining, then storing and ultimately discharging of stormwater contributes to a more stable urban drainage system. Measures like bioretention cells, infiltration trenches, green roofs and micro-reservoirs are getting more and more common practice in drainage systems in developed countries. Through a case study in a 6 km 2 urban catchment (part of the Arroio da Areia catchment) in the city of Porto Alegre, the influence of different drainage approaches on the runoff is assessed. The catchment is modelled with the SWMM 5 stormwater model, applying the kinematic wave approach. By modelling the current drainage system the bottlenecks are identified. In the current situation flooding occurs in 14 of the 31 nodes when modelled by a 10 -year return period storm. The total flooding volume accounts up to almost 30, 000 m 3. The construction costs of the current macro drainage system are estimated at R$ 14. 3 M. The objective of this case study is to present and assess alternative drainage approaches to combat these flooding problems and to present recommendations for future developments. It is shown that enlargement of the conduit diameters in the current drainage system layout to combat flooding is almost 2 times more expensive than solving the flooding problem by implanting detention basins or by adopting low impact development. It is also shown that the peak runoff produced by enlargement of the current drainage system is between 1. 5 to 2 times higher than the peak runoff generated in case detention ponds or low impact development is adopted. It is concluded that by continuing development in the conventional way, by accelerating discharge of runoff and building low-density <b>neighbourhoods,</b> <b>costs</b> for society as well as the impact on the environment and on the liveability in the city are redundantly high. It is recommended that low impact development demonstration projects should be developed to build capacity among urban water and drainage professionals, in municipal departments as well as among companies active in the sector, and to increase awareness about the environment among the population.

There trajectories are constructed by analytic and numerical search methods, and hybrid optimization algorithms including global search and local search to find the optimal rendezvous opportunities. The best rendezvous opportunities for currently known EROs in the next 20 years are reported. The relevant mission costs are analyzed.

30|$|In paper two, Lena Sterzer {{examines}} the important relationship between housing competition, people’s mobility and accessibility in the Munich Metropolitan Region of Germany. This case study selection {{is important because}} of the highly competitive nature of level of the housing market, especially within the more accessible inner-city areas of Munich. Her research suggests that in this context, low income households with little financial flexibility make compromises concerning accessibility-related decision criteria when searching for a residential location. They cannot neither afford housing in the accessible inner-city <b>neighbourhoods,</b> or the <b>costs</b> of transport and mobility by locating in less well-connected suburban areas unaffordable. As such their housing choices are extremely limited, {{and as a consequence}} they have little or no opportunity to relocate to places where new employment opportunities might arise for them. This severely reduces their social inclusion, life chances and quality of life. Her research used semi-structured, ‘problem centred’ interviews with seventeen, low-income earners who had recently moved within the Munich area. One key issue to emerge from the interviews was that many of these relocations were essentially enforced, {{because it was the only}} option to sustain a living, or because it had become unbearable to continue living in their previous home, e.g. because of severe health constraints. Their top priority in choosing a new home after considering its affordability is good access to public transport which is seen a literally a lifeline to connect them to jobs, schools, shops and healthcare services.|$|R
40|$|Asteroids and comets are of {{strategic}} importance for science {{in an effort}} to understand the formation, evolution and composition of the Solar System. Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are of particular interest because of their accessibility from Earth, but also because of their speculated wealth of material resources. The exploitation of these resources has long been discussed as a means to lower the cost of future space endeavours. In this paper, we consider the currently known NEO population and define a family of so-called Easily Retrievable Objects (EROs), objects that can be transported from accessible heliocentric orbits into the Earth’s <b>neighbourhood</b> at affordable <b>costs.</b> The asteroid retrieval transfers are sought from the continuum of low energy transfers enabled by the dynamics of invariant manifolds; specifically, the retrieval transfers target planar, vertical Lyapunov and halo orbit families associated with the collinear equilibrium points of the Sun-Earth Circular Restricted Three Body problem. The judicious use of these dynamical features provides the best opportunity to find extremely low energy Earth transfers for asteroid material. A catalogue of asteroid retrieval candidates is then presented. Despite the highly incomplete census of very small asteroids, the ERO catalogue can already be populated with 12 different objects retrievable with less than 500 m/s of Δv. Moreover, the approach proposed represents a robust search and ranking methodology for future retrieval candidates that can be automatically applied to the growing survey of NEOs...|$|R
40|$|During {{the master}} {{planning}} of neighbourhoods, design decisions {{related to the}} urban layout and typology affect the building form and availability of solar radiation considerably. The influence of those decisions on the energy demand for heating is often neglected however because appropriate energy simulation tools are lacking. This paper proposes a simple and accurate design tool to assess the solar gains and heating energy demand in buildings during the master planning phase of neighbourhoods. Detailed information on building geometry, constituting building elements and solar obstructions, is extracted from a 3 D neighbourhood model using a plugin implemented in the modelling software SketchUp. This information is {{used to assess the}} heating energy demand of the buildings in the neighbourhood based on the dynamic Equivalent Heating Degree Day (dEHDD) method. Furthermore, the associated financial and environmental impacts are calculated based on an integrated life cycle approach, combining Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Environmental Life Cycle Assessment (E-LCA) respectively. The design tool proposed is implemented for the Belgian context and used to analyse a number of schematic residential neighbourhood models with diverse built densities. The analysis reveals substantial differences in heating energy demand, life cycle financial and environmental <b>costs.</b> <b>Neighbourhoods</b> with a high built density and compact building types have a lower heating energy demand with potential reductions of up to 40 % compared to neighbourhoods with a low built density and detached building types. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Near Earth Asteroids are {{attractive}} targets for new space missions; firstly, {{because of their}} scientific importance, {{but also because of}} their impact threat and prospective resources. The asteroid retrieval mission concept has thus arisen as a synergistic approach to tackle these three facets of interest in one single mission. This paper reviews the methodology used by the authors (2013) in a previous search for objects that could be transported from accessible heliocentric orbits into the Earth's <b>neighbourhood</b> at affordable <b>costs</b> (or Easily Retrievable Objects, a. k. a. EROs). This methodology consisted of a heuristic pruning and an impulsive manoeuvre trajectory optimisation. Low thrust propulsion on the other hand clearly enables the transportation of much larger objects due to its much higher specific impulse. Hence, in this paper, low thrust retrieval transfers are sought using impulsive trajectories as first guesses to solve the optimal control problem. GPOPS-II is used to transcribe the continuous-time optimal control problem to a nonlinear programming problem (NLP). The latter is solved by IPOPT, an open source software package for large-scale NLPs. Finally, a natural continuation procedure that increases the asteroid mass allows to find out the largest objects that could be retrieved from a given asteroid orbit. If this retrievable mass is larger than the actual mass of the asteroid, the asteroid retrieval mission for this particular object is said to be feasible. The paper concludes with an updated list of 17 EROs, as of April 2016, with their maximum retrievable masses by means of low thrust propulsion. This ranges from 2, 000 t for the easiest object to be retrieved to 300 t for the least accessible of them...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to provide a clearer understanding of the non-shelter impacts of housing, and in particular of the possible processes by which aspects of housing may impact on aspects of schooling. The intention is not to prove a causal relationship, rather to shed light on mechanisms. To that end the approach taken is qualitative, involving in-depth semi-structured interviews with a sample of public housing tenants and a smaller group of educators. This thesis begins with an examination of previous research around this topic. This review identifies past studies that highlight the possible negative effects of transience as a contributor to isolation; the role that neighbourhood may play in encouraging or discouraging the valuing of schooling; a possible link between crowding and punitive parenting practices; and the impact that high housing costs can have on stress levels and therefore health. This thesis details research that builds on this earlier body of work. Given findings from earlier studies (in particular the importance of neighbourhood effects identified in some United States� studies), a sampling framework was developed to ensure a reasonable number of households who had experienced a change in neighbourhood as well as housing conditions. As well, an interview schedule was developed to provide a framework to ensure that possible pathways between housing and schooling identified in earlier research would be explored in these interviews. Public tenants were chosen as the population group from which to draw the interview sample, as this group have undergone a significant housing change (when they moved into public housing), and their income levels increase the chances of them having lived in poor quality housing in the past. A small number of interviews with educators were also conducted. Schools were chosen randomly from outer suburbs where poor quality housing and transience were expected to impact on school populations. As well an inner-city school in a gentrifying suburb was also selected for interview. These interviews identified four main themes � transience, housing amenity, <b>neighbourhood</b> and <b>cost.</b> Transience may be a significant problem for children who are already struggling in the school system, especially those who are receiving school based remediation. For these children, moving house may interrupt important remediation work at school, and may result in children falling further and further behind their peers. Also, transience may contribute to family stress levels which may impact on health and happiness, thereby reducing motivation and levels of school attendance. Housing amenity can impact on health, as a result of injuries related to poorly maintained or designed housing, from stress associated with noise and broken sleep, and from insect born illnesses due to the absence of insect screens. Possibly the most significant housing amenity related health impact seems to be due to the link between asthma, and dust and mildew. Neighbourhood seems to have {{the potential to be a}} significant positive and negative force in people�s lives. Supportive neighbours can make single parenting much less stressful, for example by helping with child-care, increasing the sense of safety, and reducing isolation. Hostile neighbours, on the other hand, can create levels of stress that may force adults and children indoors to avoid conflict. High housing costs can cause significant stress for families. For those who are already suffering from stress this additional pressure may contribute to stress related ill-health. As well, these families may not be able to afford to eat properly, and may not be able to afford to pay for extra-curricula activities such as school outings, dance classes etc. Poor diet may contribute to increased incidents of illness, and extra days missed from school. These insights suggest some changed approaches to the design and delivery of housing assistance in Australia, so as to maximise the non-shelter benefits of such interventions...|$|R
