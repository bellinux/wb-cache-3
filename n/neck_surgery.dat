On March 19, Sports Illustrated posted an article on its website in its {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. That article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained HGH. Copeland has previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 after <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> as an experiment on TSN's Off The Record with Michael Landsberg in January 2005. He said, he felt it slowed him down, so he quickly got off the substance. According to Copeland, he took HGH after returning from a spinal fusion <b>neck</b> <b>surgery.</b> He was told by doctors that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. He claims to have taken blood tests, consulted doctors, studied the drug, and got prescriptions before deciding to take them.|$|E

5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during <b>neck</b> <b>surgery,</b> especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. The nerve is permanently damaged in 0.33% of thyroid surgery, and transiently in 38% of surgeries, {{and is one of the}} leading causes of medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E
5|$|After a May 23 <b>neck</b> <b>surgery,</b> Manning {{could not}} use the Colts' {{facilities}} for practice and workouts due to the NFL lockout. Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers at Coors Field in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him {{in the late summer}} that he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return to the NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback.

Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly. In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> and out of action for a year.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSeveral {{methods have}} been {{recommended}} to detect parathyroid lesions in patients who have previously undergone <b>neck</b> <b>surgeries,</b> including radio-guided surgery or intraoperative ultrasounds. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the radio-guided excision of pathologic parathyroid lesions allowed us to find affected lesions in patients who had previously undergone neck operations. MethodsThis prospective study included 18 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism who had previously undergone <b>neck</b> <b>surgeries.</b> The pathologic parathyroid lesions were localized by ultrasonography, and a radiotracer was injected directly into the lesions. ResultsCareful dissections were carried out by following the area of maximum radioactivity until the lesions were identified and excised. Eighteen parathyroid adenomas were removed in 18 patients. The median count from each lesion {{was significantly higher than}} the values measured from the adjacent tissues and the lesion beds (12550 / 20  s, 370 / 20  s, and 35 / 20  s, respectively; p <  0. 001).

5|$|On April 6, Dumas {{suffered}} {{what appeared}} to be a stinger while filming a fight scene for a role in the season finale of the television program Dark Angel. The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent <b>neck</b> <b>surgery</b> under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on Sunday Night Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002.

40|$|Head {{and neck}} cancers often require complex, labor-intensive surgeries, {{especially}} when free flap reconstruction is required. Enhanced recovery {{is important in}} this patient population but evidence-based protocols on perioperative care for this population are lacking. To provide a consensus-based protocol for optimal perioperative care of patients undergoing head and <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> with free flap reconstruction. Following endorsement by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society to develop this protocol, a systematic review was conducted for each topic. The PubMed and Cochrane databases were initially searched to identify relevant publications on head and <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> from 1965 through April 2015. Consistent key words for each topic included "head and neck surgery," "pharyngectomy," "laryngectomy," "laryngopharyngectomy," "neck dissection," "parotid lymphadenectomy," "thyroidectomy," "oral cavity resection," "glossectomy," and "head and neck. " The final selection of literature included meta-analyses and systematic reviews as well as randomized controlled trials where available. In the absence of high-level data, case series and nonrandomized studies in head and <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> patients or randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews in non-head and <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> patients, were considered. An international panel of experts in major head and <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> and enhanced recovery after surgery reviewed and assessed the literature for quality and developed recommendations for each topic based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. All recommendations were graded following a consensus discussion among the expert panel. The literature search, including a hand search of reference lists, identified 215 relevant publications that {{were considered to be}} the best evidence for the topic areas. A total of 17 topic areas were identified for inclusion in the protocol for the perioperative care of patients undergoing major head and <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> with free flap reconstruction. Best practice includes several elements of perioperative care. Among these elements are the provision of preoperative carbohydrate treatment, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, perioperative antibiotics in clean-contaminated procedures, corticosteroid and antiemetic medications, short acting anxiolytics, goal-directed fluid management, opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia, frequent flap monitoring, early mobilization, and the avoidance of preoperative fasting. The evidence base for specific perioperative care elements in head and <b>neck</b> cancer <b>surgery</b> is variable and in many cases information from different surgerical procedures form the basis for these recommendations.
