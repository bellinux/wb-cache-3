30|$|In {{the current}} {{competitive}} market, the chain intends {{to increase its}} presence by opening some <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> with a constrained budget. There are l potential locations for opening <b>new</b> <b>facilities.</b> One of the major constraints in the proposed model {{that leads to the}} chain’s lack of accurate information about the number of <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> is the budget. Obviously, different potential locations and different design levels have various costs. Therefore, the optimal combination of the number of <b>new</b> <b>facilities,</b> their locations and their design levels is not predetermined. So, the chain aims at determining the optimal location and the design level of its <b>new</b> <b>facilities.</b> In addition, the number of <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> is also endogenously determined by the model.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{determining}} the optimal locations for the leader’s <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> under {{the condition that}} the number of the follower’s <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> is unknown for the leader. The leader and the follower have some facilities in advance. The first competitor, the leader, opens p <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> in order to increase her own market share. On the other hand, she knows that her competitor, the follower, will react to her action and locate his <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> as well. The number of the follower’s <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> is unknown for the leader but it is assumed that the leader knows the probability of opening different numbers of the follower’s <b>new</b> <b>facilities.</b> The leader aims at maximizing her own market share after the follower’s <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> entry. The follower’s objective is also to maximize his own market share. Since the number of the follower’s <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> is unknown for leader, “Robust Optimization” is used for maximizing the leader’s market share and making the obtained results “robust” in various scenarios in terms of different numbers of the follower’s <b>new</b> <b>facilities.</b> The optimal locations for <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> of both the leader and the follower are chosen among pre-determined potential locations. It is assumed that the demand is inelastic. The customers probabilistically meet their demands from all different facilities and the demand level which is met by each facility is computed by Huff rule. The computational experiments have been applied to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a new HCDFA {{has been}} {{presented}} for a competitive location problem. The problem under study is to identify the location and design of <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> under the budget constraint. The number of <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> is also endogenously determined by the model. The proposed model {{has been used for}} a real-world application of locating new chain stores in the city of Tehran, Iran. The proposed model can answer three questions in a static competition environment: (1) How many <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> should be opened? (2) Where should the optimal <b>new</b> <b>facilities</b> be located among the potential ones? (3) What is the optimal design level of the <b>new</b> <b>facilities?</b> The computational experiments depict the high efficiency of the algorithm regarding the time and quality of the solutions.|$|R

5|$|After 1952, Willamette Law {{received}} a large Lady Justice statue when the Marion County Courthouse was demolished {{to make way}} for a new one. In 1959, the school started a law review, while enrollment increased to 185 by the mid-1960s. Because of the increased enrollment, the College of Law Foundation was created by the university's trustees in 1959 to explore the construction of a <b>new</b> <b>facility.</b> Willamette switched to the awarding of the Juris Doctor from the bachelor of laws, phased in beginning in 1965.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of success under head coach Dan McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium.

The official dedication for the $3.2 million facility occurred on August 12, 2006, with Governor Jim Doyle, U.S. Representative Paul Ryan and Racine County Executive Bill McReynolds in attendance. Service would be discontinued at the 1901-depot the following day with the <b>new</b> <b>facility</b> opening for passenger service on August 14, 2006. The shuttered, 1901 station would subsequently be deconstructed and relocated to Caledonia between August and October 2009.|$|E
5|$|By 1932, the Vassar {{population}} had outgrown the Alumnae Gymnasium and a <b>new</b> <b>facility,</b> the Helen Kenyon Hall of Physical Education, was built. Kenyon featured a new indoor pool (which, at , made {{it one of}} the United States' largest indoor swimming pools), as well as tennis, squash, and handball courts. Consequently, in 1933, the Alumnae Gymnasium was renamed Ely Hall after its early benefactor. In that same year, the building underwent minor renovation to convert some of the building's back rooms to an outpatient clinic, nurses' quarters, and doctors' offices.|$|E
