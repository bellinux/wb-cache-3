5|$|Shannen Says is an eight-episode American reality {{television}} series which was broadcast on WE tv from April 10 to May 13, 2012. It focused on {{preparations for the}} wedding of actress Shannen Doherty and photographer Kurt Iswarienko, with help from celebrity-wedding planner David Tutera. The series' premise originated from a discussion between Doherty and Iswarienko about providing a look into their lives and document the stress {{on a couple of}} planning their wedding. The series' executive producers included Doherty, Iswarienko, Kathleen Farrell, Tom Forman, and Russell Heldt. It was filmed in Malibu, California over a seven-week period, and was produced by RelativityREAL and Doherty's production company <b>No</b> <b>Apologies</b> Productions. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video under the title Shannen Says, Season 1, but was not made available on DVD or Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} filmed over a seven-week period at the couple's home in Malibu and nearby locations. Production began in August 2011, with an {{original}} release date scheduled for January 2012. The title was set as Shannen Says before its premiere, and the wedding took place and was filmed on October 15, 2011. The series {{was produced by}} Doherty's company, <b>No</b> <b>Apologies</b> Production. Although she was initially hesitant {{about the lack of}} privacy during filming, she felt more comfortable when the bedroom was set as off-limits for the show. David Tutera, a wedding planner and host of My Fair Wedding with David Tutera, acted as Doherty's event planner. The series also featured Doherty's friends, Roxana Zal, Tim Bitici, and Roger Castillo, and her mother, Rosa. According to Doherty, her mother was well-received by fans on Twitter. Doherty explained that viewers liked that her mother appeared more naturally rather than being styled by the show's crew.|$|E

500|$|The novel Drive by James Sallis was {{published}} in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was [...] "the kind of character you rarely see anymore [...] {{he was a man}} with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> for it". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Slap-Happy {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Marc Weingarten of Rolling Stone praised the band for [...] "doing punk metal right", commenting that Slap-Happy [...] "is all hopped-up, pared-down riffage with <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> or gratuitous change-ups." [...] Q magazine highlighted the album for its [...] "distinctive punk noise", which [...] "stays {{roughly the same}} but evolves enough to be interesting." [...] In contrast, Craig Daniels of Exclaim! criticized the album's sound for being [...] "sterile and lacking in energy" [...] compared to previous L7 albums, but overall considered Slap-Happy to be [...] "a fairly solid record".|$|E

500|$|During 1940, Friedman was {{appointed}} {{an assistant professor}} teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and {{decided to return to}} government service. From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government, as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury. As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation. He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system, since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war. He later said, [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> for it, but I really wish we hadn't found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now." ...|$|E
500|$|Savile Row's {{reputation}} {{is built on}} bespoke tailoring, where each suit is made to individually fit. The term [...] "bespoke", which has an etymology developing from [...] "to exclaim" [...] through [...] "discussed in advance" [...] and is generally understood to mean [...] "made to order", became associated with fine tailoring, with tailors claiming that the term has been in common use for tailoring since the 17th century. Savile Row tailors argue that [...] "bespoke", in relation to tailoring, is understood to mean a suit cut and made by hand; however, after a ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority in 2008, the term may now also be applied to machine sewed garments, provided they are made-to-measure. Suits, at Kilgour & French, cost at least £5000. The Creative Director Carlo Brandelli makes <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> for the cost. Brandelli insists: [...] "That the street’s tailors have been underselling themselves for generations, certainly compared to the couture houses of Paris." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Forgive Me" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The BBC {{review of the}} single called [...] "Forgive Me" [...] a [...] "danceable funky pop song". Gavin Martin of The Mirror said, [...] " [...] showcases her voice of fire and honey. <b>No</b> <b>apologies</b> necessary". Nick Levine, Digital Spy music critic, gave the song three out of five stars, comparing it with Whitney Houston's song [...] "I'm Your Baby Tonight" [...] saying that after her previous three ballad singles, [...] "it's a nice change". However, he also said, [...] "the adultery-themed lyrics are a poor match for the sweet, unassuming Hackney girl". Chad Grischow noted that with the song Lewis [...] "will not go down as a glorified one-hit wonder". Stephen Thomas Erlewine described [...] "Forgive Me", and another song ("Misses Glass") from the album as [...] "just slightly glitzier {{than the rest of}} Spirit." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the single 'bouncy and youthful'. The New York Times criticised Lewis for being [...] "a second-tier Mariah" [...] on the song.|$|E

The Mayor, Rob Drew, believed the centre development should be an exciting time for Port Macquarie and was critical of opposition to the project, characterising it as [...] "slanderous accusations" [...] and [...] "fomenting discontent". He acknowledged the report raised concerns about the processes behind the project, but insisted the project itself was sound, saying in a press release, [...] "I for one make <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> {{that this is a}} multi-purpose facility which will provide for performers, community groups, which will provide for conferences, seminars and meetings, which will provide for activities never seen before in Port Macquarie." [...] Harrison meanwhile told ABC News, [...] "The report has said categorically that [...] Council has lied to the community about the cost of the arts centre at every opportunity it's had and it's put a gloss or a spin on it".|$|E
500|$|The Morning Call Larry Printz {{published}} a negative review, concluding that James' performance was mediocre {{and that the}} [...] "nuances in [...] once-formidable voice are long gone". Printz also criticized the slow tempo throughout the album and accused James of [...] "coasting" [...] on her legendary status. James Sullivan of Entertainment Weekly wrote that James' [...] "voice isn't quite the nasty snarl it once was, but the attitude remains". Sullivan thought [...] "Hound Dog" [...] was the album's best composition. Rolling Stone Marie Elsie St. Léger wrote that James provided a [...] "healthy dose of rootsy feminism and mettle" [...] with her [...] "passionately seasoned and gravel-edged voice". St. Léger also complimented James and her performance for having [...] "inimitable depth" [...] and for [...] "making <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> and needing no permission to sing it like she feels it". Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone named [...] "Don't Let My Baby Ride", [...] "Hawg for Ya" [...] and [...] "Come Back Baby" [...] as the album's greatest tracks. In his review, Puterbaugh concluded that the album is a [...] "solid return to roots", allowing James the right to reclaim her titular throne.|$|E
500|$|In its year end {{review of}} albums {{released}} in 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Rebel Heart at number 45 noting: [...] "How {{did it take}} this long for Madonna to write herself a theme song titled 'Unapologetic Bitch'? <b>No</b> <b>apologies</b> offered or needed—Rebel Heart was the queen's finest album in a decade, picking up the disco-stick baton of her 2005 Confessions on a Dance Floor as Madonna voyages back into the groove and reflects on where she's been lately". It was also listed at number six on its ranking of the 20 Best Pop Albums of 2015. Similarly, in its year end review, Spin magazine listed the album at number 21 as Andrew Unterberger noted that: [...] "For most artists who spent whole decades defining the mainstream, titling an album Rebel Heart would seem misguided at best, but for Madonna, it's truer now than ever: A fifty-something refusing to bend to public demands about how she should age gracefully... is as big an act of defiance as you can stage in contemporary pop music". AllMusic called Rebel Heart {{as one of their}} Favorite Pop Albums of 2015, describing it as: [...] "Bold, messy, and life-affirming record that finds Madonna simultaneously looking forward and back".|$|E

Sonically, however, it captures the Evanescence mythos {{better and more}} {{consistently}} than the first album - after all, Lee now has <b>no</b> <b>apologies</b> of being the thinking man's nu-metal chick, now that she's a star". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called the album [...] "less fun", [...] and {{said some of the}} songs are similar to each other. St. Louis Post-Dispatchs Sara Berry critiqued, [...] " [...] sound remains essentially the same: the strange but amicable marriage of churning guitar riffs to lead singer Amy Lee's silky soprano". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called the album a 45-minute [...] "romantic piece" [...] and said, [...] "if [...] featured more open-throated crooning and less teeth-gritting anger it would be a much more interesting record". She also added that the sound of the album gets [...] "black and blacker" [...] and, [...] "Lyrics tend toward repetition of words like 'darkness,' 'haunting,' and 'rage'". Christa Titus of Billboard called it a [...] "far more nuanced, moody and richly textured effort" [...] than Fallen. Postmedia News gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "While it's similar in style and sound to its predecessor, The Open Door loses the punchy power rifts and instead persuades the listener with piano and airy vocals". Andre Farias of Christianity Today admitted that [...] "The sound is loud, yes, but it's almost indistinguishable from its predecessor—a disappointment considering the opus was nearly three-and-a-half years in the making".|$|E
