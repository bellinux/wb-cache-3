The {{ultimate}} rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake.|$|E
25|$|In {{a popular}} {{personal}} report called Tre dagar med Victoria, which profiled her work during a three-day period that aired on TV4 in December 2004, Victoria commented on criticism directed at Westling, “Many unfair things are written. I {{understand that there}} is speculation, but some day justice will be done there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days it is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible to do a good job.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Díaz was never sympathetic to all Indians. In fact, {{he stated that}} the Yaquis and the Mayas {{had always been a}} pest for Mexico and that they needed to be dealt with. This {{is not to say that}} Díaz loved the rest of Mexico’s Indians. Perhaps, it could be argued that Díaz’s ultimate drive was that of economic expansion. Once Díaz amassed absolute legislative power, his indigenismo went out of the picture. It was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> elevating the lower classes into modern society and thus integrating them, but more about the economic and power status of the nation. After all, Indians composed less than half of Mexico’s population and their unwillingness to participate in the dominant culture made them political enemies of the state, especially those who persistently refused assimilation like the Yaqui and the Maya.|$|E

[...] He admitted, [...] "I've been trying to find a redeeming feature to Palpatine, and the only one I've got so far is that he's clearly a patron of the arts because he goes to the opera."

500|$|The {{themes of}} The Sun Also Rises appear in its two epigraphs.

One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose."

500|$|A small {{elite of}} black urbanites, mostly raised and educated at Christian missions, existed in Southern Rhodesia {{by the time}} of the war, and these {{generally}} identified themselves strongly with settler society and, by extension, the war effort. But the vast majority of black people in the colony retained their traditional tribal lifestyles of rural subsistence farming, and for most of them, as McLaughlin comments, the war [...] "could have been fought between aliens from different planets for all their connection with events in Europe". Some felt obliged to [...] "fight for their country", seeing the travails of Rhodesia and the Empire as their own also, but the great bulk of tribal public opinion was detached, seeing the conflict as a [...] "white man's war" [...] that did not concern them. Those who favoured the latter line of thinking cared <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the conflict itself but more about how its course might affect them specifically. For example, widespread interest was aroused soon after the outbreak of war when rumours began to fly between the rural black communities that the Company planned to conscript them. News of the Maritz Rebellion prompted a fresh rumour among the Matabele that Company officials might confiscate tribal livestock to feed the white troops going south. None of this actually occurred.|$|E
500|$|Scholars and {{academics}} have offered many possible readings of American Beauty; film critics are similarly divided, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> {{the quality of}} the film, as their interpretations of it. Described by many as about [...] "the meaning of life" [...] or [...] "the hollow existence of the American suburbs", the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers. Mendes is indecisive, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it: [...] "a mystery story, a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, a series of love stories; it was about imprisonment, loneliness, [...] beauty. It was funny; it was angry, sad." [...] The literary critic and author Wayne C. Booth concludes that the film resists any one interpretation: [...] " [...] cannot be adequately summarized as 'here is a satire on what's wrong with American life'; that plays down the celebration of beauty. It is more tempting to summarize it as 'a portrait of the beauty underlying American miseries and misdeeds', but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror, and Ball's disgust with our mores. It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live." [...] He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center—a controlling voice who [...] " [...] all of the choices". He contends that in American Beautys case, it is neither Mendes nor Ball. Mendes considers the voice to be Ball's, but even while the writer was [...] "strongly influential" [...] on set, he often had to accept deviations from his vision, particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic. With [...] "innumerable voices intruding on the original author's," [...] Booth says, those who interpret American Beauty [...] "have forgotten to probe for the elusive center". According to Booth, the film's true controller is the creative energy [...] "that hundreds of people put into its production, agreeing and disagreeing, inserting and cutting".|$|E

2500|$|In a {{scholarly}} article on The Old Glory, Baruch Hochman praised all three plays, writing, [...] "Lowell the dramatist matches Lowell the poet."

As a trilogy, the plays examine the bond between the powers that oppress and the powers that seek to overthrow them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{blackness}} in the United States {{has been described}} as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream African-American culture, politics, and values. To a certain extent, this concept is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> race but more about political orientation, culture and behavior. Blackness can be contrasted with [...] "acting white", where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to fashion, dialect, taste in music, and possibly, {{from the perspective of a}} significant number of black youth, academic achievement.|$|E
2500|$|Francis can be {{understood}} as in close continuity with the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) whose teachings were “founded on the Bible, more directly than those of any previous ecumenical council”. [...] With Vatican II “the monopoly exercised by neo-Thomists in the church collapsed” and Christianity increased its appeal to non-Western cultures. This both explains the world-wide appeal of Pope Francis and the practical differences that he experiences within the Catholic church: it's <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> individual issues as about whether one prioritizes the New Testament over neo-Thomism (the scholastic philosophy of recent history).|$|E

2500|$|Hubert Cunliffe-Jones {{identifies}} {{two opposing}} Eastern Orthodox {{opinions about the}} Filioque: a [...] "liberal" [...] view and a [...] "rigorist" [...] view. The [...] "liberal" [...] view sees the controversy as being largely a matter of mutual miscommunication and misunderstanding. In this view, both East and West are at fault for failing {{to allow for a}} [...] "plurality of theologies". Each side went astray in considering their theological framework as the only one that was doctrinally valid and applicable. Thus, neither side would accept that the dispute was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> conflicting dogmas as it was about different theologoumena or theological perspectives. While all Christians must be in agreement on questions of dogma, there is room for diversity in theological approaches.|$|E
2500|$|In two respects Bell's 1964 {{paper was}} a step forward {{compared}} to the EPR paper: firstly, it considered more hidden variables than merely the element of physical reality in the EPR paper; and Bell's inequality was, in part, experimentally testable thus raising the possibility of testing the local realism hypothesis. Limitations on such tests to date are noted below. [...] Whereas Bell's paper deals only with deterministic hidden variable theories, Bell's theorem was later generalized to stochastic theories as well, {{and it was also}} realised that the theorem is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> hidden variables, as about the outcomes of measurements that could have been taken instead of the one actually taken. Existence of these variables is called the assumption of realism, or the assumption of counterfactual definiteness.|$|E
