5000|$|Under the {{armistice}} conditions the Vichy regime {{was allowed to}} use 64 Panhards for police service. These vehicles, mainly taken from the May-June production batches, had their guns removed and replaced with an additional machine gun. On orders of the Army, the Camouflage du Matériel branch, Engineer J. Restany, using the false name [...] "J-J. Ramon", from April 1941 clandestinely produced 45 new turrets, fitted with a 47 mm SA 35 (about twenty) or a 25 mm gun in order to equip an equal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hulls</b> hidden from the Germans; some were eventually combined with the hulls for trial purposes. The turrets were of a new design but strongly resembled Restany's 47 mm turret of June 1940. They used twenty millimetre armour plates for the vertical surfaces and ten millimetre plate for the top. To the top hatch a rear hatch was added. On 28 January 1942 all turrets had been finished. Later, {{to the right of}} the main armament a 7.5 mm FM 24/29 machine-gun was fitted. These hulls and cars were partly hidden or dumped in lakes when the whole of France was occupied in November 1942.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{distribution}} of domain areas, areas enclosed by domain boundaries ("hulls"), and perimeters for curvature-driven two-dimensional coarsening, employing a combination of exact analysis and numerical studies, for various initial conditions. We show that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hulls</b> per unit area, n_h(A,t) dA, with enclosed area in the interval (A,A+dA), is described, for a disordered initial condition, by the scaling function n_h(A,t) = 2 c_h/(A + λ_h t) ^ 2, where c_h= 1 / 8 π√(3) ≈ 0. 023 is a universal constant and λ_h is a material parameter. For a critical initial condition, the same form is obtained, with the same λ_h but with c_h replaced by c_h/ 2. For {{the distribution of}} domain areas, we argue that the corresponding scaling function has, for random initial conditions, the form n_d(A,t) = 2 c_d (λ_d t) ^τ'- 2 /(A + λ_d t) ^τ', where c_d=c_h + O(c_h^ 2), λ_d=λ_h + O(c_h), and τ' = 187 / 91 ≈ 2. 055. For critical initial conditions, one replaces c_d by c_d/ 2 (possibly with corrections of O(c_h^ 2)) and the exponent is τ = 379 / 187 ≈ 2. 027. These results are extended to describe the number density {{of the length of}} hulls and domain walls surrounding connected clusters of aligned spins. These predictions are supported by extensive numerical simulations. We also study numerically the geometric properties of the boundaries and areas. Comment: 27 pages, 35 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the following problem: given an on-line, possibly unbounded stream of two-dimensional points, how can we summarize its spatial distribution or shape using a small, bounded amount of memory? We propose a novel scheme, called ClusterHull, which represents {{the shape of the}} stream as a dynamic collection of convex hulls, with a total of at most m vertices, where m is the size of the memory. The algorithm dynamically adjusts both the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hulls</b> and the number of vertices in each hull to best represent the stream using its fixed memory budget. This algorithm addresses a problem whose importance is increasingly recognized, namely the problem of summarizing real-time data streams to enable on-line analytical processing. As a motivating example, consider habitat monitoring using wireless sensor networks. The sensors produce a steady stream of geographic data, namely, the locations of objects being tracked. In order to conserve their limited resources (power, bandwidth, storage), the sensors can compute, store, and exchange ClusterHull summaries of their data, without losing important geometric information. We are not aware of other schemes specifically designed for capturing shape information in geometric data streams, and so we compare Cluster-Hull with some of the best general-purpose clustering schemes such as CURE, k-median, and LSEARCH. We show through experiments that ClusterHull is able to represent the shape of two-dimensional data streams more faithfully and flexibly than the stream versions of these clustering algorithms. ∗ A partial summary of this work will be presented as a poster at ICDE ’ 06, and represented in the proceedings by a three-page abstract...|$|E
