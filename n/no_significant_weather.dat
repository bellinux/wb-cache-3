It was revealed that the pilot had deviated from its original route. The predicted route was from point Bua to Siwa and then to Barru, however, after the crew reached point Bua, they decided to fly direct to Barru. The route that the crew took are mountainous with several mountains ahead (terrain heights of between 9,600 and 11,000 feet) while the designated route are near the shoreline with <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> height.

40|$|Erosion of bedrock-floored {{channels}} {{regulates the}} evolution of many landscapes, and accurate prediction of channel erosion rates is a primary goal of landscape evolution modeling. It is hypothesized that bedrock weathering, typically neglected in models of bedrock channel evolution, introduces spatial variation in the rock erodibility across the geometry of such channels. To test this hypothesis, in situ measurements of rock compressive strength were made using a Type N Schmidt hammer in eight channel cross-sections located in arid, humid, and subalpine environments. Average compressive strength decreased 20 - 50 % in transects rising 0. 5 - 2 m from thalweg to channel margin in arid Utah. Average compressive strength decreased 30 - 40 % along transects rising 2 � 5 m from waterline to channel margin in subalpine Colorado. Analyses {{of the extent of}} chemical weathering was also conducted on two transects using ICP-MS data and four indices of <b>weathering.</b> <b>No</b> <b>significant</b> chemical <b>weathering</b> was observed in the subalpine channel, and in the arid channel, the most intense weathering was found just above the perennial low-flow on the sub-aerially exposed margin. While more intense weathering is usually associated with wetter climates, bedrock channels show similar decreases in rock strength with height above the channel in arid channels. Finally, the spatial variability of rock erodibility is seen to occur at scales much smaller than previously accounted for in erosion calculations, and is controlled by a number of factors, including lithology, climate, solar exposure, and the availability of water...|$|R

50|$|The {{network was}} {{launched}} on March 10, 2015, with Verizon Fios {{as the first}} provider to offer the new network; Verizon Fios began carrying AccuWeather Network on channels 119 (in standard definition) and 619 (in high definition) after the provider's carriage agreement with The Weather Channel (which was replaced by AccuWeather Network in its respective channel slots) and its sister network Weatherscan (itself initially replaced on the provider by a widget featuring forecast content sourced from WeatherBug) expired without a renewal. Ironically, Verizon's decision to replace The Weather Channel with AccuWeather Network was despite its claim that the former's removal was a long-term business decision based on the increasing consumer availability of weather information on digital media (via the Internet and mobile devices), although the need for weather coverage without filler programming to pad periods when <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>weather</b> was occurring was also cited.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} agri-environment schemes, including organic farming, on contrasting taxa, when the management of a Southern English farm was changed {{in the middle of}} a 12 -year time series for an ecosystem-monitoring programme. Plant species richness, including butterfly larval food plants, increased, whilst grassland productivity decreased. There was no overall difference in butterfly or carabid beetle abundance or species richness after the management changes, but some individual species increased significantly. Moth abundance and species richness significantly increased following changes in management. There were significant longer term increases in butterfly and carabid populations from when monitoring started in 1994, which continued through the change in management. This contrasted with national trends over the same period. Warmer summers generally increased invertebrate abundance, but there was <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> trend in <b>weather</b> variables for the years following the change in management.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationships between Legionnaires' disease (LD) incidence and weather in Glasgow, UK, by using advanced statistical methods. Using daily meteorological data and 78 LD cases with known exact date of onset, we fitted a series of Poisson log-linear regression models with explanatory variables for air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and year, and sine-cosine terms for within-year seasonal variation. Our initial model showed an association between LD incidence and 2 -day lagged humidity (positive, P = 0 · 0236) and wind speed (negative, P = 0 · 033). However, after adjusting for year-by-year and seasonal variation in cases there were <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> associations with <b>weather.</b> We also used normal linear models to assess the importance of short-term, unseasonable weather values. The most significant association was between LD incidence and air temperature residual lagged by 1 day prior to onset (P = 0 · 0014). The contextual role of unseasonably high air temperatures is worthy of further investigation. Our methods and results have further advanced {{understanding of the role}} which weather plays in risk of LD infection...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the Convective Storm Flight Deviation study, funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Strategic Airspace Usage (SAU) project under Air Force Contract No. FA 8721 - 05 -C- 0002. A quantitative model to predict pilot deviations around convective weather in enroute airspace was developed. The model is based on the analysis of planned and actual flight trajectories and the weather encountered along them in two different Air Traffic Control “super-sectors ” (geographical regions that include several adjacent ATC enroute sectors) on five different days in the summer of 2003. One super-sector encompassed southern Indiana, southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky (ZID); the other was located in northern Ohio, along the southern shore of Lake Erie (ZOB). A deviation distance threshold for each super-sector was determined by analyzing the differences between planned and actual trajectories during a 24 -hour period in which <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>weather</b> was present in either super-sector. A method was developed to detect automatically planned and actual flight trajectories that encountered significant weather and to determine which of these encounters were weather-related flight path deviations. The results of the automatic detection algorithm were verified by an analyst, and the verified detection results (weather-related deviations and penetrations) and associate...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} about air traffic flow organization, ICAO {{regulations}} describe the organizing of traffic flow {{as one of}} the purposes of air traffic control, but they don’t state exactly at what point the flow has to be organized and metered. The flight phase, where air traffic controller interferes with his instructions in order to begin organizing of all aircraft landing at a certain airport depends on the actual traffic volume per hour, airspace capacity and design. The example of air traffic situation in Moscow Domodedovo airport is described in the article, with runway 32 right in use, <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>weather,</b> real usage of STARs, considering all the ICAO and Russian Federation regulations regarding speed control with the restrictions mentioned in AIP of Moscow Domodedovo. The purpose of the experiment is to prove the need of metering the air traffic flow on the entry points in Moscow TMA, because in case of unorganized air traffic flow approach controllers will have additional unnecessary workload. The conducted calculations show, that only 3 aircraft entering TMA on the same distance from initial approach point can be handled using only speed control and existing standard arrival procedures, in all other cases vectoring or holding areas should be used. In order to avoid such situations and increase the number of the aircraft that can be handled by the approach controller with less instructions, all the traffic arriving on the TMA entry point has to be metered by area control centre, because the air traffic control unit has much more space and time for long term speed control modifications, e. g. ± 0, 02 Mach. In conclusion a simple rule comes to mind – the bigger inbound traffic is, the earlier one has to organize it, in order to do it speed control, radar vectors, miles-in-trail can be used. Also new equipment and technology can help air traffic controller with this task, e. g. AMAN (arrival manager), in addition to this, the experience of London Heathrow airport, which increases the AMAN horizon from 150 nm to 600 nm, has to be studied by all concerned air traffic providers. </p...|$|E

40|$|A Distinctive Glass Clast Population In {{numerous}} {{locations in}} Sonoma and Solano Counties in north central California, over {{an area of}} ~ 200 km 2, distinctive ~ 1 - 5 cm dominantly ovoid glass clasts are found {{as part of the}} pebble population in young sediments. They are composed of black massive aphyric nonvesicular glass whose surfaces are totally covered with a texture of adjoining small deep pits and grooves. The pits are hemispherical, 1 - 10 mm across, and join at sharp edges composed of straight segments. The grooves, where present, are the width and depth of the pits and may be up to several cm long and vermicular. Some clasts have internal layering resembling flow textures. These glass objects were brought to our attention by a local resident, Ms. Diane Moore, about 20 years ago. Four of these glass clasts from widely separated locations in the exposure area have been dated by the laser incremental-heating Ar 39 /Ar 40 method at the Berkeley Geochronology Center, with an age of ~ 2. 81 Ma (upper Pliocene). The four samples have mutually overlapping ages at one sigma. Chemical analyses of the 10 major and 50 minor elements, of four widely separated clasts, were obtained at commercial laboratories. The clasts are all rhyolites and cluster tightly on the TAS diagram of Le Maitre et al (2002). All available data show that all these pitted and grooved clasts are part of a single population. II. The Clasts are Tektites We believe these distinctive glass clasts to be tektites for the following reasons: 1. Pits are always present and wholly cover the clast surface. Perhaps half the clasts also have distinctive irregular vermicular grooves superimposed on the pitted surface. This surface pattern is like those on other long-recognized ???classic??? tektites, like indochinites. The clasts look like tektites; compare McCall (2001, Figure 2. 30) for example. 2. The clasts show <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>weathering.</b> Once cleaned of adhering sediment, they are solid and vitreous. There are also no cases of partial development of the distinctive surface texture, as might be expected if it were a consequence of in situ weathering. 3. The clasts do not have a detrital origin; they are not obsidian pebbles. The pit and groove pattern, which is uniformly well developed on clasts throughout the distribution area, is fragile and could not have survived much transport. 4. The clasts are not volcanic in origin (i. e., ???apache tears???). The pit and groove pattern contrasts with the relatively smooth surface of apache tears, and the clasts bear no resemblance to lapilli. Their distinctive appearance and uniform age and chemistry suggests that these objects are tektites in a strewnfield, {{only a small part of}} which has been identified to date. No related impact site has been identified, but clast composition suggests a continental target. We suggest these clasts, heretofore informally called Healdsburg glass, be recognized as tektites and called healdsburgites, in the manner of other tektites.
