The maroon 'shoulder' patch is of a much redder (or less brownish) colour {{than that of the}} nominate. The beak is larger and more massive. The adult males display large pink nape bands, the blue sheens above the nape-bands are restricted and sometimes absent in some specimens.|$|E

These parrots are [...] "aggressive" [...] and can bite if disturbed when doing some curious work. They have red and pink patches on the wings.|$|E
