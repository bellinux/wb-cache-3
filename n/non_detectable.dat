40|$|We {{present a}} {{scenario}} (SupraNova) {{for the formation}} of GRBs occurring when a supramassive neutron star (SMNS) loses so much angular momentum that centrifugal support against self [...] gravity becomes impossible, and the star implodes to a black hole. This may be the baryon [...] cleanest environment proposed so far, because the SN explosion in which the SMNS formed swept the medium surrounding the remnant, and the quickly spinning remnant loses energy through magnetic dipole radiation at a rate exceeding its Eddington luminosity by some four orders of magnitude. The implosion is adiabatic because neutrinos have short mean free paths, and silent, given the prompt collapse of the polar caps. However, a mass ~ 0. 1 M_solar in the equatorial belt can easily reach centrifugal equilibrium. The mechanism of energy extraction is via the conversion of the Poynting flux (due to the large [...] scale magnetic field locked into the minitorus) into a magnetized relativistic wind.

40|$|A {{spectrophotometric}} method with bathophenanthroline for iron determination {{that makes it}} possible to differentiate between iron (II) and iron (III) in total soluble iron in legumes (beans, chickpeas and lentils) was optimized. Sample size, volumes of redu-cing agent and bathophenanthroline were selected. Matrix interferences made it necessary to apply the addition’s method. To check the quality of the method, linearity and precision (RSD%) were determined. A linear response between 0. 1 and 1. 8 mg Fe/ml in the assay and precision values ranging from 2. 1 to 6 for instrumental precision, and from 1. 6 to 1. 7 and 2. 7 to 9. 1, for intra- and inter-day assays, respectively were obtained. The application of the method to legumes indicated: total soluble iron ranging from 0. 52 (microwave cooked legumes) to 5. 01 mg/ 100 g dry matter in raw beans.

40|$|Abstract- The {{islanding}} {{methods are}} classified {{in terms of}} the islanding principle and the distributed Generation (DG). Islanding detection techniques are mainly divided into three types for distribution systems: Remote, local and communication based techniques. Passive methods are based on the information available on the DG site at the point of common coupling (PCC) with the utility grid. A new approach in passive techniques is the use of data-mining to classify the system parameters. Passive techniques are fast and they don’t introduce disturbance in the system but they have a large <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> zone (NDZ) where they fail to detect the islanding condition. In this paper, considerable indices of a distribution system are collected by using MATLAB simulation. These indices are change in power, change in voltage, rate of change of power, rate of change of voltage, total harmonic distortion (THD) current, voltage, and change in power factor. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy inference System (ANFIS) in MATLAB used to classifying for these indices and define the boundaries. The results show the use of ANFIS in reducing the NDZ of passive islanding detection systems.

Polar and non-polar metabolites were derivatized using tert-butyldimethylsilyl (t-BDMS) dissolved in acetonitrile. Using microwave treatment of the samples, the derivatization process could be completed within 2  h (from > 20  h of the conventional method), providing fully derivatized metabolites that contain multiple derivatizable organic functional groups. This results in a single derivative from one metabolite, leading to increased accuracy and precision for identification and quantification of the method.

40|$|Problem Statement: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are {{suspected}} toxins that accumulate in soils and sediments {{due to their}} insolubility in water and lack of volatility. Slurry-phase biological treatment {{is one of the}} innovative technologies that involve the controlled treatment of excavated soil in a bioreactor. Due to highly soil contamination from petroleum compounds in crude oil extraction and also oil refinery sites in Iran, this research was designed based on slurry phase biotreatment to find out a solution to decontamination of oil compounds polluted sites. Approach: Soil samples were collected from Tehran oil refinery site and Bushehr oil zones. Two compositions of soils (clay and silt) were selected for slurry biotreatment experiment. Soil samples were contaminated with three rates of phenanthrene (a 3 ring PAH), 100, 500 and 1000 mg kg - 1 and mixed with distilled water in solid concentration of 30 % by weight after washing out with strong solvent (hexane) and putting in to the oven. Bacterial consortium was revived in culture medium which consisted of Mineral Salt Medium (MSM) based on phenanthrene concentrations and ratio of C/N/P in the range of 100 / 10 / 2. Prepared soil samples were mixed with distilled water, nutrient and bacterial consortium together in the 250 mL glass Erlenmeyer and putted in the shaker incubator with 200 rpm revolutions and 25 °C for 7 weeks (45 days). Samples were analyzed for residual phenanthrene, bacterial population every week. For statistical analysis, general linear model with repeated measures (type III) analysis was applied. Results: The concentration of 100 mg L&# 61485;l of phenanthrene in clayey and silty soils reached to <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> limit after 5 and 6 weeks, respectively. While concentration of 500 mg L - 1 of phenanthrene both in clayey and silty soils reached to <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> limit after 6 weeks. But concentration of 1000 mg L - 1 both in clayey and silty soil samples has not met this limitation after 7 weeks. Due to presence of Pseudomonas strains in clayey soil samples and their ability in breaking down of benzene rings, the removal efficiency of phenanthrene in our slurry bioreactor in clayey soil was a little more than silty soil samples over time. There was a significance relationship between initial concentrations of phenanthrene and type of soil with time of biotreatment (p Conclusion: Therefore, this technology may be applied to remediation of small foot print oil contaminated sites, e. g., gas station, oil extraction and refinery sites in Iran, in the case of urgency. Thus this study concludes that the remediation of phenanthrene with concentration up to 1000 mg kg - 1 in the oil contaminated sites can be removed to the acceptable limits using slurry based system...|$|E

XLA patients have absent or reduced number of peripheral B cells and a profound deficiency in all immunoglobulin isotypes. This multicenter study reports the clinical, immunological and molecular features of Bruton's disease in 40 North African male patients. Fifty male out of 63 (male and female) patients diagnosed with serum agammaglobulinemia and <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> to less than 2 % peripheral B cells were enrolled.

40|$|Background: The blood {{proteome}} {{is thought}} to represent {{a rich source of}} biomarkers for early stage disease detection. Nevertheless, three major challenges have hindered biomarker discovery: a) candidate biomarkers exist at extremely low concentrations in blood; b) high abundance resident proteins such as albumin mask the rare biomarkers; c) biomarkers are rapidly degraded by endogenous and exogenous proteinases. Methodology and Principal Findings: Hydrogel nanoparticles created with a N-isopropylacrylamide based core (365 nm) -shell (167 nm) and functionalized with a charged based bait (acrylic acid) were studied as a technology for addressing all these biomarker discovery problems, in one step, in solution. These harvesting core-shell nanoparticles are designed to simultaneously conduct size exclusion and affinity chromatography in solution. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), a clinically relevant, highly labile, and very low abundance biomarker, was chosen as a model. PDGF, spiked in human serum, was completely sequestered from its carrier protein albumin, concentrated, and fully preserved, within minutes by the particles. Particle sequestered PDGF was fully protected from exogenously added tryptic degradation. When the nanoparticles were added to a 1 mL dilute solution of PDGF at <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> levels (less than 20 picograms per mL) the concentration of the PDGF released from the polymeric matrix of the particles increased within the detection range of ELISA and mass spectrometry.

Recently, many lives have been lost due to the ignorance of the brewers and their patrons. This study was carried out to {{determine}} the levels of nitrate in home- made brews, home- made spirits, raw materials and water. Four hundred and forty (440) home- made alcoholic beverages, one hundred and ten (110) water and eighteen (18) raw materials samples obtained from various parts of Nairobi slums and its environs were analyzed for nitrate. UV-visible Spectrophotometry was used in the research. Some samples contained analyte values above limits set. The concentrations of nitrate varied from <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> (ND) to 46. 3 ± 1. 404 mg/l. The recommended maximum contamination levels set by KEBS/WHO for nitrate in alcohols is nitrate 50 mg/l. Most of the home made brews and spirits analyzed in this study had values slightly lower than the levels recommended by the World Health Organization. Values of nitrate were observed to be generally high in the brews/spirits and the raw materials used. The raw materials may have contributed in elevating the levels of these pollutants in the brews. These findings are therefore useful since they provide a justified cause for the Kenyan Government to fight the selling of local alcoholic beverages...|$|E

During repeated usage the investigated moulds showed a high uptake of fat during the use of up to 8. 0 g fat per kg elastomer. The proper tempering of the moulds exhibited a major influence on the migration properties of siloxanes into different foodstuffs.

The counts of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, thermophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli and non starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) were not affected by HP treatment of cheese at 200 MPa throughout ripening. After 90 days of ripening, the same microbial groups in cheese treated at 500 MPa were about 1. 2, 3. 6, 2. 1 and 4 log units lower than in control cheese respectively. Coliforms were reduced faster at <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> levels in HP treated cheeses than in control cheese. Regarding the bacterial enzymatic activities in cheese, aminopeptidase activity (Apep) was marginally favoured by both HP treatments. However, its activity was decreased at 90 days due probably to loss in brine. In contrast, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, following the bacteria cell lysis, was negatively affected by HP treatment at 500 MPa throughout ripening. Industrial relevance: The data obtained from this work suggest that application of HP treatment under optimized conditions on ovine cheese in brine {{can be used to}} reduce effectively the undesirable microbial load in it and to cause moderate enhancement of aminopeptidase activity, without modifying its composition.

Sediments and waters of River Ogun and River Ibeche in southwestern part of Nigeria were collected and analysed for 4 -t-Octyphenol (4 -t-OP), 4 -nonylphenol (4 -NP) and Bisphenol-A (BPA), that have been shown to possess endocrine-disrupting properties. Prior to analysis by GC-MS technique, targeted compounds were extracted from samples by ultrasonication and liquid-liquid extraction, respectively. Physicochemical properties of the samples such as temperature, pH, total organic carbon and particle size distribution were also determined. 4 -NP and 4 -t-Op were detected in all the water samples with concentration ranging between 43. 9 ng/L - 79. 4 ng/L and 57. 1 ng/L - 68. 6 ng/L, respectively.

Patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including ICGA, structural OCT and OCT-A. The correspondence between choroidal round hyporeflectivities beneath GA on structural OCT and ICGA and OCT-A imaging were analyzed. Fifty eyes of 26 consecutive patients (17 females and 9 males; mean age 76. 8 ± 6. 2 years) with GA were included. Twenty-nine round hyporeflectivities have been found by OCT in choroidal layers in 21 eyes of 21 patients (42. 0 %; estimated prevalence of 57. 7 %). All 29 round hyporeflectivities showed constantly a hyperreflective border and a backscattering on structural OCT, and appeared as hypofluorescent in late phase ICGA and as dark foci with <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> flow in the choroidal segmentation of OCT-A.

For this purpose, 57 samples of ground waters, sea water, sediments and crabs were collected. Biochemical tests as well as PCR were used for further identification and molecular characterization of 46 suspected isolates using specific primers for the lytA-gene and protein 2 B-gene. The confirmed isolates were evaluated for their antimicrobial resistance, using the minimum inhibitory concentration method. Crab samples exhibited a high contamination level of an average count of 8. 2 × 104 CFU/g. In water samples, the highest contamination was recorded near a coastal landfill with a bacterial count of 1. 8 × 103 CFU/ml whereas the lowest bacterial counts (<b>non</b> <b>detectable)</b> were observed in ground water samples. Twenty out of the 46 suspected isolates came from sea water, and 17 out of those were characterized by PCR as S. pneumoniae. Testing the antimicrobial resistance of the 20 isolates to various antimicrobials showed that all sea water isolates were resistant to vancomycin, gentamicin, and oxacillin (100 %), whereas 62. 5 % were resistant to clindamycin, and only 25 % were erythromycin resistant.

40|$|The blood {{proteome}} {{is thought}} to represent {{a rich source of}} biomarkers for early stage disease detection. Nevertheless, three major challenges have hindered biomarker discovery: a) candidate biomarkers exist at extremely low concentrations in blood; b) high abundance resident proteins such as albumin mask the rare biomarkers; c) biomarkers are rapidly degraded by endogenous and exogenous proteinases. Hydrogel nanoparticles created with a N-isopropylacrylamide based core (365 nm) -shell (167 nm) and functionalized with a charged based bait (acrylic acid) were studied as a technology for addressing all these biomarker discovery problems, in one step, in solution. These harvesting core-shell nanoparticles are designed to simultaneously conduct size exclusion and affinity chromatography in solution. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), a clinically relevant, highly labile, and very low abundance biomarker, was chosen as a model. PDGF, spiked in human serum, was completely sequestered from its carrier protein albumin, concentrated, and fully preserved, within minutes by the particles. Particle sequestered PDGF was fully protected from exogenously added tryptic degradation. When the nanoparticles were added to a 1 mL dilute solution of PDGF at <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> levels (less than 20 picograms per mL) the concentration of the PDGF released from the polymeric matrix of the particles increased within the detection range of ELISA and mass spectrometry. Beyond PDGF, the sequestration and protection from degradation for a series of additional very low abundance and very labile cytokines were verified. We envision the application of harvesting core-shell nanoparticles to whole blood for concentration and immediate preservation of low abundance and labile analytes at the time of venipuncture...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT One {{of a large}} {{dairy farm}} (60 acres of land with 1, 600 livestock) located {{on the island of}} Oahu, Hawaii is {{investigated}} for potential integration of the existing lagoon system with cost effective pretreatment unit process. Based on the laboratory study, a pilot plant has been installed two 10 m 3 of anaerobic bioreactor. Two layers of media “Bio-nest ” providing void volume of 98 % are placed into each anaerobic bioreactor at 19 % based on the bioreactor water volume. For better performance and reduction of shock load, the equalization/settling tank is employed prior to the first anaerobic Bio-nest reactor. The installation of an intermediate holding tank follows the second anaerobic Bio-nest reactor. It is for settling of effluent suspended solids from the Bio-nest reactor and adjustment of loading rate in order to improve the performance of aerobic EMMC (Entrapped Mixed Microbial Cell) bioreactors. At this time, the installation of EMMC reactor is under progress. During 25 days operation of the Bio-nest system at organic loading rate of about 1. 5 g/l/d, the production rate of biogas from the first and second Bio-nest reactors is 0. 69 l/l/d and 0. 17 l/l/d, respectively. Methane production rate is 0. 43 l/l/d in the first Bio-nest reactor and <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> in the second reactor. This indicates that anaerobic degradation of organics occurred mainly in the first Bio-nest reactor due to the low loading rate. The effluent from the Bio-nest system shows TCOD removal of 78 % and SCOD removal of 67 %. Further investigation is undergoing with increasing organic loading rate, and the EMMC reactor will be integrated to reuse the treated wastewater for floor washing/flushing...|$|E
40|$|An IgG {{subclass}} deficiency {{is often}} associated with bacterial infections. We studied four pediatric patients suffering from meningoencephalitis, two of them due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and two due to Haemophilus influenzae type b. Simultaneous diagnostic serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were taken during income. The four subclasses of IgG and albumin were quantified in both biologic fluids by radial immunodiffusion. Very low levels of seric IgG 2 with <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> cerebrospinal fluid IgG 2 were found in the patients. No intrathecal IgG subclass synthesis was found in two patients. One patient with S. pneumoniae had IgG 3 intrathecal synthesis. Intrathecal IgG 1, IgG 3 and IgG 4 synthesis was found in one patient suffering from H. influenzae according with reibergrams. Substitutive therapy with intravenous gammaglobulin was given to the patients as part of the treatment. Las deficiencias por subclases de IgG se asocian frecuentemente con infecciones de origen bacteriano. Se estudian cuatro pacientes en edad pediátrica con meningoencefalitis, dos de ellos a Streptococcus pneumoniae y dos a Haemophilus influenzae tipo b.

40|$|The in vivo {{pediculicidal}} {{effectiveness of}} 1 % and 2 % formulations of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) oil (TTO) against sheep chewing lice (Bovicola ovis) was tested in two pen studies. Immersion dipping of sheep shorn {{two weeks before}} treatment in both 1 % and 2 % formulations reduced lice to <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> levels. No lice were found {{on any of the}} treated sheep despite careful inspection of at least 40 fleece partings per animal at 2, 6, 12 and 20 weeks after treatment. In the untreated sheep louse numbers increased from a mean (+/- SE) of 2. 4 (+/- 0. 7) per 10 cm fleece part at 2 weeks to 12. 3 (+/- 4. 2) per part at 20 weeks. Treatment of sheep with 6 months wool by jetting (high pressure spraying into the fleece) reduced louse numbers by 94 % in comparison to controls at two weeks after treatment with both 1 % and 2 % TTO formulations. At 6 and 12 weeks after treatment reductions were 94 % and 91 % respectively with the 1 % formulation and 78 % and 84 % respectively with the 2 % formulation. TTO treatment also appeared to reduce wool damage in infested sheep. Laboratory studies indicated that tea tree oil 'stripped' from solution with a progressive reduction in concentration as well as volume as more wool was dipped, indicating that reinforcement of active ingredient would be required to maintain effectiveness when large numbers of sheep are treated. The results of these studies suggest significant potential for the development of ovine lousicides incorporating TTO. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: One {{of newly}} {{presented}} base metal alloys (Minalux) is produced according to VeraBond 2 alloy (Ni- Cr base) composition. Several studies showed that, cytotoxicity {{of base metal}} alloys can be occurred due to corrosion and element release. Purpose: This study evaluated the biocompatibility of these two base metal alloys in three steps: as cast, after polishing and after porcelain firing cycles. Release of Ni and Cr ions were measured {{to determine if there}} is any difference between these two alloys. Materials and Methods: Samples of two base metal alloys were subjected to Neutral Red Assay, MTT Assay and Trypan Blue for biocompatibility tests. Fibroblast Balb/c 3 T 3 cells were used for cell culture. Samples were contacted directly with cells in 37 &ordm;c and 5 % Co 2 concentration for 72 hours. Teflon samples were used as negative control. ANOVA test was used to compare different groups of two alloys. In addition, the release of Ni and Cr ions in to saline solution was measured by means of atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: MTT and Trypan Blue didn’t show any significant difference between Minalux, VeraBond 2 and Teflon. Neutral Red Assay showed no significant difference between these two base metal alloys but as cast group was higher in cytotoxicity in comparisons with polished and firing groups in both two alloys. Release of Cr ion was <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> (Cr < 1 PPB) but Ni ion was measured and Ni release was significantly different in as cast groups (P= 0. 007) of two alloys. Conclusion: There is no significant difference between cytotoxicity of two base metal alloys and polishing and firing can decrease cytotoxicity of both alloys...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEstimating {{the risk}} {{associated}} to dietary intake of heavy metals by consumers constitutes a vital and {{integral part of}} regulatory processes. The assessment of exposure to mercury shown in the present document has been performed {{by means of a}} study on the whole diet. The total mercury (Hg) levels found in 420 samples of foods and drinks usually consumed have been determined through cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The total Hg concentrations measured in the different analysed groups of food ranged from <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> to 119 Μg/kg ww. The group of fish presented the highest total Hg concentrations. All groups of food with regulated Hg content showed levels that are lower than the legally set values. The food consumption data used in our analysis have been extracted from the latest nutritional survey made in the Canary Islands. The estimated total Hg intake of local population (5. 7 Μg/kg/day) does not exceed the PTWI (Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake) limit of 0. 3 mg/week of total mercury (43 Μg/person/day) fixed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. Fishery products provide with 96 % of the total Hg intake. The mean Hg intake for each Island in this archipelago, formed by seven, has also been calculated. Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and El Hierro are the ones that displayed the highest level of Hg intake (7. 0, 7, 0 and 6, 1 Μg/day, respectively). La Palma Island, due to its low fish consumption, has the lowest level of Hg intake (4. 5 Μg/person/day), followed by La Gomera (5. 4 Μg/day), Tenerife (5. 5 Μg/day) and Gran Canaria (5. 6 Μg/day). A comparison of the results obtained in this study with those found for other national and international communities has also been included in the present article. ...|$|E

The {{presence}} of heavy metals in the slimming tea has received special attention because they are directly related to health. Six slimming teas from different brands and countries which were two slimming tea products from local, two from Indonesia and another two from China were used in this project. All samples were treated using acid digestion method and concentration of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Ni were determined by using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. The result of analysis showed that the content of Cr in all slimming tea samples ranged between 4. 900 and 31. 350 mg/kg which the lowest content found in sample (X), a product from Malaysia and highest content of Cr was found in sample (3) which was product from China respectively. The levels of Cd in the slimming tea samples were between 2. 500 and 3. 850 mg/kg which the lowest level of Cd was found in sample (X) which product from Malaysia and highest from sample (Z) which is China product. The Cd value in all samples was higher than maximum permitted proportion of metal contaminants in specified food Malaysia, 1985 (regulation 38) which is 1. 0 mg/kg.

40|$|A strain KSUCr 3 with {{extremely}} high Cr(VI) -reducing ability under alkaline conditions was isolated from hypersaline soda lakes and identified as Amphibacillus sp. {{on the basis}} of 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The results showed that Amphibacillus sp. strain KSUCr 3 was tolerance to very high Cr(VI) concentration (75 mM) in addition to high tolerance to other heavy metals including Ni 2 + (100 mM), Mo 2 + (75 mM), Co 2 + (5 mM), Mn 2 + (100 mM), Zn 2 + (2 mM), Cu 2 + (2 mM) and Pb (75 mM). Strain KSUCr 3 was shown to be of a high efficiency in detoxifying chromate, as it could rapidly reduce 5 mM of Cr(VI) to a <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> level over 24 hrs. In addition, strain KSUCr 3 could reduce Cr(VI) efficiently over a wide range of initial Cr(VI) concentrations (1 - 10 mM) in alkaline medium under aerobic conditions without significant effect on the bacterial growth. Addition of glucose, NaCl and Na 2 CO 3 to the culture medium caused a dramatic increase in Cr(VI) -reduction by Amphibacillus sp. strain KSUCr 3. The maximum chromate removal was exhibited in alkaline medium containing 1. 5 % Na 2 CO 3, 0. 8 % glucose, and 1. 2 % NaCl, at incubation temperature of 40 ºC and shaking of 100 rpm. Under optimum Cr(VI) reduction conditions, Cr(VI) reduction rate reached 237 µMh¹ {{which is one of the}} highest Cr(VI) reduction rate, under alkaline conditions and high salt concentration, compared to other microorganisms that has been reported so far. Furthermore, the presence of other metals, such as Ni 2 +, Co 2 +, Cu 2 + and Mn 2 + slightly stimulated Cr(VI) -reduction ability by the strain KSUCr 3. The isolate, Amphibacillus sp. strain KSUCr 3, exhibited an ability to repeatedly reduce hexavalent chromium without any amendment of nutrients, suggesting its potential application in continuous bioremediation of Cr(VI). The results also revealed the possible isolation of potent heavy metals resistant bacteria from extreme environment such as hypersaline soda lakes...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. To characterize seasonal changes in thyroid function in a terrestrial reptile, thyroid hormones were measured over a period of two years in desert tortoises, Gopherus agassizii, maintained at the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center in Las Vegas, NV. In all samples, triiodothyronine (T 3) was <b>non</b> <b>detectable</b> (less than 0. 01 ng/ml). Circulating amounts of T 3 may reflect a low rate of T 4 to T 3 conversion. Thyroxine (T 4) exhibited distinct cycles in both sexes, being lowest during hibernation and rising toward the time of emergence. Females exhibited only one peak in T 4, during the early spring. In males, T 4 levels peaked in early spring and again in late summer. The desert tortoise has been reported to have distinct activity patterns that include increased feeding, mating, and locomotor activity in the early spring and increased mating and combat in the late summer. Thus, an increase in T 4 may be a result of increased food intake or metabolic rate after emergence. To determine if food intake contributes to increased T 4, tortoises were fasted for two weeks. Upon refeeding, T 4 levels increased, indicating that increased feeding elevates T 4, possibly to support nutrient assimilation. The second peak of T 4 in males may be due to increasing testosterone not seen in the females or male aggressive behavior associated with increased testosterone. To evaluate the effects of reproductive condition on thyroid function, adult, subadult, and juvenile male tortoises were sampled during the months of the second peak in male T 4. T 4 peaked in July only in reproductively active adults. Additionally, testosterone increased dramatically in this group. Thus, elevated T 4 in desert tortoises is associated with periods of increased feeding and reproductive activity, supporting the proposal that this hormone serves to support these energy-demanding activities...|$|E
