In January 2010, Guardian contributor Mehdi Hasan wrote: [...] "Is Choudary an Islamic scholar whose views merit attention or consideration? No. Has he studied under leading Islamic scholars? Nope.

40|$|The new {{developments}} of the package types (Ruf carton box, Crystal Airbox and VG Nicolaus Peeltop system) {{as well as the}} new bag of Mühlers Mühle were main object of the investigations and proved to be rather effective. Especially the Ruf carton boxes, wich are produced on a Nordson machine fulfill the requirements of an insect and dust proof box. It is preparec without patches or other supporting aids. The Crystal Aibox contains patches. Besides the pelltop system showed this patented sealing procedure the best results. Within four test runs on different machines nearly all tested packages resistes the young larvae of Plodia interpunctella. The packages with peeltop system of VG Nicolaus were as the only water and pressure tight and insect proof. This is achieved by glueing a plastic membrane underneath the overlapping flaps of the package. Similar as with the Espresso system with a paper mebrane of the Effem company, insects may hide underneath the overlapping flapps outside the inte riour of the box. One bag series was tested as new development and found to be improved. For the first time, all tested rice packages of Müllers Mühle could not be penetrated by larvae. The test series with etheric oils ended without ab breakthrough. The tested chemicals showed either toxic or <b>none</b> effects <b>whatsoever</b> towards the tested insect larvae. An orienting experiment with Diethyl-toluamid reveald some hints as to weather chemical substances can be mixed up with the glue to prevent later invasion of larvae through crevices between the flaps for a while. More sceening and testing is necessary to identify substances and dosages. This should further be combined with micro encapsulation as a means of the right formulation for slow release of the proper repellent amounts...|$|R
40|$|Different {{prediction}} {{models for}} operative mortality after esophagectomy have been developed. The {{aim of this}} study is to independently validate prediction models from Philadelphia, Rotterdam, Munich, and the ASA. The scores were validated using logistic regression models in two cohorts of patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer from Switzerland (n = 170) and Australia (n = 176). All scores except ASA were significantly higher in the Australian cohort. There was no significant difference in 30 -day mortality or in-hospital death between groups. The Philadelphia and Rotterdam scores had a significant predictive value for 30 -day mortality (p = 0. 001) and in-hospital death (p = 0. 003) in the pooled cohort, but only the Philadelphia score had a significant prediction value for 30 -day mortality in both cohorts. Neither score showed any predictive value for in-hospital death in Australians but were highly significant in the Swiss cohort. ASA showed only a significant predictive value for 30 -day mortality in the Swiss. For in-hospital death, ASA was a significant predictor in the pooled and Swiss cohorts. The Munich score did not have any significant predictive value <b>whatsoever.</b> <b>None</b> of the scores can be applied generally. A better overall predictive score or specific prediction scores for each country should be developed. ...|$|R
2500|$|According to legend, Isabella and Mortimer famously plotted {{to murder}} Edward {{in such a}} way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending a famous order (in [...] ) which, {{depending}} on where the comma was inserted, could mean either [...] "Do not be afraid to kill Edward; it is good" [...] or [...] "Do not kill Edward; it is good to fear". [...] In actuality, there is little evidence of anyone deciding to have Edward assassinated, and <b>none</b> <b>whatsoever</b> of the note having been written. Similarly, accounts of Edward being killed with a red-hot poker have no strong contemporary sources to support them. The conventional 20th-century view has been that Edward did die at Berkeley Castle, either murdered on Isabella's orders or of ill-health brought on by his captivity, and that subsequent accounts of his survival were simply rumours, similar to those that surrounded Joan of Arc and other near contemporaries after their deaths.|$|E
