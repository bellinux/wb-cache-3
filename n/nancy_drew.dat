5000|$|<b>Nancy</b> Ruth <b>drew</b> media {{attention}} again in 2015 when responding to reporters regarding the auditor general's questioning why she claimed separate breakfasts as public expenses {{when she could}} have eaten the airline breakfasts included {{in the price of}} her airline ticket, which she had also expensed. She is quoted as saying [...] "Well, those breakfasts are pretty awful" [...] and [...] "If you want ice-cold camembert with broken crackers, have it!" [...] The comments drew criticism as evidence of senators feeling entitled to a certain lifestyle at public expense.|$|R
5|$|Nelvana began {{production}} of another <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> television show in 1995. Tracy Ryan starred as <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew,</b> with Jhene Erwin as Bess Marvin, Joy Tanner as George Fayne, and, in a recurring role, Scott Speedman as Ned Nickerson. The show was cancelled midway through its first season due to low ratings in syndication. This <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> series was again partnered {{with a series}} based on The Hardy Boys, with which the series crossed over on occasion. The entire series has since been released on DVD, and has appeared on several online streaming sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the case turned largely on the {{question}} of who had written the <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> series. Adams filed a countersuit, claiming that, as author of the <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> Mystery Stories, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> titles after 1953 and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles, but was not the original author. When Mildred Benson, the author of the early <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> volumes, was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series of both <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> and the Hardy Boys as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E
5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> {{is cited}} as a formative influence {{by a number of}} women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E
50|$|In June 2007, Representative Steve King {{introduced}} {{legislation that would}} prohibit then-Speaker of the House <b>Nancy</b> Pelosi from <b>drawing</b> on federal funds to travel to foreign states which the U.S. deemed to sponsor terrorism.

50|$|As {{the year}} - and his {{relationship}} with <b>Nancy</b> - <b>drew</b> to a close, he started work on Autumn Journal. By Christmas, Nancy {{was in love with}} Stephen Spender's brother Michael, whom she was later to marry, {{and at the end of}} the year MacNeice visited Barcelona shortly before the city fell to Franco. The poem was finished by February 1939, and published in May. It is widely viewed as MacNeice's masterpiece, recording his feelings as the Spanish civil war raged and the United Kingdom headed towards war with Germany, as well as his personal concerns and reflections over the past decade.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Liz attends singles {{activities}} at the YMCA and her friend, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), joins her as her wingman. Nancy accompanies Liz {{to one of the}} activities, and is concerned when Liz speaks critically of everyone there and rebuffs a man whom <b>Nancy</b> has <b>drawn</b> into conversation. <b>Nancy</b> encourages Liz to focus not on the negative, but on what she does want from a man. Liz tries to follow Nancy's advice the next day at a dodgeball game, and she tells a man (Ariel Shafir), whom she hit in the face during a previous dodgeball game, what traits she wants from a man. However, the man does not speak English, and a disappointed Liz hits him with another ball.|$|R
5|$|ABC aired another series {{featuring}} the Hardy Boys, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, from 1977 to 1979.

The Hardy Boys were cast as young adults (Stevenson and Cassidy were twenty-four and eighteen respectively {{during the filming}} of the first episodes) {{to appeal to a}} prime time television audience. The series featured original plots as well as ones based on Hardy Boys books, among them The Clue of the Screeching Owl, The Disappearing Floor and The Flickering Torch Mystery.

5000|$|Lewis {{claimed that}} Frozen {{was based in}} large part on her life and that the play lifted both themes and {{verbatim}} passages from both sources. However, after interviewing Lavery, Gladwell wrote a second New Yorker article in which he characterized Lavery’s appropriation as [...] "permissible borrowing." [...] Lavery, for her part, acknowledged that all three characters were drawn heavily from external sources. For the character of Ralph, she drew on the book The Murder of Childhood by Ray Wyre and Tim Tate. For the character of <b>Nancy,</b> she <b>drew</b> on an article in The Guardian by Marian Partington, whose sister Lucy had been murdered by the serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. And, for the character of Agnetha, Lavery drew on the Gladwell article. [...] "I wanted play to be accurate", she told Gladwell.|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} {{appeared in}} comic books, animated cartoons, greeting cards and more. Little Lulu comic books, popular internationally, were translated into Arabic, Dutch, Finnish, French, Japanese, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Greek. Buell stopped drawing Little Lulu in 1947, {{and the work}} was continued by others, while she kept creative control. Sketching and writing of the Little Lulu comic book series was taken on by John Stanley, who later <b>drew</b> <b>Nancy</b> and Sluggo. Buell sold her Little Lulu rights to Western Publishing when she retired in 1971.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, the Senior Companion Program {{began as}} part of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and Administration on Aging.

5|$|During the Great Depression this fee {{was lowered}} to $100 and {{eventually}} $75. All royalties {{went to the}} Syndicate, and all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Syndicate office. The Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters' names; when Walter Karig, who wrote volumes eight through ten of the original <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> Mystery Stories, tried to claim rights with the Library of Congress in 1933, the Syndicate instructed the Library of Congress not to reveal the names of any <b>Nancy</b> <b>Drew</b> authors, a move with which the Library of Congress complied.|$|E

5|$|A {{television}} series called The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries ran from 1977 to 1979 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). It initially starred 24-year-old Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy. For the first season, episodes featuring Nancy alternated with episodes featuring the Hardy Boys.

50|$|The sisters {{achieved}} notoriety {{for their}} controversial but stylish lives as young people, then for their public political divisions between communism and fascism. Nancy and Jessica became well-known writers: Nancy {{the author of}} The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate and Jessica's 1963 The American Way of Death. Deborah managed {{one of the most}} successful stately homes in England, Chatsworth. Jessica and Deborah married nephews-by-marriage of prime ministers Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan, respectively. Deborah and Diana both married wealthy aristocrats. Unity and Diana were well-known during the 1930s for being close to Adolf Hitler. Jessica turned her back on her inherited privileges, ran away to become a communist, a result of the excitement of European politics in the 1930s. Jessica's memoir, Hons and Rebels, describes their upbringing, and <b>Nancy</b> obviously <b>drew</b> upon her family members for characters in her novels. In the early 1980s, Deborah became politically active when she and her husband Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire joined the new Social Democratic Party.|$|R
5000|$|Born Nancy Henigbaum ("Honeytree" [...] being a {{translation}} of her family's German name) {{was born into a}} family of professional classical musicians.

In 1970 she met some Jesus People at her sister's art school, and became one herself. After graduating, she worked at a youth ministry in Ft. Wayne, Indiana called [...] "The Adam's Apple", a part of the Jesus movement, and it was during these years that she began to write songs about her new-found faith, recording her self-titled first album in 1973.|$|R

[...] Their book, Keeping School (coauthored with Deborah Meier and <b>Nancy</b> Faust Sizer), <b>drew</b> from this experience. From 1997 through 2006, Sizer returned to the Harvard Graduate School of Education as a visiting professor, co-teaching a course on redesigning the American secondary school with his wife, Nancy, while he continued to work on the issues of integrating the multiple services that low socio-economic status families need in poor communities.|$|R

500|$|In 1962, all Grosset & Dunlap books become [...] "picture covers", {{books with}} artwork and {{advertising}} printed directly on their covers, {{as opposed to}} books with a dust jacket over a tweed volume. The change was to reduce production costs. Several of the 1930s and 1940s cover illustrations were updated by Nappi for this change, depicting a Nancy of the Kennedy era, though the stories themselves were not updated. Internal illustrations, which were dropped in 1937, were returned to the books beginning in 1954, as pen and ink line drawings, mostly by uncredited artists, but usually corresponding with Nappi's style of <b>drawing</b> <b>Nancy</b> on the covers. Nappi followed trends initiated by Gillies and often illustrated Nancy wearing the same clothing more than once, including a mustard shirtwaist dress.|$|R
40|$|Text making, object making, image {{making and}} mark making {{practices}} {{have to come}} together to have a peculiar conversation in and around drawing. Works sit {{parallel to one another}} and function simultaneously. Each inquiry poses a challenge to drawing related concerns, questioning its materiality, scale and medium. These works establish connections from drawing to language, the other, the hand, reading, and the future. Sympathetically, this exegesis holds together a set of separate yet connected ideas into a precarious composition. Comprised of four individual components of text, the parts that make up To Draw are placed down side-by-side rather than fixed in a set chronology. This forms a ambiguously open system, and as such has no beginning or end. To be read in any order: READING, HAND, OTHER, DOINGS. Reflecting upon the conventions that once defined drawing practice and mapping its shifts throughout the mid-late 20 th century, To Draw: Reading Hand, Other, Doings offers itself in relation - even in opposition - to certain histories which claim drawing is a verb, or drawing as synonymous with process. Riding on lines drawn by art history, philosophy and semiotics and drawing together the work of Simon O’Sullivan, Catherine de Zegher and Jean-Luc <b>Nancy,</b> To <b>Draw</b> argues for the potentials in reconsidering drawing as a noun, or drawing as an object - drawing as something autonomous...|$|R
50|$|As the {{tensions}} mount amongst the three, a Coyotero raid traps them and takes Mailers son, Tim (Dandy Curran) and holds him as hostage {{with the understanding}} that Mailer will deliver hundreds of rifles within seven days to the Indians for their continued warfare against the white man. Clint Mailer leaves to get the rifles and in the interim, Cooper and <b>Nancy</b> Mailer are <b>drawn</b> closer together with the revelation that Tim is not the son of Mailer. Mailer returns without rifles. Cooper then executes a plan involving the stealing of the rifles from the army post, placing them in the gold mine carefully leaving the mine booby trapped. The mine is blown up as the Indians approach it, Tim is rescued, Cooper and Nancy escape and set out {{to start a new life}} with Tim.|$|R
