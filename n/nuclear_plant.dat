5|$|Lack of {{government}} policy support, {{which includes the}} lack of policies and regulations supporting deployment of renewable energy technologies {{and the presence of}} policies and regulations hindering renewable energy development and supporting conventional energy development. Examples include subsidies for fossil-fuels, insufficient consumer-based renewable energy incentives, government underwriting for <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant</b> accidents, and complex zoning and permitting processes for renewable energy.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{sponsored}} {{legislation that}} would have required <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant</b> owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee. Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain has 19 {{operating}} reactors, producing about 20% of its electricity. It processes {{much of its}} {{spent fuel}} at Sellafield on the northwest coast across from Ireland, where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal. Sellafield {{has a history of}} environmental and safety problems, including a fire in a <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant</b> in Windscale, and a significant incident in 2005 at the main reprocessing plant (THORP).|$|E

50|$|The Jinshan <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> or Chin Shan <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> (金山核能發電廠), First <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> (第一核能發電廠 or 核一), is a <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant</b> in Shimen, New Taipei, Taiwan. Commissioned in 1978 for {{its first}} <b>nuclear</b> reactor, the <b>plant</b> is Taiwan's first <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant</b> as well as Taiwan's {{smallest}} <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant.</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{was also}} {{increased}} environmental {{concern in the}} Soviet Union. In the mid-1950s, Soviet scientists began taking regular radiation readings near Leningrad, Moscow, and Odessa and collected data on the prevalence of strontium-90, which indicated that strontium-90 levels in western Russia approximately matched those in the eastern US. Rising Soviet concern was punctuated in September 1957 by the Kyshtym disaster, which forced the evacuation of 10,000 people after an explosion at a <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant.</b> Around the same time, 219 Soviet scientists signed Pauling's antinuclear petition. Soviet political elites did not share the concerns of others in Soviet Union, however; Kurchatov unsuccessfully called on Khrushchev to halt testing in 1958.|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were out of power in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Plant</b> further to the northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would be struck by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the company began to switch away from purely {{construction}} and towards more turnkey work and service provision, for example the 1961-3 Hilton Hotel, Athens, project. Most work was domestic, driven by Germany's strong economic growth, with a particular strength in power plant construction. This included {{the construction of the}} Federal Republic of Germany's first nuclear power plant, Kahl Nuclear Power Plant, near Dettingen am Main. The construction contract had been awarded by AEG, which had been commissioned by the utility company RWE to build the plant. The plant began to feed its electricity to the grid in June 1961. By contrast, the first East German <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant,</b> at Rheinsberg, was connected to the grid in 1966.|$|E
50|$|The Kuosheng <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> or Guosheng <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> (國聖核能發電廠), Second <b>Nuclear</b> Power <b>Plant</b> (第二核能發電廠 or 核二), is a <b>nuclear</b> power <b>plant</b> in Wanli, New Taipei, Taiwan.

5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant,</b> the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E

25|$|From {{a safety}} stand point, nuclear power, {{in terms of}} lives lost per unit of {{electricity}} delivered, is comparable to and in some cases, lower than many renewable energy sources. There is however no radioactive spent fuel {{that needs to be}} stored or reprocessed with conventional renewable energy sources. A <b>nuclear</b> <b>plant</b> needs to be disassembled and removed.

50|$|As SMRs {{have lower}} {{generation}} capacity and are physically small, {{they are intended}} to be deployed in many more locations than existing <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants.</b> This is both at more sites in existing nuclear power states, such as old fossil fuel generation plants, and in more countries that previously did not have <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants.</b> It is also intended that SMR sites have much lower staffing levels than current <b>nuclear</b> <b>plants.</b> Because of the increased number of sites, with fewer staff, physical protection and security becomes an increased challenge which could increase proliferation risks.|$|R
