5|$|In 1844, Longstreet met {{his future}} first wife Maria Louisa Garland, called Louise by her family. She was the {{daughter}} of Longstreet's commander, Lt. Col. Garland. Little is known of their courtship or marriage. Longstreet <b>never</b> <b>once</b> mentioned Louise in his memoirs, and there are no surviving letters between the two. Most anecdotes about their relationship come through the writings of Longstreet's second wife, Helen Dortch Longstreet.|$|E
5|$|There is {{insufficient}} historical {{evidence to support}} the claim he knew any skills beyond archery. Contemporary records <b>never</b> <b>once</b> mention Zhou teaching Yue boxing. Despite this, various wuxia novels and folk legends have attributed many different military and supernatural skills to Zhou. These range from mastery of the bow, double swords and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard qigong, Chuojiao boxing and even X-ray vision. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing.|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet <b>never</b> <b>once</b> mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests this is probably {{an indication of the}} antiquity of the tradition of the story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Ariel Sabar {{published}} an article in The Atlantic which identified the previous owner of the papyrus as Walter Fritz, rather than Laukamp, and provided further evidence for supposing that the papyrus was a forgery. Fritz initially denied being the papyrus' owner, but later admitted to it. Fritz was a former Egyptology student who left his job at a German museum after items from the museum went missing. For several years, he ran pornography websites featuring his wife, who believes that she can channel God and Michael the Archangel; she had even published a book of sayings that she believes God transmitted through her. The Atlantic speculated that Fritz may have been motivated to forge the text by financial issues - Fritz had recently been unable to sell his house - or a desire to make The Da Vinci Code a reality; he denies having any financial problems, but had seen The Da Vinci Codes film adaptation. Sabar had found that Fritz once ran an art website where he sold artworks which resembled ancient manuscripts. Fritz denied that he or anyone else forged the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, but admitted {{that he may have}} been able to do so had he tried. Fritz also stressed to Sabar that he <b>never</b> <b>once</b> claimed that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife was a genuinely ancient text.|$|E

25|$|During the Belgian {{response}} to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, Brialmont, then a colonel, served as chief-of-staff of the Army of Antwerp, assigned to defending the National Redoubt at Antwerp.

25|$|At one point, Orpheus married Eurydice, a nymph. While {{fleeing from}} {{an attack by}} Aristaeus, she stepped on a snake that bit her, killing her.

Unfortunately, near the very end, Orpheus faltered and looked back, causing Eurydice to be left in the Underworld forever. Orpheus spent {{the rest of his life}} strumming his lyre while wandering aimlessly through the land, rejecting all marriage offers from women.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the Church had {{the true}} faith {{for more than}} twelve hundred years, during which time the holy Fathers <b>never</b> <b>once</b> {{mentioned}} this transubstantiation — certainly, a monstrous word for a monstrous idea — until the pseudo-philosophy of Aristotle became rampant in the Church these last three hundred years. During these centuries many other things have been wrongly defined, for example, that the Divine essence neither is begotten nor begets, that the soul is the substantial form of the human body, and the like assertions, which are made without reason or sense, as the Cardinal of Cambray himself admits.|$|E

In 1898 he made his highest first-class score of 315 against Lancashire. In 1899 he and Bobby Abel put on 448 for Surrey's fourth wicket against Yorkshire. This remains the highest partnership for any wicket for Surrey. In 1900 he achieved the very rare feat of scoring 1,000 runs {{before the end of}} May.|$|E
