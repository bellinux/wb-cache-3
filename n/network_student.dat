50|$|However, {{students}} and academics in Iran still face pervasive and routine infringements {{of their rights}} based on gender, religion, ethnicity and opinions. In the period stretching from March 2009 to February 2012, 396 cases of students were reportedly banned from their university programs because of their peaceful activism. At least 634 other students were detained by the intelligence and security <b>network.</b> <b>Student</b> activists were suspended, threatened, arrested and prosecuted {{on a regular basis}} due to their peaceful criticism of the regime. Iranian officials have also resorted to shutting down hundreds of student publications, gatherings, and independent organizations. Moreover, the intelligence and paramilitary agencies are strongly present in university campuses and sometimes violently confront students through attacking peaceful gatherings or dormitories, which often leads to grave injuries and even the death of many students. Furthermore, the minorities living in the republic of Iran are confronted with systematic discrimination and deprivation in universities. One example illustrating this case is that of the Baha’i community who are prevented from pursuing higher education because of their different religious beliefs. Iranian authorities also specifically punish student activists advocating for ethnic minority rights in harsher ways. The punishments range from violent arrests to heavy sentences including the death sentence. Women are also subject to discrimination at the educational level. The establishment of a quota system to limit female participation in universities is curbing women’s rights. Further restrictions on women’s educational choices are enforced. The issue of gender segregation, which does not always guarantee quality education for women, persists. Academics and teaching personnel are also subject to discrimination with their rights constantly violated. More than a hundred academics were dismissed from universities, because of their dissent against the government and their political views, since the 2009 election. In addition to that, several university professors have been imprisoned for merely expressing peaceful dissent.|$|E

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of virtual social <b>networks</b> among <b>students</b> in Gonabad University of Medical Sciences. Methods: In this descriptive study, 277 students were randomly selected from  Gonabad University of  Medical Sciences. They completed a questionnaire which its validity and reliability were obtained in earlier studies. Then the data were analyzed using SPSS software version 20. Results: The findings showed that 87 percent of the students were aware of virtual social networks, and 52 percent were members of these social <b>networks.</b> <b>Students</b> spend about an hour and eleven minutes (SD= 2. 20771) on the virtual networks.

40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} a methodology for building tractable normative intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). A normative ITS uses a Bayesian network for long-term student modelling and decision theory {{to select the}} next tutorial action. Because normative theories are a general framework for rational behaviour, {{they can be used}} to both define and apply learning theories in a rational, and therefore optimal, way. This contrasts to the more traditional approach of using an ad-hoc scheme to implement the learning theory. A key step of the methodology is the induction and the continual adaptation of the Bayesian <b>network</b> <b>student</b> model from student performance data, a step that is distinct from other recent Bayesian net approaches in which the network structure and probabilities are either chosen beforehand by an expert, or by efficiency considerations. The methodology is demonstrated by a description and evaluation of CAPIT, a normative constraint-based tutor for English capitalisation and punctuation. Our evaluation results show that a class using the full normative version of CAPIT learned the domain rules at a faster rate than the class that used a non-normative version of the same system...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} look at the ability of online social {{networks}} to predict election outcomes of a connected society, in this case a university. Facebook represents a new phenomenon in networking within a university. These network constructs allow for communication to occur rapidly and can influence the opinion of the student body. It is the conglomeration of previous information and communication technologies (ICTs) wrapped up under a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the student body to communicate quickly and has allowed online social networks to dominate collegiate culture. Collegiate culture exists in a duality of the real world and this new online social <b>network.</b> <b>Student</b> governance is reflected in both of these realms. Student governance is as close to political power as most students get {{within the confines of the}} university and just as complex as the network structure present in Facebook. Like Facebook, the students within the collegiate experience must successfully navigate within the internal network to survive and become leaders in the community. With these similarities, the research question that will framed the rest of the paper will be "could Facebook be used to estimate the results of a student election?" The research used a hierarchical linear matrix, which was developed for the work of Raudenbush & Bryk, to develop a model that could answer this question. The final analysis of the matrix showed it was able to predict what place the candidates came in 21 out of 27 times for all of the candidates in a given election. In terms of predicting the candidate's final percentage of votes received (within half the standard deviation of the Estimated Polling Percentage, which was. 072722) during the election 12 out of 27 times for all of the candidates in a given election...|$|E

40|$|Though stadium style seating {{in large}} lecture theatres may suggest otherwise, {{effective}} {{teaching and learning}} is a not a spectator sport. A challenge in creating effective learning environments in both physical and virtual spaces is to provide optimal opportunity for student engagement in active learning. Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has developed the Open Web Lecture (OWL), a new web-based student response application, which seamlessly integrates a virtual learning environment within the physical learning space. The result is a blended learning experience; a fluid collaboration between academic and students connected to OWL via the University’s Wi-Fi using their own laptop or mobile web device. QUT is currently piloting the OWL application to encourage student engagement. OWL offers opportunities for participants to: •	Post comments and questions •	Reply to comments  •	"Like" comments  •	Poll students and review data •	Review archived sessions. Many of these features instinctively appeal to student users of social networking media, yet avail the academic of control within the University <b>network.</b> <b>Student</b> privacy is respected through a system of preserving peer-peer anonymity, a functionality that seeks to address a traditional reluctance to speak up in large classes. The pilot is establishing OWL {{as an opportunity for}} engaging students in active learning opportunities by enabling •	virtual learning in physical spaces for large group lectures, seminar groups, workshops and conferences •	live collaborative technology connecting students and the academic via the wireless network using their own laptop or mobile device •	an non- intimidating environment in which to ask questions •	promotion of a sense of community •	instant feedback •	problem based learning. The student and academic response to OWL has been overwhelmingly positive, crediting OWL as an easy to use application, which creates effective learning opportunities though interactivity and immediate feedback. This poster and accompanying online presentation of the technology will demonstrate how OWL offers new possibilities for active learning in physical spaces by: •	providing increased opportunity for student engagement •	supporting a range of learners and learning activities •	fostering blended learning experiences. The presentation will feature visual displays of the technology, its various interfaces and feedback including clips from interviews with students and academics participating {{in the early stages of}} the pilot...|$|E
40|$|This thesis proposes, demonstrates, and evaluates, {{the concept}} of the {{normative}} Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). Normative theories are ideal, optimal theories of rational behaviour. Two normative theories suitable for reasoning under conditions of uncertainty are Bayesian probability theory, which allows one to update one’s beliefs about the world given previous beliefs and new observations, and decision theory, which shows how to fuse one’s preferences with one’s beliefs in order to rationally decide how to behave. A normative ITS is a tutoring system in which beliefs about the student (the student model) are represented with a Bayesian network, and teaching actions are selected using decision-theoretic principles. The main advantage of a normative ITS is that the normative theories provide an optimal framework for implementing learning theories. In other words, the particular learning theory underlying the ITS is guaranteed to be optimally applied to the student if it is defined as a set of normative representations (probability distributions and utility functions). In contrast, the more traditional type of ITS with an ad-hoc implementation of a learning theory is not guaranteed to be optimal. A general methodology for building normative ITSs is proposed and demonstrated. The methodology advocates building an adaptive, generalised Bayesian <b>network</b> <b>student</b> model using machine learning techniques from student performance data collected in the classroom. The Bayesian network is then used {{as the basis for the}} decision-theoretic selection of tutorial actions. The methodology is demonstrated with two implementations. Both implementations were evaluated in a classroom, rather than a lab, setting. The first implementation is an extension to an existing ITS called SQL-Tutor. A Bayesian network-based student model was added to SQL-Tutor, and this was applied to select the next problem for students. Although this system only partly implemented the normative methodology, the evaluation results were promising enough to continue in this direction. The second evaluation was more comprehensive. An entirely new ITS called CAPIT was implemented by application of the methodology. CAPIT teaches the basics of English capitalisation and punctuation to 8 - 10 year old school children, and it uses constraint-based modelling to represent domain knowledge. The system models the child’s long-term mastery of the domain constraints using an adaptive Bayesian network, and it selects the next problem and best error message (when a student makes more than one error following a solution attempt) using the decision-theoretic principle of expected utility maximisation. Learning theories define both the semantics of the Bayesian network and the form of the utility functions. The evaluation of CAPIT was a success. Three groups of children, A, B, and C, were enlisted and given a pre-test. Group B then used a randomised (non-normative) version of CAPIT for a four week period, while Group C used the full normative version of the tutor. All groups were then administered a post-test. The results show that while both Groups B and C gradually mastered the domain constraints, Group C mastered the constraints at a faster rate than group B. Group A, who did not have access to an ITS in the domain, actually regressed on the post-test...|$|E
