500|$|The {{navigation}} system proved difficult to develop because computers {{of the time}} lacked power. Artificial intelligence was considered crucial, as the navigation and other aspects relied on it. According to co-designer Jonty Barnes, the team wanted the creatures complex without high computational costs. Healey {{came up with the}} idea of slapping creatures to make them work faster, and Barnes considered it a [...] "great game decision". A great deal of time was spent working on the user interface, and at one point the idea of having <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> was considered. Carter stated that the team tried to make the sounds atmospheric and industrial so players got a sense of power. Using others' 3D sound routines proved troublesome, so he and his colleague Tony Cox wrote their own. Dungeon Keeper uses lighting algorithms used in Magic Carpet, which provided effects such as fireballs lighting corridors.|$|E

50|$|There {{are some}} special cases, {{in which the}} {{languages}} compile into the same bytecode VM, like Clojure and Java, as well as Elixir and Erlang. Since there is <b>no</b> <b>interface,</b> it is strongly spoken not a FFI, while it offers the same functionality to the user.|$|E
50|$|The SSFL {{branches}} {{from and}} runs {{parallel to the}} Main South line for its full 36 kilometre length from Macarthur to Birrong. The line is an unelectrified, bi-directional single track with 1,800m long passing loops at Glenfield and Leightonfield. Apart from its end points, the SSFL has <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> with the existing network.|$|E
50|$|Another {{frequent}} use of inheritance is to guarantee that classes maintain a certain common interface; that is, they implement the same methods. The parent class can {{be a combination of}} implemented operations and operations that are to be implemented in the child classes. Often, there is <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> change between the supertype and subtype- the child implements the behavior described instead of its parent class.|$|E
5000|$|The PRS-300 was {{launched}} on August 2009 {{and it is}} also known as the [...] "Pocket Edition". The PRS-300 was announced {{at the same time as}} the touch-screen PRS-600. It is Sony's smallest ever ereader as well as its entry-level device, priced at US$199. It has a smaller screen than the PRS-600, <b>no</b> touch <b>interface,</b> <b>no</b> MP3 audio or expandable memory. It has a similar interface to the PRS-500 and PRS-505.|$|R
50|$|The ET (Econet Terminal) {{system was}} {{designed}} {{for use in a}} network and as such had <b>no</b> <b>interfaces</b> except RGB and Composite video, plus an Econet interface module and ANFS fitted as standard (it was usually an option). It used the same main circuit board as the Master 128, but the components for missing interfaces were simply not fitted (though there was nothing stopping them being added later by someone with appropriate soldering skills). The internal ROM also contained much less software than that of the Master 128.|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of high K metal gates, a new degradation mechanism appeared. The PBTI for positive bias temperature instabilities affects nMOS transistor when positively biased. In this particular case, <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> states are generated and 100% of the Vth degradation may be recovered. Those results {{suggest that there is}} no need to have interface state generation to trapped carrier in the bulk of the dielectric.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} a graph {{rewriting rule}} of the SPO approach is a single morphism {{in the category of}} labeled multigraphs and partial mappings that preserve the multigraph structure: [...] Thus a rewriting step is defined by a single pushout diagram. Practical understanding of this is similar to the DPO approach. The difference is, that there is <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> between the host graph G and the graph G being the result of the rewriting step.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{requirements}} {{specific to}} TIROS missions, there was <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> between the satellite and the launch vehicle guidance systems. This {{resulted in the}} satellite attempting to separate from the launch vehicle at approximately 370 seconds after launch. The separation failed due to recontact between the Atlas - which was still under thrust - and the satellite, which only separated when the solid-fuel rocket motor intended to place NOAA-B into a circular 830 km sun-synchronous orbit fired.|$|E

50|$|Freight {{is still}} a major factor along this {{transport}} corridor, with the Australian Rail Track Corporation's standard gauge Adelaide to Port Augusta line running parallel to the broad gauge track between Adelaide and Salisbury. Since 1984, this line has been standard gauge and had <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> with the suburban lines. Aurizon, Genesee & Wyoming Australia, Pacific National, SCT Logistics, and Great Southern Rail operate services via the line, with the latter operating The Ghan and Indian Pacific passenger trains along this section.|$|E

50|$|The player {{does not}} receive any {{explicit}} guidance {{on how to}} play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabre Wulf graphics fill the full screen with <b>no</b> <b>interface,</b> inventory, or damage indicators apart from a high score meter in the top centre. Sabreman can eat orchid power-ups, which bloom {{for only a few}} seconds, to turn the colour of the orchid and receive a temporary character effect. Some effects empower (e.g. invulnerability, increased speed) while others impair (e.g. reversing the player's controls). Sabreman can also collect treasure and extra lives scattered throughout the maze. The Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases include a two-player mode in which players take turns controlling their own Sabreman.|$|E
5000|$|VisualAge C++ bundled-in Object Component Library (OCL) was {{not based}} on SOM. It was {{probably}} meant to be ported to SOM using C++ Direct-to-SOM mode, but in VAC v3.6.5 this mode was abandoned, and OCL has <b>no</b> SOM <b>interface</b> so far.|$|R
40|$|The infinite-volume limit {{behavior}} of the 2 d Ising model under possibly strong random boundary conditions is studied. The model exhibits chaotic size-dependence at low temperatures and we prove that the `+' and `-' phases are the only almost sure limit Gibbs measures, assuming that the limit is taken along a sparse enough sequence of squares. In particular, we provide an argument to show that in a sufficiently large volume a typical spin configuration under a typical boundary condition contains <b>no</b> <b>interfaces.</b> In order to exclude mixtures as possible limit points, a detailed multi-scale contour analysis is performed.

5000|$|The “N” in an N2 diagram is {{the number}} of {{entities}} for which relationships are shown. This N &times; N matrix requires the user to generate complete definitions of all interfaces in a rigid bidirectional, fixed framework. The user places the functional or physical entities on the diagonal axis and the interface inputs and outputs in the remainder of the diagram squares. A blank square indicates that there is <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> between the respective entities. Data flows clockwise between entities (i.e., the symbol F1 → F2, in Figure 4, indicates data flowing from function F1 to function F2; the symbol F2 → F1 indicates the feedback). That which passes across the interface is defined in the appropriate squares.|$|E
5000|$|The Maneuver Control System (MCS) {{allows the}} {{operator}} to define routes and view overlays to provide situational awareness. MCS is being phased out {{and replaced with}} [...] "Lightning", an ABCS enabled Flash/Java Program that uses the Web Browser interface. It allows users to publish products from CPOF without using the BCS (Battle Command Server) PASS (Publish and Subscribe Service) Server, making Lightning more flexible {{as it can be}} used on any Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet-System) as there is <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> software required besides your web browser (Typically IE 8.0 or higher, not compatible with Opera or Firefox at this time.) The system was developed and integrated by Ford Aerospace and Communications Corp. (FACC), Colorado Springs, Colorado.|$|E
50|$|System Preferences is an {{application}} {{included with the}} macOS operating system that allows users to modify various system settings which are divided into separate Preference Panes. The System Preferences application {{was introduced in the}} first version of Mac OS X to replace the control panel that was included in the classic Mac OS. Prior to Mac OS X, a control panel is a small application which enabled the user to modify software and hardware settings such as the sound volume and desktop pattern. Control panels differ from extensions in that they allow the user to specify options, whereas extensions provide the user with <b>no</b> <b>interface</b> for setting preferences. In many software distributions Extensions provided the functionality and the corresponding Control Panel provided all the configuration options.|$|E
