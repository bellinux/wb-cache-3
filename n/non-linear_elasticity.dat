5000|$|The {{central focus}} of the {{sub-field}} of Computational anatomy (CA) within medical imaging is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems at the 1 millimeter morphome scale. In CA mapping of dense information measured within Magnetic resonance image (MRI) based coordinate systems {{such as in the}} brain has been solved via inexact matching of 3D MR images one onto the other. The earliest introduction of the use of diffeomorphic mapping via large deformation flows of diffeomorphisms for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Rabbitt and Miller [...] and Trouve. The introduction of flows, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the Lagrangian and Eulerian equations of motion. This model becomes more appropriate for cross-sectional studies in which brains and or hearts are not necessarily deformations of one to the other. Methods based on linear or <b>non-linear</b> <b>elasticity</b> energetics which grows with distance from the identity mapping of the template, is not appropriate for cross-sectional study. Rather, in models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected. The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's original paper, with fast and symmetric methods becoming available.|$|E

The second problem considered is core speculative: it is where discontinuities of stress are allowed.

In the modelling of the marginal processes, we consider a class of non-linear SDEs that are reducible to Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process or Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985) (CIR) process. The reducibility is achieved via a typically non-linear transformation function.

As in the case of crystalline order on curved membranes, geometrically-induced stresses couple elastically to the presence of topological defects in the in-plane order. We derive the effective theory of multiple disclination defects in the cross section of bundle with a fixed twist and show that above a critical degree of twist, one or more 5 -fold disclinations is favored in the elastic energy ground state.
