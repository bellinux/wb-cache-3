Although on average, individual exposure to the crisis is associated with lower support to democracy and markets, it drives the demand for liberal reforms among groups {{of the population that}} were most excluded from the political-economic system in place, the youth particularly, in countries that lag behind in terms of liberalization and, where institutions are corrupt.

Decisions made by both the debtor and the creditor can contribute to insolvency. This article presents some stylized facts about insolvency in Canada’s household sector and analyzes the role of creditors in insolvencies. The average debt of an individual filing for bankruptcy is more than 1. 5 times that of an average Canadian household; bankruptcy filers tend to be unemployed or in low-wage jobs, and are typically renters. The article reports that banks that approve more loans per branch, which is interpreted as less-intensive use of soft information (such as the loan officer’s assessment of the applicant’s character), experience more client bankruptcies. This finding has important policy implications, because financial institutions that do not use soft information risk further deterioration in their lending portfolios. ...|$|E

40|$|Relationship {{breakdown}} has economic costs: one household {{is split}} into two, and its income is also divided. The costs are disproportionately borne by women, who often {{lose more than}} half the household’s income yet retain the majority of the financial responsibility for children. The negative financial shock of relationship breakdown is, however, rarely permanent. In the short term, separated women may benefit from social welfare policies and receive private transfer payments including child support. As time passes, if repartnering occurs this can aid the economic recovery process. A recent analysis of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey has revealed new insights into the interaction between institutional support, including welfare payments and child support rules, and repartnering as a way of mitigating the <b>negative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock</b> of relationship breakdown.   • Dr Hayley Fisher is a Lecturer in the School of Economics at the University of Sydney...|$|E
30|$|What factors {{cause this}} {{international}} {{difference in the}} responses of age-specific unemployment rates over the business cycle? Answering this question is particularly important to address policy makers’ concerns about the continuing high unemployment among youth across OECD countries after the 2008 financial crisis. The press release by OECD {{in advance of the}} G 20 Labor Ministers Meeting in Mexico on 17 - 18 May 2012 points out that the youth employment rate is higher than the general unemployment rate, citing examples of Greece and Spain, where youth unemployment is three times higher than general unemployment rate. 1 Pointing to longer-term consequences of youth unemployment, OECD recommends that governments expand job-search assistance, apprenticeship and other vocational training programs, and employment subsidies for youth. It also recommends reducing the gap of employment protection between permanent and temporary workers, and setting minimum wage not too high. Although these policy recommendations are likely to be effective for alleviating youth unemployment problems, determining why the burden of <b>negative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock</b> falls disproportionately on youth in some countries in the first place can contribute to removing the causes of youth unemployment.|$|E
40|$|September 2016; revised February 2017 In this paper, we {{theoretically}} analyze, and empirically test for, {{the importance}} of relational adaptation in outsourcing relationships using the airline industry as case study. In the airline industry, adaptation of flight schedules is necessary {{in the presence of}} bad weather conditions. When major carriers outsource to independent regionals, conflicts over these adaptation decisions typically arise. Moreover, the urgency of needed adjustments requires that adaptation be informal and hence enforced relationally. Our model shows that for relational adaptation to be self-enforcing, the long-term value of the relationship between a major and a regional airline must be at least as large as the regional airline’s cost of adapting flight schedules across joint routes. Thus, when facing a <b>negative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock,</b> the major is more likely to preserve routes outsourced to regional airlines that have higher adaptation costs, and hence higher relationship value. We analyze the evolution of U. S. airline networks around the 2008 financial crisis, and we find that consistent with our predictions, routes outsourced to regional networks with worse average weather, and hence higher adaptation costs, were more likely to survive the shock...|$|E

This study aims {{to investigate the}} impacts of socioeconomic factors on different types of crimes committed in the megapolitan cluster of the Southwest United States. Using annual crime datasets, {{we look at the}} three years before the Great Recession and subsequent three years (2005 - 2010). The metropolitan areas, Los Angeles, CA, Las Vegas, NV, Phoenix, AZ, and Tucson, AZ and surrounding neighborhood counties are included for the analysis. A set of spatial regression models is developed to estimate the impacts of socioeconomic factors and neighborhood effects. Proposed spatial dynamic model enables us to test the temporal stability under the panel data structure on the different types of crime and the associated factors. Identified spatial effects through exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) can be formally tested on their temporal stability with the recent Great Recession. Since the Great Recession started, the types and the magnitude of socioeconomic factors having impacts on crime have changed. This study guides to answer how negative economic situations affected different types of crimes.

40|$|This thesis applies a {{structural}} econometric {{model to the}} Seoul Office Market to forecast cyclic trends of rent and office space supply. The model consists of two simultaneous equations. The first equation explains office rent by past rent, office employment, and the stock of office space. The second equation explains new office supply by rent and office employment growth. Empirically, the model was tested against the data of the Seoul office market since 1974. The estimated rent equation suggests that rent seems to be fully explained by the immediate past rent, current office employment, and current office stock in the Seoul economy - but only when the previous rental boom in the late 1970 s is accounted for with the effect of governmental land use policy. On the other hand, the estimated construction equation suggests that new office supply can be well explained by rent and office employment growth, both lagging long six years. The long lag implies that investors have expected current conditions to prevail in the future, a myopic expectation. This myopic expectation can generate market volatility because {{by the time a}} space enters the stock, market conditions have changed. Using the estimated model, ten-year contingent forecasts are made based on three scenarios having different estimated office employment growths. The forecasts for both rent and new supply demonstrate similar cyclic movements in all of the scenarios. In short, the Seoul office market, strongly impacted by the <b>negative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock</b> started in late 1997 and the large supply of office space in the 1990 s, seems to remain soft or tight for two to three years before rent moves upward and supply reacts. By the middle of the 2000 s, however, the market will be fully recovered from the economic shock and it will move toward a strong market. by Rae Ik Park. Thesis (S. M. and M. C. P.)

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on the US labor market. The first two chapters examine {{the dynamics of the}} labor market in search models of unemployment. The third chapter concerns the rising nonemployment of low-skilled males. This research contributes to our theoretical and empirical understanding of how public policies and economic frictions affect the labor market in the short and long term. 	 	Chapter 1 studies the implications of the tax system used to finance unemployment insurance, known as "experience rating. " Experience-rated taxes impose higher payroll tax rates on firms that have laid off more workers in the past. In empirical analysis, higher experience rating is found to reduce both job creation and job destruction since firms are reluctant to both lay off and hire workers due to potentially higher tax burdens. A general equilibrium model with realistic UI financing shows that higher experience rating reduces the depth of recessions but can prolong their length. 	 	Chapter 2 examines the sluggishness of the labor market after recessions. In macroeconomic data, labor market tightness [...] -the number of job vacancies per unemployed worker [...] -takes four quarters to react fully to a <b>negative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shock.</b> A search model of unemployment is extended to include costly capital adjustment. Intuitively, costs of investment can cause a delay in capital adjustment which, in turn, delays adjustment of the labor market. The model is able to account for the slow recovery of the labor market during recessions. 	Finally, chapter 3 (with Michael W. L. Elsby and Matthew D. Shapiro) studies the secular increase in nonemployment of low-skilled males over the past thirty years. A simple model of family labor supply predicts that the "replacement rate" of family income during nonemployment relative to employment is an important determinant of male joblessness. Detailed income data show that families buffer income loss from male nonemployment through substantial government transfers and spousal income. The empirical estimates of the replacement rate are falling while nonemployment is rising. This suggest a limited relationship between the relative value of nonemployment, and the role of more generous government transfers, in determining male joblessness...|$|E

Recessions are often modelled as <b>negative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>shocks</b> in which {{the current state of}} the economy is untenable and the economy tries to restore itself to a new equilibrium position. In the short-run, as the economy adjusts to the shock but before it reaches the new equilibrium, the shock often causes productivity to fall, unemployment rise, and closure of firms that are now non-viable in the new environment. The new environment enables new kinds of businesses and people must learn new skills and exploit new opportunities to achieve long-run equilibrium.|$|R
