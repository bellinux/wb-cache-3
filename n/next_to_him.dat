5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg.

5|$|During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate {{among the}} rank and file and fought under heavy fire as men <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> were shot or blown to pieces.

The Algarve region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July. Pedro proceeded to subdue the remainder of the country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down to a conclusion, his Spanish uncle Don Carlos, who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Doña IsabelII, intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire Iberian Peninsula, the First Carlist War, the Duke of Braganza allied with liberal Spanish armies loyal to IsabelII and defeated both MiguelI and Carlos. A peace accord was reached on 26 May 1834.|$|E

5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5|$|On June 6, 1944, and afterward, {{most of the}} American {{airborne}} landings in Normandy {{were flown}} into areas that were not studded with Rommelspargel.

His glider hit a wooden pole defense which tore into the three soldiers sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> mortally wounding them. More casualties were inflicted during delivery of glider infantry reinforcements when some 16–18 gliders landed {{in a field of}} Rommelspargel and the troops that crawled from the wrecked gliders were immediately targeted by German small arms fire. Of 250 troops landing, some 50–60 survived.|$|E
5|$|The Vishnu sculptures {{found among}} the Elephanta ruins express {{different}} styles. One wears a dhoti and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh.

It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a chain link near the thigh, has a gada (mace) on side, and someone standing <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> of a damaged upper portion but with small waist and full breasts suggestive of a devi. This statue too is wearing a dhoti.|$|E
