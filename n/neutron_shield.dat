50|$|Boron {{is another}} common neutron absorber. Due to the {{different}} cross sections of 10B and 11B, materials containing boron enriched in 10B by isotopic separation are frequently used. The wide absorption spectrum of boron also makes it suitable as a <b>neutron</b> <b>shield.</b> The mechanical properties of boron in its elementary form are unsuitable, and therefore alloys or compounds have to be used instead. Common choices are high-boron steel and boron carbide. The latter {{is used as a}} control rod material in both PWRs and BWRs. 10B/11B separation is done commercially with gas centrifuges over BF3, but can also be done over BH3 from borane production or directly with an energy optimized melting centrifuge, using the heat of freshly separated boron for preheating.|$|E
5000|$|A marine nuclear {{propulsion}} plant must {{be designed to}} be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which {{might have to be}} undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing fuel elements for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation of fuel elements which will withstand a large amount of radiation damage. Fuel elements may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-zirconium alloy rather than the ceramic UO2 (uranium oxide) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for long core life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a [...] "burnable poison" [...] in the fuel elements, which is slowly depleted as the fuel elements age and become less reactive. The gradual dissipation of the [...] "nuclear poison" [...] increases the reactivity of the core to compensate for the lessening reactivity of the aging fuel elements, thereby lengthening the usable life of the fuel. The life of the compact reactor pressure vessel is extended by providing an internal <b>neutron</b> <b>shield,</b> which reduces the damage to the steel from constant bombardment by neutrons.|$|E
50|$|Plasma {{discharges}} {{within the}} tokamak's vacuum chamber consist of energized ions and atoms {{and the energy}} from these particles eventually reaches the inner wall of the chamber through radiation, collisions, or lack of confinement. The inner wall of the chamber is water-cooled and {{the heat from the}} particles is removed via conduction through the wall to the water and convection of the heated water to an external cooling system. Turbomolecular or diffusion pumps allow for particles to be evacuated from the bulk volume and cryogenic pumps, consisting of a liquid helium-cooled surface, serve to effectively control the density throughout the discharge by providing an energy sink for condensation to occur. When done correctly, the fusion reactions produce large amounts of high energy neutrons. Being electrically neutral and relatively tiny, the neutrons are not affected by the magnetic fields nor are they stopped much by the surrounding vacuum chamber. The neutron flux is reduced significantly at a purpose-built <b>neutron</b> <b>shield</b> boundary that surrounds the tokamak in all directions. Shield materials vary, but are generally materials made of atoms which are close to the size of neutrons because these work best to absorb the neutron and its energy. Good candidate materials include those with much hydrogen, such as water and plastics. Boron atoms are also good absorbers of neutrons. Thus, concrete and polyethylene doped with boron make inexpensive neutron shielding materials. Once freed, the neutron has a relatively short half-life of about 10 minutes before it decays into a proton and electron with the emission of energy. When the time comes to actually try to make electricity from a tokamak-based reactor, some of the neutrons produced in the fusion process would be absorbed by a liquid metal blanket and their kinetic energy would be used in heat-transfer processes to ultimately turn a generator.|$|E

40|$|In the United States, {{commercial}} spent {{nuclear fuel}} is typically moved from spent fuel pools to outdoor dry storage pads within a transfer cask system that provides radiation shielding to protect personnel and the environment. The transfer casks are cylindrical steel enclosures with integral gamma and neutron radiation shields. Since the transfer cask system must be passively cooled, decay heat removal from the {{spent nuclear fuel}} canister {{is limited by the}} rate of heat transfer through the cask components and natural convection from the transfer cask surface. The primary mode of heat transfer within the transfer cask system is conduction, but some cask designs incorporate a liquid <b>neutron</b> <b>shield</b> tank surrounding the transfer cask structural shell.

The large-scale geometry of the <b>neutron</b> <b>shield</b> tank (typically an annulus ~ 2 meters in diameter but only 5 - 10 cm in thickness), and the relatively small scale velocities (typically < 5 cm/s), represent a wide range of spatial and temporal scales that contribute to making this a challenging problem for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling.

Production targets are bombarded regularly during the week nights from Monday to Thursday. In addition to these allocated shifts of 8 hours each idle beam during the neutron therapy sessions resulting from the various patient set up procedures is also utilised for radioisotope production.
