40|$|Periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> is a {{malformation}} that, {{occurs in}} {{both males and}} females and is associated with a variety of clinical and neuroradiolooic signs. A gene called filamin- 1 (FLN- 1) has recently been identified. We review the clinical and imaging findings from a series of pediatric patients with periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia.</b> Five patients (three males and two females; age range 4 - 18 years) were investigated. In our series, periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> can be the common denominator in different conditions. Periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> can occur alone or be associated with cortical malformations. Epilepsy was present in three of the five patients and was resistant to drugs in one female. Mental retardation was present in three of the five patients. Two male patients had normal intelligence, with no cortical anomalies, patient 3 had unilateral periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia.</b> The associated malformations were more severe in the female patients and slight only in patient 1. The two females showed anomalies rarely reported in association with bilateral periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia.</b> We believe that other genes can be involved in children with atypical neuroradiologic periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia.</b> No mutations were. detected in 6 of the 48 exerts of the FLN- 1 gene, although this does not allow any definitive conclusions to be reached.

40|$|Periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> {{is caused}} by {{defective}} neuronal migration that results in heterotopic neuronal nodules lining the lateral ventricles. Mutations in filamin A (FLNA) or ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide-exchange factor 2 (ARFGEF 2) cause periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia,</b> but most patients with this malformation {{do not have a}} known aetiology. Using comparative genomic hybridization, we identified 12 patients with developmental brain abnormalities, variably combining periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia,</b> corpus callosum dysgenesis, colpocephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia and polymicrogyria, harbouring a common 1. 2 Mb minimal critical deletion in 6 q 27. These anatomic features were mainly associated with epilepsy, ataxia and cognitive impairment. Using whole exome sequencing in 14 patients with isolated periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> but no copy number variants, we identified one patient with periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia,</b> developmental delay and epilepsy and a de novo missense mutation in the chromosome 6 open reading frame 70 (C 6 orf 70) gene, mapping in the minimal critical deleted region. Using immunohistochemistry and western blots, we demonstrated that in human cell lines, C 6 orf 70 shows primarily a cytoplasmic vesicular puncta-like distribution and that the mutation affects its stability and subcellular distribution. We also performed in utero silencing of C 6 orf 70 and of Phf 10 and Dll 1, the two additional genes mapping in the 6 q 27 minimal critical deleted region that are expressed in human and rodent brain. Silencing of C 6 orf 70 in the developing rat neocortex produced periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> that was rescued by concomitant expression of wild-type human C 6 orf 70 protein. Silencing of the contiguous Phf 10 or Dll 1 genes only produced slightly delayed migration but not periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia.</b> The complex brain phenotype observed in the 6 q terminal deletion syndrome likely results from the combined haploinsufficiency of contiguous genes mapping to a small 1. 2 Mb region. Our data suggest that, of the genes within this minimal critical region, C 6 orf 70 {{plays a major role in}} the control of neuronal migration and its haploinsufficiency or mutation causes periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Neuronal heterotopia is a {{migration}} {{disorder in}} which these cells do not complete their movement toward the cerebral cortex. Periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> is the most frequently reported form, characterized by neuronal conglomerates adjacent to the lateral ventricles walls. About 90 % of patients with this condition suffer epilepsy {{at some point in}} their lives and the major proportion of them will be resistant to pharmacologic treatment. This makes an appropriate diagnostic approach necessary in order to determine which patients would benefit from surgical resection of the lesion, which in most cases offers a high rate of crisis control. Development: This article presents a review of the most important topics approached from the practice of periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and therapy. It is aimed at exploring the role of this condition as a cause of intractable epilepsy. Conclusion: Pharmacologic treatment for resistant epilepsy will have a severe impact on patient’s quality of life. Periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> is frequently associated to this condition, which must be successfully approached by the medical team attempting to an opportune diagnosis and defining which patients would benefit from surgical management.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the excitotoxic cascade on the developing brain was investigated using ibotenate, a glutamatergic agonist of both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. Injected in the neopallium of the golden hamster {{at the time of}} production of neurons normally destined for layers IV, III, and II, ibotenate induces arrests of migrating neurons at different distances from the germinative zone within the radial migratory corridors, The resulting cytoarchitectonic patterns include periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopias,</b> subcortical band heterotopias, and intracortical arrests of migrating neurons, The radial glial cells and the extracellular matrix are free of detectable damage that could suggest a defect in their guiding role. The migration disorders are prevented by coinjection of DL- 2 -amino- 7 -phosphoheptanoic acid, an NMDA ionotropic antagonist, but are not prevented by coinjection of L(+) - 2 -amino- 3 -phosphonopropionic acid, a metabotropic antagonist, This implies that an excess of ionic influx through the NMDA channels of neurons alters the metabolic pathways supporting neuronal migration, Ibotenate, a unique molecular trigger of the excitotoxic cascade, produces a wide spectrum of abnormal neuronal migration patterns recognized in mammals, including the neocortical deviations encountered in the human brain...|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} frontal lobe {{seizures}} range from tumors to head trauma to genetics. Tumors {{account for about}} one third of all frontal lobe epilepsy cases. Low-grade tumors such as gangliogliomas, low-grade gliomas, and epidermoid tumors are most common, but many high-grade tumors were most likely once involved with seizures. Other lesions on the frontal lobe such as hamartomas and <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopias</b> can cause frontal lobe symptoms as well. Birth defects such as vascular malformation are known to cause seizures, especially arteriovenous malformations and cavernous angiomas. Head trauma frequently causes damage to the frontal lobe and can cause seizures directly or indirectly through gliosis. Seizures originating directly from head trauma usually occur within a few months, but occasionally they can take years to manifest. On occasion encephalitis can cause frontal lobe seizures but it is most often associated with temporal lobe affliction. The main genetic cause of frontal lobe epilepsy is an autosomal dominant disease called Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy, which involves mutations in 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes. A genetic mutation on chromosome 22 has also been associated with another genetic form of the disorder.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} relationships between heterotopic and remote cortical structures at seizure initiation, in a patient with bilateral periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopias</b> (BPNH) explored by intracerebral electrodes. METHODS: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) was performed in a man with BPNH and refractory epilepsy {{to investigate}} the hypothesis of right temporal lobe epilepsy and the possible involvement of heterotopic structures during seizures. SEEG signals were analyzed with quantification of functional coupling between different brain structures during seizures, using nonlinear regression. We have used Z-score transformation of correlation values to reflect the change from the preictal period. Relationships between BPNH and cortical structures were investigated using analysis of stimulation-induced potentials. RESULTS: Three spontaneous seizures were recorded and analyzed. Signal analysis of interdependencies in two seizures demonstrated a large initial network involving both heterotopia and cortical structures. Stimulations of heterotopia induced responses in remote cortical structures. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct epileptogenic networks were identified, in which leader structures were either the heterotopic or the mesial temporal structures, with functional connections between heterotopic and cortical areas. SIGNIFICANCE: These results confirm that a vast epileptogenic network, including heterotopic and cortical neurons, {{may be responsible for}} seizure generation in BPNH. This may explain certain surgical failures in this group...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopias</b> (PNHs) are malformations of {{cortical}} development {{related to}} neuronal migration disorders, frequently associated with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) {{is considered a}} very effective step of the presurgical evaluation, providing {{the recognition of the}} epileptogenic zone (EZ). At the same time, via the intracerebral electrodes it is possible to perform radiofrequency thermocoagulation (SEEG-guided RF-TC) with the aim of ablating and/or disrupting the EZ. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate both the relationships between PNH and the EZ, and the efficacy of SEEG-guided RF-TC. Methods: Twenty patients with DRE related to PNHs were studied. Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) patients with epilepsy and PNHs (unilateral or bilateral, single or multiple nodules) diagnosed on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (2) SEEG recordings available as part of the presurgical investigations, with at least one intracerebral electrode inside the heterotopia; (3) complete surgical workup with SEEG-guided RF-TC and/or with traditional neurosurgery, with a follow-up of at least 12 months. Results: Complex and heterogenic epileptic networks were found in these patients. SEEG-guided RF-TC both into the nodules and/or the cortex was efficacious in the 76 % of patients. Single or multiple, unilateral or bilateral PNHs are the most suitable for this procedure, whereas patients with PNHs associated with complex cortical malformations obtained excellent outcome only with traditional resective surgery.

External constriction by amniotic bands is the generally accepted mechanism: early amniotic rupture leads to formation of mesodermal fibrous strands that constrict, entangle, and amputate distal portions of limbs. Etiology is heterogeneous. Anecdotal cases involving central nervous system abnormalities (e. g., acrania, anencephaly, polymicrogyria, congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome, neuronal heterotopia, septo-optic dysplasia, and spinal cord tethering) have been reported.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{demonstrated that the}} antiproliferative agent methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) is able to induce in rats cerebral heterotopia that share striking similarities with those observed in human periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> (PNH), a cerebral dysgenesis frequently observed in human patients affected by drug-resistant focal epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the time-course of neurogenesis in the cerebral heterotopia of MAM-treated rats, {{with the idea of}} understanding why PNH develop in human patients. For these goals, we analyzed the cytoarchitectural features, the time of neurogenesis and the cellular phenotype of the heterotopia, by means of BrdU immunocytochemistry and confocal immunofluorescence experiments. Our data demonstrate that the different types of heterotopia in MAM-treated rats are formed through the same altered neurogenetic process, which follows quite organized neurogenetic gradients. The MAM-induced ablation of an early wave of cortical neurons is sufficient to alter per se the migration and differentiation of subsequently generated neurons, which in turn set the base for the formation of the different heterotopic structures.

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that an X-linked recessive form of chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIIPX) maps to Xq 28. To select candidate genes for the disease, we analyzed the expression in murine fetal brain and intestine of 56 genes from the critical region. We selected and sequenced seven genes {{and found that}} one affected male from a large CIIPX-affected kindred bears a 2 -bp deletion in exon 2 of the FLNA gene that is present at the heterozygous state in the carrier females of the family. The frameshift mutation is located between two close methionines at the filamin N terminus and is predicted to produce a protein truncated shortly after the first predicted methionine. Loss-of-function FLNA mutations {{have been associated with}} X-linked dominant <b>nodular</b> ventricular <b>heterotopia</b> (PVNH), a central nervous system (CNS) migration defect that presents with seizures in females and lethality in males. Notably, the affected male bearing the FLNA deletion had signs of CNS involvement and potentially has PVNH. To understand how the severe frameshift mutation we found can explain the CIIPX phenotype and its X-linked recessive inheritance, we transiently expressed both the wild- type and mutant filamin in cell culture and found that filamin translation can start from either of the two initial methionines in these conditions. Therefore, translation of a normal shorter filamin can occur in vitro from the second methionine downstream of the 2 -bp insertion we found. We confirmed this, demonstrating that the filamin protein is present in the patient’s lymphoblastoid cell line that shows abnormal cytoskeletal actin organization compared with normal lymphoblasts. We conclude that the filamin N terminal region between the initial two methionines is crucial for proper enteric neuron development...|$|R

These studies demonstrated compensatory cortical reorganization and showed that large areas of heterotopia and cortical dysplasia in the central area may retain normal motor and sensory function despite strikingly altered cytoarchitectonic organization and neuronal metabolism. Such lesions necessitate appropriate functional imaging studies prior to surgery and cortical mapping to avoid creating neurological deficits.

40|$|Subependymal <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> is a {{cortical}} development malformation that {{is commonly}} associated with refractory epilepsy. Patients with heterotopia show {{a wide spectrum of}} clinical manifestations, from being asymptomatic to presenting with intractable seizures and intellectual impairment. We report a case of drug-resistant epilepsy with normal intelligence, having bilateral subependymal heterotopic nodules in the brain, presenting to us with a movement disorder in the form of myoclonus of bilateral lower limbs which is an unusual manifestation of gray matter heterotopias. Although rare, gray matter heterotopias may present as movement disorder and should be considered in differential diagnosis while workup of movement disorders...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} child with a severe choreadystonic {{movement}} disorder, bilateral periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> (BPNH), and secondary microcephaly based on compound heterozygosity for two new ARFGEF 2 mutations (c. 2031 _ 2038 dup and c. 3798 _ 3802 del), changing the limited knowledge about the phenotype. The brain MRI shows bilateral hyperintensity of the putamen, BPNH, and generalized atrophy. Loss of ARFGEF 2 function affects vesicle trafficking, proliferation/apoptosis, and neurotransmitter receptor function. This can explain BPNH and microcephaly. We hypothesize that the movement disorder and the preferential damage to the basal ganglia, specifically to the putamen, may be caused by an increased sensitivity to degeneration, a dynamic dysfunction due to neurotransmitter receptor mislocalization or a combination of both...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} case of a girl who {{presented}} with typical absence seizures at age of 4. 5 years. EEG showed absence seizures of sudden onset with 3 Hz spike-and-waves that also correlated with the clinical absences. The seizure semiology included subtle deviation of the eyes which prompted MRI investigation of the brain. This showed a periventricular <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> in the mid to anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. Although possibly coincidental, periventricular heterotopia are considered to be epileptogenic and this association has been reported once before. Migration disorders, such as in the periventricular heterotopia of our patient, may influence the formation and excitability of the striato–thalamo–cortical network involved in the generation of 3 Hz spike-waves...|$|E
40|$|Xq 28 duplications {{encompassing}} MECP 2 {{have been}} described in male patients with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder associated with hypotonia and spasticity, severe learning disability, stereotyped movements, and recurrent pulmonary infections. We report on standardized brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 30 affected patients carrying an Xq 28 duplication involving MECP 2 of various sizes (228 [*]kb to 11. 7 [*]Mb). The {{aim of this study}} was to seek recurrent malformations and attempt to determine whether variations in imaging features could be explained by differences in the size of the duplications. We showed that 93 % of patients had brain MRI abnormalities such as corpus callosum abnormalities (n[*]=[*] 20), reduced volume of the white matter (WM) (n[*]=[*] 12), ventricular dilatation (n[*]=[*] 9), abnormal increased hyperintensities on T 2 -weighted images involving posterior periventricular WM (n[*]=[*] 6), and vermis hypoplasia (n[*]=[*] 5). The occipitofrontal circumference varied considerably between >+ 2 SD in five patients and <- 2 SD in four patients. Among the nine patients with dilatation of the lateral ventricles, six had a duplication involving L 1 CAM. The only patient harboring bilateral posterior subependymal <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia</b> also carried an FLNA gene duplication. We could not demonstrate a correlation between periventricular WM hyperintensities/delayed myelination and duplication of the IKBKG gene. We thus conclude that patients with an Xq 28 duplication involving MECP 2 share some similar but non-specific brain abnormalities. These imaging features, therefore, could not constitute a diagnostic clue. The genotype-phenotype correlation failed to demonstrate a relationship between the presence of <b>nodular</b> <b>heterotopia,</b> ventricular dilatation, WM abnormalities, and the presence of FLNA, L 1 CAM, or IKBKG, respectively, in the duplicated segment...|$|E
