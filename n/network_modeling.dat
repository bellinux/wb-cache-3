40|$|The {{multi-port}} <b>network</b> <b>model</b> is {{a simpler}} tool to analyze microstrip antennas on thinner substrates. While analyzing modified shaped microstrip antennas, the multi-port <b>network</b> <b>model</b> consists of {{larger number of}} segments which increases {{the complexity of the}} model. In this paper, first multi-port <b>network</b> <b>models</b> of multi-band and compact modified rectangular microstrip antennas are discussed. Further by using the symmetry of multi-port <b>network</b> <b>models,</b> a simpler even mode <b>network</b> equivalent <b>model</b> is proposed. The even mode <b>network</b> <b>model</b> solves only half of the network and thereby reduces the complexity of the multi-port <b>network</b> <b>model.</b> It gives closer match with multi-port <b>network</b> <b>model</b> result in terms of resonance frequency, input impedance and voltage distribution.

40|$|Among the {{different}} <b>models</b> of <b>networks</b> usually considered, the hexagonal <b>network</b> <b>model</b> {{is the most}} popular. However, it requires extensive numerical computations. The Poisson <b>network</b> <b>model,</b> for which the base stations (BS) locations form a spatial Poisson process, allows to consider a non constant distance between base stations. Therefore, it may characterize more realistically operational networks. The Fluid <b>network</b> <b>model,</b> for which the interfering BS are replaced by a continuum of infinitesimal interferers, allows to establish closed-form formula for the SINR (Signal on Interference plus Noise Ratio). This model was validated by comparison with an hexagonal <b>network.</b> The two <b>models</b> establish very close results.

40|$|Connectivity and {{capacity}} are two fundamental properties of wireless multi-hop networks. The scalability of these properties {{has been a}} primary concern for which asymptotic analysis is a useful tool. Three related but logically distinct <b>network</b> <b>models</b> are often considered in asymptotic analyses, viz. the dense <b>network</b> <b>model,</b> the extended <b>network</b> <b>model</b> and the infinite <b>network</b> <b>model,</b> which consider respectively a network deployed in a fixed finite area with a sufficiently large node density, a network deployed in a sufficiently large area with a fixed node density, and a network deployed in ^ 2 with a sufficiently large node density. The infinite <b>network</b> <b>model</b> originated from continuum percolation theory and asymptotic results obtained from the infinite <b>network</b> <b>model</b> have often been applied to the dense and extended networks. In this paper, through two case studies related to network connectivity on the expected number of isolated nodes and on the vanishing of components of finite order k> 1 respectively, we demonstrate some subtle but important differences between the infinite <b>network</b> <b>model</b> and the dense and extended <b>network</b> <b>models.</b> Therefore extra scrutiny has {{to be used in}} order for the results obtained from the infinite <b>network</b> <b>model</b> to be applicable to the dense and extended <b>network</b> <b>models.</b> Asymptotic results are also obtained on the expected number of isolated nodes, the vanishingly small impact of the boundary effect on the number of isolated nodes and the vanishing of components of finite order k> 1 in the dense and extended <b>network</b> <b>models</b> using a generic random connection model.
