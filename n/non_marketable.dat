40|$|Quarry wastes are {{a largely}} {{unavoidable}} by-product of the extraction and processing of aggregates. They {{are defined as}} wastes because no market currently exists for them, but unlike many other wastes they are generally inert and non-hazardous. Materials that may be classified as quarry wastes include overburden (although this is frequently used in restoration) and interburden (material of limited value that occurs above or between layers of economic aggregate material) and processing wastes (<b>non</b> <b>marketable,</b> mostly fine-grained material from screening,crushing and other processing activities) ...|$|E
40|$|Alternate bearing is a {{phenomenon}} in some varieties that after high yielding year (On year) which fruits are very small and <b>non</b> <b>marketable,</b> flowering decrease significantly and yield will decrease so much that harvest costs is more than grove income occasionally. This bearing cycle that is usually biennial, has high severity in Unshiu mandarin as an important commercial citrus variety of Iran specially in Mazandaran province and can cause severe losses for citrus producers and citrus industry. In this study for decrease of fruitlet density in "on years" and regulating of crop production in continuous years, an factorial experiment was conducted on 18 years old Unshiu trees grafted on Poncirus rootstock in RCBD with three replications. In this four year's study, which was conducted in Kotra Citrus Experiment Station situated in Tonekabon city, effects of tree spraying with NAA on fruitlet thinning was evaluated. Surveid factors were NAA concentrations (200, 300 and 400 mg/L) and time of tree spraying (30 and 50 days after full bloom) and obtained results were compared with check (unsprayed) trees. Results showed that tree spraying with 400 mg/L at 30 days after full bloom can cause significant differences with check trees and can decrease fruitlet density at high yielding years significantly and improve crop quality on off years...|$|E
40|$|Design Directory [Italia] is a {{research}} project promoted by Triennale di Milano and carried out by Dipartimento Indaco of Politecnico di Milano. It is also a tool to map the Italian design system (including companies, professionals, publishers, culture, schools and research), which, by visualizing information, allows to represent, interpret and share the system. It is a “mechanism”, a simple service design tool which {{wants to become a}} winning action and a cultural activity aimed to stimulate the creation of social networks, the participation of all the actors and the co-creation of contents. All this by using the web 2. 0 approach. The www was chosen as “the place” where data are built and shared: this choice is validated by the effectiveness of the web as a popular tool to share information. This solution develops belongingness and identity, which apparently are <b>non</b> <b>marketable</b> nor exchangable goods. It also stimulates the need of the actors, involved in the system, to be acknowledged and it generates attention and communication. Within the Italian context, lacking both norms and insitutions, there are no laws to control the Italian design system, nor a public institution such as a design center or a design council. Thus, Italy is an ideal context to practice research...|$|E
40|$|In finfish mariculture, seed {{production}} and larval rearing still form the bottleneck for all ongrowing operations and are considered {{as the main}} limiting factor for industrial development. Through trial and error more than through biological understanding two opposite hatchery techniques have been developed which surprisingly control a multiparametric combination of different factors but aspire to the same objective of conformity with wild standards and the cost-effective production of larvae. In intensive aquaculture, the rearing technique is characterised by high initial larval densities in small tanks under strict hydraulic, thermic, and nutritional conditions. The light conditions are artificial. The temperature and quality of water are controlled. The food is restricted to an unchanging diet of Brachionus plicatilis and Artemia, two live prey that do not even occur in the natural environment of the cultured larvae. In this method, all parameters are potentially limiting and the requisite for success is a highly specific biological knowledge and know-how. When the technical milieu does {{meet the requirements of}} the biological demand, the fish must either adapt or die. Even when they adapt they sometimes remain deformed (<b>non</b> <b>marketable)</b> or display poor growth performances. Thus, only few marine species are reared on an industrial scale using intensive culture methods...|$|E
40|$|Tradable forest {{products}} are normally {{the focus of}} attention in forest management as opposed to non tradable products and <b>non</b> <b>marketable</b> benefits such as erosion control, aesthetic and traditional ceremonies values, biodiversity maintenance, wildlife conservation and other intangible benefits. This situation results from the fact that tradable goods are included in the national accounts in terms of their contribution to the GDP. Potential and still controversial proxies for analysis of the macroeconomic impacts of environmental variables include the creation of the Resource Environmental Accounts (REA) and the Environmental Adjusted Net Domestic Product (EDP) and other approaches such as change of macroeconomic policies and linear programming. Planning sustainable forest management demands an integration of all resources including potential uses by different social groups at the national and international level over medium or long term. The commitment of both the formal and informal sectors in the planning and implementation of measures to protect the environment at national level depends on the perceived value that each associate with the resources. However, the most applied method of valuation of environment, Contingent Valuation (CV), is still facing a great deal of scepticism concerning the reliability of its results. Therefore, methodological problems rise further when attempting to analyse the likely impact of alternative future environmental policy /strategies at macro level in a data scarce situation, where target groups have minimum or no information about environmental goods. Other difficulties include derivation of coefficients and selection of the appropriate aggregation level. In this research, a multiobjevtive mathematical programming model framework incorporating farmers' preferences, regional and national environmental goals and priorities is developed to determine the impact of utilisation of marketable {{forest products}} on the non-market benefits of forests. The incorporation of the latter in the model provides the basis of a powerful decision support system for policy interventions...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to study and develop an appropriate model of waste reduction and separation in the community under the community learning process. This is a research and development (R&D) study with mixed methodology consisting of four steps. Step One: Research was conducted to obtain information on solid waste disposal in Bang Sue District, Bangkok Metropolis, Thailand, employing group discussions with community members and data collection from the field. Step Two: The activities for development of the model consisted of group discussions, workshops, and development of a test of knowledge and behaviors concerning solid waste disposal using the 1 A 3 R practice concept. Step Three : Experimentation with the model consisting of pre testing and post testing of knowledge and behaviors concerning solid waste disposal; door to door imparting of appropriate knowledge and behaviors concerning solid waste disposal; and collecting of data on the rate and amount of generated waste, and waste separation. Step Four: Evaluation of the developed model consisting of assessments based on physical indicators of the waste, opinions of experts, and impacts on participating communities. The findings revealed that (1) the post experiment knowledge and behavior mean scores of community members in the sample significantly increased over their pre experiment counterparts; and (2) the rate of waste generation decreased while waste separation increased. The proposed model of solid waste reduction and separation was accepted, and has four main components:(1) Community Practice: solid waste should be separated in the household into three types: food waste, marketable waste and <b>non</b> <b>marketable</b> waste must be clearly separated from household waste. (2) Knowledge sharing: door to door imparting of knowledge and behaviors on solid waste reduction and separation based on the 1 A 3 R practice concept should be promoted. (3) Community mastery: the community organization must be strengthened by employing active leaders and community members who follow the regulations of waste separation. (4) Team sharing: the district office or other local agencies should determine the purchasing points with clear purchasing location and time. Regarding recommendation of the study, a continuous implementation plan for household waste management is needed to ensure that the community has a sustainable waste separation activity through community building...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{initiated}} with assessing onion production practices {{and effects of}} N: P 2 O 5 :S, fertilizer rates on yield of Onion (Allium Cepa L.) under irrigated farming system in Dembyia, District, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. The work has two components namely assessing onion production practices in Sufankara, Guramba and Debir zuria kebeles and evaluating the effects of N: P 2 O 5 :S, fertilizer rates on yield and yield components of onion in Jenda kebele. The study was conducted during 2014 / 15 under irrigation. To assess onion production practices data was collected from 30 onion producing households using semi-structured questioners, focus group discussions, data on demographic structure and the whole value chain of onion production system were recorded and analyzed using SPSS version 20. In the experimental part twelve different N: P 2 O 5 :S fertilizer rates were tested. The experiment was laid down in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Data on vegetative and yield parameters were collected and analyzed using SAS version 9. 0 computer soft ware. The survey result indicated {{that most of the}} onion producers in the study area did not implemented the recommended irrigation cultural practices of onion, Limited supply of improved onion seeds also one of the important factor that contributes to low productivities of onion in the study area. Low rates of fertilizers application, low population of onion plants per unit area, high incidence of disease and insect pests, shortage of pesticides and their adulteration characterize the onion production system under farmer’s practice. As a result the productivity of onion under farmers was low (85. 6 q/ha) compared with the national production (101 q/ha). Besides the average crop water productivity was (1. 74 kg/m 3) which were relatively low with compared to other researches on onion crop water productivity (4. 62 kg/m 3)). Although the quantity of water is similar with the requirement of onion (4, 914 m 3 /ha), but the yield obtained is low. The major constraints of onion production in the study area were shortage of irrigation water, high costs of irrigation equipments, shortage of genuine spare parts and accessories, shortage of pesticides and their adulteration, limited supply of improved onion seeds and lack of storage facilities, lack of skills and knowledge, high incidence of diseases and insect pests and weak extension and credit services. Results of N: P 2 O 5 :S, rate trial revealed that most of growth and yield parameters of onion were significantly influenced by N: P 2 O 5 :S fertilizer rates. The highest plant height (60. 1 cm), leaf length (50. 1 cm) and maturity days (142 days) were recorded in 73. 5 : 92 : 16. 95, 136. 5 : 119. 6 : 22 and 136. 5 : 119. 6 : 22 kg ha- 1 N: P 2 O 5 : S, application rates respectively. The highest bulb weight (198. 8 g), marketable yield (20. 8 t/ha), <b>non</b> <b>marketable</b> yields (0. 509 t/ha) and total bulb yield (21. 398 t/ha) were recorded offer 105 : 119. 6 : 22 kg ha- 1 N:P 2 O 5 :S application rate. Onion plants without N: P 2 O 5 :S, fertilizer applications were inferior in all growth and yield parameters. For enhancement of production and productivity of onion in Dembyia district and other similar environment, it is necessary to solve problems indicated above through training, extension activities and improving the supply of inputs. Application of N: P 2 O 5 :S fertilizer at the rate of 105 : 119. 6 : 22 N:P 2 O 5 :S kg ha- 1 was economically feasible and thus can be recommended for the production of onion in the study area. However is advised to repeat the experiment to have forceful recommendationGlobal Affairs Canad...|$|E
