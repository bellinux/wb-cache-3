5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing {{and he had been}} dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|General Eusebio Canales (alias Chamarrita or Prince of Arms) {{is forced}} into exile after {{being accused of}} the murder of Colonel José Parrales Sonriente. He appears to be {{organizing}} a guerrilla attack on the President, but dies of a broken heart after reading a false news report detailing his daughter's wedding to Miguel Angel Face, at which the President was apparently present. The character of the General comes into clearer focus while he is on the road to exile. Canales's road to exile also introduces readers to the desperate financial situation of three sisters who are being taken advantage of by a doctor who visited their ailing mother. This episode demonstrates that corruption and malice exist <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capital city but also in rural villages.|$|E
5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other industrialists copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} paternalism.|$|E

5|$|The {{period from}} 1520 to around 1560, {{encompassing}} Garamond's career, {{was an extremely}} busy period for typeface creation. Many fonts were cut, some such as Robert Estienne’s for a single printer’s exclusive use, others sold or traded between them. Confusion about which engravers created which typefaces is natural since many were active over this time, creating typefaces <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Latin alphabet in roman and italic, but also in Greek and Hebrew for scholarly use. These included Garamond himself, Granjon, Guillaume Le Bé, particularly respected for his Hebrew fonts, Pierre Hautin, Antoine Augereau (who may have been Garamond's mentor), Estienne's stepfather Simon de Colines and others. This period saw {{the creation of a}} pool of high-quality punches and matrices that would supply the French and European printing industry, to a large extent, for the next two centuries.|$|E
5|$|Upon activation, ERK may phosphorylate {{a number}} of cytoplasmic and nuclear {{molecules}} that ultimately result in the protein synthesis and morphological changes observed in L-LTP. These cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules may include transcription factors such as CREB. ERK-mediated changes in transcription factor activity may trigger the synthesis of proteins that underlie the maintenance of L-LTP. One such molecule may be protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), a persistently active kinase whose synthesis increases following LTP induction. PKMζ is an atypical isoform of PKC that lacks a regulatory subunit and thus remains constitutively active. Unlike other kinases that mediate LTP, PKMζ is active <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 30 minutes following LTP induction; rather, PKMζ becomes a requirement for LTP maintenance only during the late phase of LTP. PKMζ thus appears important for the persistence of memory and {{would be expected to}} be important in the maintenance of long-term memory. Indeed, administration of a PKMζ inhibitor into the hippocampus of the rat results in retrograde amnesia with intact short-term memory; PKMζ does not {{play a role in the}} establishment of short-term memory. PKMζ has recently been shown to underlie L-LTP maintenance by directing the trafficking and reorganization of proteins in the synaptic scaffolding that underlie the expression of L-LTP. Even more recently, transgenic mice lacking PKMζ demonstrate normal LTP, questioning the necessity of PKMζ.|$|E

Carson became the hero of juvenile fiction <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, but also published in French, German, Portuguese, Gujarati, Hindi, Singhalese, Arabic and Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Naples {{has played}} an {{important}} and vibrant role over the centuries <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music of Italy, but in the general history of western European musical traditions. This influence extends from the early music conservatories in the 16th century through the music of Alessandro Scarlatti during the Baroque period and the comic operas of Pergolesi, Piccinni and, eventually, Rossini and Mozart. The vitality of Neapolitan popular music from the late 19th century has made such songs as O Sole mio and Funiculì Funiculà a permanent part of our musical consciousness.|$|E

During the Manueline era, the Casa da Índia was installed in the tower, which hoisted a large sculpture of the Royal Coat of Arms of Portugal on {{the exterior of the}} tower, facing the river. Starting in 1525, King John III sponsored a set of enlargements and renovations to the palace, which, most notably, altered the Tower of the King, expanding it and opening a large balcony, faced towards the Tagus.|$|E

25|$|The Miracle at the Meadowlands {{has left}} a lasting impact on the way {{organized}} football is played at all levels, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL. Most notably, it legitimized the quarterback kneel. Coaches everywhere took heed of Gibson's fate and immediately began instructing quarterbacks {{to sit on the}} ball in similar situations. Some traditionalists feel that the kneel-down has been detrimental to the game and have called for rule changes to eliminate or discourage the play. Other leagues, such as the Arena Football League, have done just that, and now require the ball to be advanced past the line of scrimmage in order for the clock to continue running in the final minute of play.|$|E
