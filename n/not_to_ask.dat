5|$|In February 1947 Nichols was {{appointed}} Professor of Mechanics at West Point, but in April 1948, he was recalled {{to command the}} AFSWP, with the rank of major general, becoming the youngest major general in the Army at the time. Although his rank entitled him to quarters at Fort Myer, Virginia, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General Omar Bradley advised him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for them as there had been criticism from some senior colonels. Nichols also became Senior Army Member of the Military Liaison Committee to the AEC, and Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff of the Army (G-3) for Atomic Energy.|$|E

25|$|Winfrey claims her worst {{interviewing}} {{experience was}} with Elizabeth Taylor in the show's second season. Just before the interview, Taylor asked Winfrey <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{any questions about}} her relationships.

Taylor returned to the show in 1992, apologized to Winfrey and told her that she was in excruciating back and hip pain at the time.|$|E
25|$|While in Madras, Peter {{decided to}} officialise his {{relationship}} with Ovtchinnikova. The pair were married in a Danish consulate in September 1939. Aware of his family's disapproval of the relationship, but also possibly wishing {{to take advantage of}} the turmoil created by the recently declared Second World War, the Prince did not bother to inform either the Greek royal court or his parents about the marriage. The royal family learned of the mesalliance through the press a few weeks later. Prince George, affronted by his son's decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him or the King for permission to marry, disowned Peter and henceforward refused contact with him. Despite her own disappointment, however, Princess George remained in touch with her son and continued to regularly send him money.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of the controversies, Clarkson was asked, and agreed, {{to remain}} in the Queen's service for an {{additional}} year beyond the traditional, but not official, five-year period. Though the decision was met with mixed feelings from across the country, Prime Minister Martin had advised the Queen to retain Clarkson as her vicereine in order to provide stability while the country faced potential constitutional difficulties arising from a minority government; there had been speculation at the end of 2004 over whether or not Clarkson would have to become directly involved in politics should the Cabinet led by Paul Martin lose the confidence of the House of Commons, leaving the Governor General to decide whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, then Stephen Harper, to form a government, or to call a general election. Ultimately, circumstances played out so that Clarkson's personal involvement was rendered unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} {{leadership}} race, Turner wanted a reconciliation with Chrétien {{in order to}} lead a united party into the coming general election, and asked Chrétien for what terms could a reconciliation be forged. Chrétien, angry about losing the leadership race, asked for terms that he knew that Turner could never give him, demanding that he be appointed Quebec lieutenant with control of patronage and organization in Quebec, a position that Turner had already promised to give to André Ouellet in exchange for backing him in the leadership race. Chrétien's demand to be appointed Quebec lieutenant proved to be impossible to meet as it would force Turner to break his promise to Ouellet, and so Turner compromised by creating a troika to run Liberal operations in Quebec comprising Chrétien, Ouellet and Lalonde. The troika was a sham, and during the 1984 general election, the {{three members of the}} troika spent more time feuding with one another than in combating the Conservatives. Chrétien's demand for the Quebec lieutenancy was not the only thing that divided him from Turner. As almost immediately, Chrétien and Turner clashed over the issue of an early election. Chrétien advised Turner <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the Governor-General to dissolve Parliament, but rather keep Parliament in session for the fall of 1984 in order to give the government a record to run on for a winter election in early 1985 (an election had to be called no later than February 1985 as the last election was in February 1980). Turner for his part believed that a boost in the polls after he became Prime Minister in late June 1984 justified asking for Parliament to be dissolved for an election in September 1984, so Chrétien's advice was disregarded. Relations between the two were strained, especially after the Liberals were severely defeated in the 1984 election. He was one of only 17 Liberal MPs elected from Quebec (the party had won 74 out of 75 seats in 1980). He was also one of only four MPs from the province elected from a riding outside Montreal.|$|E

500|$|In 1957, he {{was sent}} to the Imperial Defence College, London to attend a higher command course for one year. On his return, he was {{appointed}} the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 26th Infantry Division. While he commanded the division, General K. S. Thimayya was the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), and Krishna Menon, the defence minister. During Menon's visit to Manekshaw's division, he asked him what he thought of his chief. Manekshaw replied that it was not appropriate for him to think of his chief in that way, and told Menon <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> anybody again. This annoyed Menon and he told Manekshaw that if he wanted to, he could sack Thimayya, to which Manekshaw replied, [...] "You can get rid of him. But then I will get another." [...] This heated conversation with Menon later proved to be a thorn in his career.|$|E

Chris later tells Leslie his dating policy has affected others, explaining that he earlier warned Ben <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> out a co-worker. Leslie realizes that is why Ben rejected her and is glad when Ben asks her to eat {{in front of her}} favorite city hall mural. Leslie deletes her profile on HoosierMate, and is relieved to learn that Tom has 26 different profiles on the site to match himself with any type of woman, although the one Leslie matched with was his [...] "nerd" [...] profile.|$|E

"The D'oh-cial Network" [...] also parodies the 2010 drama film The Social Network, which {{portrays the}} {{founding}} of Facebook by Mark Zuckerberg and the subsequent lawsuit by American rowers Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss who claimed Zuckerberg stole their idea. The Social Network, like the episode, features {{a scene in which}} the Winklevoss twins are seen rowing. In July 2011, it was announced in Entertainment Weekly that American actor Armie Hammer would make a guest appearance in [...] "The D'oh-cial Network", playing the Winklevoss twins. Hammer previously attained that role in The Social Network. According to The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean, the staff of the show decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the [...] Winklevoss twins to guest star in the episode as themselves because [...] "We [...] were like, 'Wait, [...] played them, that's who people think they are, we should just get him.'"

500|$|When Valkyrie premiered in New York City on December 15, 2008, it {{was shown}} in a private {{screening}} room at the Time Warner Center, rather than at a Lincoln Square theater. The venue was chosen in part to minimize the exposure to Scientology protesters gathered at the Time Warner Center. Protesters also appeared at the December 18 Los Angeles screening, where Cruise entered through a tunnel. While the US [...] "red carpet" [...] was held in private, Cruise interacted with fans in South Korea and Europe. There were small anti-Scientology protests at the European premiere in Berlin, where Cruise signed one protester's Guy Fawkes mask. Anti-Scientology protests also occurred at the London premiere, and Amsterdam where Scientologists in the crowd engaged the protesters. The NTV news report about the January 26 Moscow premiere noted that journalists had to sign a document promising <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions about Scientology, and their questions would be censored; to this, the reporter remarked, [...] "You can't help getting reminded of those historic times depicted in Operation Valkyrie." ...|$|E

500|$|Hassett had two close {{encounters}} as captain, both on damp pitches before the First Test when Australia's unbeaten record was challenged. Against Yorkshire {{in the third}} match of the tour, Australia came the closest to losing for the entire tour. In a low-scoring match in which neither team posted more than 101, Australia was set 60 for victory, Hassett elected <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for the pitch to be rolled. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett [...] "might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [...] out of the pitch". Australia lost quick wickets and Hassett came in with the score at 2/5. After being involved in a run out, he fell to leave Australia at 5/20. Australia lost another wicket to be 6/31, effectively seven down with Sam Loxton incapacitated by injury, but scraped hom without further loss after both batsmen at the crease were dropped. It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912. In the 11th match of the tour against Hampshire, Australia ceded a first innings lead {{for the first time}} on tour. On a drying pitch, Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side's 195. Australia had made a solid start, before Hassett fell for 26, sparking a collapse of 8/47 to be all out for 117. Hampshire were then bowled out for 103, leaving Australia a target of 182, which they reached to seal an eight-wicket win.|$|E

A few months later, Dionysus was born on Mount Pramnos in the island of Ikaria, where Zeus went to release the now-fully-grown baby from his thigh. In this version, Dionysus is born by two [...] "mothers" [...] (Semele and Zeus) before his birth, hence the epithet dimētōr (of two mothers) {{associated}} with his being [...] "twice-born".|$|E
2500|$|Former bass guitarist Nick Oliveri, who {{was fired}} by Josh Homme in 2004, {{provided}} backing vocals on [...] "If I Had a Tail", and upon hearing that drummer Dave Grohl was returning to Queens of the Stone Age {{to assist in the}} recording process, Oliveri asked Homme if he too could return on bass guitar. Oliveri noted: [...] "I actually put in a request with Josh. I heard Dave was playing on the record, and I was like, 'Dude! I wanna play bass on it!' I'd be a fool <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> If Dave Grohl was playing drums, then I want in. He's an amazing drummer. I never had a better time in my life than when Dave was in the band."
