40|$|This {{is a case}} study, {{focused on}} Kumamoto City as an example, to examine {{what it means for}} local govenrments in Japan to {{establish}} their own ordinances based on their autonomous interpretations of <b>national</b> <b>laws.</b> When local governments determine operations of <b>national</b> <b>laws,</b> they usually compile implementation guidelines accordingly. But in this case, Kumamoto City sets the operation in the ordinance instead. Establishing ordinances means stronger decisions of the local governments, and brings about more powerful legal authority. Thus, it is very meaningful and significant for local governments to establish ordinances based on autonomous interpretations of <b>national</b> <b>laws.</b> Furthermore, establishing ordinances based on autonomous interpretations of <b>national</b> <b>laws</b> must be done properly in the sense of their contents and procedures. In a case of Kumamoto City, its ordinance fully meets these standards. This trend should be discussed further in the new movements of decentralization in Japan...|$|R

5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand {{the power of his}} office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus.

Out of the four questions, one asked if the president could disband parliament if the members violate <b>national</b> <b>law.</b> The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last referendum on the Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E
