5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E

25|$|Although powerful, the {{internal}} modem was commercially impractical. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> require special driver software, but a different hardware design {{was needed for}} every computer bus, including Apple II, S-100, TRS-80, and others. Some popular computers, like the Atari 400, did not even integrate internal slots. An obvious solution was to use the RS-232 serial port; modems were serial devices and generally driven off RS-232 anyway, and most computer designs included an RS-232 port, or some variant.|$|E
25|$|That the {{original}} {{creators of the}} movement were now passing the torch to another batch of bands and musicians was a historically enormous development: it would set Argentine rock apart.

From 1965, Argentine rock, with a solid line of ascent and evolution, became the most important rock movement in the Spanish-speaking world.|$|E
25|$|Experts posit {{that the}} {{construction}} of the wall {{was the result of the}} work of Nguyễn Dynasty soldiers and collaboration between the Viet and the H're minority, who seldom had peaceful relations.

25|$|Although {{limited in}} numbers and quality, airpower {{proved to be}} one of the {{greatest}} assets that the British possessed during this conflict. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> allow them to extend their reach beyond the border and bomb Kabul, but it also enabled them to harass the retreating enemy and to break up tribesmen as they attempted to form larger groups prior to launching an attack. The ability of the British to project airpower, even small scale raids, had considerable psychological effects. For example, the single-plane raid on the palace which took place of 24 May 1919, although effecting little actual damage nevertheless greatly impacted the morale of Afghan citizens and contributed to bringing King Amanullah to request an armistice.|$|E

Further, daytime viewership had declined greatly overall since 1975, thanks to a surge in cable and pay channels giving the viewer more choices than just the three major networks. With a greater possibility for local advertising revenue from the talk shows, numerous stations passed on the game despite the solid performance of its lead-in, Family Feud.|$|E
25|$|Nystatin is a polyene {{antifungal}} drug {{to which}} many molds and yeast infections are sensitive.

It also showed effectiveness in slowing the spread of Dutch Elm Disease, a fungal disease of elm trees spread by the elm bark beetle.|$|E

25|$|The Escarpment of {{that time}} was more {{gradually}} sloped than it is now, with much loose rock from its uplift. Sometime between 100,000 and 300,000 years ago, the Illinoian glaciation swept through the region. This had two impacts on the Escarpment. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> scour and steepen its slopes, leaving the many bare cliffs found today, it carved out both Platte and Kaaterskill cloves from the narrower, shorter and shallower valleys of smaller streams. In the latter, the gouge in the Escarpment was so deep it resulted in stream capture, as the outflow streams from North-South Lake, the headwaters of what would eventually be named Schoharie Creek instead flowed down into the new gorge. This both created Kaaterskill Falls, one of the Catskills' early tourist attractions, and relocated {{the source of the}} Schoharie to its present location.|$|E
25|$|Although Fine Gael gained seats, {{it crossed}} the Dáil chamber to the Opposition benches.

The Green Party picked up an extra seat, with John Gormley elected in Dublin South-East. He was elected by just over 30 votes after a marathon recount, lasting four days, saw Progressive Democrat Michael McDowell defeated.

His arrest in London made the front-page of newspapers worldwide as <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> involve the head of the military dictatorship that ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990, but it was the first time that several European judges applied the principle of universal jurisdiction, declaring themselves competent to judge crimes committed by former heads of state, despite local amnesty laws.|$|E

25|$|On the whole, {{industrialisation}} in Germany must {{be considered}} to have been positive in its effects. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world we live in. It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, {{in terms of social}} inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory at}} Amiens was celebrated {{as a huge}} victory; <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> mark a {{definitive}} turn in the road to Franco-Spanish peace but Spain had to sacrifice the war against France. In conjunction with Spanish financial distress, her insolvency caused by her bankrupt nature after the Capture of Cadiz, two costly failed armadas (in 1596 and 1597) against England and {{the war against the}} Dutch meant that Spain had too much too deal with. Mutinies in the garrisons of Doulens, Cambrai, Ardres and Le Catalet added to Spain's problems. With this advantage Henry made sure the Peace of Vervins was signed which would end the war between Spain and France. The treaty was highly beneficial to France - an ill and dying Philip recognized the formerly Protestant Henry as King of France. In addition Spanish ruled towns were handed over to the French king under terms of the peace. Vervins was the final defeat of Philip II, and a sign of the long downfall of Habsburg Spain and the gradual rise in European hegemony of France during the ensuing Grand Siècle.|$|E
25|$|A {{day before}} the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in {{exchange}} for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and Deshawn Stevenson. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts {{felt that this was}} a good move, because <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through. The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128–78. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83–77. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55–27 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title.|$|E
