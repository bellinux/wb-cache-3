Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, {{but it could have been}} an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E

In May 2014, she posted three photos on her Instagram account, which revealed she was working the producer. She called him [...] "a slave driver" [...] in the studio. Diplo commented that he met Madonna because of her kids and then she invited him to a party, and they ended up writing seven songs together. He continued: [...] "I do not usually feel pressured to write hits, but when it’s an artist of this cailber, it’s obvious that I want to push the bounderies a little bit further and surpass myself."

Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album.

500|$|Milne {{was with}} Dundee United {{for a further}} three seasons and still a regular player in the team, {{although}} he scored less frequently. Milne's increasingly fractious relationship with manager Jim McLean was also becoming common knowledge; in December 1983 McLean publicly criticised Milne, stating [...] "I have {{tried to get the}} message across to him that it is when he is not playing well that he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hardest. It is plainly not sinking in." [...] Ironically some months later in August 1984, it was Milne who scored both goals against Nottingham Forest in a pre-season testimonial match for McLean. However, after the game the pair again fell out because of a brief conversation Milne had with Brian Clough which led McLean to believe the player was trying to arrange a deal away from United; by this time Milne had grown increasingly frustrated over being frequently fined a week's wages for breaking minor club rules and generally offending McLean's strict sense of discipline. The financial strain this caused led to him to work as a casual labourer in order to meet his mortgage repayments. By this time his drinking had become more of a problem, resulting in a struggle to maintain fitness.|$|E

500|$|... "Living for Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna, Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid, with additional writing from MoZella and Toby Gad. Madonna's collaboration with Diplo was revealed in May 2014 through an image on her Instagram showing her {{working on her}} laptop with him. She had invited him for her annual Oscar party, {{and he could not}} make it. So he began texting with her about music and sent some music. Madonna replied with a 20-page text containing her anecdotes on the music. Following this they started collaborating for the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] "Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding.

[...] According to Diplo, [...] "Living for Love" [...] had almost 20 versions ranging from a piano ballad to an EDM composition, ultimately Madonna and Diplo compromising on a middle level. Rechtshaid and British singer MNEK also joined for writing sessions with them, improving the verse of the song.

One song was composed using a hook Madonna had sung in the studio; Diplo described it as [...] "super weird". Another one, later confirmed as [...] "Living for Love", had nearly twenty versions recorded ranging from a piano ballad to an EDM version. Ultimately Madonna and Diplo compromised on version midway between the two styles. Rechtshaid and British singer MNEK also joined their writing sessions, improving the song's verses. Diplo also confirmed another track, known as [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", which he believed would push the lyrical boundaries for a pop song. Both Alicia Keys and Ryan Tedder confirmed working on the album, saying that they had contributed to the songwriting with Keys playing piano on [...] "Living for Love". Two other songs, [...] "Messiah" [...] and [...] "Devil Pray", were confirmed by Madonna in different interviews.|$|E

[...] During the tournament, Kavaliauskas averaged 10.5 points and 4.0 rebounds.

2500|$|The {{difference}} of the APF for air purifying negative pressure full-facepiece masks are not large. The difference between PAPR with helmets a few more. But measurements {{showed that the}} real effectiveness of RPD (at the workplace conditions) {{is strongly dependent on}} the conditions of their use, not only from the design, and this partly explains the difference in APF values. The APF for negative pressure half mask respirators are twofold. But this difference cannot be considered separately from recommendations for use of respirators. The use of half-face masks in the US is limited to 10 PEL for the [...] "worst case" [...] - work in the polluted atmosphere of 8 hours per day, 40 hours a week. But British experts took into account large experience of the use of negative pressure air purifying RPDs, and they concluded that to achieve continuous wear respirator 8 hours a day is impossible (because of the negative impact on the health of workers). For this reason, [...] they recommend to the employer to give the job to the workers so that they work in the polluted atmosphere not during entire shift, but only a part of the shift. The remaining time the employee <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a non-polluted atmosphere (without the respirator). The fact that the employee is in a non-polluted atmosphere some part of working time provide additional protection of his health, and therefore, the requirements to the efficiency of the respirator may be less stringent.|$|E
