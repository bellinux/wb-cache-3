40|$|The nursing {{environment}} {{is full of}} situations under ethical and legal constraints. Therefore this study focused on the knowledge, position and attitudes of nurses in relation to healthcare ethics and nursing legal regulations. We conducted a pretest and posttest study using a specific questionnaire administered to {{a convenience sample of}} nurses who worked in a healthcare system in Principado de Asturias, a northern state of Spain and were enrolled in a continuing nursing education program about ethical and legal aspects in the nursing profession. The main findings suggest that nurses are very concerned about situations that create ethical and legal conflicts but do not feel sufficiently trained. In general, they demonstrated sufficient knowledge to address the most frequent ethical and moral situations of nursing work, and the training received during a postgraduate course in ethics and legislation provided them with greater knowledge and tools to solve the dilemmas. In conclusion, although the nurses have university-level education about professional deontology, bioethics and <b>nursing</b> <b>legislation,</b> they require periodic continuing education...|$|E

Nor does it provide adequate legislative protection especially with regard to the responsibilities within the prehospital environment. This creates role confusion and conflict, which has a negative impact on the patient who requires emergency care, the advanced nurse practitioner and the emergency team.. The purpose of this research was to explore and describe {{the role of}} the South African emergency nurse in the prehospital environment and the emergency room and to formulate an instrument {{that can be used for}} policy formation, education, training and evaluation. The purpose was addressed though an action research process where data was collected in four phases that included both qualitative and quantitative methods. The process involved a group of experts who utilized their expert knowledge, skills and attitudes to explore and describe the phenomena being researched. They confirmed that the environment in which emergency nurses worked included the pre-hospital environment and emergency room. The data/roles identified and analysed were weighted to provide a weighting scale by means of a methodology referred to as “ Modelling of Human Judgement”. A competency rating was done to provide a three-point competency rating. The data/roles obtained was developed into a questionnaire and sent to the rest of the emergency nurse population for validation and verification. After validation and verification the information gathered was reduced, organized and with the assistance of a statistician (throughout all the phases) the data was analysed and an instrument developed for use as a policy framework for e. g. a scope of practice and unit standards. The instrument was quantified for educational and evaluation purposes. The instruments can be used to develop high levels of competency to encourage interdependent and autonomous decision-making, which is based on the knowledge of role expectations and sound professional decision making, which in turn is supported by appropriate legislation...|$|E

40|$|The Labour Relations Act (South Africa, 1991) made {{provision}} for protected strike action by employees, subject to certain conditions, procedures and negotiated agreements. This {{led to the}} removal of the strike clause in the Nursing Act (South Africa, 1992). The labour rights of all citizens are entrenched in the Constitution of the country (South Africa, 1996). Participation in strike action by the nurse/ midwife, regardless of the legal requirements and specifications, does, however, pose an ethical question. It is therefore necessary to conduct a value clarification on strike action by nurses in South Africa. The purpose of this research is to explore and describe the perceived values of participants from an accessible population on this phenomenon. A qualitative, exploratory and descriptive research design was deployed. The perceived values of nurses on strike action were collected by means of an openended questionnaire/sketch. Over a period of three years a purposive and convenient sampling method was used, involving all the enrolled post basic nursing/midwifery students/ learners at a particular Nursing Education Institution. The justification of the sample was further enhanced by also collecting data on the participants’ age and provincial distribution location. Although a 63 % sample realisation (of the accessible population) was achieved, this represents only 1, 5 % of the registered nursing/midwifery population in the country. A descriptive analysis of the participants’ age and provincial distribution was undertaken, as well as a content analysis of their perceived values on strike action. The mean age of the participants was 48 years, which could be attributed to {{the fact that most of}} them were enrolled for a post-basic Diploma in Community Nursing Science. Most of the responses (52, 7 %) were against strike action and 32, 5 % supported strike action by nurses as a constitutional and legal right. A fairly substantial number of participants (14, 8 %) expressed mixed views as to whether strike action by nurses is right or wrong. Some respondents (15, 7 %) also reflected confusion regarding the enactment of strike action and {{the removal of the}} strike clause from the <b>nursing</b> <b>legislation.</b> Although this study does not claim external validity due to inappropriate representation of the nursing profession, the nurse of today opposes strike action.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} <b>nursing</b> and midwifery <b>legislation</b> in high HIV-burden {{countries of}} the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region, with respect to global standards, and suggests areas that could be further examined to strengthen the nursing and midwifery professions and HIV service delivery. To provide universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment, sufficient numbers of competent human resources for health are required. Competence in this context means possession and use of requisite knowledge and skills to fulfil the role delineated in scopes of practice. Traditionally, the purpose of professional regulation has been to set standards that ensure the competence of practising health workers, such as nurses and midwives. One particularly powerful form of professional regulation is assessed here: national legislation {{in the form of}} nursing and midwifery acts. Five {{countries of the}} WHO South-East Asia Region account for more than 99 % of the region's HIV burden: India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand. Online legislative archives were searched to obtain the most recent national <b>nursing</b> and midwifery <b>legislation</b> from these five countries. Indonesia was the only country included in this review without a national nursing and midwifery act. The national nursing and midwifery acts of India, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand were all fairly comprehensive, containing between 15 and 20 of the 21 elements in the International Council of Nurses Model <b>Nursing</b> Act. <b>Legislation</b> in Myanmar and Thailand partially delineates nursing scopes of practice, thereby providing greater clarity concerning professional expectations. Continuing education was the only element not included in any of these four countries' legislation. Countries without a nursing and midwifery act may consider developing one, in order to facilitate professional regulation of training and practice. Countries considering reform to their existing nursing acts may benefit from comparing their legislation with that of other similarly situated countries and with global standards. Countries interested in improving the sustainability of scale-up for HIV services may benefit from a greater understanding of the manner in which nursing and midwifery is regulated, be it through continuing education, scopes of practice or other relevant requirements for training, registration and licensing.

40|$|Based on {{evidence}} of negative effects and limited efficacy of physical restraint of older adults, efforts to eliminate physical restraint use {{in nursing homes}} in the United States coalesced in federal <b>legislation</b> (<b>Nursing</b> Home Reform Law) implemented in 1990. Despite diverse attempts, such as policy mandates, education, or intensive nursing and system efforts, use of physical restraints in U. S. nursing homes in 1992 still exceeded that of other Western countries. ^ This study was a secondary analysis of an existing data set developed to test the effects of interventions designed to reduce restraint use in nursing homes. The present study examined predictors of restraint use in those nursing home residents who were either continuously or newly restrained following interventions aimed at restraint reduction. Using a one group pre-test post-test design, contextual factors and resident characteristics known {{to be associated with}} restraint use were examined to establish predictors of continued and initiated restraint use employing logistic regression analysis. ^ Of the nursing home residents restrained prior to interventions (N = 201), 135 (67. 2 %) were still restrained following the interventions. Lower cognitive status (odds ratio: 2. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 7, 3. 3) and fall risk as reason for restraint (odds ratio: 3. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 5, 8. 0) were predictive of continued restraint use. Of the nursing home residents not restrained prior to the interventions (N = 335), 23 (6. 9 %) were newly restrained. Lower cognitive status (odds ratio: 1. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 0, 2. 1) and a greater ratio of licensed nursing personnel (predominantly licensed practical nurses) to non-licensed nursing personnel (odds ratio: 3. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 2, 11. 9) were predictive of initiation of restraint use. ^ Key findings of the study suggest that continued restraint use in nursing homes occurs with residents who are severely cognitively impaired and when staff believe the resident to be at risk for falling, despite a lack of objective verification of fall risk. Initiation of restraint use following interventions is a less common event but occurs when a nursing home resident is cognitively impaired and when staff mix has a greater proportion of licensed (particularly licensed practical nurses) than non-licensed nursing personnel. ...|$|R
40|$|The nursing {{handover}} report {{belongs to}} everyday activities of nurses. In {{the work of}} a nurse {{it is important to know}} exactly who, when, where, what and how. This is what the following activity and responsibilities of the duty period are derived from. This diploma thesis, focused on the Nursing Handover Report at a Patient´s Bedside, has a theoretical and practical part. The first, theoretical part, is composed of three chapters, the modern trend of nursing, the <b>nursing</b> report and <b>legislation.</b> The second, practical part, is based on quantitative and qualitative surveys with three defined objectives and four hypotheses. The first objective was to determine what nurses regard as a major contribution of the nursing handover report at a patient´s bedside. The second objective was to define the greatest obstacle in the nursing handover report at a patient´s bedside. The third objective was assessing the patients´ attitude towards the nursing handover report at their bedside. All three objectives were met by the research. The qualitative part of this diploma work was based on a conducted kvasiexperiment and subsequent questions for patients and nurses. The research sample was 5 nurses and 5 patients from the intermediate care unit (IMCU) and 5 nurses and 5 patients from the resuscitation station (RES) of the České Budějovice hospital, PLC. The semi-structured interview consisted of six to eight questions, surveying the feelings, contents, visualization, integration, advantages, disadvantages, departments, nursing handover at the bedside and the quality. The data collection was carried out by means of an anonymous questionnaire designed for nurses to find out how nurses hand the report over or how they would like to hand it over. 303 nurses from the České Budějovice Hospital, PLC, and the Příbram Hospital, PLC, took part in the research. The results were used to confirm or to reject the hypotheses. The first hypothesis: Nurses do not consider an oral handover report as a quality one when done without a visual completion, this has not been confirmed by the investigation. The second hypothesis: In terms of the risk of the patient's damage, the quality of the handover report done by the nurses in the IMCU and the RES is better than that done by the nurses in a standard unit, this has been confirmed. The third hypothesis: Nurses consider the time consuming nature of the handover report at the patient´s bedside as the greatest difficulty, this has not been confirmed. The fourth and last hypothesis: Patients have a positive attitude towards the nursing handover report at the bedside, this has been confirmed by the research. The output of this thesis is to suggest a standard for the nursing handover report at a patient´s bedside. The results can be used for nursing managers, deputy directors of nursing, medical students and nursing professionals...|$|R
