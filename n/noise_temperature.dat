2500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{developed}} a maser to provide ultra-low-noise amplification of S-band microwave signals received from deep space probes. This maser used deeply refrigerated hydrogen to chill the amplifier {{down to a}} temperature of four kelvin. Amplification was achieved by exciting a ruby comb with a 12.0 gigahertz klystron. In the early years, it took days to chill and remove the impurities from the hydrogen lines. Refrigeration was a two-stage process with a large Linde unit on the ground, and a crosshead compressor within the antenna. The final injection was at [...] through a [...] micrometer-adjustable entry to the chamber. The whole system <b>noise</b> <b>temperature</b> looking at cold sky (2.7 kelvins in the microwave band) was 17 kelvins. This gave such a low noise figure that the Mariner IV space probe could send still pictures from Mars back to the Earth even though the output power of its radio transmitter was only 15 watts, and hence the total signal power received was only -169 decibels {{with respect to a}} milliwatt (dBm).|$|E

Prototype array systems need to demonstrate the low noise potential of aperture array technology. This paper presents noise measurements for an Aperture Array tile of 144 dual-polarized tapered slot antenna (TSA) elements, originally built and characterized for use as a Phased Array Feed for application in an L-band radio astronomical receiving system. The system noise budget is given and the dependency of the measured <b>noise</b> <b>temperatures</b> on the beam steering is discussed. A comparison is made of the measurement results with simulations of the noise behavior using a system noise model.

If that amplifier is used to amplify a source having a <b>noise</b> <b>temperature</b> of about room temperature (290 K), as many sources do, then the insertion of that amplifier would reduce the SNR of a signal by 6 dB.
