5|$|Rozhestvensky reorganized his ships {{into three}} divisions; the first {{consisted}} of the four new s commanded by himself, von Fölkersam commanded the second division of the battleships , Navarin, Sissoi Veliky and the armored cruiser , and Nebogatov retained his ships as the third division. Von Fölkersam, ill with cancer, died on 26 May and Rozhestvensky decided not to inform the fleet {{in order to keep}} morale up. The captain of Oslyabya became the commander of the 2nd Division while Nebogatov had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he was now the squadron's de facto second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the first}} episode to feature Jerry's parents. Only one casting session was {{performed}} to find the actors for the roles. Philip Sterling was originally cast {{to play the role}} of Morty Seinfeld, but was replaced with Phil Bruns. Bruns was then replaced as well because Seinfeld and David wanted the character to be harsher. As a result, the role was recast and given to Barney Martin — who had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> another actor had already established the part. In this episode Kramer greets Morty by name.|$|E
5|$|Between 1958 and 1964, the Merseyside {{area had}} about 500 {{different}} groups, which were constantly forming and breaking up, {{with an average}} of about 350 groups playing concerts on a regular basis. In 1961, Harry and the Cavern Club's DJ, Bob Wooler, compiled a list of groups that they had personally heard of, which had almost 300 names. In 1962, Mersey Beat held a poll to find out who was the most popular Merseyside group. When the votes were counted, Rory Storm & the Hurricanes were in first place, but after looking through the postal votes again, Harry noticed that forty votes were all written in green ink, in the same handwriting, and from the same area of Liverpool, so the dubious votes were declared void. This was suspected to have been Storm himself, but Harry had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the Beatles had done exactly the same thing.|$|E

5|$|The Halo series {{features}} voice work {{by television}} and film actors including Ron Perlman, Orlando Jones, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert Davi, and Terence Stamp. Voice acting became more important as Halo: Combat Evolveds sequels were developed; Halo 2 had 2,000 lines of combat dialogue, while Halo 3 has {{in excess of}} 14,000 lines. The actual technology for the trilogy changed very little; while some actors voiced their lines in remote locations, others traveled to Bungie to record their lines. In interviews, Halos voice actors stated that they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the games would become such a critical and commercial success. Steve Downes, {{the voice of the}} game's protagonist, stated that generally when a voice actor has finished their lines, their involvement with the game ends. As the characters in Combat Evolved were relatively undefined, the voice actors were given leeway to develop their own style and personality.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, failed but continued to operate via motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator {{was attached to the}} number one engine, failed, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his stick shaker, and the slat disagreement sensors. While a switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist – not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. Furthermore, to reach the switch the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft never got higher than 350 feet (110 m) above ground and was in the air for only 50 seconds between when the engine separated and when it crashed, there was not sufficient time to take such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally. As the wings and engines were not visible from the cockpit, the crew likely had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> an engine had fallen off, only that one had failed.|$|E
25|$|The {{ancient world}} had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> male semen and female ovum were both needed {{to form a}} fetus; instead they thought that the male {{contribution}} in reproduction consisted {{of some sort of}} formative or generative principle. According {{to the understanding of the}} time, Mary's bodily fluids would provide all the matter that was needed for Jesus' bodily form, including his male sex.|$|E

25|$|Peled reiterated, however, {{that he had}} {{conceived}} {{of this as a}} purely military operation to counter a military threat, and that he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Israel would maintain occupation of the territories captured for decades afterwards, or establish settlements designed to effect their annexation and permanently change their demographic character.

Nevertheless, he announced shortly after the raid that he intends to replace his son as the company's CEO. Sholom Rubashkin remained in charge though. He was finally replaced as CEO in September 2008 by Bernard Feldman, a New York attorney who had worked as counsel for the family, after child labor charges against Aaron and Sholom Rubashkin had been announced, and the Orthodox Union had threatened to withdraw their kosher certification.|$|E

25|$|Burns said in {{his speech}} that he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be a}} {{candidate}} for the electorate, and therefore did not have enough time to prepare a speech, so he made it up along the way. He stated that if he became a Member of Parliament for Bruce, he would endeavour to act in a straightforward manner. In response to questions, Burns stated that he was an advocate for free trade. He also stated that he was against separationism, the act of dividing the North and South Islands, and that although he supported the use of income tax, he was against a stamp act or newspaper postage.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, al-Zawahiri {{married his}} first wife, Azza Ahmed Nowari, {{a student at}} Cairo University who was {{studying}} philosophy. Their wedding, which {{was held at the}} Continental Hotel in Opera Square, was very conservative, with separate areas for both men and women, and no music, photographs, or light-hearted humour. Many years later, when the United States attacked Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks in October 2001, Azza apparently had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> al-Zawahiri had supposedly been a jihadi emir (commander) for the last decade. In June 2012, one of Zawahiri's four wives, Umaima Hassan, released a statement on the internet congratulating the role played by Muslim women in the Arab Spring.|$|E
25|$|Wood had a {{long-term}} relationship with actress and songwriter Dolores Fuller, whom he met in late 1952. The two lived together for a time and Wood cast Fuller in three of his films: Glen or Glenda, Jail Bait and Bride of the Monster. Fuller later said she initially had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Wood was a crossdresser and was mortified when she saw Wood dressed as a woman in Glen or Glenda. The couple broke up in 1955 after Wood cast another actress in the lead role of Bride of the Monster (Wood originally wrote the part for Fuller and reduced her part to a 1-minute cameo) and because of Wood's excessive drinking.|$|E

Milroy {{concentrated}} all of his forces in the three forts defending the town. Having feared exactly this type of a scenario, General-in-chief Henry W. Halleck had asked Schenck to order Milroy to fall back from Winchester to Harpers Ferry. Although Schenck had discussed evacuation with Milroy, he left no clear direction for Milroy to evacuate, since Milroy had convinced Schenck that his defensive position in Winchester was strong. Milroy had previously decided to disregard concerns from Washington because he was confident that {{the strength of his}} fortifications would allow his garrison to withstand an assault or a siege.|$|E

25|$|Nolte {{argued that}} the vast {{majority}} of Germans had no knowledge of the 'Holocaust while it was happening Nolte claimed that the genocide of the Jews was Hitler’s personal pet project, and that the Holocaust was the work of only a few Germans who were entirely unrepresentative of German society Contradicting the American historian Raul Hilberg, who claimed that hundreds of thousands of Germans were complicit in the Holocaust, from high-ranking bureaucrats to railway clerks and locomotive conductors, Nolte {{argued that the}} functional division of labour in modern society meant that most people in Germany had no idea of how they were assisting in genocide. In support of this, Nolte cited the voluminous memoirs of German generals and Nazi leaders, such as Albert Speer, who claimed to have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> their country was engaging in genocide during World War II.|$|E

25|$|Becky Sharp says {{farewell}} to the Sedley family and enters {{the service of the}} crude and profligate baronet Sir Pitt Crawley, who has engaged her as a governess to his daughters. Her behaviour at Sir Pitt's house gains his favour, and after the premature death of his second wife, he proposes marriage to her. However he finds that she has secretly married his second son, Captain Rawdon Crawley. (Becky very much regrets having done that; however, when she married Rawdon she had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> his father's wife would die so soon after). Sir Pitt's elder half sister, the spinster Miss Crawley, is very rich, having inherited her mother's fortune, and the whole Crawley family compete for her favour so she will bequeath them her wealth.

First she favours the family of Sir Pitt's brother, but when she dies, she has left her money to Sir Pitt's oldest son, also called Pitt.|$|E
25|$|Eraserheads went onstage {{for their}} reunion concert on August 30, 2008 at The Fort Open Field, Taguig City. The concert, however, {{was cut short}} halfway through a planned 30-song setlist as Buendia {{was rushed to the}} Makati Medical Hospital after {{experiencing}} chest pains. He was reported to be in stable condition. Buddy Zabala had checked on Buendia in his tent right after they went to their planned 20 minute break and saw that he already was on an oxygen mask with paramedics checking his blood pressure. As he left and came back, paramedics were already taking Buendia on an ambulance. Bandmates Zabala, Marasigan and Adoro further said that they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Buendia was already having difficulty performing. In the spirit of the reunion, Marasigan, Zabala and Adoro went to Saguijo after the concert and they continued their sets there. Kris Gorra-Dancel, Ebe Dancel, Aia De Leon and many other OPM artists joined them as well. During the concert, Jazz Nicolas of the Itchyworms and a close friend of the band, also joined the band and played synths, keyboards, and other back-up instruments.|$|E
25|$|Aquaman {{appears as}} the main protagonist in the {{animated}} film , voiced by Matt Lanter. In the film Arthur Curry starts off with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he is half-Atlantian, due to his mother being the princess of Atlantis and promised to someone else; in the present she is the Queen, {{and trying to keep}} Arthur's half-brother Orm under control after Darkseid's attack in Justice League: War cost the King of Atlantis his life. At the time, Arthur has just lost his father and is being watched over by Mera, his mother's loyal right-hand woman. After Black Manta orders an assassination attempt on him, Arthur is brought to the royal armory by Mera; there, he dresses in what would become his costume. Arthur confronts Orm, {{with the help of the}} Justice League, but learns that Orm murdered their mother so he could wage war against the surface world. In the midst of the battle, Arthur learns Black Manta had manipulated Orm and summons a shark to swallow him. Thanks to Cyborg's technology, they are able to play Orm's confession of murder to the troops; Arthur takes his place as king, wanting to bridge the surface and Atlantian worlds in peace. Much to his annoyance, Arthur is given the codename Aquaman by Shazam.|$|E
