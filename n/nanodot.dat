30|$|In conclusion, we have {{fabricated}} self-organized InN <b>nanodots</b> on Si (111) substrates by PA-MBE via droplet epitaxy technique. The {{characterizations of}} InN <b>nanodots</b> and growth mechanism of InN <b>nanodots</b> by droplet epitaxy {{are discussed in}} this report according to the analyses of in situ RHEED, SEM, AFM, XPS, TEM, and PL. The formation of InN <b>nanodots</b> is observed by RHEED and XPS. From the results of SEM and AFM, the density of InN <b>nanodots</b> becomes {{less than that of}} the In droplets due to the surface diffusion and desorption of atoms during the nitridation and annealing process. The cross section TEM image shows the shape of InN <b>nanodots,</b> and their PL emission performs at the peak energy of 0.82  eV. As the substrate temperatures increase from 250 to 450  °C, the density of InN <b>nanodots</b> decreases while both the average sizes of InN <b>nanodots</b> and surface roughness of the samples increase. For the growth at 250  °C, the density of the InN <b>nanodots</b> can reach as high as 2.83 [*]×[*] 1011  cm− 2.

Inspired by the biological organization of polypeptides and porphyrins in living systems, {{here we have}} developed a supramolecular strategy to fabricate photothermal <b>nanodots</b> through peptide-modulated self-assembly of photoactive porphyrins. The self-assembling nature of porphyrins induces the formation of Taggregates as substructures of the <b>nanodots,</b> and thus enables the fabrication of <b>nanodots</b> with totally inhibited fluorescence emission and singlet oxygen production, leading to a high light-to-heat conversion efficiency of the <b>nanodots.</b> The peptide moieties not only provide aqueous stability for the <b>nanodots</b> through hydrophilic interactions, but also provide a spatial barrier between porphyrin groups to inhibit the further growth of <b>nanodots</b> through the strong 7 r-stacking interactions. Thermographic imaging reveals that the conversion of light to heat based on the <b>nanodots</b> is efficient in vitro and in vivo, enabling the <b>nanodots</b> to be applied for photothermal acoustic imaging and antitumor therapy.

30|$|TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory {{cytokine}} and {{is responsible}} for activation and positive regulation of the NFκB pathway, which is a key regulator of the immune response[23]. There was a five-fold increase in TNF-α found at 50 -nm <b>nanodot</b> arrays in macrophages, while a five- to six-fold increase was demonstrated in foam cells at 50 - to 100 -nm <b>nanodot</b> arrays (Figure 5 a,b). Similarly, IL- 6 encodes a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is critical for activating an acute inflammatory response and {{is responsible for}} recruiting adaptive immune cells {{to the site of}} injury or infection. There was a significant three-fold increase of IL- 6 in macrophages cultured on 200 -nm <b>nanodot</b> arrays, while there was about a one-fold increase at 50 - to 100 -nm <b>nanodot</b> arrays. In contrast, the foam cells responded differently than the macrophages, with a three- to five-fold increase of IL- 6 when cultured on 10 - to 100 -nm <b>nanodot</b> arrays and a two-fold increase for 200 -nm <b>nanodot</b> arrays. In comparison, IL- 10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine responsible for blocking the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and negatively regulates NFκB activation. There was an increasing trend of IL- 10 gene expression in the macrophages and the foam cells (Figure 5 a,b). For the CCL- 2 chemokine, which functions to recruit monocytes and other immune cells, there was no significant change in any of the macrophage topography conditions.
