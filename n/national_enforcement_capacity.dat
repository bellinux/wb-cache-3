40|$|International audienceLand use {{governance}} in the Brazilian Amazon has undergone {{significant changes in}} the last decade. At the <b>national</b> level, law <b>enforcement</b> <b>capacity</b> has increased and downstream industries linked to commodity chains responsible for deforestation have begun to monitor some of their suppliers’ impacts on forests. At the municipal level, local actors have launched a Green Municipality initiative, aimed at eliminating deforestation and supporting green supply chains at the territorial level. In this paper, we analyze the land use transition since 2001 in Paragominas—the first Green Municipality—and discuss the limits of the governance arrangements underpinning these changes. Our work draws on a spatially explicit analysis of biophysical variables and qualitative information collected in interviews with key private and public stakeholders of the main commodity chains operating in the region. We argue that, up to now, the emerging multi-level scheme of land governance has not succeeded in promoting large-scale land use intensification, reforestation and rehabilitation of degraded lands. Moreover, private governance mechanisms based on improved product standards, fail to benefit from potential successful partnerships between the public and private sector at the territorial level. We propose a governance approach that adopts a broader territorial focus as a way forward...|$|R

40|$|Building <b>enforcement</b> <b>capacity,</b> that is, {{attaining}} {{and sustaining}} control {{in order to}} implement changes, is crucial {{for the success of}} public management reforms. However, this aspect of public management reform does not receive much theoretical or empirical attention. This paper analyzes the process of building <b>enforcement</b> <b>capacity</b> for the case of the Mexican Professional Civil Service reform. Although this reform experienced several complications (e. g., limited support, resources, and credibility), important goals were attained and some control was achieved. We study how officials attained control over implementation through the adaptive management of combinations of different types of control strategies (regulatory, normative, and procedural). The case study, focused on the analysis of in-depth interviews with the highest officials involved in the implementation of this reform, finds evidence for three combinations of strategies next to a general pattern characterized by a trade-off between compliance and coordination. This trade-off shows that the process of building <b>enforcement</b> <b>capacity</b> may affect the goals of the reform, deviating from lawmakers' original intentions Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
