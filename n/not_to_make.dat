Murdoch chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a bid for Tottenham himself, for conflict of interest reasons, and used his newspapers to create momentum in favour of Sugar.|$|E
5|$|The {{unresolved}} larger narrative arc encourages {{speculation about}} future story events. According to Martin, {{much of the}} key to Ice and Fire future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers believe to be true {{may not necessarily be}} true.|$|E

5|$|After {{the subject}} of {{business}} was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue {{easier for him to}} manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October, and advised him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a decision until after this was over.|$|E
5|$|As Wilson {{adjusted}} his lineup of potential Cabinet appointees, he and House considered Lane for {{the positions of}} Attorney General and Secretary of War. Finally, Wilson wrote to him on February 24, 1913, offering him the Interior position, and, although the two had never met, he accepted the post. According to The New York Times, Chairman Lane was selected since {{he was one of}} the few California Democrats who had fought the railroads and who was not beholden to Hearst. At the time, it was customary <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an official announcement of Cabinet appointments until the new President formally submitted the names to the Senate on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, March 4; however, The New York Times obtained the list of Wilson's appointees a day early. The Senate met in special session on March 5, and approved all of President Wilson's Cabinet appointees.|$|E

She entered service on 14 July 1865 and cost a total of 1,148,000 rubles, almost double her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon completion. For some reason, she was the only ship of the class <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a port visit to Stockholm, Sweden in July–August 1865. She suffered some sort of hull damage in September, but the details are not known.|$|E

5|$|First and Second World War dazzle camouflage, {{pioneered by}} English artist Norman Wilkinson, was used <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> ships disappear, {{but to make}} them seem smaller and/or faster, to {{encourage}} misidentification by an enemy {{and to make the}} ships harder to hit. In the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy trialled a form of active camouflage, counter-illumination, using diffused lighting to prevent ships from appearing as dark shapes against a brighter sky during the night. It reduced visibility by up to 70%, but was unreliable and never went into production.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her the live wire in the family.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{information}} {{learned from the}} 2002 and 2006 expeditions, there was {{public support for the}} making of Davidson Seamount into a marine sanctuary. A key group of research scientists, fishermen, officials, educators, and marine biologists was formed in 2006 to discuss whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Davidson Seamount a National Marine Sanctuary under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and if so whether to make it its own sanctuary, or incorporate it into the nearby Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The group decided that the seamount was eligible for sanctuary designation, and the majority of the group recommended its incorporation into the nearby Monterey Bay sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|In {{political}} {{circles in}} The Netherlands, the announcement caused widespread irritation about his plan. Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders' words could endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a speech, {{arguing that the}} international public does not know {{who is in the}} Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders' speech could be mistaken as an official statement of the Dutch government. Also Christian Democrat party leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, {{have said that they}} noticed changes in him {{in the days and weeks}} prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E
