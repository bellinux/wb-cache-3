25|$|The best {{treatment}} {{approach is}} to improve the immune status in immunodeficient individuals using highly active antiretroviral therapy that includes an HIV protease inhibitor along with continued use of antiparasitic medication. Antiparasitic drug treatment for immunocompromised individuals usually involves the combination of <b>nitazoxanide,</b> paromomycin, and azithromycin together; these drugs are only partially active in HIV/AIDS patients compared to their effect in immunocompetent persons. A Cochrane Collaboration review recommended that <b>nitazoxanide</b> be considered for use in treatment despite its reduced effectiveness in immunocompromised individuals.|$|E
25|$|There are {{case reports}} of <b>nitazoxanide</b> being {{successfully}} used in human fasciolosis treatment in Mexico. There are also reports of bithionol being used successfully.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitazoxanide</b> {{has been}} found {{effective}} in trails, but is currently not recommended. The life cycle includes freshwater snails as an intermediate host of the parasite.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitazoxanide</b> is a {{synthetic}} nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide derivative indicated as an antiprotozoal agent (FDA-approved {{for the treatment}} of infectious diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia) and also is currently being studied in C. difficile infections vs. vancomycin.|$|E
25|$|Parasites, {{particularly}} protozoa (e.g., Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Entamoeba histolytica, Blastocystis spp., Cyclospora cayetanensis), {{are frequently}} {{the cause of}} diarrhea that involves chronic infection. The broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent <b>nitazoxanide</b> has shown efficacy against many diarrhea-causing parasites.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{improved}} sanitation, {{which includes}} improving access to toilets and proper disposal of feces. Handwashing with soap appears protective. In areas {{where more than}} 20% {{of the population is}} affected, treating everyone at regular intervals is recommended. Reoccurring infections are common. There is no vaccine. Treatments recommended by the World Health Organization are the medications albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, or pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and <b>nitazoxanide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization for ascariasis are: albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and <b>nitazoxanide.</b> Pyrantel pamoate may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{in vitro}} study from Pakistan found 40% of {{isolates}} {{are resistant to}} common antiprotozoal drugs. A study of isolates from patients diagnosed with IBS found 40% of isolates resistant to metronidazole and 32% resistant to furazolidone. Drugs reported in studies {{to be effective in}} eradicating Blastocystis infection have included metronidazole, trimethoprim, TMP-SMX (only trimethoprim is active with sulphamethoxazole demonstrating no activity), tetracycline, doxycycline, <b>nitazoxanide,</b> pentamidine, paromomycin and iodoquinol. Iodoquinol {{has been found to be}} less effective in practice than in-vitro. Miconazole and quinacrine have been reported as effective agents against Blastocystis growth in-vitro. Rifaximin, and albendazole have shown promise as has ivermectin which demonstrated high effectiveness against blastocystis hominis isolates in an in vitro study. There is also evidence that the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, and the plant mallotus oppositifolius may be effective against Blastocystis infections.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>nitazoxanide</b> is {{the only}} {{antiparasitic}} drug treatment with proven efficacy for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent individuals; however, it lacks efficacy in severely immunocompromised patients. Certain agents such as paromomycin and azithromycin are sometimes used as well, but they only have partial efficacy.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{research}} {{is being done}} in molecular-based immunotherapy. [...] For example, synthetic isoflavone derivates {{have been shown to}} fight off Cryptosporidium parvum both in vitro and in animal studies. [...] Derivates of <b>nitazoxanide,</b> known as thiazolides, have also shown promising results in vitro.|$|E
2500|$|Bacterial {{overgrowth}} {{is usually}} {{treated with a}} course of antibiotics although whether antibiotics should be a first line treatment {{is a matter of}} debate. Some experts recommend probiotics as first line therapy with antibiotics being reserved as a second line treatment for more severe cases of SIBO. Prokinetic drugs are other options but research in humans is limited. A variety of antibiotics, including tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, [...] metronidazole, neomycin, cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and <b>nitazoxanide</b> have been used; however, the best evidence is for the use of rifaximin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitazoxanide</b> is {{contraindicated}} only {{in individuals}} who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to <b>nitazoxanide</b> or the inactive ingredients of a <b>nitazoxanide</b> formulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitazoxanide</b> {{alone has}} shown {{preliminary}} evidence of efficacy {{in the treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B over a one-year course of therapy. <b>Nitazoxanide</b> 500 mg twice daily resulted in a decrease in serum HBV DNA in all of 4 HBeAg-positive patients, with undetectable HBV DNA in 2 of 4 patients, loss of HBeAg in 3 patients, and loss of HBsAg in one patient. Seven of 8 HBeAg-negative patients treated with <b>nitazoxanide</b> 500 mg twice daily had undetectable HBV DNA and 2 had loss of HBsAg. Additionally, <b>nitazoxanide</b> monotherapy in one case and <b>nitazoxanide</b> plus adefovir in another case resulted in undetectable HBV DNA, loss of HBeAg and loss of HBsAg. These preliminary studies showed a higher rate of HBsAg loss than any currently licensed therapy for chronic hepatitis B. The similar mechanism of action of interferon and <b>nitazoxanide</b> suggest that stand-alone <b>nitazoxanide</b> therapy or <b>nitazoxanide</b> in concert with nucleos(t)ide analogs have the potential to increase loss of HBsAg, which is the ultimate end-point of therapy. A formal phase â…¡ study is being planned for 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Following oral administration, <b>nitazoxanide</b> {{is rapidly}} hydrolyzed to the {{pharmacologically}} active metabolite, tizoxanide, which is 99% protein bound. Tizoxanide is then glucuronide conjugated into the active metabolite, tizoxanide glucuronide. [...] Peak plasma concentrations of the metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed 1-4 hours after oral administration of <b>nitazoxanide,</b> whereas <b>nitazoxanide</b> {{itself is not}} detected in blood plasma.|$|E
50|$|Resistance {{has been}} seen {{clinically}} to both nitroimidazoles and albendazole, but not <b>nitazoxanide,</b> though <b>nitazoxanide</b> resistance has been induced in research laboratories so is theoretically possible. The exact mechanism of resistance {{to all of these}} medications is not well understood. In the case of nitroimidazole-resistant strains of Giardia, other drugs are available which have showed efficacy in treatment including quinacrine, <b>nitazoxanide,</b> bacitracin zinc, furazolidone and paromomycin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitazoxanide</b> is the {{prototype}} {{member of the}} thiazolides, which is a drug class of structurally-related broad-spectrum antiparasitic compounds. <b>Nitazoxanide</b> is a light yellow crystalline powder. It is poorly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in water.|$|E
50|$|Chemically, <b>nitazoxanide</b> is the {{prototype}} {{member of the}} thiazolides, a class of drugs which are synthetic nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide derivatives with antiparasitic and antiviral activity. Tizoxanide, an active metabolite of <b>nitazoxanide</b> in humans, is also an antiparasitic drug of the thiazolide class.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, Romark {{launched}} {{a series of}} controlled trials. A placebo-controlled study of <b>nitazoxanide</b> in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, <b>nitazoxanide</b> was not successful {{in the treatment of}} cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, <b>nitazoxanide</b> was superior to placebo and comparable to metronidazole. <b>Nitazoxanide</b> was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of cyclosporiasis, isosporiasis, and amebiasis.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{dosage form}} of <b>nitazoxanide</b> {{for use in}} chronic hepatitic C was {{developed}} for future clinical trials. [...] The extended release tablet provides a larger dose of <b>nitazoxanide</b> (675 mg) than the current tablets (500 mg) and {{is intended to be}} used twice daily for 7 days.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{exceptionally}} high {{plasma protein}} binding (>99.9%) of nitazoxanide's metabolite, tizoxanide, the concurrent use of <b>nitazoxanide</b> with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices (e.g., warfarin) {{increases the risk}} of drug toxicity. [...] In vitro evidence suggests that <b>nitazoxanide</b> does not affect the CYP450 system.|$|E

50|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>nitazoxanide</b> do not {{significantly}} differ from a placebo treatment for giardiasis; these symptoms include stomach pain, headache, upset stomach, vomiting, discolored urine, excessive urinating, skin rash, itching, fever, flu syndrome, and others. <b>Nitazoxanide</b> {{does not appear to}} cause any significant adverse effects when taken by healthy adults.|$|E
50|$|Romark {{initially}} {{decided to}} focus on the possibility of treating chronic hepatitis C with <b>nitazoxanide.</b> The drug garnered interest from the hepatology community after three phase II clinical trials involving the treatment of hepatitis C with <b>nitazoxanide</b> produced positive results for treatment efficacy and similar tolerability to placebo without any signs of toxicity. Subsequent clinical trials are ongoing.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{symptoms}} in most immunocompetent persons will resolve without treatment, <b>nitazoxanide</b> {{has been approved}} for treatment of diarrhea resulting from cryptosporidiosis. The effectiveness of <b>nitazoxanide</b> in immunocompromised patients, however, is uncertain and current treatments revolve around boosting the host immune system to aid in symptom resolution. [...] Current avenues for treatment include scanning the Cryptosporidium hominis genome for possible targets for vaccine development.|$|E

50|$|The World Health Organization and Infectious Disease Society of America {{recommend}} metronidazole {{as first}} line therapy. The US CDC lists metronidazole, tinidazole, and <b>nitazoxanide</b> as effective first-line therapies; of these three, only <b>nitazoxanide</b> and tinidazole are approved {{for the treatment}} of giardiasis by the US FDA. A meta-analysis done by the Cochrane Collaboration found that compared to the standard of metronidazole, albendazole had equivalent efficacy while having fewer side effects, such as gastrointestinal or neurologic issues. Other meta-analyses have reached similar conclusions. Both medications need a five to 10 day long course; albendazole is taken once a day, while metronidazole needs to be taken three times a day. The evidence for comparing metronidazole to other alternatives such as mebendazole, tinidazole or <b>nitazoxanide</b> was felt to be of very low quality. While tinidazole has side effects and efficacy similar to those of metronidazole, it is administered with a single dose.|$|E
