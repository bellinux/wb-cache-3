50|$|Bonus {{usually is}} a {{discount}} in the premium which is given on {{the renewal of}} the policy if no claim {{is made in the}} previous year. Malus is an increase in the premium if there is a claim in the previous year. Bonus-malus systems are very common in vehicle insurance. This system is also called a <b>no-claim</b> <b>discount</b> (NCD) or no-claims bonus in Britain and Australia.|$|E
40|$|Linear {{models have}} been {{successfully}} used to describe and predict judgement and behavior {{in a variety of}} settings. In this study a linear regression model was used to model claim costs for an automobile insurance account portfolio of a major British insurance company. The categorical independent variables of policyholder age, area of residence, group (vehicle type), and <b>no-claim</b> <b>discount</b> (NCD) status were all found to be statistically significant influences on claim costs. It is argued that ex-post analyses of this nature are important to the managerial process of forecasting future claims and pricing insurance, as well as claims reserving decisions based on those forecasts...|$|E
40|$|Allowing {{consumers}} greater {{choice of}} health plans {{is believed to}} be the key to high quality and low costs in social health insurance. This study investigates consumer preferences (361 persons, response rate 43 %) for hypothetical health plans with differed in 12 characteristics (premium, deductibles, <b>no-claim</b> <b>discount,</b> extension of insurance and financial services, red tape involved, medical help-desk, choice of family physicians and hospitals, dental benefits, physical therapy benefits, benefits for prescription drugs and homeopathy). In 90 % the health plan with the most attractive characteristics was preferred, indicating a predominantly rational kind of choice. The most decisive characteristics for preference were: complete dental benefits, followed by zero deductibles, and free choice of hospitals. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Modelling sets up Markov {{models that}} can be used as {{underlying}} framework for the incorporation of, say, <b>no‐claims</b> <b>discounts</b> into premium considerations. This project picks up these threads and considers how past claims experience can be used to set and update premium levels as time evolves. The focus in on an individual policy in a portfolio. While the policies in the portfolio may offer the same benefits in principle, the policy holders will display a variety of claims patterns. We can model this by a family of claims distributions Fθ depending on a parameter θ. The idea is that each policy holder generates claims X 1, [...] .,Xn according to Fθ for some θ, which is unknown and can be estimated from X 1, [...] .,Xn. Part II of Mikosch’s book describes a Bayesian approach due to Bühlmann which considers θ, varying across the population, to be randomly sampled from the population (independently for each policy holder). Using a prior distribution for θ that reflects the whole population, which is a fair choice {{in the absence of any}} further information, claims X 1, [...] .,Xn allow to update our belief of the parameter θ and calculate a posterior distribution. There is some general theory, there are some parametric models, and further developments exist under various simplifying assumptions. The proposal is to work these out in this dissertation, beginnin...|$|R
40|$|Telematics {{technology}} - {{the integrated}} use of telecommunication and informatics - may fundamentally change the car insurance industry by allowing insurers to base their {{prices on the}} real driving behavior instead of on traditional policyholder characteristics and historical claims information. Telematics insurance or usage-based insurance (UBI) can drive down the cost for low-mileage clients and good drivers. Car insurance is traditionally priced based on self-reported information from the policyholder, most importantly: age, license age, postal code, engine power, use of the vehicle, and claims history. Over time, insurers try to refine this a priori risk classification and restore fairness using <b>no-claim</b> <b>discounts</b> and claim penalties {{in the form of}} the bonus-malus system. It is expected that these traditional methods of risk assessment will become obsolete. Your car usage and your driver abilities can be better assessed based on telematics data collected, such as: the distance driven, the time of day, how long you have been driving, the location, the speed, harsh or smooth breaking, aggressive acceleration or deceleration, your cornering and parking skills [...] . This high dimensional data, collected on the fly, will force pricing actuaries to change their current practice. New statistical models will have to be developed to adequately set premiums based on individual policyholder’s motoring habits instead of the risk associated to their peer group. In this work, we take a first step in this direction. We analyze a telematics data set from a European insurer, collected in between 2010 and 2014, in which information is collected on the amount of meters insureds drive. Besides the number of meters driven, we also registered how this distance is divided over the different kind of road types and time slots. This data allows car insurers the use of real driving exposure to price the contract. We build claims frequency models combining traditional and telematics information and discover the relevance and impact of adding the new telematics insights. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The <b>No-Claim</b> <b>Discount</b> (NCD) is {{a system}} that adjusts the premium paid by policyholders {{according}} to their individual insurance claim history. The current NCD system in Malaysia is not protecting good drivers more than bad drivers. Good drivers, who are in the maximum discount group are being penalised unfairly more than those in the 0 -percent discount level. Therefore, this paper introduces an alternative step-back NCD system with additional classes and a malus zone, which is rather “tough” to policyholders. The idea is that the bonuses awarded to good drivers should be compensated for by maluses from bad drivers. The main actuarial tools for evaluating and comparing different NCD systems are then used in this study in terms of the fairness of penalty charges to policyholders, the total difference of premium income collected by insurance companies and the efficiency of the system...|$|E
