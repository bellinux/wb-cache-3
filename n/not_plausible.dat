5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is <b>not</b> <b>plausible.</b> Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is <b>not</b> <b>plausible</b> that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E

25|$|Historian Richard Overy in 2014 {{published}} {{a study of}} the air war The Bombers and the Bombed: Allied Air War Over Europe 1940-1945 in which he disputed the official German figures of air war dead. He estimated total air raid deaths at 353,000. Overy maintains that the German estimates are based on incorrect speculations for losses during the last three months of the war when there was a gap in the record keeping system. He points out that the figures for air raid dead {{in the last three months}} of the war were estimated in the West German figures from 1956 at 300,000 people which he believes is <b>not</b> <b>plausible.</b> The official figures include an inflated total of 60,000 in the Bombing of Dresden and the inclusion of refugees fleeing westward.|$|E

2500|$|Hunyadi's year {{of birth}} is uncertain. Although Gáspár Heltai writes that Hunyadi was born in 1390, he must have {{actually}} been born between around 1405 and 1407, because his younger brother was only born after 1409, and a difference of almost two decades between the two brothers' age is <b>not</b> <b>plausible.</b> The place of his birth is likewise unknown. The 16th-century scholar, Antun Vrančić wrote that John Hunyadi had been [...] "a native" [...] of the Hátszeg region (now Țara Hațegului in Romania). Hunyadi's father died before 12 February 1419. A royal charter issued on this day mentions Hunyadi, Hunyadi's two brothers (John the younger and Voyk) and their uncle Radol, but does not refer to their father.|$|E
2500|$|Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya {{argues that}} the 16th line doesn't mention Maurya kala (Maurya era); instead it reads Mukhya kala ("the main era"). He relies on the {{description}} of Kharavela's 5th regnal year in the Hathigumpha inscription. According to him, this record implies that Kharavela flourished [...] ti-vasa-sata years after the Nandaraja. Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri identifies Nandaraja with Mahapadma Nanda {{or one of his}} sons. The expression ti-vasa-sata can mean either 103 or 300 years. According to Chattopadhyaya, 103 is <b>not</b> <b>plausible,</b> because that would make Kharavela's inscriptions contradictory to the Ashoka's records. Based on this, he places Kharavela in second half of the 1st century BCE, or first half of the 1st century CE.|$|E
2500|$|The Court's [...] "commitment to Apprendi in {{this context}} {{reflects}} not just respect for longstanding precedent, but the need to give intelligible content {{to the right of}} jury trial. [...] That right is no procedural formality, but a fundamental reservation of power in our constitutional structure." [...] Just as citizens participate in the legislative process by electing representatives to the legislature, they participate in the judicial process by serving on juries. [...] The Apprendi rule ensures that [...] "the judge's authority to sentence derives wholly from the jury's verdict. [...] Without that restriction, the jury would not exercise the control that the Framers intended." [...] Justice Scalia, as the author of the majority opinion, reasoned that those who reject [...] Apprendi [...] "are resigned to one of two alternatives." [...] First, a jury might be allowed only to pass on a small part of criminal activity, and then allow the judge to determine the punishment for the full range of conduct the government seeks to punish, as by letting the jury determine whether an accused murderer illegally possessed a firearm and then allowing the judge to impose a life sentence because the defendant had used the firearm to kill someone. [...] Second, the legislature could establish judicial limits that were not too excessive, a necessarily subjective standard that would be hard for the Court to monitor and adjust as necessary. [...] But this claim was <b>not</b> <b>plausible,</b> since the entire purpose of the jury-trial requirement was to check judicial authority.|$|E

2500|$|On May 6, 2015, the NFL {{published}} a 243-page report regarding the deflation of footballs {{used in the}} previous season's AFC Championship Game. The report concluded that, more likely than not, Brady was at least generally aware of the intentional deflation. On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on [...] "substantial and credible evidence" [...] that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he failed {{to cooperate with the}} investigators. On May 11, Troy Vincent—NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations—penned a letter to Brady that stated in part: [...] "Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football." [...] Vincent's letter further stated: [...] "With respect to your particular involvement, the report established that there is substantial and credible evidence to conclude you were at least generally aware of the actions of the Patriots' employees involved in the deflation of the footballs and that it was unlikely that their actions were done without your knowledge. Moreover, the report documents your failure to cooperate fully and candidly with the investigation, including by refusing to produce any relevant electronic evidence (emails, texts, etc.), despite being offered extraordinary safeguards by the investigators to protect unrelated personal information, and by providing testimony that the report concludes was <b>not</b> <b>plausible</b> and contradicted by other evidence." [...] Brady, through the NFL Players Association, officially appealed the suspension on May 14.|$|E

For one thing, the fellow was Jimmy's friend, but when Jimmy started for the rocks Deering, not the other, went after him. Then Stannard's {{narrative}} was puzzling. Jimmy had run away and his going indicated that he was accountable for the warden's getting shot. If Jimmy imagined he had shot at a deer, {{he ought to have}} stayed. Moreover, Bob had run away, and if he had hit the warden, it was obvious that Jimmy had not.
