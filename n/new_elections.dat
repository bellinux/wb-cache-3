5|$|In August 1909, a {{group of}} army {{officers}} that had formed a military league, Stratiotikos Syndesmos, demanded, among other things, that the royal family be stripped of their military commissions. To save the King the embarrassment of removing his sons from their commissions, they resigned them. The military league attempted a coup d'état, and the King insisted on supporting the duly elected Hellenic Parliament in response. Eventually, the military league joined forces with Venizelos in calling for a National Assembly to revise the constitution. King George gave way, and <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> to the revising assembly were held in August 1910. After some political maneuvering, Venizelos became prime minister of a minority government. Just a month later, Venizelos called <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> for , at which he won an overwhelming majority after most of the opposition parties declined to take part.|$|E

5|$|<b>New</b> <b>elections</b> for {{regional}} governments were held on November 19, 2006; most regions went to local political movements {{rather than to}} national parties. The APRA, which had won the presidential elections held on June 4, 2006, only managed to win in two regions, all other national parties achieved even less.|$|E

5|$|The 1930s {{also saw}} the growth of several authoritarian and fascist {{political}} parties in both Wallonia and Flanders. In the 1936 elections, one of these, the French-speaking Rexist party, gained 11.6 {{percent of the national}} vote. By 1939 however, extremist parties lost many of the seats that they had previously gained in <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> and political stability seemed to be returning.|$|E
5|$|In October 1975, the Opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, {{determined}} to withhold supply by deferring consideration of appropriation bills. With Field on leave (his Senate appointment having been challenged), the Coalition had an effective majority of 30–29 in the Senate. The Coalition {{believed that if}} Whitlam could not deliver supply, and would not advise <b>new</b> <b>elections,</b> Kerr would have to dismiss him. Supply would run out on 30November.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the current}} {{constitution}} of Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister {{is the leader}} of the Cabinet business and also functions as a deputy to the President. In the event a president dies in office, the Prime Minister becomes the acting president until the Parliament convens to elect a successor or <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> can be held to elect a new president. This was the case in 1993, when President Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated and Prime Minister Dingiri Banda Wijetunge took office as President.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} from Maranhão, Caxias saw that the {{political}} climate had changed. Francisco de Lima's Liberal Party had pushed through the premature declaration of the Emperor's majority on 23 July 1840. In May 1842, the Liberals rebelled in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais {{in retaliation for the}} Emperor's decision—on the advice of a Council of State dominated by Reactionaries—to call for <b>new</b> <b>elections,</b> annulling the previous election tainted by widespread fraud by the Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned that}} Obote was {{planning}} to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a military coup on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off Entebbe International Airport and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on Radio Uganda accused Obote's government of corruption and preferential treatment of the Lango region. Cheering crowds were reported {{in the streets of}} Kampala after the radio broadcast. Amin announced that he was a soldier, not a politician, and that the military government would remain only as a caretaker regime until <b>new</b> <b>elections,</b> which would be announced when the situation was normalised. He promised to release all political prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Kagame's {{first term}} expired and <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> {{were held in}} 2010. Having served one term as elected president, Kagame was {{entitled}} to serve for one further term. The election campaign began publicly in January 2010 when Victoire Ingabire, a Hutu who had been living abroad for some years, returned to Rwanda and announced her candidacy for the presidency. This failed as she was arrested and accused of threatening state security. Ingabire caused some controversy in the country following her arrival, with comments relating to the genocide. The government accused her of breaking the country's strict laws regarding genocide denial, and she was arrested in April 2010. She was released on bail, but was prohibited from running in the election. In October 2012 she was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment by the High Court of Kigali, which is heavily criticized by Amnesty International.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April, an agreement, which {{intentionally}} excluded PAIGC, {{was reached}} with 22 of the 35 opposition parties {{to set up}} a National Transitional Council. According to Vaz, the size, composition and mandate period would be determined the following day and then discussed with the Military Command. He also said that existing institutions would be dissolved and that two committees would run the country, one would manage foreign affairs and the other would handle social affairs. The former committee was due to meet the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) the following day. The transitional civilian government will rule up to two years before <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> will be held. National Assembly speaker Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, who had previously rejected the office of interim president in April 2012, was again selected as interim president on 11 May 2012. Sory Djaló was the speaker of the NTC.|$|E
5|$|On 16 July 1868, a Progressive cabinet led by Zacarias {{resigned}} {{following a}} political crisis and PedroII asked the Conservatives {{to form a}} new government. As always when a party returned to power, <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> were held, though marked by fraud. The two main wings of the Progressive Party (Progressive, to which Porto Alegre belonged, and Historical) set aside their disputes, became more disciplined in their unity and renamed their party the Liberal Party. When Porto Alegre's term as general deputy ended in 1866, the ongoing war precluded elections in Rio Grande do Sul. Predictably, in the elections organized under the Conservative Party's direction in early 1869, he was not elected. He turned his attention to organizing a Liberal stronghold in his native province. At the request of the national Liberal Center, Porto Alegre created and became president of the province's Liberal board of directors.|$|E
5|$|With the Conservatives {{leading in}} the polls, Diefenbaker wanted a <b>new</b> <b>election,</b> hopeful that his party would gain a {{majority}} of seats. It was then Canadian constitutional practice that the Governor General could refuse a dissolution early in a parliament's term, unless the government had been defeated in the House, or was winning divisions by {{only a handful of}} votes. Diefenbaker sought a pretext for a <b>new</b> <b>election.</b>|$|R
25|$|While in Congress, Traficant was a {{supporter}} of immigration reduction, and a strong opponent of illegal immigration. In the controversy surrounding the defeat of Congressman Bob Dornan (R-CA) by Democrat Loretta Sanchez, Traficant was the only Democratic member of Congress who advocated a <b>new</b> <b>election,</b> due to Dornan's allegations of voting in that race by undocumented immigrants (the allegations went unproven, and a <b>new</b> <b>election</b> was not held).|$|R
25|$|The electors had {{originally}} chosen {{the members of}} the Estates-General to serve for a single year. However, by the terms of the Tennis Court Oath, the communes had bound themselves to meet continuously until France had a constitution. Right-wing elements now argued for a <b>new</b> <b>election,</b> but Mirabeau prevailed, asserting that the status of the assembly had fundamentally changed, and that no <b>new</b> <b>election</b> should take place before completing the constitution.|$|R
5|$|On 19 February 1860, {{he founded}} {{and became the}} first and only {{president}} of the Historic and Geographic Institute of the Province of São Pedro (as Rio Grande do Sul was also known). The institute was short-lived, lasting from 1860 until 1864. In 1862, Porto Alegre was among the Liberals who, along with dissident Conservatives, founded the Liga Progressista (Progressive League), which replaced the Liberal Party. He became Minister of War on 24 May {{as a member of the}} first Progressive cabinet, headed by Zacarias de Góis e Vasconcelos. However, the cabinet fell after a vote of no confidence six days later. When the Chamber of Deputies was dissolved in 1863 and <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> were called, he was elected and served until 1866.|$|E
5|$|Outmaneuvering the {{opposition}} of Vogoride and his group of conservative followers during <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> for the Divan, Kogălniceanu was able to promote Cuza in Moldavia on January 17, 1859, leading to Cuza's election for a similar position in Wallachia (February 5)—the de facto union {{of the two countries}} as the United Principalities. In October 1858, he made a clear proposal regarding the unification, which, as he noted, carried the vote with only two opposing voices (Alecu Balș and Nectarie Hermeziu, the Orthodox vicar of Roman Bishopric), being publicly acclaimed by Ion Roată, the peasant representative for Putna County. During 1859, Kogălniceanu again stood in the ad hoc Divan and rallied support for Cuza from all factions of the unionist camp, while promoting his candidature in Bucharest—thus profiting from ambiguities in the Paris Treaty. On the day Cuza took the throne, to begin his rule as Domnitor, Mihail Kogălniceanu welcomed him with an emotional speech.|$|E
5|$|The British people {{returned}} Clement Attlee and his Labour Party {{later in}} July. Attlee and his Secretary of State for India, Lord Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, immediately ordered {{a review of}} the Indian situation. Jinnah had no comment on the change of government, but called a meeting of his Working Committee and issued a statement calling for <b>new</b> <b>elections</b> in India. The League held influence at the provincial level in the Muslim-majority states mostly by alliance, and Jinnah believed that, given the opportunity, the League would improve its electoral standing and lend added support to his claim to be the sole spokesman for the Muslims. Wavell returned to India in September after consultation with his new masters in London; elections, both for the centre and for the provinces, were announced soon after. The British indicated that formation of a constitution-making body would follow the votes.|$|E
