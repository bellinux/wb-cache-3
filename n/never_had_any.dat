5|$|Unlike the United States Army, {{which had}} an all Puerto Rican unit (the 65th Infantry Regiment) and other {{units in the}} Southwest region of the United States mostly made up of Hispanics, the Marines have <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> Hispanic-oriented units.|$|E
5|$|First thing, I {{saw these}} guys as scientifically {{accomplished}} but ethically, morons. They <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> reasons before to have ethical questions. So when they're hit with this device they're blindsided by it. The {{first thing they}} do is make money with it. They're {{not talking about the}} ethics of altering your former self.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Chantal Hébert {{pointed out}} Couillard <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{criminal}} record {{and was not}} charged with criminal activity, and that investigative journalists could not find links between Couillard and the bikers since 1999. Political commentators called the affair a {{threat to national security}} due to Bernier's carelessness and to Couillard's background with motorcycle biker gangs.|$|E

5|$|Large's first {{operation}} with the SAS was in Malaya, hunting the Malayan Races Liberation Army (MRLA) guerrillas {{engaged in the}} Malayan Emergency uprising. By the time of Large's involvement there was little communist activity and, despite months of jungle patrols and encounters with leeches, scorpions, civet cats and tigers, he <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> contact with MRLA guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|McMillin played {{professional}} football {{in the early}} days of the NFL, with the Milwaukee Badgers and the Cleveland Indians. McMillin could only play on certain weeks when the team he was coaching traveled North. The Badgers had to mail him the plays and signals the week before, pay him in advance, and he <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> practice with the team.|$|E
5|$|Paul Schlesselman is of German {{descent and}} {{was a high school}} dropout raised by a single father in Helena–West Helena, Arkansas. He hated his small Delta region {{hometown}} because of its predominantly black population. He had <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> problems with the law prior to the alleged Obama plot. He had a strong affinity for drinking and smoking.|$|E

5|$|Together {{they raised}} her {{children}} from her previous marriage, John Parke Custis and Martha Parke (Patsy) Custis. Later, they raised Martha's grandchildren Eleanor Parke Custis and George Washington Parke Custis. George and Martha <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> children together; his earlier bout with smallpox in 1751 {{may have made}} him sterile. The newlywed couple moved to Mount Vernon, near Alexandria, where he took up {{the life of a}} planter and political figure.|$|E
5|$|During 1947 Katsura {{caught the}} eye of American {{serviceman}} Vernon Greenleaf (no relation to the pool and carom billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf), a master sergeant in the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps {{who had been in the}} armed services for 22 years. Katsura and Greenleaf first met in a Tokyo service club where she was giving billiard exhibitions. Greenleaf began taking lessons from Katsura and was quickly smitten with her. They were married on November 30, 1950, but <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> children.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, the USN {{purchased}} the UK's fleet of 72 retired BAe Harrier IIs (63 single-seat GR.7/9/9As plus 9 twin-seat T.12/12As) and replacement engines to provide spares for the existing USMC Harrier II fleet. Although the March 2012 {{issue of the}} magazine AirForces Monthly stated that the USMC intended to fly some of the ex-British Harrier IIs, instead of using them just for spare parts, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has since stated that the USMC has <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> plans to operate those Harriers.|$|E

5|$|Aymer married twice; {{his first}} marriage, before 1295, was to Beatrice, {{daughter}} of Raoul de Clermont, Lord of Nesle in Picardy and Constable of France. Beatrice died in 1320, and in 1321 he married Marie de St Pol, daughter of Gui de Châtillon, Count of St Pol and Butler of France. He <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> legitimate children, {{but he had}} an illegitimate son, Henry de Valence, whose mother is unknown. Pembroke's most lasting legacy is probably through his second wife, who in 1347 founded Pembroke College, Cambridge. The family arms are still represented on the dexter side of the college arms. Aymer de Valence was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his tomb can still {{be seen as a}} splendid example of late gothic architecture, elaborating on the design of the nearby tomb of Edmund Crouchback.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{started on}} 7 July 1910, {{with the first}} ore train being run on 13 July. The first shipload left Kirkenes on 11 October, but SS Bengal sank with the first shipment. In 1911, the system {{exported}} 330,000 tonnes of ore. The railway was also used for transporting workers, with trains running from the towns to the plants {{in the morning and}} returning after the working day was over. Prior to private cars becoming common, the railway operated a passenger carriage on the trains between Kirkenes and Bjørnevatn—allowing free travel. The railway has <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> scheduled or public transport of passengers, but the company's concession specifies that the authorities could at a later date require the company to operate public passenger services under specified conditions.|$|E
5|$|The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was {{the fifth}} Century (called the proletarii) of the unarmed adjunct class. This Century was the only Century {{composed}} of soldiers who had no property, and since {{it was always the}} last Century to vote, it <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> real influence on elections. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul Gaius Marius reformed the organization of the army, and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth unarmed Century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army. This mass disenfranchisement of most of the soldiers in the army {{played an important role in}} the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.|$|E
6000|$|On the whole, {{the stage}} villain appears {{to us to}} be a rather badly used individual. He <b>never</b> <b>has</b> <b>any</b> [...] "estates" [...] or {{property}} himself, and his only chance of getting {{on in the world}} is to sneak the hero's. He has an affectionate disposition, and <b>never</b> <b>having</b> <b>any</b> wife of his own he is compelled to love other people's; but his affection is ever unrequited, and everything comes wrong for him in the end.|$|R

5|$|When the National Assembly reconvened in Hanoi on October 28, only 30 of the 50 VNQDD {{seats were}} filled. Of the 37 VNQDD and Dong Minh Hoi members who turned up, only 20 {{remained}} {{by the end}} of the session. By the end of the year, Tam had resigned as foreign minister and fled to China, and only one of the three original VNQDD cabinet members was still in office. In any case, the VNQDD <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> power, despite their numerical presence. Upon the opening of the National Assembly, the communist majority voted to vest power in an executive committee almost entirely consisting of communists; the legislature met only once a year. In any case, the façade of a legislature was dispensed with as the First Indochina War went into full flight. A small group of VNQDD fighters escaped Giáp's assault and retreated to a mountainous enclave along the Sino-Vietnamese border, where they declared themselves to be the government of Vietnam, with little effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1837, Sherman {{left school}} {{and found a}} job as a junior {{surveyor}} on construction of improvements to the Muskingum River. Because he had obtained the job through Whig Party patronage, the election of a Democratic governor in 1838 meant that Sherman {{and the rest of his}} surveying crew were discharged from their jobs in June 1839. The following year, he moved to Mansfield to study law in the office of his older brother, Charles Taylor Sherman. He was admitted to the bar in 1844 and joined his brother's firm. Sherman quickly became successful at the practice of law, and by 1847 had accumulated property worth $10,000 and was a partner in several local businesses. By that time, Sherman and his brother Charles were able to support their mother and two unmarried sisters, who now moved to a house Sherman purchased in Mansfield. In 1848, Sherman married Margaret Cecelia Stewart, the daughter of a local judge. The couple <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> biological children, but adopted a daughter, Mary, in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion has been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> complaints.|$|E
