5|$|In {{the early}} to mid-1990s, the two teams were seldom equally good. The Yankees had the worst record in the American League when the Red Sox won their third {{division}} title in five years in 1990.

5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the chalk}} cliff near the lower {{terminus}} collapsed in 1957, forcing the railway's closure while a strengthening concrete wall was built. The new wall reduced the lower terminus {{to a single}} length of track. The second track at Hereson Road was closed at the same time, and removed to build a short siding <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel for stabling the trains. The wooden station platforms were replaced by modern concrete structures.|$|E

5|$|The first Winter Olympics {{took place}} in 1924. Australia first competed at the Winter Olympics in 1936, when its sole representative, Kenneth Kennedy, participated in speed skating. Kennedy came 33rd in both the 1500m and 5000m, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the standings. He was entirely on his own; no Australian support staff were in attendance, even though the AOF officially sanctioned Kennedy's entry.|$|E
5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the geyser {{rise to a}} point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise {{to the top of the}} column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E
50|$|As lead mining {{declined}} in Mineral Point, zinc mining and smelting became important new industries. Zinc ore was discovered {{with increasing frequency}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> <b>of</b> old lead mines. The Mineral Point Zinc Company was founded in 1882, and by 1891 it was operating the largest zinc oxide works in the United States at Mineral Point. Zinc mining and processing continued {{on a large scale}} until the 1920s.|$|R

A run of poor form left Hull <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the table going into {{the final game of}} the 2014–15 season and needing to defeat Bruce's former club Manchester United to stand any chance of avoiding relegation. They could only manage a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championship. The poor performances of a number of players signed by Bruce, including club record signing Abel Hernández, were identified as key factors in the club's failure to remain in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} the original ZX Spectrum Underwurlde release. They noted its expansive game world and appreciated the parts where Sabreman travelled by bubble. Later critics {{commented on the}} game's frustrating difficulty. While the Commodore 64 version {{was similar to the}} original, reviews were mixed—one critic thought the title had aged poorly in the year between releases. Your Sinclair placed Underwurlde within its top 20 for the ZX Spectrum, though their readers put it <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> their top 100. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Rich in {{cultural}} heritage, Virginia however ranks <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> U.S. states {{in terms of}} public spending on the arts, at nearly half of the national average. The state government does fund some institutions, including the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Science Museum of Virginia. Other museums include the popular Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum and the Chrysler Museum of Art. Besides these sites, many open-air museums are located in the Commonwealth, such as Colonial Williamsburg, the Frontier Culture Museum, and various historic battlefields. The Virginia Foundation for the Humanities works to improve the Commonwealth's civic, cultural, and intellectual life.|$|E

5|$|As several squads {{left the}} hill on a patrol, North Koreans {{attacked}} the main company position behind it. The platoon dropped {{down off the}} ridge into a gully on the left. Some {{of the men in}} the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured most <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines. About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated North Korean battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The company to turned back this attack. That night, North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Bouchard's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the {{championship}} for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low, often less than 3,000 a game, and {{there was talk of}} folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the league for several years, apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey life. In his first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Cinderella teams TnC Gaming and Digital Chaos, {{who were}} both {{projected}} to finish <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the final standings, exceeded expectations, {{with the latter}} eventually reaching the Grand Finals, finishing as the tournament's runner-up. Game one of the upper bracket series between Evil Geniuses and EHOME was thought by Patrick Hancock of Destructoid to be more exciting than any traditional sporting match he had ever seen, with him comparing moments during the game to famous American football plays such as the Helmet Catch. Seattle KCPQ reporter Kaci Aitchison, who co-hosted the event, thought that due to the International's large prize pools and production values, eSports had become a true spectator sport which deserved {{the same level of}} respect of traditional sports.|$|E

She is then attacked by Emily; the two fight, and Emily removes her wig and prosthetic teeth, revealing herself to be Warren.|$|R

The only significantly anomalous patterns revealed {{were those of}} low salinity and high suspended sediment, atop a turbidity-current apron opposite the mouths of two submarine canyons. This water was probably emplaced by turbidity currents, and its presence here indicates that areal variations of bottom-water properties elsewhere warrant detailed studies...|$|R
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the screen {{may result in a}} jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5|$|That night Jones and {{the eight}} men with him {{stayed in the}} ravine just under the crest. Without his radio he could not {{communicate}} {{with the rest of}} the company which he thought had been destroyed or driven off the hill. The next day when American fighter planes strafed the hilltop it confirmed his belief that no D Company men were there. Some of the men in the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured Jones and the eight men with him <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines. This account of the 3rd Platoon explains why, except for the 3d Squad which rejoined D Company that evening, it was out of the action and off the crest almost as soon as it arrived on top, unknown to Kennedy and the rest of the company at the time.|$|E
5|$|Verity {{moved to}} play for Horsforth Hall Park in 1924, where his batting became more {{productive}} than his bowling. By 1926, when he scored a total of 488runs and took 62wickets to win the Yorkshire Council League prize for best junior bowler, his all-round potential secured a second trial at Yorkshire. Receiving coaching from Hirst, Verity played several matches for the Yorkshire Colts. He was given little bowling to do, suggesting that he was chosen more for his batting at this stage, and was <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the team's bowling averages. Yorkshire did not allocate him to a local club, their practice towards promising cricketers at the time. Hirst was nevertheless impressed by Verity and recommended him to Accrington Cricket Club, a team in the Lancashire League looking for a professional cricketer. After a trial, Verity signed a contract in September 1926.|$|E
50|$|On ice, Braehead {{finished}} 6th in the league, finishing just 1 point behind 4th and 5th place.

They had some stand out results, winning 4-1 in Belfast and 7-4 in Hull (with players out injured and back up netminder Mike Will in goal).
