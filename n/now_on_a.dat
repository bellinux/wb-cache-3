Back with the Wings, he centered a line with Brady Leisenring and Andrew Fournier and had a 12-game point-scoring streak early in the season. In early January, Daavettila was loaned to the Griffins, where he played in one game before being returned. He was named ECHL Player of the Week for the week ending on February13 after scoring five goals and two assists in four games, including his first professional hat trick on February12 against the Greenville Road Warriors. He was on a seven-game point streak {{at the end of the}} month and was named ECHL Plus Performer of the Month for having the best plus-minus in February and ECHL Player of the Month for scoring 8goals and 14assists in his team's 14games. <b>Now</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> line with Fournier and Darryl Lloyd, Daavettila extended his point streak to eleven games and helped Kalamazoo gain a place in the playoffs in March.

Daavettila was also named an ECHL second-team all-star and shared the ECHL Reebok Plus Performer Award with Brendan Connolly of the Greenville Road Warriors. In the playoffs, Daavettila scored 6goals and 22assists in 18games, leading the league in playoff scoring, and helped the Wings defeat the Florida Everblades, Reading Royals and Wheeling Nailers on their way to the Kelly Cup Finals. In that series, Kalamazoo lost to the Alaska Aces 4–1.|$|E

25|$|The IND World's Fair Line, officially the World's Fair Railroad, was {{a branch}} of the Independent Subway System (IND) serving the 1939 New York World's Fair in Queens, New York City.

25|$|Nucleotides {{containing}} the genetic information are <b>now</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single strand messenger template called mRNA. The mRNA is incorporated with a subunit of the ribosome and interacts with an rRNA. The genetic information {{carried in the}} codons of the mRNA are now read (decoded) by anticodons of the tRNA. As each codon (triplet) is read, amino acids are being joined together until a stop codon (UAG, UGA or UAA) is reached. At this point the polypeptide (protein) has been synthesised and is released. For every 1000 amino acid incorporated into the protein, {{no more than one}} is incorrect. This fidelity of codon recognition, maintaining the importance of the proper reading frame, is accomplished by proper base pairing at the ribosome A site, GTP hydrolysis activity of EF-Tu a form of kinetic stability, and a proofreading mechanism as EF-Tu is released.|$|E

25|$|In late 1867, James Grant, the Morayshire Chairman made {{tentative}} enquiries with The Highland Railway (successor {{company to}} I) regarding an amalgamation {{of their two}} companies and in early 1868 a statement regarding {{the terms of a}} possible amalgamation was produced. The GNoSR, when made aware of the statement immediately set about safeguarding its investment in the Morayshire with negotiations between the two big companies eventually leading to the Highland withdrawing the amalgamation terms. After a short illness, the Morayshire chairman James Grant died on 23 May 1872, aged 70. His public funeral took place on 28 May during which all shops and businesses in Elgin were closed. Gradually over the next few years, thanks mainly to the General Manager, Alexander Watt, the Morayshire introduced cost-cutting measures and revenue raising schemes. Rail travel for both goods and passengers increased greatly. The herring fishing at Lossiemouth coupled with such attractions as the public swimming baths at the port attracted visitors in large numbers allowing the Morayshire to pay back outstanding debts to most of its creditors. The GNoSR acknowledged that the Morayshire was <b>now</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sound footing and so in 1880 negotiations between the companies resumed and the enabling act for the amalgamation was given Royal Assent on 11 August 1881. This ended the Morayshire Railway's 35-year existence.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} storm developed {{east of the}} Leeward Islands on September 5 and quickly became the season's first hurricane.

The hurricane weakened somewhat on September 7 as it skirted the southern coast of Hispaniola, and curving northwestward, it passed along northern Jamaica. On September 10, it moved through the Yucatán Channel, restrengthening upon emerging into the Gulf of Mexico. <b>Now</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> northwesterly course, the storm reached its peak windspeeds on September 12.

Those elements came from the design of the Golf. In addition, the Volkswagen Beetle had now a new alarm system as series equipment. Externally, this model differed due to the rear apron of its central body, which was now more rounded.
