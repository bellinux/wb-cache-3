25|$|Particularly the Flemish Block/Flemish Interest {{has seen}} electoral success roughly {{around the turn}} of the century, and the <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> during the last few elections, {{becoming}} even the largest party in the 2010 federal elections.|$|E
25|$|EFA {{members are}} {{generally}} progressive, {{although there are}} some notable exceptions as the conservative <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance,</b> Bavaria Party, Schleswig Party and Future of Åland, the Christian-democratic Slovene Union, the centre-right Liga Veneta Repubblica and the far-right South Tyrolean Freedom.|$|E
50|$|Because {{regional}} parties - including regionalist parties - often cannot receive {{enough votes}} or legislative seats {{to be politically}} powerful, they may join political coalitions or seek {{to be part of}} a coalition government. Notable examples include the Sinn Féin's participation in the Northern Ireland Executive since 1999, the <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance's</b> participation in the Federal Government of Belgium since 2014, and Lega Nord's participation in the Italian government in 1994, 2001-2006 and 2008-2011.|$|R
50|$|In the Flemish Parliament election, the liberal-socialist {{government}} {{was put to}} the test. The far right Vlaams Blok became the second largest party in Flanders just after the alliance of conservatives Christian Democratic and Flemish-New <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (CD&V - N-VA). The green party Groen! managed to be elected and keeps half of their seats in the parliament. In contrast with the previous election, the People's Union (VU-ID) has split and the new parties, N-VA and Spirit, allied with CD&V and Different Socialist Party (SP.A) respectively.|$|R
50|$|The Arkprijs van het Vrije Woord (Ark Prize of the Free Word) is a {{symbolic}} award created in 1951 by Herman Teirlinck and the editorial {{team of the}} Nieuw Vlaams Tijdschrift (<b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> magazine) to counteract ideologically driven restrictions on the freedom of expression.|$|R
25|$|In Belgium, the <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA) {{political}} party uses it as a rallying gesture. During the taking {{the oath of}} the actual Belgian federal government, three N-VA ministers used the V sign instead of the formal three-fingers sign.|$|E
25|$|From 1932 onwards (and up till 2013) all mayors {{belonged to}} the Social Democrat party: Camille Huysmans, Lode Craeybeckx, Frans Detiège and Mathilde Schroyens, and after the {{municipality}} fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Detiège en Patrick Janssens. Since 2013 the mayor is the Flemish nationalist Bart De Wever, belonging to the Flemish separatist party N-VA (<b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance).</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 European Parliament election, six MEPs were {{returned}} for the EFA: {{two from the}} SNP (Ian Hudghton and Alyn Smith), one from Plaid Cymru (Jill Evans), one from the Party of the Corsican Nation (PNC; François Alfonsi), one from the ERC (Oriol Junqueras), and Tatjana Ždanoka, an individual member of the EFA from Latvia. After the election, the <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA) also joined the EFA. The EFA subgroup thus counted seven MEPs.|$|E
50|$|Koen Wauters {{started his}} career as a TV {{presenter}} in 1989, {{as one of the first}} faces for the <b>new</b> <b>Flemish</b> TV station vtm. He has presented shows like De Super 50 (a hitparade show), Familieraad, Wedden dat?, 1 tegen 100 and Op zoek naar Maria.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the veterans of Flandern, the Sturmbrigade now gained a contingent of <b>new</b> <b>Flemish</b> volunteers, an anti-tank Panzerjäger company, an assault gun battalion equipped with StuGs and a FlaK battalion. In October 1943, the brigade was renamed 6th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Langemarck. In December 1943, the Langemarck {{was ready to be}} sent to the front. The total unit strength was 2,022 men.|$|R
50|$|The Michel Government formed {{during these}} {{negotiations}} {{consists of a}} centre-right coalition of the Flemish nationalists (N-VA), the Flemish Christian democrats (CD&V) and the liberal parties (Open Vld/MR); i.e. only one party at French-speaking side. The <b>new</b> <b>Flemish</b> Government reflects the same coalition, whereas the Walloon and French Community Governments {{are made up of}} the PS and cdH, main centre-left parties that now became opposition at federal level.|$|R
25|$|The 2007–2008 Belgian {{government}} formation {{followed the}} general election of 10 June 2007, and comprised a period of negotiation in which the Flemish parties Flemish Liberal Democratic (Open VLD), Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD) and <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA), and the French-speaking parties Reformist Movement (MR), Democratic Front of Francophones (FDF) and Humanist Democratic Centre (CdH) negotiated to form a government coalition. The negotiations were characterized by the disagreement between the Dutch- and French-speaking parties {{about the need for}} and nature of a constitutional reform. According to some, this political conflict could have led to a partition of Belgium.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during the}} last half century, many new {{political}} parties were founded in Flanders. One of {{the first was the}} nationalist People's Union, of which the right nationalist Flemish Block (now Flemish Interest) split off, and which later dissolved into the now-defunct Spirit or Social Liberal Party, moderate nationalism rather left of the spectrum, on the one hand, and the <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA), more conservative but independentist, on the other hand. Other parties are the leftist alternative/ecological Green party; the short-lived anarchistic libertarian spark ROSSEM and more recently the conservative-right liberal List Dedecker, founded by Jean-Marie Dedecker, and the socialist Workers' Party.|$|E
25|$|Both the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region are {{constitutional}} {{institutions of}} the Kingdom of Belgium, exercising certain powers within their jurisdiction, granted following a series of state reforms. In practice, the Flemish Community and Region together form a single body, with its own parliament and government, as the Community legally absorbed the competences of the Region. The parliament is a directly elected legislative body composed of 124 representatives. The government consists of up {{to a maximum of}} eleven members and is presided by a Minister-President, currently Geert Bourgeois (<b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance)</b> leading a coalition of his party (N-VA) with Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams (CD) and Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten (Open VLD).|$|E
50|$|In February 2004, the N-VA {{entered into}} an electoral alliance, {{commonly}} known in Belgium as a cartel, with the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V) party, the traditionally largest party, {{which was then}} in opposition. They joined forces in the regional elections in 2004 and won. Both parties joined the <b>new</b> <b>Flemish</b> government, led by CD&V leader Yves Leterme. Geert Bourgeois became a minister, and Bart De Wever became the new party leader in October 2004.|$|R
50|$|With Edward Keurvels, Albert Baets and Hendrik Fontaine, Tokkie took {{financial}} {{responsibility for the}} <b>new</b> <b>Flemish</b> Opera in the period 1893-96, {{at a time when}} the viability of this company was still questioned. Due to his merit as a singer, he was able to partially absorb the losses he suffered as an administrator. That the Opera was not being a profitable enterprise meant that Tokkie had to remain active within the Antwerp diamond business, at that time controlled by the Jews.|$|R
40|$|An open-minded look of {{students}} in the master program urbanism and spatial planning at KU Leuven, together with the critical reflection of their lecturer, exhibits {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the <b>new</b> <b>Flemish</b> coalition agreement concerning 'planning policy'. The reduction in administrative charges through changes in procedures and digitalization and the trust in local governments have clear support. However, what content concerns, the Flemish government does lack an innovative project, despite the challenges that are waiting Flemish society in the next fifty years. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|There {{is a large}} {{economic}} gap between Flanders and Wallonia. Wallonia was historically wealthy compared to Flanders, mostly due to its heavy industries, but {{the decline of the}} steel industry post-World War II led to the region's rapid decline, whereas Flanders rose swiftly. Since then, Flanders has been prosperous, among the wealthiest regions in Europe, whereas Wallonia has been languishing. As of 2007, the unemployment rate of Wallonia is over double that of Flanders. The divide has played a key part in the tensions between the Flemish and Walloons in addition to the already-existing language divide. Pro-independence movements have gained high popularity in Flanders as a consequence. The separatist <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA) party for instance is the largest party in Flanders.|$|E
25|$|Early in 2014, Nweke {{expressed}} concern about the efficiency of the State Owned Enterprise (SOE), Economisch Huis Oostende (House of the Economy Ostend) in delivering its corporate goals despite considerable resources which the Council had invested in it. He however declared that he was ready to give a fair chance to the new Alderman, Niko Geldhof, to inject some impetus into the firm. In the summer of 2014 Nweke commended the development on social media. However, before the monthly Council debate session of August 2014, Nweke raised questions about substantial losses the firm had recorded in the preceding years, and stated that his party would not approve further funding for the firm until a clear recovery plan was tendered to Council. Opposition party, <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA) accused Collins of a flip-flop. Collins justified his approach in public statements.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 federal {{elections}} {{showed more}} support for Flemish autonomy, marking {{the start of the}} 2007–2011 Belgian political crisis. All the political parties that advocated a significant increase of Flemish autonomy gained votes as well as seats in the Belgian federal parliament. This was especially the case for Christian Democratic and Flemish and <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA) (who had participated on a shared electoral list). The trend continued during the 2009 regional elections, where CD and N-VA were the clear winners in Flanders, and N-VA became even the largest party in Flanders and Belgium during the 2010 federal elections, followed by the longest-ever government formation after which the Di Rupo I Government was formed excluding N-VA. Eight parties agreed on a sixth state reform which aim to solve the disputes between Flemings and French-speakers. The 2012 provincial and municipal elections however continued the trend of N-VA becoming the biggest party in Flanders.|$|E
5000|$|He was a {{supporter}} of the Flemish movement during World War I and endorsed the replacement of French by Dutch during the German occupation of Belgium. He worked as [...] "lector fysica" [...] at the <b>new</b> <b>Flemish</b> University of Ghent, which was made possible by the support of the German occupation forces, and was viewed as connivance with the enemy by the reestablished Belgian authorities. Because of this, he was sentenced after the war in absence to 15 years of forced labor. However, Minnaert had anticipated this outcome by fleeing Belgium in time.|$|R
50|$|The Sociedade Filarmónica Nova Artista Flamenguese (Philharmonic Society <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> Artists), {{founded on}} 23 January 1881, {{was the first}} band {{established}} in Flamengos. Between 1899 and 1912, its musical director was Maestro Francisco Xavier Simaria, but today Mário Francisco Leal Abreu is currently conducting the brass band. Besides this, there is the Tuna e Grupo Folclórico Juvenil dos Flamengos (Flamengos Chorus and Youth Folklore Group) was founded in 1978 by António da Luz Rodrigues, who served as its director, which recently (1 March 1999) established an ancillary group, the Grupo de Cantares Sons do Vale (Singing Group Sons of the Valley).|$|R
50|$|The {{arrondissement}} {{was created}} in 1963 upon the splitting of the arrondissement of Brussels into the capital one and the surrounding arrondissement of Halle-Vilvoorde. They remained part of the province of Brabant until it was split as well in 1995. In that year, the arrondissement of Nijvel formed the new Walloon Brabant and the arrondissements of Halle-Vilvoorde and Leuven formed the <b>new</b> <b>Flemish</b> Brabant. The arrondissement of Brussels-Capital, corresponding to the Brussels-Capital Region, thus became extraprovincial, meaning {{it is not a}} province, neither does it belong to one, nor does it contain any. However, it is the only Belgian arrondissement that is headed by a Governor and a Vice-Governor.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2011, Kamiński {{announced}} he would resign his chairmanship, effective 8 March, when a replacement would be elected. Former interim leader Timothy Kirkhope {{was said to be}} the front runner, but lost the election to Jan Zahradil of the Czech Republic's ODS. [...] Zahradil has been in talks with other parties about joining the ECR. [...] In late March, David Cameron invited the <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA) to join the group.|$|E
2500|$|The Bureau {{takes care}} of daily affairs. It is chaired by François Alfonsi (Party of the Corsican Nation), {{president}} of the EFA, while Jordi Solé (Republican Left of Catalonia) is secretary-general and Lorena Lopez de Lacalle (Basque Solidarity) treasurer and first vice-president. The Bureau is completed by other nine vice-presidents: Olrik Bouma (Frisian National Party), Chantal Certan (ALPE), Jill Evans (Plaid Cymru), [...] (Future of Åland), David Grosclaude (Partit Occitan), Flemming Meyer (SSW Landesverband), Ana Miranda (Galician Nationalist Bloc), Wouter Patho (<b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance)</b> and Natalia Pinkowska (Silesian Autonomy Movement).|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 Belgian federal {{election}} produced a highly fragmented political landscape, with 11 parties {{elected to the}} Chamber of Representatives, none of which had more than 20% of the seats. [...] The separatist <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA), the largest party in Flanders and {{the country as a}} whole, controlled 27 of 150 seats in the lower chamber. [...] The Francophone Socialist Party (PS), the largest party in Wallonia, controlled 26 seats. [...] Belgium beat the world record for time taken to form a new democratic government after an election, at 353 days. [...] Finally a government coalition was sworn in on 6 December 2011, with Socialist Elio Di Rupo becoming Prime Minister of the Di Rupo Government.|$|E
5000|$|Of the <b>Flemish</b> parties, the <b>alliance</b> of Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&V) and the New-Flemish Alliance (N-VA) {{received}} an increased {{share of the}} vote from the previous election, held in 2003. The CD&V/N-VA list was headed by Yves Leterme, and became the largest political formation in Belgium, thus leading the coalition talks for a <b>new</b> government. <b>Flemish</b> Interest (Vlaams Belang) received more votes {{than in the previous}} election, but lost one seat. Green! was able to return to parliament and newcomers List Dedecker (Lijst Dedecker) surprised most by immediately grabbing six seats, including one in the Senate. Prime minister Guy Verhofstadt's [...] "purple coalition," [...] consisting of his Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) alliance list and Socialist Party - Different (SP.A/SPIRIT), was punished in the election, with the SP.A/SPIRIT alliance losing somewhat more than Verhofstadt's Open VLD alliance. The day after the election, Verhofstadt handed in the resignation of his government to King Albert II. SP.A leader Johan Vande Lanotte resigned from his leadership position as well that day.|$|R
50|$|This 'Voka-Alliance' unites {{more than}} 17 000 {{businesses}} from all sectors within the <b>Flemish</b> region. The <b>alliance</b> is politically independent; {{there is no}} structural funding from government. It is a non-profit organisation: small, medium and large-sized companies of all sectors everywhere in Flanders can become member on a voluntary basis.|$|R
40|$|In many countries, as in Belgium, welfare {{services}} {{are provided by}} either local governmental, private nonprofit, or private commercial organizations. Next to that, welfare service delivery is often embedded in local communities. In this article we measure the prevalence of these three types of organizations at the local level, for the policy areas of child care and elderly care. Through the theoretical lenses of demand-side, supply-side and social origins theories, we also try to find an explanation for this relative prevalence. The results we present {{can be helpful in}} defining the limits local governments face in coordinating the heterogeneous field of welfare service deliverers in their local community, a role they have to play since the <b>new</b> <b>Flemish</b> Decree on Local Social Policy...|$|R
2500|$|At a European level, the Conservatives {{are members}} of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE), which unites centre-right parties in {{opposition}} to a federal European Union. [...] In the European Parliament, the Conservative Party's MEPs sit in the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, which is affiliated to the ACRE. [...] Party leader David Cameron pushed the foundation of the ECR, which was launched in 2009, along with the Czech Civic Democratic Party and the Polish Law and Justice, before which the Conservative Party's MEPs sat in the European Democrats, which had become a subgroup of the European People's Party in the 1990s. [...] Since the 2014 European election, the ECR group has been the third-largest group, with the largest members being the Conservatives (nineteen MEPs), Law and Justice (eighteen MEPs), the Liberal Conservative Reformers (five MEPs), and the Danish People's Party and <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (four MEPs each).|$|E
2500|$|The 2014 European {{elections}} were held on 22–25 May 2014. On 4 June 2014, the ECR accepted applications from the Danish People's Party (4 MEPs) and the Finns Party (2 MEPs), both formerly {{attached to the}} EFD group during the 7th term of the European Parliament, {{as well as the}} Family Party of Germany, both Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OĽaNO) and New Majority (NOVA) from Slovakia, and the Independent Greeks. Alternative for Germany and Bulgaria Without Censorship were admitted on 8 June, followed by the Dutch Reformed Political Party on 16 June. On 18 June the <b>New</b> <b>Flemish</b> <b>Alliance</b> (N-VA) joined the group, a party previously attached to the Greens/EFA group. N-VA party members had voted by a wide margin to join the ECR group instead of ALDE; 70 voted to join the ECR, and just three to join ALDE. The N-VA's decision allowed the ECR to overtake ALDE as the third biggest group in the European parliament, assuming the role of [...] "kingmakers" [...] in the new parliament. On 23 June, Irish Fianna Fáil MEP Brian Crowley joined from the ALDE group, but without the permission of his party or its leader Micheál Martin, who removed Crowley's party whip the following day. On the same day, IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement joined, taking the group to 70 MEPs.|$|E

From the mid-1970s Danny Matthys created the development of artistic training at the Urban Arts Institute in Ghent. Given the many winners in several national art competitions it was quite valued. His partner there was Eric De Volder, a locally very famous Flemish experimental theater maker.
