It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle {{disagreed}} with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle {{argued that there}} are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.|$|E
25|$|AP1 and AP2 {{are both}} {{segments}} {{of a single}} category. AP does not c-command BP {{because it does not}} exclude BP.

A c-commands C. The definitions above may perhaps be thought to allow BP to c-command AP, but a c-command relation is not usually assumed to hold between two such categories, and for the purposes of antisymmetry, the question of whether BP c-commands AP is in fact moot.|$|E

500|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> every noun is only {{associated}} with one classifier.

[...] Even within a single dialect or a single speaker, the same noun may take different measure words depending on the style in which the person is speaking, or on different nuances the person wants to convey (for instance, measure words can reflect the speaker's judgment of or opinion about the object). An {{example of this is}} the word for person, rén, which uses the measure word (...) gè normally, but uses the measure kǒu when counting number of people in a household, and wèi when being particularly polite or honorific, and míng in formal, written contexts; likewise, a group of people may be referred to by massifiers as [...] (yì [...] rén, [...] "a [...] of people") or [...] (yì [...] rén, [...] "a [...] of people"): the first is neutral, whereas the second implies that the people are unruly or otherwise being judged poorly.|$|E

500|$|After {{looking at}} agriculture, Cochrane {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right {{not to have been}} engineered, arguing that it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> they always do, and that if [...] "genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible." [...] Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest [...] "in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well-being", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is no wrong in engineering nonconscious entities.|$|E
