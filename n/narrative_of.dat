40|$|This article investigates {{what happens}} to {{institutional}} <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> care in Swedish preschool when a policy on increased documentation is introduced. Questions deal with preschool teachers’ professionalism as expressed through the teachers’ talk about documentation. The analysis is based on theories in education policy, teacher professionalism and institutional narratives. The findings show that the few references made by the teachers to <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> care are subordinated to <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> learning. A major conclusion is that <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> care are {{in a process of}} becoming a ‘noisy silence’, which influences teachers’ professionalism as well as shaping our common society...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} oral <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> personal experience told in thegraduate classroom and viewed here as a genre (Martin & Rose, 2007). <b>Narratives</b> <b>of</b> personal experienceare ubiquitous in everyday life and work as a means of re-constructing experience (Bruner, 1997, 1994). In this research, <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> personal experience are examined according to narrative and evaluationtheory (Cortazzi & Jin, 2001; Martin, 2001; Martin & White, 2005) to investigate how evaluation occursin these texts and how they work as a pedagogic tool.

40|$|In this study, I examine <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> {{belonging}} {{through a}} corpus of digital diasporic discourse. The corpus {{is based on}} a Nigerian online discussion forum; its users primarily consist of both local Nigerians and members of the globally dispersed Nigerian diaspora. The study sets out by providing a working definition <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> belonging couched in the sociolinguistic tradition <b>of</b> approaching <b>narrative</b> structures. This includes aspects of personal narration, structural features, and reference to concepts that are salient in the construction of belonging. From this preliminary definition, retrieval strategies are developed to identify <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> belonging in a large-scale dataset through a combination of manual and automated searches. The dataset <b>of</b> <b>narratives</b> is then analyzed, both in terms of structural features such as length and variation in narrative complexity, as well as linguistic properties, such as code-switching and the use of toponyms. Finally, these analyses are used to identify emerging topic strands and recurring themes in these <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> belonging. It can be argued that such codifications of the diasporic experience are created and reinforced through individuated stories. <b>Narratives</b> <b>of</b> belonging, in other words, systematically contribute to the identity work performed in and by a digital diasporic community...|$|R
40|$|Secondary-school {{students}} in the United States score notoriously low on tests of their reproductive and sexual knowledge despite attempts by educators and legislators {{to provide them with}} informative sex-education courses. In this paper, we build from narrative theory to explore how low-income women perceived their formal sex-education experiences and how they connected those experiences to their sexual-health knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors. Drawing from interviews with 30 low-income women, we identify and develop a typology <b>of</b> sex-education narratives: <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> regret, <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction, and <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty. We also investigate existing theoretical claims that lapses in time between lived events and the narration of those events connect to sensemaking efforts. We find that younger women in the sample were more likely to tell <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty than were older women. These results have implications for the study <b>of</b> <b>narrative</b> theory, sexual-health communication, and the discourse of public sex education...|$|R

40|$|The {{methods used}} to plan {{adaptation}} to climate change have been heavily influenced by scientific <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> gradual change and economic <b>narratives</b> <b>of</b> marginal adjustments to that change.
