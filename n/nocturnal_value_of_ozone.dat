The trends with summer minima and winter maxima for Δ 17 O(SO 4 2 −) and Δ 17 O(NO 3 −) values are caused by sunlight-driven changes in the relative contribution of O 3 oxidation to the oxidation by HO x, RO x, and H 2 O 2. In addition to that general trend, by comparing Δ 17 O(SO 4 2 −) and Δ 17 O(NO 3 −) values to ozone mixing ratios, we found that Δ 17 O(SO 4 2 −) values observed in spring (September to November) were lower than in fall (March to May), while there was no significant spring and fall difference in Δ 17 O(NO 3 −) values. The relatively lower sensitivity of Δ 17 O(SO 4 2 −) values to the ozone mixing ratio in spring compared to fall is possibly explained by (i)  the increased contribution of SO 2 oxidations by OH and H 2 O 2 caused by NO x emission from snowpack and/or (ii)  SO 2 oxidation by hypohalous acids (HOX [*]=[*] HOCl + HOBr) in the aqueous phase...|$|R

For the typical DC- 8 SOLVE II cruising altitudes of approx. 8 - 12 km and the background stratospheric aerosol conditions that prevailed during SOLVE 11, absorption of incoming solar radiation by ozone comprised a significant fraction of the aerosol-plus-ozone optical depth measured in the four AATS- 14 channels centered between 499. 4 and 675. 1 nm. Typical AODs above the DC- 8 ranged from 0. 003 - 0. 008 in these channels. For comparison, an <b>ozone</b> overburden <b>of</b> 0. 3 atm-cm (300 DU) translates to <b>ozone</b> optical depths <b>of</b> 0. 009, 0. 014, 0. 041, and 0. 012, respectively, at these same wavelengths. In this paper, we compare AATS- 14 <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> column content with temporally and spatially near-coincident values derived from measurements acquired by the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) and the Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement 111 (POAM III) satellite sensors. We also compare AATS- 14 ozone retrievals during selected DC- 8 latitudinal and longitudinal transects with total column ozone data acquired by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite sensors. To enable this comparison, the amount <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> in the column below the aircraft is estimated by combining SAGE and/or POAM data with high resolution, fast response in-situ ozone measurements acquired during the DC- 8 ascent {{at the start of}} each science flight...|$|R
40|$|Ozone {{measurements}} {{made by the}} SME UV Spectrometer and the Stratosphere Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) spectometer {{are compared}} at 1. 0 mbar for the time period from October 1984 to December 1986, using {{a model of the}} diurnal variation <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> to correct for the difference in local times of the two measurements. The absolute <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> mixing ratio measured by the two spectrometers were found to agree to better than 5 percent, with no significant divergence between the instruments. It is concluded that, since the SAGE II data are not dependent on the absolute calibration of the instrument, these data can be used as time-dependent 'ground truth' measurements for comparisons with other instruments...|$|R
40|$|During the {{austral summer}} of 1993, {{measurements}} <b>of</b> surface <b>ozone</b> (O 3), non-methane hydro-carbons (NMHC), lead- 212 and radon- 222 activity {{were performed on}} board the vessel ANTARCTICA between 43 °S and 77 °S. The latitudinal variations of light C 2 –C 5 alkanes reflect the relatively short photochemical lifetime of these compounds and their intensive photochem-ical destruction during summer. Average mixing ratios of ethane, propane and acetylene were 291 ± 76 pptv, 61 ± 53 pptv and 48 ± 35 pptv respectively, in good agreement with published measurements previously undertaken in the Antarctic region. O 3 mixing ratios ranged from 8. 5 ppbv to 22. 2 ppbv. The few relatively high <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> that have been observed during EREBUS 94 campaign occurred simultaneously with high Rn- 222 activities and possibly indicated continental influence through transport of air masses in the free troposphere. With the exception of these high O 3 events, the O 3 and NMHC observa-tions, in conjunction with air mass back trajectory analysis, radon- 222 observations and a global 3 -D model calculations, suggest that the troposphere/stratosphere exchanges {{play an important role}} on ozone budget at the high latitudes of the southern hemisphere. 1.

40|$|The {{formative}} {{stages of}} {{the onset of the}} 1979 southwest monsoon was marked by a WNW-ESE oriented band of marine convection over the South Arabian Sea. This convection was first observed on June 10, 1979 using satellite cloud imagery. The marine convection appeared during a major acceleration of the upper troposphere easterly wind field. A composite vertical meridional cross-section of upper level winds for June 11, revealed the core of the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) at 115 mb, 9. 5 deg N. Time analysis of the upper level wind field over the Tropical Wind Observing Ship (TWOS) polygon show a lowering of both the pressure level of maximum wind and tropopause level with acceleration of the upper level easterlies. The tropopause was as much as 20 mb lower on the equatorial side of the TEJ. Streamline analysis of the maximum observed easterly winds over India did not reveal the horizontal position of the TEJ. Careful analysis <b>of</b> Total <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data for June 11, 1979 showed relatively high <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> south <b>of</b> India. It was observed that the latitudinal position of the TEJ on June 11, at approximately 70 deg E coincided with the northern edge <b>of</b> relatively high <b>ozone</b> <b>values.</b> Using this as a reference, the TEJ core was identified as far as NE Bay of Bengal (the limits of the available TOMS data) ...|$|R
40|$|At latitudes and altitudes where {{transport}} {{effects on}} ozone mixing ratio can be neglected, ozone and temperature responses to short-term changes in solar ultraviolet flux {{can be used}} to calculate implied bounds on two basic photochemical parameters: the odd oxygen photochemical relaxation time and the chemical sensitivity of odd oxygen to local temperature changes. Seasonally averaged <b>values</b> <b>of</b> these parameters are derived from response measurements and are compared with model calculations between 0. 7 and 4 mbar at tropical latitudes. Results are in agreement within measurement and model uncertainties at all pressure levels. Model <b>values</b> <b>of</b> mean <b>ozone</b> and <b>of</b> the response <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> to perturbations are functions of the same photochemical data. Therefore this agreement provides a constraint which should be considered when changes are proposed in model input data for the purpose of improving agreement between measured and calculated high-altitude ozone...|$|R
40|$|Ozone plays {{a crucial}} role in tropospheric chemistry, is the third largest {{contributor}} to greenhouse radiative forcing after carbon dioxide and methane and also a toxic air pollutant affecting human health and agriculture. Long-term measurements <b>of</b> tropospheric <b>ozone</b> have been performed globally for more than 30 years with UV photometers, all relying on the absorption <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> at the 253. 65 nm line of mercury. We have re-determined this cross-section and report a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> 11. 27 x 10 − 18 cm 2 molecule − 1 with an expanded relative uncertainty of 0. 86 % (coverage factor k = 2). This is lower than the conventional value currently in use and measured by Hearn (1961) with a relative difference of 1. 8 %, with the consequence that historically reported ozone concentrations should be increased by 1. 8 %. In order to perform the new measurements of cross-sections with reduced uncertainties, a system was set up to generate pure ozone in the gas phase together with an optical system based on a UV laser with lines in the Hartley band, including accurate path length measurement of the absorption cell and a careful evaluation of possible impurities in the ozone sample by mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This resulted in new measurements <b>of</b> absolute <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> absorption cross-sections <b>of</b> 9. 48 x 10 − 18, 10. 44 x 10 − 18 and 11. 07 x 10 − 18 cm 2 molecule − 1, with relative expanded uncertainties better than 0. 7 %, for the wavelengths (in vacuum) of 244. 06, 248. 32, and 257. 34 nm respectively. The cross-section at the 253. 65 nm line of mercury was determined by comparisons using a Standard Reference Photometer equipped with a mercury lamp as the light source. The newly reported value should be used in the future to obtain the most accurate measurements <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration, which are in closer agreement with non-UV-photometry based methods such as the gas phase titration <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> with nitrogen monoxide...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} for stratospheric mass transport into, and remaining in, the troposphere in an intense midlatitude cyclone. Mesoscale forecast model analysis fields from the Mesoscale Analysis and Prediction System (MAPS) {{were compared with}} total ozone observations from the Total Ozone Measurement Spectrometer (TOMS). Coupled with parcel back-trajectory calculations, the analyses suggest two mechanisms contributed to the mass exchange: (1) A region of dynamical ly-induced exchange occurred on the cyclone's southern edge. Parcels originally in the stratosphere crossed the jet core and experienced dilution by turbulent mixing with tropospheric air. (2) Diabatic effects reduced parcel potential vorticity (PV) for trajectories traversing precipitation regions, resulting in a "PV-hole" signature in the cyclone center. Air with lower-stratospheric <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and water vapor {{was left in the}} troposphere. The strength of the latter process may be atypical. These results, combined with other research, suggest that precipitation-induced diabatic effects can significantly modify, (either decreasing or increasing) parcel potential vorticity, depending on parcel trajectory configuration with respect to jet core and maximum heating regions. In addition, these results underscore the importance of using not only PV but also chemical constituents for diagnoses of stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) ...|$|R
40|$|Moon {{measurements}} made at Tromso, and at Spitzbergen, 70 and 78 N, back in {{the fifties}} have been re-evaluated. One has {{to take into account}} that the wedge calibration will change when the focussed image of the moon on the inlet slit is used. A correction was later decided to be used after several experiments in Dobsons Laboratory in Oxford. The absorption coefficients have been changed since the observations were taken and evaluated the first time. The re-evaluated ozone values have been plotted, in one diagram for Spitzbergen, and in one for Tromso. The zonal mean value for ozone is given as a reference. Ozone measurements from the winter season 1985 / 86 and 1986 / 87 made at the same places are presented. Here the daylight measurements are incorporated and also TIROS satellite data from single point data retrieval are given. The two winter seasons were very different. In the first we had a late final stratospheric warming, and in the other we had an early final stratospheric warming. This {{can be seen from the}} 30 millibar temperatures, provided by Barbara Naujokat, and plotted in the diagrams. Again the zonal mean <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> are given as reference...|$|R
