5|$|The paper {{launched}} an online <b>news</b> <b>desk</b> {{in the early}} 2000s in order to compete with local radio stations for breaking news. Knight Ridder was bought by rival The McClatchy Company in June 2006. The Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News were among the twelve less-profitable Knight Ridder newspapers that McClatchy put up for sale when the deal was announced in March. On June 29, 2006, The Inquirer and Daily News were sold to Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC (PMH), a group of Philadelphian area business people, including Brian P. Tierney, PMH's chief executive. The new owners planned to spend US$5 million on advertisements and promotions to increase The Inquirers profile and readership.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to {{telephone}} the BBC's <b>news</b> <b>desk.</b> During the call, Oan took the receiver and spoke directly to the BBC journalist. He identified the group to which the gunmen belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages. At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, became seriously ill and his colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field telephone to negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15. He was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by police officers sent to gather information from him.|$|E

25|$|On May 17, 2012, Rolling Stone {{reported}} that Van Halen was postponing all tour dates after their show of June 26 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Shortly thereafter, the Van Halen <b>News</b> <b>Desk</b> {{revealed that the}} band's members were in good health, had not been arguing with each other, and {{that the reason for}} the postponed tour dates was to take a break after 18 months of non-stop recording and touring as well as to allow the group the opportunity to enhance its concert presentation before resuming the tour in the late summer of 2012. However, the postponed dates were officially listed as cancelled shortly thereafter.|$|E

A gigantic Panasonic 103-inch plasma monitor is often used for graphic display backgrounds. A kitchen set is located upstairs from the main studio. The blue background that is seen in the opening of the show in home base moves up and down to allow a view of the outside from the home base.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Fatbeard" [...] was watched by 2.59 million overall households, {{according to the}} Nielsen ratings, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. The episode received generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of If magazine, who gave the episode an A- grade, particularly praised the Cartman and Ike characters and called the ending [...] "perfect". Delgado said of the show's creators, [...] "These guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through the <b>news</b> <b>desk.</b> And because South Park {{can be made in}} like a week—and I’m talking start to finish, from concept to finished product—they end up being the most socially conscious and timely show on television today." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode and the Somalian pirate song, and complimented the show for presenting the pirates as sympathetic human beings. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said the portrayal of Somalian pirates was a predictable storyline, but said he enjoyed the episode because of the pacing: [...] "Rather than a cobbled-together collection of gags, everything progressed very organically." [...] IGN writer Travis Fickett said the episode was amusing but not exceptional. Fickett enjoyed the takeover of the French vessel {{and the extent to which}} Cartman's delusion about pirates takes him, but he said the pirate plot [...] "isn't entirely in good taste (and) it never really gathers a full head of steam".|$|E

50|$|In 1999, SVT {{started a}} digital 24-hour news channel called SVT24. It {{was based on}} content from both Rapport and Aktuellt, but it soon took {{over most of the}} Rapport broadcasts. In 1999, the updates at 12:00, 16:00, 17:00 and in the late evening were taken over by SVT24 and in 2000 SVT24 also took over the morning bulletins with Rapport Morgon moving to the SVT24 studio. Suddenly, Rapport proper found itself {{providing}} only the prime-time early-evening programme (and the late-evening edition at weekends) on the second channel, by now known as SVT2. This relocation of news bulletins to SVT24 was, in fact, only a matter of branding and technology (SVT24 used more efficient digital technology which made broadcasts from there cheaper), SVT having in 2000 merged all its <b>news</b> <b>desks</b> into one.|$|R
40|$|Histories of {{the printed}} press and {{occupational}} myths tend to emphasise that journalists in most European countries {{have long been}} concerned about interferences from political authorities in the editorial sphere. But over time, other sources of potential influence, including advertising, commercial pressures, competition and other economic pressures became matters of concern. As news evolved to become a big business, <b>news</b> <b>desks</b> have {{had to cope with}} different forms of political and economic influences, ranging from soft pressures to strict censorship. On the whole, journalistic practices have been strongly marked by national historical situations and values linked to the particular context in which media were built and to the balance of power with political authorities. European democracies and Eastern regimes produced many national journalistic traditions and models, reflecting differing forms and degrees of media independence and editorial freedom...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} requirements analysis for a next generation digital newspaper publishing system. It contains detailed requirements {{in the form}} of use cases for the following categories: Functional requirements, context awareness and extended services. Functional requirements define the operation of the system with respect to its stakeholders: media consumers, <b>news</b> <b>desks,</b> the business office, news sources and advertisers. Context awareness requirements allow a media consumer’s newspaper to be adapted to the consumer’s personal taste, reading behaviour and his current whereabouts. Extended services requirements extend newspapers with services from third party service providers (e. g. concert ticket offices, book stores, restaurants [...] .) which can target consumers that match a particular profile. These requirements are illustrated using a number of real life scenarios. Example quality scenarios show how non-functional requirements should be addressed.

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} how local journalists in Kalmar think when they choose their sources to interview. We have also studied several factors that can affect their choices of sources. We have interviewed eight news journalists from the two largest local news papers Barometern and Östran in Kalmar. The journalists were asked about the sources they often use as interview objects. They were supposed to tell about how they think when choosing sources and define which sources they commonly use. There are different factors that can affect the choices and we have narrowed them down to ethics, source critics, credibility, stress, hard production conditions, public and their own interest and if they consider themselves to be individualistic or controlled by the <b>news</b> <b>desks.</b> Furthermore the journalists were asked to characterize what changes they would make when choosing sources in a perfect world. All of the journalists had not reflected prominently {{on the subject of}} sources before our research. But most of them could perceive different views. Hence the study became essential for them as well as us. We found various perspectives very interesting. For instance the interviews showed that the journalists frequently use the same sources on account of the limitation of time and number of sources in Kalmar. There is a lack of using intimidating sources which opinions the journalists do not agree with. The personal network of sources is crucial to the reporter in finding important information and relevant interview objects. The reporters in our research are more individualistic than controlled by the <b>news</b> <b>desks.</b> However the <b>news</b> bosses may affect their choices of sources by telling them which sources are credible and worthy to fit in the news papers.

According to Nick Davies in Flat Earth News, the paper originally intended an attack on the groups arguing for an inquiry into the Lawrence murder, but the paper's reporter Hal Austin, on interviewing Neville and Doreen Lawrence, realised that some [...] years earlier, Neville had worked at Dacre's home in Islington as a plasterer, and the <b>news</b> <b>desk</b> instructed Austin to [...] "Do something sympathetic" [...] about the case.

He {{was head of}} the Irish Government's Information Service and Government Press Secretary from 1977 to 1982, a position that had been established on Dunlop's recommendation. This role involved developing relationships with media outlets, including RTÉ, The Irish Times, Irish Independent amongst others. There were no other authorised radio stations in Ireland at this stage although there were quite a number of illegal broadcasters. The Government Information Service, prior to Dunlop's time, was the established unit of the Taoiseach's office for the dissemination of information relating to the activities of the Government. Dunlop described its role to The Mahon Tribunal in 2003, as being a 'post office' - [...] "it just delivered copies of statements, speeches, announcements, CSO details to the <b>news</b> <b>desks</b> of newspapers; there was no substantive policy discussions with the media prior to that time".|$|R
