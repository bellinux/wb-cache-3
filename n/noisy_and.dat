5|$|At {{least partly}} {{explaining}} why both Lamb and Hazlitt felt {{the inadequacy of}} Shakespearean stage performances was that the theatres themselves were huge and gaudy, audiences were <b>noisy</b> <b>and</b> unmannerly, and dramatic presentations {{in the early nineteenth}} century were sensationalistic, laden with artificial and showy props. In addition, unless one sat down in the pit, one could easily miss the subtleties of the actors' facial and vocal expressions.|$|E

5|$|Even if without direct predation, {{the giant}} otter must still {{compete with other}} predators for food resources. Duplaix {{documented}} interaction with the neotropical otter. While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, {{there appeared to be}} no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical otter is far more shy, less <b>noisy,</b> <b>and</b> less social; at about a third the weight of the giant otter, it is more vulnerable to predation, hence, a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage. The neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal giant otter. Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus felt Uppsala was too <b>noisy</b> <b>and</b> unhealthy, so {{he bought}} two farms in 1758: Hammarby and SÃ¤vja. The next year, {{he bought a}} {{neighbouring}} farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants {{that could not be}} grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.|$|E
5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a <b>noisy</b> <b>and</b> messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E

5|$|Red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} are diurnal, raucous and <b>noisy,</b> <b>and</b> {{are often}} seen flying high overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks {{of up to}} 500birds are generally only seen in the north or when the birds are concentrated at some food source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, graptogyne and naso, are almost exclusively arboreal. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually found in small groups, {{although}} substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks well, without waddling, {{and although it}} normally feeds by upending, it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other whistling ducks. It flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds {{during the day and}} at night in fairly large flocks, often with other whistling duck species, but rests or sleeps in smaller groups {{in the middle of the}} day. They are <b>noisy</b> <b>and</b> display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off in alarm, they often shake their head sideways.|$|E
5|$|Although wildcats are solitary, {{the social}} {{behavior}} of domestic cats {{is much more}} variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that form around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation. Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and if that does not work, by short but <b>noisy</b> <b>and</b> violent attacks. Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, {{they do not have}} a social survival strategy, or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.|$|E

5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is <b>noisy</b> <b>and</b> desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E
5|$|While {{extensive}} {{technical studies}} and the raising of finance for the project were in progress, the city expanded significantly resulting in a twofold rise in population and a fivefold {{rise in the number}} of vehicles between 1981 and 1998. Consequently, traffic congestion and pollution soared, as an increasing number of commuters took to private vehicles with the existing bus system unable to bear the load. An attempt at privatising the bus transport system in 1992 merely compounded the problem, with inexperienced operators plying poorly maintained, <b>noisy</b> <b>and</b> polluting buses on lengthy routes, resulting in long waiting times, unreliable service, extreme overcrowding, unqualified drivers, speeding and reckless driving. To rectify the situation, the Government of India and the Government of Delhi jointly set up a company called the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on 3 May 1995, with E. Sreedharan as the managing director.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{live animals}} to {{represent}} the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold's account, {{the inspiration for the}} form of the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman. Sherman's Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her. The design came from Wah Chang, but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline CumerÃ©. She was paid $350 to sew five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with foam rubber. Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite <b>noisy</b> <b>and</b> required the dialogue to be looped in during editing. Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required for one to sit on a person or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted. Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992. The sale at Christie's auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode {{as part of a larger}} Star Trek sale. Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald. An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000.|$|E

5|$|Wood Siding {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a low platform and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a buffer stop for the siding, and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and <b>noisy</b> <b>and</b> could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908â1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood Siding {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby garden shed.|$|E
