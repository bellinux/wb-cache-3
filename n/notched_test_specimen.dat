40|$|The {{suitability}} of using rain-flow reconstructions {{as an alternative}} to an original loading spectrum for component fatigue life testing is investigated. A modified helicopter maneuver history is used for the rain-flow cycle counting and history regenerations. Experimental testing on a <b>notched</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> over a wide range of loads produces similar lives for the original history and the reconstructions. The test lives also agree with a simplified local strain analysis performed on the specimen utilizing the rain-flow cycle count. The rain-flow reconstruction technique is shown to be a viable test spectrum alternative to storing the complete original load history, especially in saving computer storage space and processing time. A description of the regeneration method, the simplified life prediction analysis, and the experimental methods are included in the investigation...|$|E
40|$|For the {{simulation}} of the durability and life estimation of cyclic loaded parts, simulation models which consider material plasticity and damage effects {{such as the}} local strain concepts are state of the art. Typically light weight structures are dimensioned {{in a way that}} limited local yielding is allowed. Traditional nonlinear FEA analysis simulating the local material plasticity are still very resource intensive, yet fatigue and life endurance simulations commonly need stress and strain results for various different load levels, making such an analysis expensive. In order {{to reduce the number of}} nonlinear simulation results, approximation techniques based on the Neuber formula which estimate the plastic stress-strain state from linear analysis runs are utilized in commercial fatigue simulation software such as "NEi Fatigue/Winlife", FE-Fatigue or "MSC Fatigue", to name a few.

In this contribution, void {{growth has been}} quantitatively characterized in an extruded 6061 -wrought Al-alloy {{as a function of}} stress state in <b>notch</b> tensile <b>test</b> <b>specimens.</b> Digital image analysis and Stereology have been used to estimate the volume fraction and three-dimensional number density of voids in a series of interrupted <b>notch</b> tensile <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> where the local stress state is predominantly triaxial. Finite elements (FE) simulations have been used to compute the stress states at different locations in the specimens. The computed stress states and experimentally estimated average void volume are utilized to verify analytical void growth models. Lack of agreement between the predictions of the models and the experimental data is due to interactions between neighboring voids, which are ignored in the theoretical models, and continuous void nucleation. The following empirical damage evolution equation is obtained from the experimental data on void volume fraction expressed as % (f), and the corresponding local equivalent plastic strain (op) and stress triaxiality (I) computed from FE simulations: f/a/b ln[op]/cI.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} impact loads against {{offshore}} pipelines are studied. Impact loads are {{often associated with}} accidents, such as an anchor hooking. A pipeline subjected to an anchor hooking may experience severe deformations and a complex stress and strain history. Local deformation will occur when the anchor hits the pipe. Then the pipe may be dragged along the sea bed until the anchor is released or the anchor chain snaps. Axial forces, which increase as the pipeline deflects, will drag the pipe back against its initial position. Fracture may occur {{in the area where}} the anchor hits. Experiments and numerical analyses are applied to investigate the problem. The experiments consisted of two tests, impact and stretching. Scaled pipes were first impacted in the pendulum accelerator at Department of Structural Engineering, NTNU, Trondheim. Stretching of the dented pipes was performed at Statoil’s laboratory in Trondheim. Fracture occurred in all the pipes during the stretch <b>tests.</b> Material <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were taken from the pipe wall and tested in the laboratory at NTNU. A material model, including a constitutive relation and a fracture criterion, were calibrated for use in numerical analyses. Strain hardening and strain rate sensitivity was accounted for in the constitutive relation, and isotropic hardening was assumed. <b>Notched</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were <b>tested</b> to capture the effect of stress triaxiality on the fracture strain. The pipes were modeled using Abaqus/Explicit and the experiments were recreated numerically. Both shell and volume element models were used.

NASTRAN was used for the finite element analysis assuming linear behavior and equivalent static load. The unidirectional composites investigated ranged from Thornel 75 Epoxy to S-Glass/Epoxy with the fiber direction parallel to the long dimension of the specimen. The results indicate a biaxial stress state exists in (1) the notch vicinity which is dominated by transverse tensile and interlaminar shear and (2) near the load application point which is dominated by transverse compression and interlaminar shear.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} strength reliability of micron size polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) structure, bending tests of cantilever beam and Weibull analysis are performed. Recently, {{the importance of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in society is increasing, {{and the number of}} production is also increasing. The MEMS devices, which contain mechanical movement, have to maintain their reliability in face of external shock, thermal stress and residual stress from manufacturing processes. In greeting the mass production era of the MEMS, in case the material strength design of MEMS is performed, required strength data is not average value but the variation, especially minimum value of the material. Micron size poly-Si structure is widely employed in the MEMS such as microsensor, switching device and so on.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{the theory of}} {{critical}} distances (TCD) is reformulated {{in order to make}} it suitable for predicting fatigue lifetime of notched components in the medium-cycle fatigue regime. This extension of the TCD takes as its starting point the idea that the material characteristic length, L, changes as the number of cycles to failure, Nf, changes. In order to define the L versus Nf relationship two different strategies were investigated. Initially, we attempted to determine it by using the L values calculated considering material properties defined at the two extremes, namely static failure and the fatigue limit. This strategy, though correct from a philosophical point of view, contained some problems in its practical application. We subsequently attempted to determine the L versus Nf relationship by means of two calibration fatigue curves; (one generated by <b>testing</b> plain <b>specimens</b> and the second one generated by <b>testing</b> <b>notched</b> <b>specimens).</b> This second strategy was found to be much more simple to apply to practical problems, resulting in estimations characterized by a higher accuracy. The reliability of the devised method was systematically checked by using experimental results generated by <b>testing</b> <b>notched</b> <b>specimens</b> of low-carbon steel containing different geometrical features and tested using various loading types, stress ratios and specimen thicknesses. The accuracy of the method was further verified by using several data sets taken from the literature.

These results are very interesting, especially considering that the TCD is very easy to use because it requires only a linear-elastic stress analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{deformation}} and {{fracture of}} polycarbonate and polycarbonate toughened with methyl-methacrylate shell/polybutadiene core sub-micron particles are investigated. The effects of strain rate, temperature, and notch stress triaxiality on deformation and fracture are studied. The Arruda-Boyce constitutive model for glassy polymers and finite element simulations {{are used to}} simulate the deformation of the polycarbonate homopolymer subjected to compression and tension under un-notched and notched conditions. Compression of polycarbonate in uniaxial compression is found to exhibit an initially elastic response followed by yield, then strain softening and strain hardening at large strains. The yield stress {{is found to be}} dependent on temperature and strain rate. Yield stress is shown to increase with increasing strain rate and decrease with increasing temperature. Load-displacement behavior of un-notched polycarbonate is shown to exhibit an initially elastic response followed by macroscopic yield, then a load drop, and then a load plateau as the neck stably propagates, soon after the neck has propagated the full length of the specimen it begins to travel into the grip region, ductile failure occurs due to extensive stretching. The fracture is surface initiated. The load at yield is shown to be dependent on temperature and displacement rate. The load at yield increases with increasing strain rate and decreases with increasing temperature. Notched tension specimens are shown to exhibit an initially elastic behavior. Mildly <b>notched</b> <b>specimens</b> <b>tested</b> at room temperature are shown to fail in a ductile manner similar to un-notched specimens. More severely notched specimens, and the moderately <b>notched</b> <b>specimen</b> <b>tested</b> at 100 ° C are shown to fail in a brittle manner where the brittle failure is found to be internally initiated. The un-notched and <b>notched</b> tension <b>test</b> data together with simulation results enabled construction of ductile and brittle fracture criteria. A ductile failure criterion of maximum strain is proposed. This maximum strain is seen in the ductile failures of both the un-notched and the mildly notched specimens and has a value of approximately 0. 65. A temperature dependent brittle failure criterion is proposed. This brittle failure criterion establishes critical values of negative pressure for brittle failure at various temperatures. Rubber-modified compression and tension specimens are shown to exhibit stress-strain and load-displacement behavior similar to that seen for the un-modified material compression and tension tests respectively. The elastic modulus, yield stress, amount of strain softening, and strain hardening are all seen to decrease with increasing rubber volume content. The inclusion of sub-micron rubber particles is shown not to dramatically enhance the mechanical properties of un-notched or mildly notched specimens.

The influence of carbon black content on fracture phenomenology and fracture toughness was investigated by performing video-recorded tests adopting a suitable grooved <b>notched</b> pure shear <b>test</b> <b>specimen.</b> In such a way, {{it was possible}} to analyze the so-called ‘‘knotty tearing’’ deformation mechanism occurring at the crack tip: sideways cracks perpendicular to the notch plane develop before the onset and propagation of a forward crack parallel to the notch plane.

The presence of carbon black modifies the maximum chain extensibility and strain-induced crystallizability of the rubber matrix in the compound. The formation of sideways cracks occurred in all filled compounds and resulted in a link to the maximum chain extensibility. Nevertheless, toughness enhancement was observed only when strain-induced crystallization took place at the crack tip before the onset of the forward crack...|$|R

V-notch (with an opening angle of 120 °) geometry is considered with root radii ranging from 0. 1 to 2. 0. mm. Plots of torque loads versus twist angles are recorded for all <b>notch</b> root radii <b>tested.</b> Such results can help in evaluating numerical and theoretical models for fracture of notched components under mode III loading. The second part of the paper deals with an analysis of the experimental results by using the Strain Energy Density criterion. Because of the mode III loading conditions, a non-conventional application of such criterion is carried out, showing a good agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical fracture assessments and it is used to justify the link between nominal and local fracture approaches...|$|R
40|$|The fatigue {{strength}} {{at a high}} number of cycles with initial elastic–plastic behavior was experimentally investigated on quenched and tempered 42 CrMo 4 steel. Fatigue <b>tests</b> on unnotched <b>specimens</b> were performed both under load and strain controls, by imposing various levels of amplitude and with several high load ratios. Different ratcheting and relaxation trends, with significant effects on fatigue, are observed and discussed, and then reported in the Haigh diagram, highlighting a clear correlation with the Smith–Watson–Topper model. High load ratio tests were also conducted on notched specimens with C (blunt) and V (sharp) geometries. A Chaboche model with three parameter couples was proposed by fitting plain specimen cyclic and relaxation tests, and then finite element analyses were performed to simulate the <b>notched</b> <b>specimen</b> <b>test</b> results. A significant stress relaxation at the notch root became clearly evident by reporting the numerical results in the Haigh diagram, thus explaining the low mean stress sensitivity of the notched specimens...|$|R
