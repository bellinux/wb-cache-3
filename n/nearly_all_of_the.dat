5|$|Despite Riggs' publication, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of Marsh and his taxa, labeled the Apatosaurus mount of the American Museum of Natural History Brontosaurus. Because of this decision the name Brontosaurus was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what Riggs considered Apatosaurus, and the museum's popularity meant that Brontosaurus {{became one of the}} best known dinosaurs, even though it was invalid throughout <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E

5|$|In the United States {{the film}} {{remained}} unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version {{under the title}} Unsane. It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's violence, which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes that established the characters and their relationships were excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of Tenebrae received nearly unanimously negative reviews.|$|E
5|$|Just {{over half}} of the French {{infantry}} were regulars of the old Royal Army, as were <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cavalry and, most importantly, the artillery, which were widely regarded as the best in Europe at the time. These veterans provided a professional core to steady the enthusiastic volunteer battalions. Combined, Dumouriez' Army of the North and Kellermann's Army of the Centre totalled approximately 54,000 troops. Heading towards them was Brunswick's coalition army of about 84,000, all veteran Prussian and Austrian troops augmented by large complements of Hessians and the French royalist Army of Condé.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{territory}} of Chile {{is subject to}} earthquakes, arising from strains in the subducting Nazca and South American Plates or shallow strike-slip faults. The subduction zone along the Chilean coast produced the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Some earthquakes which occurred near the epicentre of the 11 March 2010 event are the 1985 Algarrobo and Rapel Lake earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} events elsewhere {{interacted with}} groundwater and magma creating numerous pit craters. Many of these pit craters {{have been filled}} with water creating several crater lakes. In some places glacial till and fluvial sands and gravels are maintained under the several lava flows that form the volcanic field. Paleosols are found, but are rare. Glaciation has left a thick blanket of till over <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanic deposits and therefore outcrop is largely limited to cliffforming exposures in several valleys.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the hurricane, an {{estimated}} 20,000people evacuated the coastal parishes of southeastern Louisiana, including <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2,000residents on Grand Isle. Small-scale evacuations were issued for residents living in low-lying or coastal areas of Mississippi and Alabama. Offshore, the threat of the hurricane prompted oil companies to evacuate employees on oil rigs to the mainland.|$|E
