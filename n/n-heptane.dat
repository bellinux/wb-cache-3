25|$|Triclosan can be {{synthesized}} {{through a}} three-step process starting with 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one. The 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidin-2-one is dehydrated with either zinc or calcium oxide into 1-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one. Then, 1-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one can be reacted with 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenyl acrylate in <b>n-heptane</b> to form triclosan.|$|E
25|$|Octane {{rating is}} {{measured}} {{relative to a}} mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (an isomer of octane) and <b>n-heptane.</b> There are different conventions for expressing octane ratings, so the same physical fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used.

25|$|Raoult's law {{predicts the}} vapor {{pressures}} of ideal mixtures {{as a function}} of composition ratio. In general only mixtures of chemically similar solvents, such as n-hexane with <b>n-heptane,</b> form nearly ideal mixtures that come close to obeying Raoult's law. Solvent combinations that can form azeotropes are always nonideal, and as such they deviate from Raoult's law.|$|E
25|$|More {{volatile}} short-chain alkanes {{are also}} produced by and found in plant tissues. The Jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally {{high levels of}} <b>n-heptane</b> in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and n-nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses. Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane, pentane, and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not {{generally considered to be}} a major component of biogenic air pollution.|$|E
50|$|Jeffrey pine wood {{is similar}} to ponderosa pine wood, and {{is used for the}} same purposes. The {{exceptional}} purity of <b>n-heptane</b> distilled from Jeffrey pine resin led to <b>n-heptane</b> being selected as the zero point on the octane rating scale of petrol.|$|E

5000|$|... 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, {{also known}} as isooctane, is an octane isomer which defines the 100 point on the octane rating scale (the zero point is <b>n-Heptane).</b> It is an {{important}} component of gasoline.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>n-Heptane</b> {{is defined}} as the zero point of the octane rating scale. It is {{undesirable}} in gasoline, because it burns explosively, causing engine knocking, as opposed to branched-chain octane isomers, which burn more slowly and give better performance. It was originally chosen as the zero point of the scale because of the availability of very high purity <b>n-heptane,</b> unmixed with other isomers of heptane or other alkanes, distilled from the resin of Jeffrey pine and from the fruit of Pittosporum resiniferum. Other sources of heptane and octane, produced from crude oil, contain a mixture of different isomers with greatly differing ratings, and do not give as precise a zero point.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of octane rating {{worldwide}} is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine with a variable compression ratio under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and <b>n-heptane.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{octane rating}} was {{developed}} by chemist Russell Marker at the Ethyl Corporation in 1926. The selection of <b>n-heptane</b> as the zero point of the scale was due to its availability in high purity. Other isomers of heptane produced from crude oil have greatly different ratings.|$|E
5000|$|Heptane is commercially {{available}} as mixed isomers {{for use in}} paints and coatings, as the rubber cement solvent [...] "Bestine", the outdoor stove fuel [...] "Powerfuel" [...] by Primus, as pure <b>n-heptane</b> {{for research and development}} and pharmaceutical manufacturing and as a minor component of gasoline.|$|E

50|$|Aviation fuels {{consist of}} blends of over two {{thousand}} chemicals, primarily hydrocarbons (paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics), additives such as antioxidants and metal deactivators, biocides, static reducers, icing inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, and impurities. Principal components include <b>n-heptane</b> and isooctane. Like other fuels, aviation fuel for spark-ignited piston engines are described by their octane rating.|$|E

5000|$|As it mainly {{consists}} of <b>n-heptane,</b> Jeffrey pine resin {{is a poor}} source of turpentine. [...] Before Jeffrey pine was distinguished from ponderosa pine as a distinct species in 1853, resin distillers operating in its range suffered a number of 'inexplicable' explosions during distillation, now {{known to have been}} caused by the unwitting use of Jeffrey pine resin.|$|E
50|$|At {{the present}} time {{activity}} of the enterprise is focused on development of Design Basis or Basic Engineering Design for detailed engineering of isomerization (technology Isomalk-2, isomerization n-butane Isomalk-3, isomerization <b>n-heptane</b> Isomalk-4) and reforming units, {{as well as on}} isomerization and reforming catalysts supply, monitoring of isomerization and reforming units operation, analytical research of hydrocarbon fractions and catalysts, creation of new catalysts.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane, {{also known}} as {{isooctane}} or iso-octane, is an organic compound with the formula (CH3)3CCH2CH(CH3)2. It {{is one of several}} isomers of octane (C8H18). This particular isomer is the standard 100 point on the octane rating scale (the zero point is <b>n-heptane).</b> It is an important component of gasoline, frequently used in relatively large proportions to increase the knock resistance of the fuel.|$|E
50|$|To recover {{products}} from the residue, secondary processing facilities consisting of fluidized catalytic cracking unit of 1 mmtpa capacity along with a feed preparation unit of 1 mmtpa capacities, were commissioned in December 1982. The refinery set up pilot distillation facilities {{for the production of}} <b>n-Heptane</b> and light aluminum rolling oils. To enable absorption of increased indigenous crudes the refinery's capacity was further increased to 9.5 mmtpa.|$|E
5000|$|... n-Hexane is biotransformed to 2-hexanol {{and further}} to 2,5-hexanediol in the body. The {{conversion}} is catalyzed by the enzyme cytochrome P450 utilizing oxygen from air. The pathway is called omega oxidation. 2,5-Hexanediol may be further oxidized to [...] 2,5-hexanedione, which is neurotoxic and produces a polyneuropathy. In {{view of this}} behavior, replacement of n-hexane as a solvent has been discussed. <b>n-Heptane</b> is a possible alternative.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Methylhexane (C7H16, {{also known}} as isoheptane, ethylisobutylmethane) is an isomer of heptane. It is {{structurally}} a hexane molecule with a methyl group attached to its second carbon atom. It exists in most commercially available heptane merchandises as an impurity but is usually not considered as impurity in terms of reactions since it has very similar {{physical and chemical properties}} when compared to <b>n-heptane</b> (straight-chained heptane).|$|E
5000|$|A rule-of-thumb is {{that any}} {{molecule}} that will dissolve in methanol or a less polar solvent is compatible with SFC, including polar solutes. CO2 has polarity similar to <b>n-heptane</b> [...] at its critical point, but the solvent strength can be increased by increasing density or using a polar cosolvent. In practice, when the fraction of cosolvent is high, the mobile phase is not truly supercritical, but this terminology is used regardless.|$|E
50|$|Being an alkane, 2-methylhexane is {{insoluble}} in water, but is soluble in many organic solvents, such as alcohols and ether. However, 2-methylhexane is {{more commonly}} {{considered as a}} solvent itself. Therefore, {{even though it is}} present in many commercially available heptane products, it is not considered as a destructive impurity, as heptane is usually used as a solvent. Nevertheless, by concise processes of distillation and refining, it is possible to separate 2-methylhexane from <b>n-heptane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rubber cement {{is simply}} a mixture of solid rubber in a {{volatile}} solvent that will dissolve it. When the cement is applied, the solvent evaporates, leaving the rubber as the adhesive. Almost any rubber (pre-vulcanized or not) can be used. The rubbers used might be natural rubber, gum mastic or gum arabic. Early solvents used included chloroform and benzene. In the United States of America, current formulations include <b>n-heptane.</b> In the UK, a product called Marabu-Fixogum uses acetone.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>n-Heptane</b> is the {{straight-chain}} alkane {{with the}} chemical formula H3C(CH2)5CH3 or C7H16. When {{used as a}} test fuel component in anti-knock test engines, a 100% heptane fuel is the zero point of the octane rating scale (the 100 point is a 100% iso-octane). Octane number equates to the anti-knock qualities of a comparison mixture of heptane and isooctane which is expressed {{as the percentage of}} isooctane in heptane and is listed on pumps for gasoline (petrol) dispensed globally.|$|E
50|$|The {{solvents}} used in {{rubber cement}} present some hazards, including flammability and potential for abuse as inhalants. Therefore, {{as with any}} adhesive, rubber cement {{should be used in}} an open area. Also, care needs be taken to avoid heat sources, as <b>n-heptane</b> and n-hexane are highly flammable. Rubber cement and rubber cement thinner (which is used to replace the solvent that evaporates from the container and to remove stains of glue) that contain acetone will damage polished surfaces and many plastics.|$|E
5000|$|Asphaltenes consist {{primarily}} of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, {{as well as}} trace amounts of vanadium and nickel. The C:H ratio is approximately 1:1.2, depending on the asphaltene source. Asphaltenes are defined operationally as the <b>n-heptane</b> (...) -insoluble, toluene (...) -soluble component of a carbonaceous material such as crude oil, bitumen, or coal. Asphaltenes {{have been shown to}} have a distribution of molecular masses in the range of 400 u to 1500 u, but the average and maximum values are difficult to determine due to aggregation of the molecules in solution.|$|E
50|$|Engine {{knocking}} is {{an unwanted}} {{process that can}} occur during high compression ratio in internal combustion engines. Graham Edgar in 1926 added different amounts of <b>n-heptane</b> and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane to gasoline, and discovered that the knocking stopped when 2,2,4-trimethylpentane was added. This was {{the origin of the}} octane rating scale. Test motors using 2,2,4-trimethylpentane gave a certain performance which was standardized as 100 octane. The same test motors, run in the same fashion, using heptane, gave a performance which was standardized as 0 octane. All other compounds and blends of compounds then were graded against these two standards and assigned octane numbers.|$|E
50|$|More {{volatile}} short-chain alkanes {{are also}} produced by and found in plant tissues. The Jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally {{high levels of}} <b>n-heptane</b> in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and n-nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses. Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane, pentane, and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not {{generally considered to be}} a major component of biogenic air pollution.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of photochemical processes is the low {{efficiency of the}} conversion of electrical energy in the radiation energy of the required wavelength. In addition to the radiation, light sources generate plenty of heat, which in turn requires cooling energy. In addition, most light sources emit polychromatic light, even though only monochromatic light is needed. A high quantum yield, however, compensates for these disadvantages. The quantum yield for the photochlorination of <b>n-heptane</b> is about 7000, for example. In photochlorination plants, the quantum yield is about 100. In contrast to the thermal chlorination, which can utilize the formed reaction energy, the energy required to maintain the photochemical reaction must be constantly delivered.|$|E
