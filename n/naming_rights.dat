Domain <b>name</b> <b>rights</b> may be hypothecated and realized in two ways. First, it can be classified as Intellectual property rights meeting the essential characteristics of hypothec property rights. Second, it may be subjected to an enterprise’s collective mortgage, fulfilling the purpose of mortgage by putting the domain <b>name</b> <b>rights</b> into the enterprise’s aggregately mortgaged property.

5|$|A {{controversy}} arose regarding {{whether to}} lay natural or artificial turf. Kristofer Hæstad, one of Start's star players, {{stated that he}} would not continue to play for the club if artificial turf was laid. The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with artificial turf. In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality for the cost of building another artificial turf venue. The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year <b>naming</b> <b>rights</b> agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK35 million.

In February 2012, Kristiansand District Court sentenced Start to pay NOK6.4 million in value added tax on the <b>naming</b> <b>rights.</b> The club stated that they believed the <b>naming</b> <b>rights</b> were exempt. After the 2011 season, Start was again relegated to the First Division. In an attempt to better the club's financial situation, Start agreed to lay artificial turf on Sparebanken Sør Arena, in exchange for NOK250,000 in municipal funding to use the stadium for recreational sports. Removal of the natural pitch started on 28 May 2012.|$|E
