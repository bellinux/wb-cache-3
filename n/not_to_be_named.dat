5|$|Coltrane was the Simpsons fourth cat, {{adopted from}} an animal shelter {{shortly after the}} death of Snowball III. Lisa is not certain she wants another cat, but her other one has haunted her and Coltrane name wins her over due to its {{resemblance}} of jazz musician John Coltrane's name. Upon bringing Coltrane home, Lisa decides to play him some of John Coltrane music on her saxophone, but the noise frightens him and he commits suicide by jumping out the window. Coltrane was the Simpsons only cat since Snowball I to have been white, although {{he was the only one}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>named</b> Snowball. However, Lisa evidently considers him as part of the Snowball lineage, as she names her next cat Snowball V, implying that Coltrane was Snowball IV.|$|E
5|$|As the Canucks {{opened the}} 1992 playoffs against the Winnipeg Jets, Bure {{recorded}} his first NHL hat trick in game six to help force a seventh and deciding game. Vancouver won the series {{to advance to}} the second round, but were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers. Bure finished his first Stanley Cup playoffs with six goals and 10 points in 13 games. At the end of the season, he was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year. His 60 points were second among first-year players to Tony Amonte's 69 points with the Rangers, although Bure played in 14 fewer games. When accepting the award, Bure thanked Canucks linemate Igor Larionov for his guidance. On arriving in Vancouver, his former Red Army teammate took him into his home for two weeks before Bure moved into his own apartment; the two also roomed together on the road. Bure's Calder Trophy, along with head coach Pat Quinn's Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach, marked the first major individual NHL awards in Canucks' team history. However, despite being named the league's top rookie, Bure was left off the NHL All-Rookie Team, making him the only Calder recipient <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>named</b> to the lineup. This was because he split his time playing both left and right wing. When it came to voting for the players, Bure had the most total votes, but not enough at either position to claim a spot.|$|E

25|$|Port Vale {{is one of}} the few English league clubs <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>named</b> after a {{geographical}} location, their name being a reference to the valley of ports on the Trent and Mersey Canal. They were founder members of the Second Division in 1892 and of the Fourth Division in 1958. They have never played top-flight football, and hold the record for the most seasons in the English Football League without reaching the top tier (105). After playing at the Athletic Ground in Cobridge and The Old Recreation Ground in Hanley, the club returned to Burslem when Vale Park was opened in 1950. Outside the ground is a statue to Roy Sproson, who played 842 competitive games for the club.|$|E

[...] He blamed poverty on his reservation for his crimes later in life; he said that there were no jobs and he could only make a living on crime. [...] According to a family acquaintance, who asked <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>named,</b> at age 8 or 10 Red Dog tried to emulate the lifestyle of an older half-brother whom he admired, who as of 1993 was in a federal prison.

2500|$|The {{northern}} whiting {{was first}} described by Peter Forsskål in 1775 {{under the name}} [...] Atherina sihama, mistaking the fish as a species of hardyhead. The species was subsequently placed in the genus Platycephalus, before its true identity as a new genus was realized and Sillago was created in [...] 1816. This was the first description and naming of any smelt-whiting, even though the author initially placed the species in the wrong genus. This makes S. sihama the type species of its genus, Sillago, {{as well as the}} type species of the family Sillaginidae, which was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>named</b> until 1846. However, Forsskål's name {{was not the only one}} applied to the species, with three other names given to the fish after the first correct naming. Two of these, S. acuta and S. erythraea were made by Georges Cuvier, and the other, Sciaena malabarica by Bloch and Schneider. These later names are junior synonyms and are discarded under the ICZN rules.|$|E
