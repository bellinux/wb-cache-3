The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists.; <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction compared with other diagnoses (median 6. 7 vs. 5. 0 × 10 (9) /L, respectively, P >. 001). The accuracy of the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction, quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0. 69, which was significantly {{lower than that of}} cardiac troponin T (AUC 0. 89, P >. 001).

40|$|Objectives: Use of {{point-of-care testing}} is increasing, however many {{haematology}} analysers can only determine granulocyte count without further differentiation into neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Since {{the diagnosis of}} life-threatening neutropenia in cancer patients requires a distinct <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> this study aimed to determine the comparative performance between the <b>neutrophil</b> and granulocyte <b>count.</b> Design and methods: A database of 508 646 venous full blood count results measured on a laboratory reference analyser was mined from a large oncology unit. The relationship between granulocyte and <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> was assessed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to classify results into neutropenia grades using an equivalent granulocyte count. Results: Granulocyte to <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> correlation was 0. 997. The accuracy for classification into neutropenia grades using the derived equivalent granulocyte count ranges was 96. 4 %. Identification of results with a <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> < 1. 5 × 109 cells/L using an equivalent granulocyte count of < 1. 69 × 109 cells/L resulted in sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 98. 0 %, 99. 5 %, 97. 8 % and 99. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bone marrow {{suppression}} is a well-recognized {{toxicity of}} the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Reduction of the peginterferon dose because of neutropenia is common in clinical practice. However, reduction of peginterferon dose during the first weeks of HCV treatment is associated with failure to achieve sustained virological response. AIMS: The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate whether the fall of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> during hepatitis C treatment is associated with achieving sustained virological response. METHODS: We performed an observational study of patients who completed peginterferon and ribavirin treatment in an Infectious Diseases Department in Manchester, UK. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients included in the analysis, 78 % had genotype 2 or 3 hepatitis C and 15 % had liver cirrhosis. Sustained virological response was achieved in 78 % of patients. On univariate analysis, factors related to achieving sustained virological response were younger age, genotype 2 or 3, baseline <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> and fall of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> during treatment. Multivariate analysis showed baseline <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> > 3. 5 x 10 (3) cells/mm(3) [odds ratio (OR) 5. 7; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 24 - 26. 3] and a reduction of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> > 60 % (OR 4. 5; 95 % CI 1. 03 - 19. 9) to be independently associated with achieving sustained virological response. Neutropenia was not associated with an increased risk of infections. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, higher baseline <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and fall of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> during the treatment of hepatitis C was associated with achieving sustained virological response.

Materials and Methods: a group of 77 obese patients [32 males and 45 females] and 19 controls [7 males and 12 females] were studied. Total WBC count was performed by using an automatic blood cell counter. Blood cell morphology and WBC differential count were evaluated in Wright stained blood films. The plasma levels of CRP were evaluated by immunoturbidimetry. Results: obese participants presented with a statistically significant higher neutrophil percentage and CRP levels when compared to controls; the median CRP value was about 5 times higher than that observed in controls.

The triangular relationship among pre-seroconversion PBC counts, host genotypes, and risk of HIV acquisition was determined in a prospective cohort of black South African high-risk female sex workers. Twenty-seven women had seroconversion during follow-up, and 115 remained HIV negative for 2 years, despite engaging in high-risk activity. Results. Preseroconversion <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> in women who subsequently had seroconversion were significantly lower, whereas platelet counts were higher, compared with those who remained HIV negative.

Impaired bioavailability of L-arginine, {{the substrate}} for NO synthesis, {{is linked to}} sepsis severity, and plasma arginase {{has been linked to}} hypoargininemia in other disease states. Circulating neutrophils are increased in sepsis and constitutively express arginase. We investigated whether plasma arginase activity is increased in human sepsis and whether this is associated with neutrophil numbers and activation. Methods: We used HPLC and a radiometric assay to evaluate plasma amino acid concentrations and plasma arginase activity. The relationships between plasma arginase activity, <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> <b>neutrophil</b> activity and plasma L-arginine and arginine metabolites were evaluated in 44 sepsis patients and 25 controls. Results: Plasma arginase activity was increased in sepsis patients, correlated with <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (r= 0. 44; p= 0. 003), but was independent of sepsis severity (SOFA or APACHE II score). Plasma HNP 1 - 3 correlated with <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (r= 0. 31; p= 0. 04), was elevated in shock (median 180 ng/mL vs. 83 ng/mL sepsis without shock, p= 0. 0006) and correlated with SOFA score. Sepsis patients with high <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> had significantly higher plasma HNP 1 - 3 and arginase activity and lower plasma L-arginine concentrations than those with lower <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> and controls.

Design: Data on 156 HIV-infected and 1533 uninfected children in the European Collaborative Study followed from birth until at least 8 years of age. Methods: Smoothers and splines were used to elucidate patterns over age; linear mixed effects allowed for repeated measurements. Covariates included the child's HIV- 1 infection status, prematurity, gender, race, drug withdrawal symptoms at birth and ARV exposure; effects on <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> were quantified in regression analyses using z-scores (SD from mean) of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> obtained after modelling untransformed values using the LMS method. For HIV-infected children, progression to AIDS and ARV therapy were also included. Results: After approximately 4 months of age, <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> were consistently and substantially lower in HIV-infected children than in uninfected children; in both groups, black children had significantly lower counts than white children across the whole age range.

However, {{little is known about the}} involvement of acute inflammation. Objective: To evaluate whether circulating neutrophils, markers of acute inflammation, are associated (quantitatively and qualitatively) with adolescent obesity and whether leptin modulates these associations. Subjects and methods: We assessed 528 adolescents (16. 8 yr old, 47 % females), without chronic/acute illness. We measured anthropometry and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and calculated fat mass percentage (FM%). Fasting serum glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol, and triglycerides were used with blood pressure and waist circumference to compute a metabolic z-score. Leukocyte and <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> were obtained, together with levels of serum leptin. In a subsample of 23 males, flow cytometry was used to assess degranulation (CD 66 b expression) of neutrophils. Results: Female sex and obesity were positively related to mean <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> (p< 0. 05). When accounting for sex and weight status, leptin was associated with <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> (p< 0. 05), partially explaining the association between obesity and <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts.</b> <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> were related to metabolic risk z-scores, controlling for fat mass.
