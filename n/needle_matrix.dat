50|$|The first form of sewing was {{probably}} tying together animal skins using thorns and sharpened rocks as needles, with animal sinew or plant material as thread. The early limitation was {{the ability to}} produce a small enough hole in a <b>needle</b> <b>matrix</b> such as a bone sliver small enough not to damage the material: traces of this survive {{in the use of}} bodkins to make eyelet holes in fabric by separating rather than cutting the threads. A point that might be from a bone needle dates to 61,000 years ago and was discovered in Sibudu Cave, South Africa. A needle made from bird bone and attributed to non-humans, estimated to be around 50,000 years-old, was found in Denisova Cave. A bone needle, dated to the Aurignacian age (47000 to 41,000 years ago), was discovered in Potok Cave (Potoƒçka zijalka) in the Eastern Karavanke, Slovenia. Bone and ivory needles found in the Xiaogushan prehistoric site in Liaoning province date between 30,000 and 23,000 years old. Ivory needles were also found dated to 30,000 years ago at the Kostenki site in Russia. Flinders Petrie found copper needles at Naqada, ranging from 4400 BC to 3000 BC. Iron sewing needles were found at the Oppidum of Manching, dating to the third century BC.|$|E
