The results indicated that employing 1 g L(- 1) of reactive material for dechlorination in the monometallic form (both micro- and <b>nano-scale)</b> exhibited very little reduction capability compared with the bimetallic Ni/Fe <b>nano-scale</b> particles, containing 28. 9 % Ni (in molar), which achieved complete dechlorination of the TCE in solution within 576 h. Experiments were also performed to determine the optimum bimetallic composition of the Ni/Fe particles for TCE reduction. This revealed that 3. 2 % Ni was the optimum Ni/Fe molar ratio for both maximum dehalogenation performance and minimum release of Ni into solution. Using particles of the most effective bimetallic composition, experiments were carried out to determine the concentration required for optimal TCE reduction. Over the range of <b>nano-scale</b> particle concentrations tested (0. 1 - 9 g L(- 1)), reduction rates of TCE increased with greater TCE:nano-scale particle ratios. However, a concentration range of 1 - 3 g L(- 1) was selected as the most appropriate for site remediation, since more concentrated solutions demonstrated only small increases in rates of reaction. Finally, in order to test the long term performance and reactivity of the 3. 2 % Ni/Fe bimetallic <b>nano-scale</b> particles, weekly spikes of 350 mg L(- 1) TCE were injected into a 3 g L(- 1) <b>nano-scale</b> particle batch reactor.
