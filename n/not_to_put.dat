5|$|Brown {{explored}} coaching possibilities, {{but he was}} mindful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{himself in}} a position where his control might be challenged as it had been in Cleveland. In the mid-1960s, the American Football League (AFL), which had formed to compete against the NFL, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager. He was also given the right to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for Brown.|$|E
5|$|Louise and {{her sisters}} had another {{disagreement}} {{after the death of}} the Queen's close friend, Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill. Determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her mother through more misery, Louise wanted the news to be broken to the Queen gradually. When this was not done, Louise voiced her sharp criticism of Helena and Beatrice. One month later, on 22 January 1901, Queen Victoria died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. In her will, the Queen bequeathed Kent House, on the Osborne Estate, to Louise as a country residence, and gave Osborne Cottage to Louise's youngest sister, Beatrice. Louise and Beatrice were now neighbours both at Kensington Palace and Osborne.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, 1827, McKenney and Whistler's force {{arrived at}} the Portage. On September 3, two Ho-Chunk leaders, Waukon Decorah and Carymaunee, {{surrendered}} Red Bird and Wekau to the Americans. Carymaunee asked the Americans <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> irons on Red Bird and Wekau; this request was granted. He then offered to give the Americans twenty horses {{in exchange for the}} prisoners, but this was declined. The Ho-Chunks turned in four more men involved in the uprising in the following weeks.|$|E

5|$|Sarwar became interim leader {{following}} Lamont's resignation, {{and announced}} plans for the party to hold a leadership contest, with the winner to be announced on 13 December. Sarah Boyack became {{the first person to}} confirm that she would be standing as a candidate for party leader; she was subsequently joined by Neil Findlay and Jim Murphy. Katy Clark and Kezia Dugdale entered the deputy leadership race. Findlay was among those to call on former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to enter the contest, but he ruled out doing so. Other senior Labour figures who decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> their names forward included Sarwar, Jackie Baillie, and Jenny Marra.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{ordered his}} men not to harass {{the women on}} the train, but the guerrillas robbed all of the men, finding over $9,000 and taking the soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the {{captured}} Union soldiers to form a line and announced that he would keep one for a prisoner exchange, but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted of the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, the Liberals agreed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{candidates}} against Thomas Burt and Alexander Macdonald, two miners' {{leaders who}} were standing for Parliament.

While on the trip, DeLay promised <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the bill on the legislative calendar.|$|E
25|$|US {{retail price}} gas prices rose from a {{national}} average of 38.5cents in May 1973 to 55.1cents in June 1974. State governments requested citizens <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up Christmas lights. Oregon banned Christmas and commercial lighting altogether. Politicians called for a national gas rationing program. Nixon requested gasoline stations to voluntarily not sell gasoline on Saturday nights or Sundays; 90% of owners complied, which produced long queues.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of Hogwarts, the four founders {{hand-picked}} students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the most appropriate house. The student's own choices may affect the decision: the clearest example is the Hat telling Harry that he would do well in Slytherin in the first book, but ultimately selecting Gryffindor after Harry asks it <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him in Slytherin.|$|E
25|$|During {{the close}} Parliament of 1950–51, Lindsay played {{his part in}} harrying the Labour government. In November 1950 he won {{a spot in the}} ballot for Private Member's Bills and {{introduced}} a freedom of information Bill to give the press a statutory right to report the proceedings of public bodies. Lindsay's Bill ran out of time; he also supported the bill, that became statute, introduced by Labour MP Eirene White reforming the divorce laws. Early in 1951 he called on Belgium <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> General von Falkenhausen, the former German military governor, on trial for war crimes. Lindsay argued that Belgium had the least oppressive occupation of any nation.|$|E
25|$|In the aftermath, the {{handling}} of the incident was widely criticized by fans and media. While the sanctioning body was commended by many for choosing <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> its drivers in danger the race was largely viewed as a debacle, a low point for the slumping series, and very damaging to the organization in the months and years to come. CART reported that it spent $3.5 million for the settlement and legal costs, resulting in a $1.7 million loss for the third quarter of 2001. CART declared bankruptcy and was sold in 2003, became known as Champ Car, and never attempted to return to Texas Motor Speedway. Ultimately it was absorbed into the Indy Racing League in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{production}} on the second season, Poehler became pregnant again and the producers of the show were forced to go into production on season three early and film an additional six episodes to accommodate not only Poehler's pregnancy, but also a projected September 2010 air date. After the episodes were already filmed, NBC opted <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the show on the fall schedule and instead delayed the premiere of the third season {{until the beginning of}} 2011. This allowed for the network to run its new comedy, Outsourced, in two-hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation. The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season were filmed before any of them were shown; the rest of the episodes, starting with the seventh, were filmed in the fall of 2010. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. The move proved frustrating for the cast and crew of Parks and Recreation, although Poehler also pointed out it gave them additional time to go back and re-edit episodes or shoot and add new material.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{originally}} planned a voice-over {{to reveal that}} the satellites seen after the prologue are nuclear weapons, and that the Star Child would detonate the weapons {{at the end of}} the film. However, he decided this would create associations with his previous film Dr. Strangelove, and decided not to make it so obvious that they were [...] "war machines". A few weeks before the release of the film, the U.S. and Soviet governments had agreed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> any nuclear weapons into outer space.|$|E
500|$|For Joe 90s {{original}} run, in {{some regions}} {{the end of the}} title sequence incorporated a zoom-in shot of Joe's WIN glasses accompanied by a voice-over provided by actor Tim Turner, stating, [...] "These are Joe 90's special glasses. Without them, he's a boy. Wearing them, he's an expert." [...] This short speech, intended to warn child viewers <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> themselves at risk by imitating Joe's exploits, has been erroneously attributed to Keith Alexander on the Joe 90 Region 2 DVD box set, on which it is a special feature.|$|E

500|$|Bush {{embarked}} on a 60-day national tour, campaigning for his initiative in media events known as [...] "Conversations on Social Security", {{in an attempt to}} gain public support. Nevertheless, public support for the proposal declined and the House Republican leadership decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda. The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from Hurricane Katrina. After the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress {{as a result of the}} 2006 midterm elections, there was no prospect of further congressional action on the Bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office.|$|E
500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, you do your best <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Wintour {{began making}} more media appearances. On a 60 Minutes profile, {{she said she}} would not retire. [...] "To me this is a really {{interesting}} time to be in this position and I think it would be in a way irresponsible <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my best foot forward and lead us into a different time." [...] In September, The September Issue, a documentary film by The War Room producer R.J. Cutler about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington. She appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote it, defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy. The American Society of Magazine Editors elected her to its Hall of Fame in 2010.|$|E
