5|$|Bootham Crescent {{hosted a}} war-time {{representative}} match {{in which the}} Football League XI beat the Northern Command XI 9–2 on 17 October 1942, before a 5,500 crowd. It held a university representative match on 17 February 1976, when a FA XI drew 2–2 with the Universities Athletic Union; the FA XI included former England internationals and 1966 World Cup winners Bobby Charlton and <b>Nobby</b> Stiles. The ground hosted its first major neutral match on 7 February 1968, when Middlesbrough beat Hull City 1–0 in an FA Cup third-round second replay, {{in front of a}} crowd of 16,524. During 2012–13, Bootham Crescent held one fixture apiece for Harrogate Town and Gateshead, as the pitches at their grounds were unplayable. The ground hosted the 2013 FA Women's Premier League Cup Final on 5 May 2013, when Aston Villa beat Leeds United 5–4 on penalties after a 0–0 extra time draw.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey dropped Alan Ball and John Connelly {{and brought}} in Terry Paine and Martin Peters, whose {{advanced}} style of play as a midfielder matched the qualities Ramsey looked for in his system. England beat Mexico 2–0. Ramsey replaced Terry Paine with Ian Callaghan for their final group match, against France. England won 2–0, securing qualification to the knockout rounds. Two difficult situations arose from the final group match, however. After making a vicious tackle and being cautioned, midfielder <b>Nobby</b> Stiles came under fire from senior FIFA officials, who called for Ramsey to drop him from the side. Ramsey strongly disagreed, and told the FA to inform FIFA that either Stiles would remain in his team or Ramsey himself would resign. Another bad tackle was committed during that match, resulting in Tottenham striker (and one of England's most prolific goal-scorers) Jimmy Greaves being injured and sidelined {{for the next few}} matches. Despite having more experienced strikers in his squad, Ramsey selected young Geoff Hurst as Greaves's replacement, once again seeing potential in the young West Ham forward. The France match also marked Ramsey's final game with a winger. After it, he dropped Ian Callaghan from his side and brought back Alan Ball to strengthen the midfield.|$|E
5|$|England won the Test series 2–0. Jardine contributed three fifties in four {{innings in}} the series, scoring 221 runs {{at an average}} of 73.66. He scored 60, 61 and 65 before his final Test innings ended at 35 not out. Jardine scored 831 {{first-class}} runs on the Indian leg of the tour—he played one match in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)—averaging 55.40. Although Jardine enjoyed the tour, there were still clashes evident. There was an argument with the Viceroy over Jardine selecting the Maharaja of Patiala to play for the M.C.C. in one match; in a subsequent match, Jardine complained that the pitch was rolled for too long. He also clashed, later on, with the umpire Frank Tarrant, initially due to suspicion over the number of lbw decisions given against the M.C.C., but also because Tarrant had warned him against using Bodyline and was employed by Indian princes. Jardine threatened to stop him umpiring and sent a telegram to Lord's, with the result that Tarrant, having officiated the first two Tests, was not used in the third. For much of the time, Jardine used different tactics to those employed in Australia. Slow bowling, particularly that of Hedley Verity, played a key part in the bowling attack. At times, the faster bowlers <b>Nobby</b> Clark and Stan Nichols bowled Bodyline, resulting in several injuries. In this case, the Indian bowlers Mohammad Nissar and Amar Singh retaliated with Bodyline bowling of their own.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nobby's</b> Breakwater was {{originally}} {{built in the}} first half of the 19th century to protect ships entering Newcastle Harbour. After the breakwater was completed <b>Nobby's</b> Beach formed against it and over the reefs around <b>Nobby's</b> headland. It is on these reefs where Pasha Bulker came to grief.|$|R
50|$|Newcastle East {{is home to}} two of Newcastle's beaches, <b>Nobbys</b> Beach and Newcastle Beach, both {{of which}} have surf lifesaving clubs and are patrolled by lifesavers. In June 2007, the bulk carrier MV Pasha Bulker {{grounded}} itself off <b>Nobbys</b> Beach in a storm. Between Newcastle and <b>Nobbys</b> beaches lie the Newcastle Ocean Baths.|$|R

25|$|The <b>nobby</b> is an inshore {{sailing boat}} {{which was used}} as a {{traditional}} fishing boat around Lancashire and the Isle of Man. The Lancashire <b>nobby</b> originated in Morecambe Bay about 1840 and around Southport. It subsequently came into widespread use down the north west coast of England. The Manx <b>nobby</b> first appeared in the 1880s and was used around the Isle of Man. Many localities on the coast of Great Britain developed their own type of fishing boat adapted to local fishing and sea conditions, and the nobbies are examples of this.|$|E
25|$|The Manx <b>Nobby</b> {{is similar}} to the cornish luggers.|$|E
25|$|Kenny's {{funeral was}} held on 1 December 1952 at the Neil Street Methodist Church in Toowoomba. The funeral was {{recorded}} for transmission {{in other parts of}} Australia and in the United States of America. The funeral cortege from the church to <b>Nobby</b> Cemetery was one of the largest seen in Toowoomba. Kenny was buried beside her mother in <b>Nobby</b> Cemetery.|$|E
40|$|Whibayganba, or <b>Nobbys</b> Headland, {{stands as}} a {{sentinel}} {{at the entrance of}} Newcastle Harbour, a symbol {{of the city and the}} site of its first environmental campaign. In the early 1850 s, the government of NSW proposed significantly reducing the height of <b>Nobbys</b> Headland, with the intention of making navigating the harbour mouth less treacherous. Residents of the area had developed a special affinity with <b>Nobbys</b> and many rallied to save it from destruction. They were successful and <b>Nobbys</b> survived, albeit with the significant reduction in height. While this campaign is largely forgotten, it can be seen as the first in a series of environmental actions in Newcastle...|$|R
50|$|<b>Nobbys</b> Head {{was thought}} to have been {{originally}} 62 m high, however work done by the Coal River Working Party in 2010 has concluded that the original height was more likely 43 m high. It was reduced to its current 27.5 m height because sailing ships were losing wind in the sails as they rounded <b>Nobbys</b> Head. The rock taken from <b>Nobbys</b> to reduce its height was used in the pier's construction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nobbys</b> Head Light is {{an active}} {{lighthouse}} on <b>Nobbys</b> Head, a headland {{on the south side}} of the entrance to Newcastle Harbour, New South Wales, Australia. An image of the lighthouse is included in the Coat of Arms of the City of Newcastle.|$|R

25|$|The type {{was adopted}} by {{fishermen}} from the Solway down to Cardigan Bay, and hundreds of nobbies were built. The demand for boats was driven by the English taste for shrimps, which in its turn was driven by the English sea side holiday trade, which came to prominence with the railways in the 1850s. There was no standard design of <b>nobby,</b> alterations were made to suit {{the ideas of the}} original owners. Three racing classes, the Royal Mersey Restricted class, the Royal Mersey Rivers class and the Fleetwood Jewel Class, were built on <b>nobby</b> lines by various local boat builders. The difference between these was that the Royal Mersey Restricted class and the Fleetwood Jewels Class were cutter rigged same as a <b>Nobby</b> and the Royal Mersey Rivers Class had a single headsail.|$|E

25|$|Although {{fishing vessel}} {{designed}} increasingly began to converge around the world, local conditions still often led {{the development of}} different types of fishing boats. The Lancashire <b>nobby</b> was used down the north west coast of England as a shrimp trawler from 1840 until World War II. The Manx <b>nobby</b> was used around the Isle of Man as a herring drifter. The fifie was also used as a herring drifter along the east coast of Scotland from the 1850s until well into the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Fort Scratchley is {{situated}} atop Flagstaff Hill, overlooking the Tasman Sea and the Hunter River, less than 1 km from the Newcastle central business district. It is accessed from <b>Nobbys</b> Road, and is directly between Newcastle and <b>Nobbys</b> beaches. Originally {{built as a}} coastal defence fort, it {{is located in a}} commanding position, guarding the Hunter River estuary.|$|R
50|$|Originally called Coal Island, {{and then}} later <b>Nobbys</b> Island, the Island was {{connected}} to the mainland at first by the Macquarie Pier, completed in 1846, 38 years after commencement. The pier was eventually replaced by a breakwater. Sand accumulate along the breakwall to make <b>Nobby's</b> beach, and the sand and plants makes the isthmus appear natural.|$|R

25|$|Throughout history, local {{conditions}} {{have led to}} the development of a wide range of types of fishing boats. The Lancashire <b>nobby</b> was used down the north west coast of England as a shrimp trawler from 1840 until World War II. The bawley and the smack were used in the Thames Estuary and off East Anglia, while trawlers and drifters were use on the east coast. Herring fishing started in the Moray Firth in 1819. The Manx <b>nobby</b> was used as a herring drifter around the Isle of Man, and fifies were used as herring drifters along the east coast of Scotland from the 1850s until well into the 20th century.|$|E
