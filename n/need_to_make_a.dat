5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land {{a short distance from}} the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

25|$|The Luftwaffe did {{end up with}} an {{air force}} {{consisting}} mainly of relatively short-range aircraft, {{but this does not}} prove that the German air force was solely interested in ’tactical’ bombing. It happened because the German aircraft industry lacked the experience to build a long-range bomber fleet quickly, and because Hitler was insistent on the very rapid creation of a numerically large force. It is also significant that Germany's position in the centre of Europe to a large extent obviated the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> clear distinction between bombers suitable only for ’tactical’ and those necessary for strategic purposes {{in the early stages of}} a likely future war.|$|E

25|$|Benetton {{finally won}} its first Grand Prix in Mexico, the {{penultimate}} {{race of the}} season.

It was generally agreed that the victory was a fitting culmination to Benetton's first season as an F1 constructor, Berger's emerging talent in what was the first of 10 career wins, and a vindication of the potential of the B186. The race would also prove to be the last win for the BMW M12 engine.|$|E

Although Ismail had wanted to [...] "not consider commercial aspects" [...] of filmmaking when he established Perfini in 1950, {{he was forced to}} recognise the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profitable film as Perfini continued to lose money. Following the failures of Lagi-Lagi Krisis (More Crises, 1955) and Tamu Agung (Exalted Guest, 1955), the company's financial situation was bleak, and Ismail fired a number of his staff. With only some leftover government credit to finance his next production, Ismail collaborated with M. Alwi Dahlan to write a film which would be popular with audiences. The resulting story, which may have been inspired by the 1936 musical comedy Three Smart Girls, was Tiga Dara.|$|E

[...] Dele Fadele of NME also praised the open-ended nature of the album, but criticized the instrumental [...] "Spec Bebop" [...] for being [...] "constructed around some hurtful feedback, to end up as an endurance test." [...] In a very positive review, Jason Josephes of Pitchfork praised the album for exploring new directions, commenting that the band takes its [...] "sonic inventions to new levels." ...|$|E

[...] He would go on to withdraw from Roland Garros later, citing a back injury. After a four-week break due to injury, Murray made his comeback at the 2013 Aegon Championships, where he was the top seed. After a rain delayed first day, Murray had to complete his second round match against Nicolas Mahut, and his subsequent match against Marinko Matosevic on the same day, both of which he won in straight sets. After beating Benjamin Becker in the quarterfinals, Murray next faced his first top ten opponent since losing to Tomáš Berdych in Madrid, taking on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals. After dropping the first set against the Frenchman, Murray eventually raised his level and won in three to set up a final against Marin Čilić of Croatia, his third consecutive final on grass courts. He came from behind again to beat Čilić in three sets to claim his third title at Queen's Club.|$|E
