25|$|According to Microsoft, Direct3D 10 {{will be able}} {{to display}} some {{graphics}} up to 8 times faster than DirectX 9.0c because of the new improved Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM). In addition, Direct3D 10 incorporates Microsoft's high-level shader language 4.0. However, Direct3D 10 is not backward compatible like prior versions of DirectX. The same game will not be compatible with both Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 9 or below. Games would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> for both APIs, one version for Direct3D 9 and below if targeting Windows versions prior to Windows Vista and another version using Direct3D 10 if targeting only Windows Vista. Windows Vista does, however, contain a backward compatible Direct3D 9 implementation.|$|E
25|$|The {{valuable}} long-range sliders {{have to be}} {{shielded from}} attack by the enemy's much less-valuable steppers by operating from behind your own steppers, or they would get quickly lost through fork attacks. As the steppers start on the back rank, they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> before you can engage the opponent. This is usually done by pushing the Pawns one rank forward, creating a passage through the 3rd rank by moving {{up some of the}} sliders there, and walk Copper, Silver and Leopard to the 4th rank and beyond through the resulting corridor. One of the Side Movers is usually moved up to 4th rank, so that when your own camp empties as a result of launching your attack, the Side Movers prevent entry of the enemy Lion by controlling 3rd and 4th rank.|$|E

25|$|At {{this moment}} most prisons in Tonga still abide {{with the old}} laissez-faire attitude. Usually having no fences, no iron bars and so forth, that makes it very easy for the inmates to escape. This system may be {{required}} to change, adapting for the influx of foreign born/raised criminals who may treat such a system with contempt, alternatively a minimum/maximum security prison system may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> placing escapists or repeat offenders into closed prisons, but for the moment the jailors can trust on the goodwill of the inmates. Some are glad to be in prison, not to be bothered by demanding family members. There is no social stigma on being in prison (although that may change now too), but then of course it also does not serve as a deterrent against crimes.|$|E
500|$|In January 2015, USAF {{officials}} told lawmakers {{that it would}} take 15 years to fully develop a new attack aircraft to replace the A-10; that year General Herbert J. Carlisle, the head of Air Combat Command, stated that a follow-on weapon system for the A-10 may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed.</b> It planned for F-16s and F-15Es to initially take up CAS sorties, and later by the F-35A once sufficient numbers become operationally available over the next decade. [...] In July 2015, Boeing held initial discussions on the prospects of selling retired or stored A-10s in near-flyaway condition to international customers. However, the Air Force then said that it would not permit the aircraft to be sold.|$|E
500|$|Several {{obstacles}} {{have been}} {{encountered in the}} development of astatine-based radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment. World War II delayed research for close to a decade. Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer-selective carrier would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> and {{it was not until the}} 1970s that monoclonal antibodies became available for this purpose. Unlike iodine, astatine shows a tendency to dehalogenate from molecular carriers such as these, particularly at sp3 carbon sites (less so from sp2 sites). Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body, this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its host molecule. While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy, more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine. Mitigating the effects of astatine-induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development. A practical application for astatine as a cancer treatment would potentially be suitable for a [...] "staggering" [...] number of patients; production of astatine in the quantities that would be required remains an issue.|$|E

500|$|Carme Juncadella {{produced}} a systematic review of research as of 2013 {{related to the}} impact of NVC on the development of empathy. She found 13 studies which met her inclusion criteria (three were published in peer reviewed journals; ten were unpublished theses or researcher reports). Eleven of these suggested an increase in empathy subsequent to the application of NVC (five of these with evidence of statistical significance) and two did not. Juncadella notes several shortcomings of her review. None of the studies she included were randomized and only three used validated instruments. As a result she used a narrative synthesis review format, which, [...] "lacks precision," [...] but allows the summarization of studies of different types, sizes, outcome measures and aims. She suggests the primary limitation of her review is that a number of relevant studies exist that could not be included due to lack of availability. She suggests these might have significantly altered her results. Finally, she includes the following caveat: [...] "I must mention the inevitable subjectivity bias present throughout the whole review. In spite of the efforts made towards 'disciplined subjectivity'... my decisions show a degree of uncertainty and inaccuracy born via the tension between the weak evidence of the studies and my own convictions about the NVC model." [...] Her overall assessment of the current research on NVC's efficacy in promoting the development of empathy is that the results are promising, but [...] "would need to be confirmed with further studies bearing stronger designs and more appropriate measures." [...] She notes that a major shortcoming of the existing research is the [...] "mismatch between the constructs of the model and the validated empathy measures" [...] and suggests that improved instruments <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> to adequately test NVC.|$|E

2500|$|The Garnaut Climate Change Review notes many {{barriers}} to increased global biosequestration. [...] "There must be {{changes in the}} accounting regimes for greenhouse gases. Investments are required in research, development and commercialisation of superior approaches to biosequestration. Adjustments are required in the regulation of land use. New institutions will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> to coordinate the interests in utilisation of biosequestration opportunities across small business in rural communities. Special efforts {{will be required to}} unlock potential in rural communities in developing countries." [...] Saddler and King have argued that biosequestration and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions should not be handled within a global emissions trading scheme because of difficulties with measuring such emissions, problems in controlling them and the burden that would be placed on numerous small-scale farming operations. Collett likewise maintains that REDD credits (post-facto payments to developing countries for reducing their deforestation rates below an historical or projected reference rate), simply create a complex market approach to this global public health problem that reduces transparency and accountability when targets are not met and will not be as effective as developed nations voluntarily funding countries to keep their rainforests.|$|E
