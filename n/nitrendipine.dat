50|$|<b>Nitrendipine</b> has {{additionally}} {{been found}} {{to act as an}} antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>nitrendipine</b> is ingested, it {{is absorbed}} by the gut and metabolized by the liver before it goes into the {{systemic}} circulation and reaches {{the cells of the}} smooth muscles and cardiac muscle cells. It binds more effectively with L-type calcium channels in smooth muscle cells because of its lower resting membrane potential. The <b>nitrendipine</b> diffuses into the membrane and binds to its high affinity binding site on the inactivated L-type calcium channel that's located in between each of the 4 intermembrane components of the α1 subunit. The exact mechanism of action of <b>nitrendipine</b> is unknown, but it is believed to have important tyrosine and threonine residues in its binding pocket and its binding interferes with the voltage sensor and gating mechanism of the channel. Thought to have a domain-interface model of binding. In hypertension, the binding of <b>nitrendipine</b> causes a decrease in the probability of open L-type calcium channels and reduces the influx of calcium. The reduced levels of calcium prevent smooth muscle contraction within these muscle cells. Prevention of muscle contraction enables smooth muscle dilation. Dilation of the vasculature reduces total peripheral resistance, which decreases the workload on the heart and prevents scarring of the heart or heart failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitrendipine</b> is a {{dihydropyridine}} {{calcium channel}} blocker. It {{is used in}} the treatment of primary (essential) hypertension to decrease blood pressure and can reduce the cardiotoxicity of cocaine.|$|E
50|$|Drugs can be {{formulated}} as HBS floating microsphere.

50|$|<b>Nitrendipine</b> {{is given}} to {{hypertensive}} individuals in 20 mg oral tablets every day. This amount is effective in reducing blood pressure by 15-20% within 1-2 hours of administration. With long-term treatments, the dosage may rise {{to as much as}} 40 mg/day; in elderly individuals, a lower dosage of up to 5 mg/day may be equally effective (this reduction in drug amount is attributed to decreased liver function or “first pass” metabolism). Once digested, <b>nitrendipine</b> is absorbed into the blood and binds to plasma proteins. The majority (98%) is bound to plasma proteins and 70-80% of its inactive polar metabolites are also bound to plasma proteins. Following hepatic metabolism, 80% of the 20 mg dose can be recovered in the first 96 hours as inactive polar metabolites. The specific volume of distribution of the drug is 2-6 L/kg. In terms of drug half-life, <b>nitrendipine</b> has a half-life of 12-24 hours. The reported side effects include: headache, flushing, edema and palpitations. These side effects can all be attributed to thevasodilation effect of this drug.|$|E

The recumbent and standing blood pressures were reduced (P less than 0. 01 or less) during monotherapy with <b>nitrendipine</b> and acebutolol, but {{the magnitude of}} blood pressure reduction was greater (P less than 0. 05 or less) during <b>nitrendipine</b> dosing. Pulse rate decreased (P less than 0. 01) during acebutolol whereas <b>nitrendipine</b> induced a nonsignificant increase. Both treatments induced no changes in serum electrolytes, creatinine, urea, uric acid, lipids, plasma renin activity, and plasma and urinary aldosterone. The overall incidence of side effects was similar with both treatments but four patients discontinued <b>nitrendipine</b> because of headache. The addition of mefruside to <b>nitrendipine</b> or acebutolol produced a further fall of blood pressure in patients not controlled with monotherapy.

40|$|We found {{previously}} that calcium entry blockade with <b>nitrendipine</b> {{enhanced the}} natriuretic effect of high-dose {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP). It is unknown whether <b>nitrendipine</b> also influences the effect of physiological changes in ANP. We therefore studied the effect of <b>nitrendipine</b> on cumulative sodium balance during changes in sodium intake {{as well as on}} natriuresis after low-dosage ANP infusion during low and high sodium (LS and HS, respectively) intake. In eight healthy volunteers, sodium balance was recorded after the switch from LS (20 mmol/day) to HS (300 mmol/day) diet. Cumulative sodium balance was equal with (441 +/- 45 mmol) or without (458 +/- 45 mmol) <b>nitrendipine</b> treatment. The body weight curves were also fully congruent. ANP (0. 005 micrograms/kg/min for 3 h) was administered during maximal water diuresis on both sodium intake levels with and without <b>nitrendipine.</b> Infusion of ANP increased sodium excretion (mumol/min) from 30 +/- 7 to 81 +/- 12 (LS) and from 316 +/- 27 to 469 +/- 46 (HS). During <b>nitrendipine,</b> similar increments (from 36 +/- 7 to 98 +/- 24 mumol/min, HS) were found. ANP had no effect on inulin clearance and fractional excretion of lithium, but consistently depressed diluting segment reabsorption. This pattern was also similar during <b>nitrendipine.</b> Apparently, under the conditions of this study in normal subjects, <b>nitrendipine</b> has no effect on sodium balance.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{effects of}} the calcium entry blocker <b>nitrendipine</b> on blood {{pressure}} (BP) and renal hemodynamics were studied in rats with angiotensin II (ANG II) -induced hypertension. The ANG II was infused subcutaneously by implanted osmotic minipumps for 14 to 16 days. There was a progres-sive rise in BP in ANG H-infused rats to levels 58 mm Hg above basal by Day 10, whereas control rats with sham pumps remained normotensive. <b>Nitrendipine</b> or vehicle was administered by gavage to groups of control and hypertensive rats for 5 days, and clearance experiments were performed with the rats under anesthesia on the last day. The prolonged infusion of ANG II increased the renal vascular resistance and reduced the glomerular filtration rate and renal Na + excretion. At a dose of 3 mg/ 100 g body weight, <b>nitrendipine</b> had no consistent effects on BP or renal function of control rats. By contrast, in rats with ANG II-induced hypertension, <b>nitrendipine</b> normalized both the BP and the changes in renal vascular resistance and glomerular filtration rate. Despite the fall in BP, <b>nitrendipine</b> caused a marked diuresis and natriuresis. Moreover, <b>nitrendipine</b> increased Na+ excretion of con-scious, ANG H-hypertensive rats but not of controls. Thus, <b>nitrendipine</b> appears to be highly effective in reversing ANG II-induced hypertension and Na+ retention. These findings also indicate that the hypertension, renal vasoconstriction, and Na+ retention accompanying prolonged ANG II infusion...|$|E

Atenolol and <b>nitrendipine</b> significantly reduced blood pressure (P less than 0. 05 or less). However, {{the magnitude of}} the decrease in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and in standing diastolic pressure was more pronounced (P less than 0. 05 or less) in the <b>nitrendipine</b> than in the atenolol group. Neither of the drugs significantly affected the erythrocyte sodium and potassium concentrations or the ouabain-sensitive efflux of sodium. In multiple regression analysis the changes in supine SBP and DBP with <b>nitrendipine</b> were independently and negatively correlated with the patients' age and initial blood pressure, and positively with the change in supine pulse rate; the change in supine SBP was also negatively correlated with initial erythrocyte sodium concentration.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} indicating that neuronal calcium channels {{play an important}} role in the mechanism of morphine dependence. In this study, the effects of acute and chronic administration of <b>nitrendipine</b> on naloxone precipitated morphine withdrawal signs wereinvestigated. Mice were rendered dependent to morphine by subcutaneous injection of morphine over a period of 5 days. In chronic studies, <b>nitrendipine</b> (25 and 50 mg/kg, i. p.), or vehicle injections were given once a day during the morphine treatment, and the last injection of <b>nitrendipine</b> was given 24 h before the morphine withdrawal. For acute studies, nitrendipine(25 and 50 mg/kg, i. p.) was given 1 h after the last dose of morphine (1 h before naloxone). A single injection of <b>nitrendipine</b> at 25 mg/kg was ineffective in blocking most signs of morphinewithdrawal, however, at 50 mg/kg <b>nitrendipine</b> blocked signs such as hair raising, sniffing, diarrhea and number of jumping.

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} effects of a calcium {{antagonist}} (<b>nitrendipine)</b> and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) with those of placebo on left ventricular mass in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension, Design A double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Setting General practitioners referred patients to the trial physician. Patients The study population comprised 121 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, inclusion criteria for blood pressure were diastolic blood pressure 90 - 115 mmHg and systolic blood pressure {{less than or equal to}} 200 mmHg, while subjects were not being administered blood-pressure-lowering drugs for 3 weeks. Intervention Patients were randomly allocated to receive <b>nitrendipine</b> (n = 40), enalapril (n = 40) or placebo (n = 41), The treatment period was 48 weeks. Main outcome measures The effect of <b>nitrendipine</b> was defined as the difference in change in left ventricular mass index from baseline between <b>nitrendipine</b> treatment and placebo after 48 weeks of treatment, The effects of <b>nitrendipine</b> compared with that of enalapril and of enalapril compared with placebo were defined similarly. Left ventricular mass was measured by M-mode echocardiography. Results Use of <b>nitrendipine</b> and enalapril led to significant and almost identical reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. During 48 weeks left ventricular mass index decreased by 5 % for patients in the <b>nitrendipine</b> group (decrease by 12 g/m(2), 95 % confidence interval 1 - 23), remained about the same for patients in the enalapril group (decrease by 1 g/m(2), 95 % confidence interval decrease by 10 to increase by 9) and increased by 9 % for patients in the placebo group (increase by 9 g/m(2), 95 % confidence interval 2 - 16), Conclusion These results indicate that administration of <b>nitrendipine</b> to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension reduces left ventricular mass index. Enalapril appears not to induce regression, but perhaps prevents progression with an effect that is intermediate between those of <b>nitrendipine</b> and placebo.

40|$|Six point {{concentration-response}} curves {{were established}} for the contractile effect of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) on helically-cut strips of human chorionic plate arteries. Tissues were then allocated to one of four treatment groups: a control group and 3 groups exposed to the calcium channel blocker <b>nitrendipine</b> at 10 (- 9), 10 (- 7) or 10 (- 5) M. The concentration-response curves were then repeated. The addition of <b>nitrendipine</b> {{was associated with a}} significant depression of the induced contraction. The contractile response to the lower doses of PGE 2 was replaced by a small relaxation in 63 % of the treated tissues. It is suggested that in these tissues PGE 2 exerts its constrictor effect via the receptor-operated channels and that <b>nitrendipine</b> is blocking this effect. Similar experiments performed with PGE 1 showed great variability in the initial response. <b>Nitrendipine</b> 10 (- 5) M failed to exert any detectable effect on this response.

In the present study the acute and long-term hypotensive effects of <b>nitrendipine</b> have been evaluated in comparison with those of atenolol in a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. Twenty-four patients have been studied, and the effects of treatment have been evaluated both at rest and during psychological and physiological stresses. Hemodynamic noninvasive parameters have also been obtained, at rest and during mental arithmetic tests, by a continuous-wave Doppler technique.

40|$|The {{morbidity}} and mortality after stroke — eprosartan compared with <b>nitrendipine</b> for secondary prevention (MOSES) trial compared the effects of two antihypertensive agents in secondary prevention of stroke. The hypothesis of the trial was that in hypertensive stroke patients, for {{the same level of}} blood pressure (BP) control, eprosartan would be more effective than <b>nitrendipine</b> in reducing cerebrovascular and cardiovascular {{morbidity and}} mortality. A total of 710 patients were assigned to an eprosartan-based regimen and 695 to a nitrendipine-based regimen. These patients had hypertension requiring treatment and documented cerebral ischaemia or haemorrhage. They were well matched at baseline in general characteristics, BP and concomitant disease. BP was lowered to the same extent in both treatment arms, with a very similar timeframe. A high proportion of patients in both treatment arms achieved target BP. The combined primary endpoint was a composite of total mortality and total number of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including recurrent events. There were 206 endpoints in the eprosartan group and 255 endpoints in the <b>nitrendipine</b> group. This represents a statistically significant 21 % risk reduction in favour of eprosartan. Eprosartan also had advantages over <b>nitrendipine</b> in respect of all cerebrovascular events and first cardiovascular events...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} the acute effects of captopril and <b>nitrendipine</b> on renal function and sodium excretion in hyper-tensive, male, heterozygous transgenic rats harboring a mouse renin gene [TGR(mRen- 2) 27]. Both drugs reduced blood pressure dose dependently in conscious transgenic rats. The oral ED 20 for captopril was 0. 5 mg/kg and 2. 7 mg/kg for <b>nitrendipine.</b> In orally salt-loaded (20 mL/kg saline) transgenic rats captopril (0. 3 to 3. 0 mg/kg) reduced sodium excretion by approximately 90 % in the 6 hours after administration, whereas equally antihypertensive dsses of <b>nitrendipine</b> in-creased sodium excretion by approximately 100 %. The antina-triuretic effect of captopril {{was accompanied by}} a reduction in creatinine clearance and a decrease in the excretion of cyclic GMP. In orally water-loaded (20 mL/kg water) transgenic rats captopril also reduced sodium excretion by more than 90 %...|$|E
40|$|Barium {{chloride}} contracted tracheas and bronchi {{from young}} and old guinea pigs and was equipotent in all tissues. Efficacies were significantly greater in tracheal vs. bronchial tissues within and between age groups. The effects of <b>nitrendipine</b> and vera-pamil were compietely reversibie with washing in tissues from young animals; in tissues from old animals {{the effects of the}} antagonists were irreversible. <b>Nitrendipine</b> (1 0, 50 and 1 00 nM) reduced the efficacy of barium chloride in tissues from old animals from 0 to 70 %, depending upon the tissue source and the concentration of calcium channel blocker used. Verapamil (1. -i 0 M) reduced the contractile response of tracheal tissues from old animals to barium by 50 % at the maximally effective concentration of the agonist. In contrast, in tissues from young animals, <b>nitrendipine</b> (50 -i 00 nM) totally abolished the respons...|$|E
40|$|Various Ca-channel {{blockers}} {{differ in}} cardiovascular action despite common effects at the Ca channel. Many investigators have reported {{only a single}} high-affinity receptor for binding of [3 H]nitrendipine, a dihydropyridine Ca-channel blocker. Its equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) does not match the concentration of <b>nitrendipine</b> needed for a physiological effect on the mammalian cardiac Ca channel. The purpose of these studies was to clarify the existing discrepancy between pharmacological properties of <b>nitrendipine</b> receptors and the physiological effects of the dihydropyridine blockers. Of particular importance in this regard {{was to provide a}} pharmacological correlate for electrophysiological studies demonstrating multiple voltage-dependent conformational states of the Ca channel, which show differing affinities for the dihydropyridine Ca-channel blockers. By use of an improved ligand binding assay, our studies demonstrate both "high-affinity" and "low-affinity" [3 H]nitrendipine receptors with Kd values corresponding well with observed physiologically effective <b>nitrendipine</b> concentrations. We detected two distinct populations of <b>nitrendipine</b> receptors in rat heart and bovine aortic membrane. A high-affinity Kd value of 0. 2 - 0. 3 nM was found, which seems to correspond to the physiologically functional state of the Ca channel in smooth muscle, since the Kd value is similar to the concentration at which <b>nitrendipine</b> inhibits contraction. However, in contrast to numerous other studies, we observed that the predominant component of [3 H]nitrendipine binding (95 - 99 %) had a low-affinity Kd value (235 nM). This putative low-affinity [3 H]nitrendipine receptor may correspond to the physiologically functional state of the Ca channel in cardiac muscle...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{transport systems}} for tri-iodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) {{in the human}} choriocarcinoma cell line, JAR, using a range of structurally similar com-pounds to determine whether these thyroid hormones are transported by common or different mechanisms. Saturable T 3 but not saturable T 4 uptake was inhibited by {{a wide range of}} aromatic compounds (<b>nitrendipine,</b> nifedipine, verapamil, meclofenamic acid, mefenamic acid, diazepam, phenytoin). <b>Nitrendipine</b> and diazepam were the most effective inhibitors of saturable thyroid hormone uptake. <b>Nitrendipine</b> decreased the Km for T 4 uptake from a control value of around 500 nM to around 300 nM (n= 6). In contrast, the Km for T 3 uptake was increased from a control value of around 300 nM to around 750 nM (n= 4). Diazepam had similar effects. This divergent shift in affinity for the uptake of T 3 and T 4 suggested that separate uptake systems exist for these two thyroid hormones. This provides evidence for at least two transporters mediating uptake of T 3 and T 4 in JAR cells: a specific T 4 transporter that does not interact with T 3 or structurally similar compounds; and a shared iodothyronine transporter that interacts with T 3, T 4, <b>nitrendipine</b> and diazepam...|$|E
