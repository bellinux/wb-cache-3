40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} and predict effects of preparation parameters on wear mass loss of <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> coatings, Ni coatings and <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> coatings were prepared on steel substrates by electrodeposition process.

The predictive curves of wear mass losses predicted by ANN had the similar shapes with the measured curve and the maximum error was 9. 7 %. When the current density was between 30 A/dm 2 and 50 A/dm 2, the wear losses of Ni coatings and Ni-SiC coatings decreased with the increase of current density. SiC particles in a composite coating electrodeposited by ultrasonic parameters were much greater in number and were dispersed homogeneously in the deposit and the <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> coating exhibited a dense structure...|$|E
40|$|Electrodeposited <b>Ni–SiC</b> <b>composite</b> coating is {{the most}} widely used {{engineering}} coating. Ni–SiC coating is bestowed with higher wear resistance and microhardness compared to plain nickel. In this study, the feasibility of using sodium hexametaphosphate as a dispersant in the electrodeposition of <b>Ni–SiC</b> <b>composite</b> coating has been investigated. The effect of sodium hexametaphosphate and probe sonication on the microhardness, microstructure and wear resistance of the electrodeposited <b>Ni–SiC</b> <b>composite</b> coating has been studied. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the coatings showed the absence of Na and P elements from sodium hexametaphosphate in the bath. Ni–SiC coating deposited using probe sonication followed by the addition of sodium hexametaphosphate exhibited microhardness as high as 680 HK. The microstructure of the coatings varied with probe sonication and SHMP addition and Ni–SiC–PS–SHMP coating possessed lowest roughness. This study has revealed that a synergistic combination of probe sonication of the electrolyte bath containing particles followed by sodium hexametaphosphate addition enhances the co-deposition of finer SiC particles and thereby enhances the coating properties like microhardness and wear resistance...|$|E

It {{was found that}} the grain size of the <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composites</b> decreased with increasing average current density, and the hardness of the composites increased with decreasing nickel matrix grain size. An equivalent circuit model {{based on the results of}} electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was formulated to simulate the charge transfer process under triangular waveform. Compared with deposits produced under the direct current, the triangular waveform with relaxation time provided a higher instantaneous peak current for charge transfer, which resulted in an improvement in morphology and hardness of the composites.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{the effect of}} pulse {{frequency}} on electrodeposition behaviour of <b>Ni–SiC</b> <b>composites</b> was examined. Based on the impedance results of the composite, an equivalent circuit was {{used to describe the}} electrochemical system under different pulse frequencies. It was found that the simulated instantaneous peak current increased with decreasing pulse frequencies. A high peak current was known to favour nucleation and fine grain size. Experimental results revealed that the nickel grain size decreased with decreasing pulse frequency, and the volume fraction of SiC was relatively independent of pulse frequency. Microhardness and nanoindentation tests were also performed, and {{it was found that the}} hardness and the elastic modulus of the composite were dependent on the pulse frequency, and the phenomena could be explained by its change in grain size.

The electrochemical impedance spectra revealed that a passive layer was formed {{on the surface of the}} Ni-SiC coating with the magnetic field. The microstructures of electrodeposited <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> coatings were also examined. More SiC particles were found to be incorporated into the coating with the presence of magnetic field, which was considered to be one of the reasons for the enhancement of corrosion resistance as SiC particles were reported to be corrosion inhibitors.

40|$|Fused mullite, a {{commonly}} used refractory material has been synthesized and {{adopted in the}} present study as reinforcement in the nickel composite coating. The composite has been developed through electrodeposition method. The thermal stability of Ni–mullite composite in terms of microhardness was studied at temperatures up to 800 °C and compared with Ni–SiC, a commercialized wear resistant coating. The microhardness of as deposited electroforms was similar for both Ni–mullite and <b>Ni–SiC</b> <b>composites</b> (400 Hk). A marginal decrease in the microhardness of Ni–mullite occurred at 600 °C while, significant reduction was observed beyond 400 °C for Ni–SiC coating. Thus, the Ni–mullite composite has higher thermal stability compared to Ni–SiC. The tribological studies showed that the wear volume loss for Ni–mullite is 2. 38 × 10 − 5 mm 3 /m while, of Ni–SiC it is 9. 58 × 10 − 5 mm 3 /m under identical conditions. The potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance showed that the corrosion resistance of Ni–mullite composite is better compared to Ni–SiC.

40|$|Metal matrix {{composites}} {{reinforced with}} nano-sized particles have attracted {{scientific and technological}} interest due to the enhanced properties exhibited by these coatings. <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composites</b> have gained widespread application {{for the protection of}} friction parts in the automobile industry. The influence of variables like SiC content, current density and stirring speed on microhardness of nano-composite coatings has been studied. The improved microhardness was associated with the reduction in crystallite size determined by X-ray diffraction studies. The influence of incorporation of nano-SiC in hardened Ni-Co alloy matrix was also studied. It was observed that for 28 wt. %Co content in the matrix the microhardness was higher compared to 70 wt. % for a given nano-SiC content. This was associated to the crystal phase of Ni- 28 Co-SiC being fcc compared to hcp phase exhibited by Ni- 70 Co-SiC. The wear resistance of pure Ni, Co and nano-composite coatings was studied using pin-on-disc wear tester under dry sliding condition. The volumetric wear loss indicated that, the wear resistance of Ni-SiC nano-composite is better than that of pure nickel deposit. The wear resistance of Ni-Co composites was observed to be superior to Ni composite. The wear behaviour of Ni and Ni- 28 Co composite was in accordance with the Archard’s law.

Therefore,analyzation of change on various plating films through the kinetic friction is {{objective of this}} study. Tracks of tribology test on three kinds of plating films,Ni-P film,hard Cr film and <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> film,were analyzed by XPS. As the results,in {{the case of the}} electroless Ni-P plating film,phosphate,which exist on only extreme surface of the Ni-P film,was confirmed on the tracks. Therefore,the Ni-P was transformed like a push out side with pinching its extreme surface or oxidizing the P in the Ni-P film. In the case of the hard Cr electro plating film,there was almost no wear nor chemically change on the film,however,ball bearing,which was used for the tribology test,was worn and it stuck to the film. In the case of the <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> electroplating film,the SiC particle in composite film made inroads into ball bearing and promoted the film wearing as abrasive.

The effects of agitation speed on hardness properties of the coatings were investigated.

40|$|<b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> {{is widely}} adopted as a {{functional}} coating in aerospace and automobile applications. However, the limitation with this coating {{is that at}} temperatures above 400 oC nickel reacts with silicon carbide to form brittle silicides which deteriorates {{the performance of the}} coating. Oxides are thermally more stable than carbides and hence, in the present study an attempt has been made to compare the corrosion behaviour of pulse electrodeposited Ni-ZrO 2 and Ni-YSZ coatings with Ni-SiC coatings in 3. 5 %NaCl medium. The three composite coatings were deposited under identical conditions i. e. 10 % duty cycle and average current densities in the range of 400 - 700 mA/inch 2. The microhardness of Ni-YSZ coating was higher than that of Ni-ZrO 2 and Ni-SiC coatings. The corrosion behaviour of the coatings was evaluated using polarization and electrochemical impedance studies in 3. 5 wt%NaCl medium. The Ni-YSZ coating displayed better corrosion resistance due to low corrosion current density (icorr) and high polarization resistance (Rp) compared to Ni-ZrO 2 and <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> coatings. The icorr values at constant average current density of 400 mA/inch 2 are 0. 1 µA/cm 2, 3. 9 µA/cm 2 and 14. 6 µA/cm 2 for Ni-YSZ, Ni-ZrO 2 and Ni-SiC coatings respectively. An increase in icorr was observed with increase in current density from 400 - 700 mA/Inch². The charge transfer resistance (Rct) was the highest for Ni-YSZ coating affirming the above behaviour...|$|E

It was found that under the same average and peak current density, the shape of current waveform has {{significant effect on the}} electrodeposition behaviour. A higher instantaneous peak current for charge transfer was obtained by the ramp-up waveform, which results in finer grain size and enhanced hardness of the composites.

Taking into account the working temperature of engine cylinders, the wear behavior of coatings was evaluated at 25 to 300 ºC and the high temperature tribological properties of the coatings were investigated. Based on the results obtained from the wear tests, all three coatings showed almost good friction coefficient values at 25 and 100 ºC, which were close to each other. By increasing the temperature to 200 - 300 °C, the friction coefficient and weight loss values strongly increased. However, addition of solid lubricants caused the values to decrease.

40|$|Micron and submicron-sized SiC-particles (5 and 0. 3 mum respectively) were codeposited with nickel from a Watts electrolyte. The <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> {{coatings}} {{showed a}} better corrosion resistance in a 0. 6 M NaCl solution than nickel electrodeposited {{under the same}} conditions. The corrosion rate of Ni-SiC decreases by two orders of magnitude with respect to pure Ni coatings. This improved corrosion resistance is quite independent of the size and amount of embedded particles, except for the smallest SiC-particles investigated. In that case, the pitting corrosion potential shifts to more noble values indicating a notable reduction of the localized corrosion susceptibility. This improved corrosion resistance of Ni-SiC coatings containing submicrometric SiC-particles is linked {{to a change in}} grain morphology and texture of the coatings.

40|$|Electrodeposition {{is one of}} {{the most}} technologically {{feasible}} and economically superior techniques for producing metal matrix composite coatings. Particle-reinforced metal matrix composites (MMCs) generally exhibited wide engineering applications due to their enhanced hardness, better wear, and corrosion resistance when compared to pure metal or alloy. In the present study, nickel composite coatings (Ni-SiC, Ni-YSZ, and Ni-ZrO 2) were successfully synthesized from nickel sulphamate electrolyte containing ceramic particles like SiC, YSZ and ZrO 2 by direct current (DC) plating with the aid of mechanical and magnetic agitation. The effect of magnetic and mechanical agitation on microstructure, mechanical, and tribological properties have been analyzed. It was observed from the studies that mechanical properties obtained by adopting mechanical agitation were better compared to those of the coatings obtained using magnetic agitation. The FESEM studies revealed that in <b>Ni-SiC</b> <b>composite</b> the SiC particles were covered by a film of nickel while, in the oxide reinforced composite coatings the oxide particles were distinctly visible on the surface of coatings. Tribological testing of the composite coatings under dry sliding conditions and under wet conditions (distilled water) was carried out. The tribological studies under dry sliding conditions showed that the wear loss was less for Ni-YSZ coating compared to the other Ni composite coatings. However, in distilled water medium Ni-SiC coating exhibited better wear resistance than the other coatings. The corrosion behaviour was evaluated using polarization and electrochemical impedance studies. The studies showed that oxide particle reinforced Ni composites possess better corrosion resistance due to their lower Icorr when compared with the Ni-SiC coating.
