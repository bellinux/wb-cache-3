40|$|Thermal {{performance}} {{study is}} one of the critical aspects of the <b>natural</b> <b>ventilated</b> vernacular buildings. Thermal comfort studies of built environment mainly focussed on two different approaches, one is heat balance approach and the other is adaptive approach. Thermal comfort survey has been carried out in 50 houses covering over 100 occupants of cold and cloudy climatic zone of North East India. This comfort study has been done in the form of long term thermal monitoring at outside and inside of a house, comfort survey based on ASHRAE thermal sensation scale for different seasons of the year. Comfort temperatures are calculated based on Humphreys and Auliciems comfort model. Neutral temperatures at which people feels comfortable in this <b>natural</b> <b>ventilate</b> buildings are obtained from the comfort survey. It has been found that the comfort temperature obtained from the Humphreys and Auliciems comfort model differs with the neutral temperatures obtained from comfort surevy. There are four major indicator like outdoor and indoor temperatures, relative humidity and clothing pattern of the peoples has direct impact on the peoples perception and acceptabilty on comfort situtaion. In this study, thermal comfort equations are developed based on these four indicator and validated with the neutral temperature obtained from comfort survey. It has been found that the comfort equation developed with all these four indicators has highest co-relation coefficient and provide the neutral temparture values very close to thermal comfort survey results. However, these equations are valid only for similar kinds of <b>natural</b> <b>ventilated</b> buildings and also for similar kinds of building functioning management of this climatic zones.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} most {{buildings}} {{is to provide}} a comfortable and healthy indoor environment for the occupants. As a result of increasing energy prices in the last decades, much effort has been done to reduce the cost arising from mechanical and natural ventilation of buildings. This often involves lowering the outdoor air intake. At the same time, many new pollution sources have been introduced in the buildings. These issues are important if we take into consideration that today {{the majority of the people}} spends more than 90 % of their time indoors. In this work will be presented a physical and mathematical models to study the three-dimensional turbulent air flow patterns with thermal buoyant effects, the heat transfer, including radiation between walls, the gas contaminant trasnport and the most air transport into mechanical or <b>natural</b> <b>ventilated</b> spaces. the calculations made use of a numerical procedure, which solves the three-dimensional equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, thermal energy and air contaminant transport. The turbulence is modelled by the k-e model and thermal radiation by the discrete transfer method. To validate the mathematical model, the predictions results were compared with experimental data for two different scales - full scale office room and 1 / 4 laboratory scale model. A physical modelling technique, based on dimensional analysis, was used to derive the physical properties of the laboratory model, designed to provide similarity with the room.

The study has successfully developed ANN model to forecast indoor temperature, indoor humidity and indoor velocity. From the results, it was found that the best ANN to forecast indoor temperature is 3 - 37 - 1, 3 - 12 - 1, 3 - 30 - 1 and 3 - 17 - 1. As for the indoor humidity forecasting, the best ANN is 3 - 40 - 1, 3 - 1 1 - 1, 3 - 31 - 1 and 3 - 36 - 1.

40|$|We {{consider}} chemical plume tracing (CPT) in time-varying airflow environments {{using multiple}} mobile robots. The purpose of CPT is to approach a gas source with a previously unknown location {{in a given}} area. Therefore, the CPT could {{be considered as a}} dynamic optimization problem in continuous domains. The traditional ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm has been successfully used for combinatorial optimization problems in discrete domains. To adapt the ant colony metaphor to the multi-robot CPT problem, the two-dimension continuous search area is discretized into grids and the virtual pheromone is updated according to both the gas concentration and wind information. To prevent the adapted ACO algorithm from being prematurely trapped in a local optimum, the upwind surge behavior is adopted by the robots with relatively higher gas concentration in order to explore more areas. The spiral surge (SS) algorithm is also examined for comparison. Experimental results using multiple real robots in two indoor <b>natural</b> <b>ventilated</b> airflow environments show that the proposed CPT method performs better than the SS algorithm. The simulation results for large-scale advection-diffusion plume environments show that the proposed method could also work in outdoor meandering plume environments...|$|R
