As the eldest and most experienced of Vespasian's sons, Titus shared tribunician power with his father, received seven consulships, the censorship, and was given command of the Praetorian Guard; powers that left <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> was the designated heir to the Empire. As a second son, Domitian held honorary titles, such as Caesar or Princeps Iuventutis, and several priesthoods, including those of augur, pontifex, frater arvalis, magister frater arvalium, and sacerdos collegiorum omnium, but no office with imperium.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} horsepower deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the mile and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto {{went on to win the}} race. He dropped to third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> was capable of competing at the international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event at Sears Point, Roberts started the race at the back of the pack and passed the entire field within four laps to win the race. Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of the dirt track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E

These negative views were likely augmented by the fact that Puritan ideologies stated that women were vastly inferior to men.|$|E
25|$|The {{final years}} of Starkey's life were devoted to resurrecting his medical {{practice}} and manufacturing income-producing medicines. However, he never wandered far from his chymistry lab and his quest for Van Helmont's alchahest or the philosophers' stone. <b>No</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> continued his search for the perfect liquor alchahest, a medicinal solvent whose purpose was similar to theriac, an antidotal compound that was consumed to preserve health and prevent illness. Starkey's success in producing his alchahest was limited, and his quest for the philosophers' stone never came to fruition. Although he continued to produce medical treatises, three political pamphlets that he wrote in 1660 along with public disputes he engaged in with other medical practitioners and the Royal College of Physicians further tainted his career.|$|E

500|$|On {{taking office}} as Melter and Refiner, Peale {{implemented}} the changes he had recommended {{based on what}} he had seen in Europe. [...] He also wanted additional mechanization in the mint's Coining Department, headed by Chief Coiner Adam Eckfeldt, whose son Jacob was the Philadelphia Mint's Assayer. Adam Eckfeldt had helped strike some of the first federal coins in 1792 and had been in his office since 1814. [...] Eckfeldt was reluctant to adopt all [...] Peale's recommendations, telling Peale's nephew, engineer George Sellers, [...] "If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down... he wants something better and <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> would have it if we were starting anew." [...] As improvements crept in despite Eckfeldt's caution, the Chief Coiner saw their value and became more enthusiastic, noting the savings in working time afforded by the Contamin lathe, which had been imported from France after being seen by Peale there. To help deal with the increased output from the Philadelphia Mint, Peale invented a piling-box, allowing planchets or coins to be quickly stacked, and a counting board, speeding the work of the clerks. The counting board remained in use until the mints installed mechanical counters in 1934.|$|E

[...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in a lot of books, you think you're reading what the person writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether you agree or not (and I agreed with some of his stuff, not others), I had <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> was giving his true opinions on things.

500|$|Frazier {{began his}} fourth season {{representing}} Penn State with 17 points, 8 assists, and 5 rebounds {{in an exhibition}} game against Philadelphia on November 3, 2012. He sat out {{for much of the}} second half, giving his duties to D. J. Newbill. After the game, Frazier said that the team [...] "just played Penn State basketball." [...] On November 9, 2012, the first regular season for Frazier as a senior, he logged his 19th career 20-point game against Saint Francis (PA). On November 18, Frazier left six minutes into a game against Akron due to a ruptured left Achilles tendon. It was announced that he had a recovery period of about 12 months and would be out for the season. The injury was described as a [...] "devastating blow" [...] to the program by ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan. Chambers addressed the situation, saying, [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> will meet this challenge and will again be one of the top players in the nation," [...] in accordance to his potential fifth year of NCAA eligibility. Frazier redshirted the season shortly after it was announced by the school that he would undergo surgery. He said, [...] "I will never forget that game, that injury, never forget that camera. I'm sitting there on the sideline with the (television) camera just zooming in on my foot. I'll never forget the look on my sister's face, my mom and dad's face." [...] During his rehabilitation, Frazier began using the elliptical machine, doing work in the swimming pool, and taking part in weight training. He was guided by Penn State's athletic trainer, Jon Salazer, throughout the process. Frazier's sister Krystal had torn her right Achilles tendon when playing college basketball nearly seven years prior, and had gone through a similar rehabilitation before resuming her playing career.|$|E

[...] Dubal observed that Horowitz sublimated a strong instinctual sexuality into a powerful erotic undercurrent which was communicated in his piano playing.

2500|$|As Shadow Chancellor he {{concentrated}} on tax reform. Jenkins, Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, wrote that he was never intimidated by him, and that Macleod concentrated on opposition rather than constructive proposals. Macleod planned to abolish Selective Employment Tax and to cut personal income tax, but not to increase indirect taxes, trusting that economic growth would make up the shortfall in revenue. He proposed a national lottery then opposed Jenkins when he proposed one; on another occasion he required Conservative MPs, to the irritation of some of them, {{to walk out of}} a select committee meeting in protest. Jenkins later recorded that Macleod was not “an amiable “shadow” … <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> was in pain … Perhaps he also had a premonition that time was running out for him.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Injuries to Sibbles and to Frank Booth gave Pollard an {{opportunity}} to play 23 matches in 1935, and was awarded his county cap.

[...] In fact, by playing for The Rest against the new County Champions, Yorkshire and taking three wickets in the game, he reached exactly 100 wickets for the season.

2500|$|Malick's {{forthcoming}} arrival {{was announced}} by the BBC on 26 November 2010. Described as [...] "a complex character who completely divides opinion amongst his Holby colleagues", executive producer Belinda Campbell expanded: [...] "He absolutely refuses to play the political game and his bedside manner leaves {{a lot to be}} desired. However, there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> excels at his job and what would overwhelm other medics is like nectar to Malick." [...] Akingbola deemed his character [...] "an alpha male who doesn't suffer fools gladly", someone who would cause ructions amongst staff and patients alike. Despite his abrasive personality, Malick is a talented doctor. Akingbola likened him to footballer Eric Cantona, in that he is [...] "highly skilled, but his temper, his attitude and his confidence get in the way." [...] As a result of his refusal to engage in hospital politics, he is introduced as a registrar who has not achieved his [...] "main ambition" [...] of being promoted to consultant level, although he is close to it, and feels he should be one already. Confident in his ability, Malick exudes arrogance. The actor suggested that Malick's drive stemmed from having been told he would never amount to anything, and a desire to prove his detractors wrong.|$|E
2500|$|Grace and {{his brother}} Fred faced {{financial}} difficulty after their father died in December 1871 as they were still living with their mother who had been left just enough to retain the family home. As medical students, they faced considerable outlay {{in addition to their}} living expenses and it became imperative for them to make what they could out of cricket, especially the United South of England Eleven. Grace as its match organiser had to find gaps in the first-class fixture list and then pull together a team to visit a location where a suitable profit could be made. It has been estimated that the standard fee paid to the USEE was £100 for a three-day match with £5 each going to the nine professionals in the team and the other £45 to W. G. and Fred: a sizeable amount in 1872 when £100 was perhaps the equivalent of £3,000-plus {{at the end of the}} 20th century. Otherwise, Grace played for expenses but these were loaded as, for example, he is known to have claimed £15 per appearance for Gloucestershire and £20 for representing the Gentlemen. Although the money he was paid is [...] "small beer" [...] compared with 21st-century sports stars, there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>he</b> had a comfortable living out of cricket and made far more money than any contemporary professional. To put it in context, a domestic servant earned less than £50 a year.|$|E
