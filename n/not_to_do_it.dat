5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E

Wracked with guilt and loneliness, Leela resolves to consume enough space honey to fall asleep forever and be with Fry in her dreams, but a portrait of Fry implores her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Leela tries to fight back, but she ends up smashing her jar of space honey and luring a swarm of bees. As Leela clutches her picture of Fry, Fry begs Leela to wake up.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{had less}} than {{three and a half}} hours to bowl England out for victory and their spinners gave them 50 overs to do so. Bob Barber hit 34 off 37 balls with 3 fours and a six, but Geoff Boycott carried his bat through to stumps with 63 not out. Boycott pushed a ball from Peter Philpott away with his hand during his innings, but Brian Booth refused to appeal for handled the ball and Wally Grout just told him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. John Edrich (37) and Ken Barrington (38) also hit sixes and Mike Smith saw out the last half hour as England made 186/3 to ensure a draw.|$|E

25|$|In 839 Jang proved {{instrumental}} in the seizure of power by Silla's King Sinmu following the overthrow of King Minae. Kim Ujing (later King Sinmu) approached Jang for help in taking the throne from the usurper who had killed Ujing‘s father. Jang is purported to have replied, “The ancients had a saying, ‘To see {{what is right and}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> is want of courage.’ Though I am without ability, I shall follow your orders.” Thereupon Jang dispatched a force of 5000 men under the command of his closest companion and adviser Jeong Yeon (who had since also returned from Tang) in support of Sinmu's claim. The success of Sinmu's power grab won Jang Bogo the post of Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|Eisenhower {{had warned}} Eden <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> saying the American people would never approve of a {{military}} solution to the crisis. He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realize the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.|$|E

Richards himself {{said in a}} 1998 interview: [...] "I think of our differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him, it's {{because no one else}} has the guts to do it or else they're paid <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done." ...|$|E

500|$|Denis O'Hare {{joined the}} cast in late March 2011 as Larry Harvey. Jessica Lange joined the cast in April 2011 as Constance, marking her first regular role on television. Lange was {{attracted}} to the role because it didn't require a 22-episode commitment like a series on a broadcast network. [...] "That was huge for me!" [...] she said. [...] "I wasn't about to commit to, you know, six months. It was cable, rather than network...

500|$|At the Springfield General Hospital, Dr. Hibbert wires Homer's broken jaw shut, {{saying that}} he {{will not be able to}} speak or eat solid food for a while. Unable to talk, Homer starts to listen to his family, which pleases them, {{especially}} Marge. She decides that, since Homer is so well-behaved, they can risk going to the Springfield annual formal event at the Country Club. The next day, the jaw wires come off. Homer and Marge appear on a chat show called [...] "Afternoon Yak" [...] to discuss how Homer became a changed man. During the show, Marge, with the support of the hosts, pleads with Homer to stop his [...] "reckless ways" [...] and stay well behaved.

500|$|Despite signing Johnston, several {{tenets of}} the {{original}} policy still officially remained in place as Rangers {{did not attempt to}} sign any further Catholic players {{for the next few years}} and because the media had branded Johnston as a [...] "card-carrying Catholic". The club did not make another major Scottish Catholic signing until Neil McCann in 1998. In the same year, Rangers lifted a ban on players making the sign of the cross at the behest of Gabriel Amato but warned them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in front of supporters. In 1999, Lorenzo Amoruso became the first Catholic captain of Rangers. However, in 2002 defender Fernando Ricksen, who had been receiving sectarian phone calls from Celtic supporters, stated [...] "If you're Catholic and you play for Rangers, then you are a Protestant. If you play for the Protestant people, you don't play for the Catholic people." ...|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Ron {{slips and}} {{falls on the}} grass while running to warn Leslie about Ben's plan {{to shut down the}} Freddy Spaghetti concert. That fall was neither scripted nor accidental, but rather planned and improvised by Nick Offerman. Aziz Ansari {{described}} the physical comedy as [...] "one of my favorite shots in the series". In a different scene, April is chewing on a hay-straw while raking hay before the concert, and angrily spits the straw out when Andy tries to talk to her. That moment was improvised by actress Aubrey Plaza. Woliner asked her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but she insisted, correctly predicting it would make the final cut if she did it. In a different scene, Ron eats a turkey leg wrapped in bacon. The original script called simply for a large turkey leg, but a props employee suggested wrapping it in bacon based on Ron's well-known affinity for the food. It was Woliner who suggested that Ron say the snack was nicknamed [...] "the Swanson".|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} March 2011, with Connie Britton {{first to be}} cast, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon. Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien. When Ryan Murphy presented the role to her he said, [...] "This is something we've never seen you do before. It will be turning what you've just been doing on its ear." [...] She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately {{decided to take the}} part. Denis O'Hare joined the cast in late March as Larry Harvey. Jessica Lange joined the cast in April as Constance, marking her first regular role on television. Lange was attracted to the role because it didn't require a 22 episode commitment. [...] "That was huge for me!" [...] she said. [...] "I wasn't about to commit to, you know, six months.

500|$|Later in 1819, Nathaniel {{moved the}} family to Montville, a hamlet of Moravia. Appreciating his son's talents, Nathaniel Fillmore persuaded Judge Walter Wood, the Fillmores' {{landlord}} and the wealthiest person in the area, to allow Millard to be his law clerk for a trial period. Wood agreed to employ young Fillmore, and to supervise him as he read law. Fillmore taught school for three months to earn money to buy out his apprenticeship at the mill. Fillmore left Wood after 18 months; the judge paid him almost nothing, and the two quarreled when Fillmore earned a small sum by advising a farmer in a minor lawsuit. Refusing to pledge <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again, Fillmore left, abandoning his clerkship. Nathaniel Fillmore again moved the family, and Fillmore accompanied his father west to East Aurora, in Erie County, near Buffalo. [...] This move proved successful, and the farm Nathaniel Fillmore purchased there became prosperous. Nathaniel Fillmore {{would be the first}} father of a president to visit his son at the White House, and alluded to his family's onetime poverty when he told a questioner how to raise a son to be president: [...] "Cradle him in a sap trough".|$|E
500|$|Originally, Parker and Stone {{considered}} {{making a}} full-length episode of The Queef Sisters. The duo had pulled a similar stunt {{with the second}} season premiere. Instead of the expected follow-up to [...] "Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut", in which the identity of Cartman's father was to be revealed, Parker and Matt Stone showed the episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus", a Terrance and Phillip-centered episode as an April Fools' Day prank. Since [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] was coincidentally also set to air on April Fools' Day, they considered a similar joke revolving around Katherine and Katie. However, since [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" [...] infuriated South Park fans at the time, they decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and wrote a full script for [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] instead. The original prank is referenced in the episode, when The Canada Channel announces {{that it will not}} air a much-anticipated part two episode of Terrance and Phillip, and instead will show the Queef Sisters as an April Fools' Day prank. The angry reaction from the boys mirrors the real-life fan reaction to the South Park second season premiere.|$|E
500|$|Lloyd's biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 {{as being}} the year that she officially [...] "made it" [...] thanks to a {{catalogue}} of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; The Era called her [...] "the favourite of the hour". During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. [...] At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. [...] The 1892 pantomime was Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. [...] The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when {{she got out of}} bed to pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said [...] "Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? [...] I think of little besides her." [...] On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of Little Bo-Peep. [...] Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, [...] "ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress".|$|E
