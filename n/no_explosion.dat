5|$|GM {{recommends}} that a Volt battery fire be fought with water rather than dry chemicals, and rates the Volt battery as having <b>no</b> <b>explosion</b> or electrocution hazard {{as the result}} of a collision. The high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, and nail penetration.|$|E

25|$|In training, {{the damage}} control team specializing in on-deck {{firefighting}} for Forrestal (Damage Control Team #8, led by Chief Petty Officer Gerald Farrier) had been shown films of Navy ordnance tests demonstrating how a 1000-lb bomb could be directly {{exposed to a}} jet fuel fire for a full 10 minutes and still be extinguished and cooled without an explosive cook-off. However, these tests were conducted using the new Mark 83 1000lb bombs, which featured relatively stable Composition H6 explosive and thicker, heat-resistant cases, compared to their predecessors; H6, which is still used in many types of naval ordnance due to its relative insensitivity to heat, shock and electricity, is also designed to deflagrate instead of detonate when it reaches its ignition point in a fire, either melting the case and producing <b>no</b> <b>explosion</b> at all, or, at most, a subsonic low order detonation {{at a fraction of}} its normal power.|$|E

500|$|Approximately 500 Zanzibari men {{and women}} were killed or wounded during the bombardment, most of the dead a result of the fire that engulfed the palace. It is unknown how many of these {{casualties}} were combatants, but Khalid's gun crews were said to have been [...] "decimated". British casualties amounted to one Petty Officer severely wounded aboard Thrush who later recovered. Although the majority of the Zanzibari townspeople sided with the British, the town's Indian quarter suffered from opportunistic looting, and around twenty inhabitants lost their lives in the chaos. To restore order, 150 British Sikh troops were transferred from Mombasa to patrol the streets. Sailors from St George and Philomel were landed to form a fire brigade to contain the fire, which had spread from the palace to the nearby customs sheds. There was some concern about the fire at the customs sheds as they contained a sizeable store of explosives, but <b>no</b> <b>explosion</b> occurred.|$|E
500|$|The only {{parameter}} {{which characterizes}} the explosion is the Damköhler number [...] When [...] is very high, conduction time {{is longer than}} the chemical reaction time and the system explodes with high temperature since {{there is not enough}} time for conduction to remove the heat.

On 10 January 1943, Triton stalked an unidentified vessel but withheld her attack upon observing it was marked as a hospital ship. Three days later, she launched four torpedoes at a tanker and scored one hit. When the enemy began firing at her periscope, she went deep to begin an end around. About 20 minutes later, the submarine returned to periscope depth and launched a spread of four torpedoes. Two geysers of water rose amidships {{as high as the}} target's bridge, but <b>no</b> <b>explosions</b> followed. The next day, Triton attempted to attack a freighter, but an escort forced her down where she was subjected to a two-hour depth charge attack. On 16 January, she attacked two cargo ships, scoring two hits on the first and one on the second; but her victims forced her to submerge before she could evaluate the damage. Later that day, Triton fired her last three torpedoes at a large freighter but heard <b>no</b> <b>explosions.</b> She then headed for Australia and reached Brisbane on 26 January, with a total of 6,500 tons for the trip.|$|R

Of twenty-one people aboard the plane, one survived the crash. Local Radio Okapi reported that the aircraft ran out of fuel after being unable to land at Bandundu, but Filair later declared that 150 litres of kerosene were still on board, affirming that a technical problem had caused the crash. Daniel Philemotte, the Belgian airline owner, was at the controls of the aircraft himself. Most of the dead were Congolese.

In addition, in Manjil town it took more than 30  min after the earthquake to shut down the gas flow. The failure of electric power supply and the strong wind of Manjil that dissipated the gas contributed to the fortunate situation that <b>no</b> <b>explosions</b> or fires occurred after the earthquake.|$|R

Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August his engine was producing 800lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to try it on a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had wanted to check the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature {{at the last minute}} there was <b>no</b> <b>explosion</b> and no lives were lost.
