25|$|Tairawhiti Polytechnic head of Māori studies Joe Te Rito {{operated}} a part-time station, Te Toa Takitini, on the polytechnic's Gisborne campus in 1988 and 1989, {{in an effort}} to broadcast Rongomaiwahine-Ngāti Kahungunu's local elders and native speakers. A year later he relaunched it as full-time station Radio Kahungunu in Hastings, to increase grammatical and spoken Māori language fluency, and expose the language to homes where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> it. Te Rito archived more than 2000 programme recordings, which he used to study and translate the tribe's distinctive dialect, teach courses on the local spoken and written language, and provide an international model for preserving dialects in other communities in Asia and the Pacific.|$|E
500|$|James R. Doolittle of Wisconsin objected {{that the}} {{citizenship}} provision {{would not be}} sufficiently narrow to exclude American Indians from citizenship, and {{in an attempt to}} address this issue, he proposed to add a phrase taken from the Civil Rights Act—"excluding Indians not taxed". [...] Although most Senators agreed that birthright citizenship should not be extended to the Indians, a majority saw no need to clarify the issue, and Doolittle's proposal was voted down. [...] Upon its return to the House of Representatives, the proposed Fourteenth Amendment received little debate; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> in opposition to the Senate's addition of the Citizenship Clause, and the complete proposed amendment was approved by the House on June 13, 1866, and declared to have been ratified on July 28, 1868.|$|E
500|$|The {{last two}} {{chapters}} feature Peshkin's {{commentary on the}} school in society, its tradeoffs and comparison with other total institutions and larger social movements, like the New Religious Right. He also compares the academy to public and parochial schools, wherein he finds public school students more politically tolerant and acceptant of religious pluralism. Peshkin's final reflections are written as a [...] "cost-benefit analysis" [...] of these Christian schools in the larger American society. In the last chapter, Peshkin contemplates how his Jewish identity is insulated within a pluralistic and secular society, and how he is fearful of absolutist [...] "imperious, implacable logic" [...] and [...] "zeal for conversion and exclusivism". He recounted that while the school spoke derogatorily of non-fundamentalists and non-Christians, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> of the American religious plurality that permitted this. In response to the encroaching state, fundamentalists feel that their political conviction should mirror that of their religion. Peshkin views the school as schismatic in a larger society for promoting intolerance towards fellow Americans. He also praised traits of the schools including its community, dedicated teachers, and attractive image. At the time of print, Christian schools like Bethany were outpacing the growth of other schools. In 1989, Christian schools comprised about 20% of private school enrollment—around 700,000 students.|$|E

5000|$|Classmates {{described}} him as quiet and [...] "a typical teen". [...] "He was a good person," [...] said a classmate, [...] "quiet and didn't really talk to <b>no</b> <b>one,</b> only <b>spoke</b> with his friends, people he knew." ...|$|R
500|$|The main {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Closing Time {{took place at}} Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California—where Buffalo Springfield, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and The Doors had previously recorded—during spring 1972. Yester fronted production and the sessions were held almost immediately after Waits' record deal, and were described [...] "quick and efficient." [...] Waits was [...] "nervous, but confident enough in his own material" [...] during {{the beginning of the}} sessions; however, as the sessions progressed, Waits and Yester [...] "were pulling against each other" [...] over the direction which the album would take, with Waits wanting a jazz-laden record and Yester more focused on producing a folk-based album. Despite this, Waits was [...] "absolutely communicative" [...] with his fellow musicians, articulating his direction and using metaphors to describe how he wanted the songs to sound. The sessions took a total of ten days, with the first two days focusing on [...] "getting used to [...]" [...] Both Waits and Yester wanted to record during the evening, but as no slots were available, it was recorded through the morning and afternoon [...] "from ten to five every day." [...] During the recording of [...] "Ol' '55", Seiter contributed backing vocals and [...] "came up with a perfect harmony line that started faintly before the chorus even began." [...] The sessions concluded with a total of nine songs completed. Though unsatisfied with the amount of songs, a second recording session was arranged the following week in United Western Recorders. The final session for Closing Time began the following Sunday, with guest musicians Arni Egilsson replacing Plummer and Jesse Erlich performing cello. The title track, [...] "Closing Time", was the only song recorded in full, and Yester later described the session as [...] "the most magical session I've ever been involved with. At the end of it, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> for what felt like five minutes, either in the booth or out in the room. No one budged. Nobody wanted the moment to end." [...] String overdubs were later cut for [...] "Martha" [...] and [...] "Grapefruit Moon" [...] the following day. The final recordings were mixed and mastered at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco.|$|E
2500|$|The twins {{entered the}} house of the Sun before [...] had {{completed}} his journey across the sky. [...] They saw a woman sitting against the western wall, and they saw two handsome young men, , Black Thunder, and , Blue Thunder. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> to them. [...] "We are from ," [...] the twins said. [...] "Our mother is , Changing Woman, and we have been told that , the Sun, is our father. [...] We have followed the Holy Trail to seek his help." [...] The woman remained silent. [...] Black Thunder and Blue Thunder approached the twins, and wrapped four blankets around them. [...] They wrapped them in the blanket of red dawn, and the blanket of blue daylight, and the blanket of yellow evening, and the blanket of black darkness. [...] Then Black Thunder and Blue Thunder lifted the bundled twins and lay them high on a shelf.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, {{a neighbor}} of Casolaro's and long-time housekeeper, Olga, helped Casolaro pack a black leather tote. She remembers him packing a thick sheaf of papers into a dark brown or black briefcase. Casolaro said he was leaving for several days to visit Martinsburg, West Virginia, to meet a source who promised to provide an important missing piece to his story. This {{was the last time}} Olga saw him. Olga told The Village Voice that she answered several threatening telephone calls at Casolaro's home that day. She said that one man called at about 9:00a.m. and said, [...] "I will cut his body and throw it to the sharks". Less than an hour later, a different man said: [...] "Drop dead." [...] There was a third call, but Olga remembered only that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>spoke</b> and that she heard music as though a radio were playing. A fourth call was the same as the third, and a fifth call, this one silent, came later that night.|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> else <b>spoke.</b> Isabelle had fainted {{when she}} heard the threat of {{execution}} against her lover. Ada stood before her with a look of such anger and contempt on her young face that Chermside fairly winced under it.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> moved, nor <b>spoke.</b> The missionaries were {{stricken}} with horror; the converts seemed turned to stone, and the hostile throng waited silently, {{as they had}} for hours.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to a book}} by Mark Dumol, {{a senior}} civil servant {{in charge of the}} privatization, President Fidel Ramos insisted in 1994 that there was a [...] "water crisis" [...] in Manila at a time when <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>spoke</b> about a water crisis. Ramos began to {{convince}} others that there was a water crisis, which increased political support for privatization.|$|R

50|$|The Bruce Codex {{was bound}} {{when it was}} in the {{possession}} of the British Museum - in a random order, with some pages upside-down, since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> involved <b>spoke</b> Coptic. It was edited in 1893 by Carl Schmidt, who also translated it into German; it has since been rebound in Schmidt's ordering. Violet Macdermot translated it into English as The Books of Jeu and the Untitled Text in the Bruce Codex in 1978.|$|R
60|$|Benham {{stood at}} the top of the stairs looking down upon them, white-faced and inexpressive. Easton dropped back a pace. For a moment <b>no</b> <b>one</b> moved nor <b>spoke,</b> and then very quietly Easton shut the half-door and shut out the noises of the road.|$|R

60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> else <b>spoke.</b> On {{removing}} the caps, {{it was found}} that each man had been scalped, and that all of those, whom we had left a few days before, proud of their strength and instinct with life, had departed in spirit, soon to be seen no more. Jumper, the other Indian, alone remained to be accounted for. Rifle-balls had been at work here, each of the four having been shot; Mr. Traverse, in no less than three places.|$|R
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> now <b>spoke.</b> The caravel was dashing {{in toward}} the point with appalling speed, and every minute brought her perceptibly nearer to the {{cauldron}} of water that was foaming around it. Without absolutely entering within this vortex, the Niña flew along its edge, and, in five minutes more, she had a direct course up the Tagus open before her. The mainsail was now taken in, and the mariners stood fearlessly on, certain of a haven and security.|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, Baker {{reversed}} {{an earlier}} position, joining Gerald Neal, the only African-American {{member of the}} Senate, in advocating for a bill to make Martin Luther King, Jr. Day a state holiday. Baker apologized for his earlier stand against the Senate honoring King, saying simply, [...] "I was wrong." [...] A Lexington Herald-Leader columnist wrote of Baker's speech, in which he recounted that his family had owned slaves until his great-grandfather freed them in the 1820s, that it [...] "set such a high moral tone for the Senate that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>spoke</b> – and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> voted against the King holiday." ...|$|R

60|$|Nevertheless, Mrs. Duke {{was pleased}} with her new guest's {{concentration}} of courtesy upon herself; for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>spoke</b> seriously to her any more than she listened seriously to any one. And she almost beamed as the stranger, with yet wider and almost whirling gestures of explanation with his huge hat and bag, apologized for having entered by the wall instead of the front door. He was understood to put it down to an unfortunate family tradition of neatness and care of his clothes.|$|R
60|$|Other {{people had}} wondered, too. Still the keen blue eyes looked across through the misty {{atmosphere}} at the grey building opposite. Men and women passed before {{him in a}} constant, unseen procession. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> came and <b>spoke</b> to him, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> interfered with his meditations. The two {{men who had been}} discussing him passed out of the room presently one of them glanced backwards in his direction.|$|R

5000|$|The Payne {{translation}} {{is a mixture}} of 19th and 16th century idioms. Examples of the latter include [...] "an thou wilt" [...] instead of [...] "if you will", [...] "wheneas" [...] instead of [...] "when", [...] "methinketh" [...] instead of [...] "I think", [...] "parlous" [...] instead of [...] "perilous". On most occasions, the language is clear and of fine literary value, but sometimes it is degraded with terms <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>spoke</b> or wrote. For example, instead of saying [...] "Now I would gladly hear your advice on this matter", the duchess of Amalfi says: [...] "Now I would fain hear from thee that which thou counsellest thereanent." ...|$|R
50|$|Today, Ganges is {{considered}} to be the fifth most polluted river in the world. Raghubir Singh has noted that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> in India <b>spoke</b> of the Ganges as polluted until the late 1970s. However, pollution has been an old and continuous process in the river as by the time people were finally speaking of the Ganges as polluted, stretches of over six hundred kilometres were essentially ecologically dead zones.|$|R
60|$|A man's voice {{beside her}} made her start and turn. She had noticed the speaker {{more than once}} amongst the {{first-class}} passengers. There had been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination. He <b>spoke</b> to <b>no</b> <b>one.</b> If anyone <b>spoke</b> to him he was quick to rebuff the overture. Also he had a nervous way of {{looking over his shoulder}} with a swift, suspicious glance.|$|R
