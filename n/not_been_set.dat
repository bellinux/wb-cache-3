5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a quick start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> when the starter gun fired.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1806, Cabell {{learned that}} his father was sick. Not long after, however, he {{received}} word {{that his father was}} improving and expected to meet him in Virginia en route to the capital. Although a rendezvous location had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>set,</b> he assumed it would be in Lynchburg, where the Breckinridges had relatives. In October, he traveled to his uncle Lewis Breckinridge's home to wait for his father, but he never came. Disappointed, he returned to Princeton for the beginning of the new term, unaware that his father's recovery had been short-lived. Later he {{learned that his}} father had attempted to leave Cabell's Dale on October 22 but collapsed off his horse and returned to his sick bed; he died December 14, 1806.|$|E

The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and sick children were accommodated in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those accommodated in the barracks had no electricity or running water, and food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E

Greek troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, {{in the northern part of}} the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.|$|E

25|$|The final planned {{phase of}} the stadium's {{expansion}} includes the construction of permanent seating and an upper deck in the south end zone, completely enclosing the playing field.

However, the date of the final construction phase to fully enclose the south end zone has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> nor have any funds been raised. Varying sources claim this phase may not take place for upwards of 10 to 15 years, though on March 11, 2014 an announcement was made that an exploratory committee has been formed regarding the expansion of the stadium in conjunction with the construction of the Dell Medical School on campus.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say will be good enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E
25|$|MTBE, a major {{gasoline}} additive (10% by volume), {{was discovered}} in the city's water wells in August 1995. The MTBE was found almost by accident since it {{was not on the}} list of known contaminants and acceptable level had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>set.</b> The city waters engineers had to research the hazard and they raised the alarm. Within a year all five wells were closed, leading to the loss of 45% of the city's water supply. One well had a concentration of 600 parts per billion, while another rose from 14 parts per billion to 490 parts per billion within a year. The California EPA guidelines now call for no more than 35 parts per billion. The city's well field is in the Charnock Sub-Basin, a small aquifer in Mar Vista, Los Angeles that both Santa Monica and Culver City draw upon. To maintain supply to customers Santa Monica was forced to purchase water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) at a cost of over $1.1 million per year. Cleanup of the site is ongoing at a current cost of $3 million per year, paid for by the responsible parties, principally: Shell Oil Company, Chevron, and Exxon. Following this discovery other water districts began testing that revealed tens of thousands of MTBE pollution cases across the United States.|$|E

A college spokesman said that the scholarship had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> up as part of a political decision, and if the initial donations had been refused, this would have been interpreted as a political decision too. The university (which did not receive a letter of complaint from the embassy) {{made it clear that the}} decision to establish the scholarship was one for Queen's, not for the university, since the colleges are self-governing bodies.|$|E

It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the Uncharted film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, {{said he did not}} know the status of the film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think it will be hard to get that across," [...] but she is hopeful that it can be done.

500|$|In late April 2008 {{hundreds}} of ducks {{landed in a}} northern Alberta tailings pond belonging to Syncrude, where most died. The incident was a blow to Stelmach's efforts to convince the world that Alberta's oil sands were environmentally friendly. The number of ducks that died was originally reported at around 500, but in March 2009 Syncrude revealed that the number was in fact more than 1,600. In response to accusations from opposition and environmental groups that his government, which had known the actual number since the summer of 2008, had participated in covering it up to save face, Stelmach asserted that it had refrained from making the higher number public for fear of jeopardizing its investigation of whether Syncrude had violated any provincial regulations in the incident. [...] Investigations were centred around the questions of whether Syncrude had immediately reported the incident as required (the government had first heard of it from an anonymous tip, though Syncrude reported it several hours later) and whether the company had the required measures in place to prevent ducks from landing on its tailings ponds (it had noisemakers designed to deter waterfowl, but these had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> up {{at the time of}} the incident due to winter weather conditions). [...] Syncrude was eventually charged with [...] "failing to have systems in place to divert waterfowl", which carries a maximum fine of $800,000.|$|E
500|$|A film {{adaptation}} of the first game was announced in 2005.

In September 2010, Jaffe said that the [...] "script went out {{a year and a half}} ago to Daniel Craig who plays [...] Bond, but he turned it down". He also said that another actor had since been cast as Kratos; he said, [...] "this new person is pretty good, if that ends up true." [...] In July 2012, The Hollywood Reporter said that writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan had been hired to adapt the God of War film. On August 30, 2012, the writers told IGN that they intend to [...] "humanize" [...] Kratos and explore his past. Melton said that they are emotionally invested and it could become a series of films, and that Ares [...] "will become a more proactive villain". As of [...] , , the movie is without a director, no actors have been confirmed, and a release date has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>set,</b> but the script has been [...] "turned in".

Currently proposed by the Highways Agency is the M54 to M6 / M6 (Toll) Link Road.
