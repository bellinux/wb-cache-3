50|$|Starting in the 1950s, the Allied Paper {{operation}} in Kalamazoo {{began to use}} recycled waste paper for stock. Mixed in with this waste paper was carbonless copy paper, often called NCR (<b>No</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>Required)</b> <b>paper.</b> This type of paper was sold by the NCR corporation and between at least 1957 and 1971 it contained PCBs as an ink carrier. The use of PCBs were banned in the early 1970s but by then the area between the Monarch and Bryant Mill sites, where settling lagoons were used after 1950 to remove suspended particles within the waste water from the recycling process, contained over 110,000 pounds of PCBs. There were 8 million cubic yards of contaminated material. In addition, the PCBs had traveled along Portage Creek and into the Kalamazoo River, causing significant contamination all the way downstream to the dam at Allegan, Michigan. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared this a Superfund Site.|$|E
50|$|The {{case report}} form (CRF) is the data {{collection}} tool for the clinical trial and can be paper or electronic. Paper CRFs will be printed, often using <b>No</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>Required</b> <b>paper,</b> and shipped to the investigative sites conducting the clinical trial for completion after which they are couriered back to Data Management. Electronic CRFs enable data to be typed directly into fields using a computer and transmitted electronically to Data Management.Design of CRFs needs {{to take into account}} the information required to be collected by the clinical trial protocol and intended to be included in statistical analysis. Where available, standard CRF pages may be re-used for collection of data which is common across most clinical trials e.g. subject demographics.Apart from CRF design, electronic trial design also includes edit check programming. Edit checks are used to fire a query message when discrepant data is entered, to map certain data points from one CRF to the other, to calculate certain fields like Subject's Age, BMI etc.. Edit checks help the investigators to enter the right data right at the moment data is entered and also help in increasing the quality of the Clinical trial data.|$|E

50|$|Another {{available}} alloy, EZ960™ Sterling Silver Metal Clay {{was invented}} by Bill Struve from Metal Adventures, the inventor of BRONZclay™ and COPPRclay™. Because the clay is a sterling silver alloy, one of its best attributes is its post firing strength, in comparison to fine silver. This clay is fired open shelf on a raised hard ceramic kiln shelf at 1675 °F / 913 °C - 2 hours, full ramp. <b>No</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>required.</b> Its shrinkage rate is smaller than other clays, at 10-11%.|$|R
50|$|Overall {{equipment}} effectiveness (OEE) {{is a set}} {{of performance}} metrics that fit well in a lean environment. Also, PMTS, methods-time measurement, cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and IT effectiveness in the operational processes. For example, Jun-Ing Ker and Yichuan Wang analyze two prescribing technologies, namely <b>no</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>required</b> (NCR) and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering, transcribing, and dispensing process in a multi-hospital health system. With comparison between these two technologies,the statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology. The results indicated a reduction of 54.5% in queue time, 32.4% in order entry time, 76.9% in outgoing delay time, and 67.7% in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology.|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{provides}} a lens of operation research {{for evaluating the}} use of technology on medication distribution systems in U.

We analyze two prescribing technologies, namely <b>no</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>required</b> (NCR) and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering, transcribing, and dispensing process in a multi-hospital health system. With comparison between these two technologies, the statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology. The results indicated a reduction of 54. 5 % in queue time, 32. 4 % in order entry time, 76. 9 % in outgoing delay time, and 67. 7 % in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology. We also conducted a cost analysis on each of the two technologies, illustrating that the total cost generated by using digital scanning was as low as 37. 31 % of that generated by NCR. Lessons learned about how to evaluate IT effectiveness by lean methods are presented for both theoretical and practical perspectives...|$|R
50|$|Under the {{previous}} system, a customer typically had to hand their card to a sales clerk {{to pay for}} a transaction. When credit cards were first introduced, merchants used mechanical (rather than magnetic) portable card imprinters that <b>required</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>paper</b> to make an imprint. They did not communicate electronically with the card issuer, and the card never left the customer's sight. The merchant had to verify transactions over a certain currency limit by telephoning the card issuer. During the 1970s in the United States, many merchants subscribed to a regularly-updated list of stolen or otherwise invalid credit cards numbers. This list was commonly printed in booklet form on newsprint, in numerical order, much like a slender phone book, yet without any data aside from the list of invalid numbers. Checkout cashiers were expected to thumb through this booklet each and every time a credit card was presented for payment of any amount, prior to approving the transaction, which incurred a short delay. This pause generally did not endear the credit card user to those waiting in line behind them.|$|R
