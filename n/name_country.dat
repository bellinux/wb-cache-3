2500|$|The Lower Dalälven has for a {{long time}} been {{recognized}} in Sweden as a remarkable site worthy of protection. In the 1960s, the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation engaged itself for the protection of Färnebofjärden, in particular the area of Tinäset, and made many inventories in the area. At the beginning of the 1970s, Stora AB tried to clear all the forests it owned {{in the northern part of}} Tinäset. In response the ornithologist Stig Holmstedt made contact with the Swedish nature conservation society and formed a group to work towards the protection of the zone, which led to the formation of a proposition for a national park in 1975. Only the commune of Sandviken took up the idea and formed the same year the nature reserve of Gysinge. In the following years, the geomorphology, fauna and flora of the Lower Dalälven were systematically inventoried. This began at the formulation of a protection plan by Naturvårdsverket and the concerned counties. In 1989, in the first directive for the creation of national parks established by Naturvårdsverket, Färnebofjärden was proposed as a future national park. In 1997, Färnebofjärden is proposed on the list of the Ramsar Convention, and, finally, the national park was established by the king on 10September 1998. The motive for creating the park was [...] "to preserve a unique fluvial landscape as well as rich forests and surrounding wetlands in a relatively intact state". It thus includes a large part of the old reserve of Gysinge, which accordingly was reformed in 1999 with all the zones not included in the park. On 19November 2001, the park was finally added to the Ramsar list. It is also included in the Natura 2000 Network. In 2011, the Lower Dalälven was classified as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO under the <b>name</b> <b>country</b> of the river Nedre Dalälven.|$|E
60|$|Such are the {{material}} {{points of the}} circumstantial relation furnished by Garcilasso de la Vega, one hundred and twenty years after the event. In regard to authority, he recollects to have heard the story {{when he was a}} child, as a subject of conversation between his father and the neighbors, and he refers to the histories of the Indies, by Acosta and Gomara, for confirmation. As the conversations to which he listened must have taken place sixty or seventy years after the date of the report, there had been sufficient time for the vague rumors to become arranged into a regular narrative, and thus we have not only the <b>name,</b> <b>country,</b> and destination of the pilot, but also the name of the unknown land to which his vessel was driven.|$|E
60|$|At length his own slave {{name was}} shouted; {{he was called}} up by the captain of his gang, and, while expecting some fresh punishment, or, maybe, to find himself sold into some {{domestic}} form of slavery, he was set before a Jewish agent, who, after examining him on his <b>name,</b> <b>country,</b> and station, and comparing his answers with a paper of instructions, informed {{him that he was}} ransomed, caused his fetters to be struck off, and shipped him off at once for Genoa, with orders to the captain to consign him to the merchant Signor del Battiste. By him Sir Eberhard had been received with the warmest hospitality, and treated as befitted his original station, but Battista disclaimed the merit of having ransomed him. He had but acted, he said, as the agent of an Austrian gentleman, from whom he had received orders to inquire after the Swabian baron who had been his fellow-captive, and, if he were still living, to pay his ransom, and bring him home.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{empirical}} analysis to provide new {{insight into the}} trade diversion effects of antidumping (AD) policy. Trade diversion is the shift in trade from <b>named</b> <b>countries</b> in an AD investigation to non-named countries. Previous studies have concluded that AD action causes a considerable drop in exports from <b>named</b> <b>countries,</b> however {{the extent to which}} trade is diverted to non-named countries is still an open debate. This paper examines to see whether AD action on <b>named</b> <b>countries</b> can have signaling effects on non-named countries. To examine the trade effects on non-named countries, a time series data at an 8 -digit product level is constructed for all cases initiated between 1997 and 2003 in the European Union. The paper provides evidence that antidumping policy has signaling effects on non-named imports...|$|R
