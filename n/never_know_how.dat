25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E

[...] Detective Timoshenko’s name is engraved on Panel 16-West, Line 26 of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC.|$|E

Smith embarked on a promotional tour, beginning {{at the end of}} October, with magazine, television and radio appearances. Appearances included Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, Sky News Sunrise, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The Paul O'Grady Show. Speaking about the album's promotion, Smith said [...] "t is always a struggle when a second album comes out because you <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it is going to do but fingers crossed people will enjoy it. I am very proud of it. ... I am excited about going on all the shows too – especially Ready Steady Cook because I can't cook and I think it will be fun." ...|$|E

500|$|A cast of Swedish and American actors {{contributed to}} the recording. While Sparks {{recorded}} the music in the United States, Wennersten oversaw the recording of the Swedish voice artists in Stockholm. Translation of the lyrics was also handled in Sweden: [...] "Since I do not speak Swedish, I will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> they managed," [...] Russell Mael said, expressing his appreciation for the efforts of everyone involved to translate the tone and spirit of the Maels' original text into Swedish lyrics. Sparks and Wennersten communicated mainly via an FTP server, with Sparks sending Wennersten their musical material, and Wennersten sending the edited Swedish voice recordings back to Sparks. Sparks were {{very pleased with the}} results of the collaboration, and the fact that Swedish actor Jonas Malmsjö, playing Bergman, had starred in several Bergman productions, enabling him to bring this personal experience to his portrayal of Bergman.|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{chose the}} most {{complicated}} scene, with the most dancers and choreography in the classic style of musical theater, to accompany an 18-second song ("The Mustard") [...] "to {{get it out of}} the way" [...] for more personal numbers later in the episode. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com considers this [...] "brilliant because it frees even people who hate musicals to settle into the story without getting hung up on the genre's conventions". The musical styles span from a jaunty 1950s sitcom arrangement of the Buffy theme in the opening credits—the only episode in the series to begin without the normal version of the theme song and full cast roll, signifying a genre shift—to Anya's hard-rock version of [...] "Bunnies". Whedon assigned Emma Caulfield the rock-opera format because Caulfield often sang in such a way to him on the set. Spike's [...] "Rest in Peace" [...] is also a rock song, which Whedon wrote after completing the episode's first song, Tara's [...] "Under Your Spell", a contemporary pop song with radio-play potential. Xander and Anya's duet—the most fun to shoot but difficult to write, according to Whedon—is inspired by Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers comedies as evidenced by the silken pajama costumes and art deco apartment setting. Musically, the song uses influences from Ira Gershwin, a Charleston rhythm, and jazz-like chord slides. Giles' [...] "Standing" [...] is a ballad to Buffy that she does not hear, unlike the songs revealing truths elsewhere in the episode. Whedon shot the scene so that Giles moves in real time while Buffy works out in slow motion, to accentuate Giles' distance from her. Buffy's not hearing his song was intentional; Whedon explained, [...] "You can sing to someone in musicals and they can <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> you feel or how much you love them, even if they're standing right in front of you".|$|E

2500|$|The Empress was an inveterate traveller, horsewoman, {{and fashion}} maven who was rarely seen in Vienna. Sisi was obsessed about {{preserving}} her beauty, carrying out many bizarre routines and strenuous [...] exercise, {{and as a}} result suffered from ill health. She was stabbed to death by an Italian anarchist in 1898 while on a visit to Geneva. A few days after the funeral, Robert of Parma {{wrote in a letter to}} his friend Tirso de Olazábal that [...] "It was pitiful to look at the Emperor, he showed a great deal of energy in his immense pain, but at times one could see all the immensity of his grief." [...] Franz Joseph never fully recovered from the loss. According to the future empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma he usually told his relatives: [...] "You'll <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> important she was to me" [...] or, according to some sources, [...] "You will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much I loved this woman." ...|$|E

He was also {{highly critical of the}} bugs, citing a mission which couldn't be completed until the sound effects were turned off, and another which crashes when the player zooms in or out.
