25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or <b>noils</b> remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|E
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath.

40|$|X-ray microtomography, image {{processing}} and Weibull statistical methods {{were used to}} characterize the length and width distributions of <b>noil</b> hemp fibres before and after composite fabrication. X-ray microtomography provided direct observations and accurate measurements of length and width of <b>noil</b> hemp fibres within the hemp–polypropylene composite matrix. The effects of the weight content of the <b>noil</b> hemp fibre {{and the addition of}} compatibilizer on the fibre breakage and tensile strength of the composites were studied. The results indicated that the tensile strength of the <b>noil</b> hemp fibre reinforced composites without the coupling agent was lower than that of pure polypropylene. Fibre–fibre interaction mechanism indicated that high hemp content caused more fibre breakage. The addition of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) coupling agent improved the tensile strength of the composites by the enhanced fibre/matrix interfacial adhesion. The addition of MAPP also reduced the fibre breakage due to the better dispersion of fibres. ...|$|R
50|$|Silk <b>noil</b> {{may also}} be made from the short fibres, {{directly}} sourced from the silkworm cocoons. Rather than the continuous length of silk, shorter fibers, which are generally not used to create high quality silk are used for Silk <b>Noil,</b> which has a slightly rough texture. It is relatively weaker and has low resilience. It tends to have very low lustre, which makes it appear more like cotton - than silk.|$|R

50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and circular combing. The Noble comb {{is an example of}} circular combing. The French comb is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When combing wool, the discarded short fibers are called <b>noils,</b> and are ground up into shoddy.|$|E

40|$|Natural fibre-reinforced {{composites}} {{have attracted}} great research and economic interests {{because of their}} outstanding 'green' characteristics compared with glass fibre-reinforced composites. It {{is very important to}} understand the processing effect on the natural fibre-reinforced composites mechanical properties because of the natural fibre degradation characteristics. Optimizing the fabrication process, especially the compounding process, is effective to achieve the optimal properties of the composites. In this research a natural fibre, <b>noil</b> hemp fibre, was applied to reinforce polypropylene with internal mixing process. The influence of compounding parameters, such as mixing temperature, mixing time and rotor speed, on the mechanical properties (tensile strength, flexural strength and impact strength) of the <b>noil</b> hemp fibre/polypropylene composites was investigated using orthogonal method and the evidence of thermogravimetric analysis test of fibre and the observation of fibre dispersion in resin. The range analysis and variance of analysis demonstrated that the mixing temperature has significant effect on the three mechanical properties, mixing time has minor influence on the tensile and flexural strengths, and rotor speed mainly affects the impact strength. The thermogravimetric analysis test of <b>noil</b> hemp fibre and the fibre dispersion in resin show that a combination of low mixing temperature, short mixing time and high rotor speed of compounding process is helpful to achieve certain fibre dispersion without serious thermal degradation of fibre. <b>Noil</b> hemp fibre/polypropylene composites with the best comprehensive mechanical properties could be obtained at 165 degree C for 12 min with rotor speed 50 r/min. ...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} (tensile, flexural, and impact) {{of ground}} hemp fibre polypropylene composites were investigated. Ground alkali-treated hemp fibre and <b>noil</b> hemp fibres with various initial fibre lengths were utilized to reinforce polypropylene matrix. Firstly, the microstructural and tensile characterizations {{of the two}} types of fibres were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR), and Dynamic Mechanical Analyser (DMA). Then, the fibres were ground into different lengths of 0. 2, 0. 5, 1, and 2 [*]mm; composites containing 40 [*]wt% short hemp fibre and 5 [*]wt% maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) were fabricated by means of a twin screw extruder and an injection moulding machine. Finally, influence of hemp fibre type and initial hemp fibre length on tensile property of the composites were investigated. The results revealed that addition of either <b>noil</b> hemp fibre or normal treated hemp fibre into the pure polypropylene matrix increased the tensile strength almost twice and stiffness of the composites more than three times. Although <b>noil</b> hemp fibre composite indicated slightly lower mechanical properties than the normal alkali-treated fibre composites, the difference was not significant.
