40|$|The {{research}} was conducted at PT. XYZ which is a manufacturing company engaged {{in the manufacture of}} spare parts of screwpress and digester. The study was conducted only in the manufacture of spare parts of screwpress, namely protection <b>nut,</b> <b>screw</b> worm, cone guide, dismentling plate, cone, pin & coupling nut, strainer, extension shaft, intermediate gear, and flexible coupling. The flow pattern at PT. XYZ is job shop and produced by make to order, each product has a different process flow, sequence and timing of different processes, but through the facilities of the same engine, so may result in idle time on a machine and the accumulation of another job on the machine. PT. XYZ used production scheduling by FCFS rule that still result in a delay in the completion of orders and there was so much undone job because makespan values was too large. The {{purpose of this study was}} to minimize the makespan, namely the Tabu Search Algorithm. Results from this study is the reduction occurred from time to schedule company with Tabu Search Algorithm is from 141. 22 hours or minutes become 132. 14 8473. 2 7928. 4 hours or minutes. Relative Error shows that the savings obtained makespan between Tabu Search Algorithm with the method of company is 6. 8715 % and the value of Efficiency Index is 1. 068715. It can be concluded that the Tabu Search Algorithm produces a smaller makespan than the company actual scheduling...|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of furniture corner joints is often {{carried out by}} assembling double thread (“Trio”) nuts and metal corners. Such connections are particularly suitable for disassemble bal structures and these connections are also used for savings in transport when all the structural elements are transported in boxes and furniture is prepared for in site assembly. The assembly process consists of fastening the binding metal corners to wooden elements with the metric thread screws. To achieve the optimal quality of these joints, the production process must {{comply with the requirements}} of various products including the loading applications and strength of individual wood species. This paper examines the fundamental factors affecting the quality of such joints. Special attention was paid to the process of screwing and loading capacity of double thread nuts in three different types of wood. Optimization of the technological process was set as the ultimate goal aimed at achieving a high level of product quality. Tests have been conducted on fi r, beech and oak wood to determine optimal bore diameters and <b>nut</b> <b>screwing</b> parameters relative to the screwing resistance, extraction force and the time interval required for <b>nut</b> <b>screwing...</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>screw</b> and <b>nut</b> {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning {{engagement with the}} threads of the <b>nut</b> and <b>screw,</b> shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the <b>screw.</b> The <b>nut</b> assembly typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers. The cam rings have opposing cams aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from <b>nut</b> and <b>screw,</b> and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the nut assembly (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to <b>nut</b> and <b>screw,</b> the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|R
