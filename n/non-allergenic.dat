40|$|Fining agents {{derived from}} animal and mineral sources {{are widely used}} to clarify and {{stabilize}} white wines.

In this study, our aim is to validate the potential of <b>non-allergenic</b> protein extracts, obtained from an alternative and safe source, naturally present in wine: oenological yeasts. Three untreated white wines were used in this work in order to evaluate the impact of these novel yeast protein extracts (YPE) in terms of the wine clarification and stabilization improvement. Two separated fining trials were thus conducted at laboratory scale and the yeast alternatives were compared with reference fining agents, obtained from mineral, animal and vegetable origins. Our results indicate that yeast protein extracts were capable to promote (i) brilliance/color improvement, (ii) turbidity reduction (76 - 89 % comparing with the untreated wines) and (iii) production of compact and homogeneous lees (44 % smaller volume than obtained with bentonite). Additionally, after submitting wines to natural and forced oxidations, YPE treatments revealed (iv) different forms of colloidal stabilization, by presenting comparable or superior effects when particularly compared to casein.

40|$|Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Sunn pest) is {{the most}} {{damaging}} insect pest of wheat in areas of North Africa, Eastern Europe and Western and Central Asia. Sunn pest injects an enzyme characterized as a prolyl endylprotease (spPEP) into wheat grains that digests the gluten protein (Darkoh et al., 2010). Previous {{studies have shown that}} casein peptides generated by Lactobacillus species have inhibitory effects on human (hPEP) and bacterial prolyl endoproteases (bPEP) which makes casein a good natural candidate to inhibit spPEP. Developing biopesticides for food products from αS 1 casein is complicated due to some allergenic amino acid sequences. Ruiter et al (2005) identified a <b>non-allergenic</b> peptide region on αS 1 casein that includes a previously identified inhibitory sequence (LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG) to hPEP (Jeanneret, 2011).

40|$|Photoactivation and binding of photoactive {{chemicals}} to proteins is a known prerequisite {{for the formation}} of immunogenic photoantigens and the induction of photoallergy. The intensive use of products and the availability of new chemicals, along with an increasing exposure to sun light contribute to the risk of photosensitizing adverse reactions. Dendritic cells (DC) play a pivotal role in the induction of allergic contact dermatitis. Human peripheral blood monocyte derived dendritic cells (PBMDC) were thus perceived as an obvious choice {{for the development of a}} novel in vitro photosensitization assay using the modulation of cell surface protein expression in response to photosensitizing agents. In this new protocol, known chemicals with photosensitizing, allergenic or <b>non-allergenic</b> potential were pre-incubated with PBMDCs prior to UVA irradiation (1 J/cm 2). Following a 48 h incubation, the expression of the cell surface molecules CD 86, HLA-DR and CD 83 was measured by flow cytometry. All tested photosensitizers induced a significant and dose-dependent increase of CD 86 expression after irradiation compared to non-irradiated controls. Moreover, the phototoxicity of the chemicals could also be determined. In contrast, (i) CD 86 expression was not affected by the chosen irradiation conditions, (ii) increased CD 86 expression induced by allergens was independent of irradiation and (iii) no PBMDC activation was observed with the <b>non-allergenic</b> control.

40|$|Only a {{small number}} of protein homologues cause the {{majority}} of allergies. There is no consensus structure or other obvious common denominator discriminating the few proteins that are allergens from thousands of other, <b>non-allergenic</b> proteins. By database sequence homology searching, we here show that to date known allergen sequences have no or few bacterial homologues, in contrast to randomly selected control protein sequences. This finding suggests a novel common denominator for allergens of potential use for allergen prediction programs. A possible interpretation of this finding is that allergens are proteins which are exposed to the immune system and which lack bacterial homologues. This interpretation is discussed in relation to the many observations that allergies coincide with a delayed establishment of infant gut flora. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
