The TD04 compressor has a compressor bypass valve built right into the compressor housing. The exhaust manifold and turbine housing were cast in one piece by Mitsubishi from high-nickel <b>Ni-Resist</b> steel.

The turbine discharge was {{also part of the}} manifold/turbine housing casting, and it looped back around and hit the manifold again {{on its way to the}} catalytic converter. Where they met, there was a wastegate valve; keeping the wastegate valve away from the turbine housing improved flow where it mattered most. Maximum boost in stock form was around [...] Piston velocities and valve-train components force a rev limit of 6240 rpm although MOPAR upped the ante with their Stage 2 and 3 kits which have a rev limit of 6500 rpm.|$|E
40|$|For {{engineering}} reasons, ductile <b>Ni-resist</b> alloys {{are widely}} used in oil and gas, automotive industries and elevated temperature purposes. Ductile <b>Ni-resist</b> offers an advantage because this alloy has an austenitic structure at all temperatures.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{behavior of}} two ductile cast irons {{was investigated in}} synthetic diesel and gasoline exhaust gases. The alloys were a SiMo (Fe 3. 86 Si 0. 6 Mo 3 C) and a <b>Ni-Resist</b> (Fe 32 Ni 5. 3 Si 2. 1 C). Polished sections were exposed at temperatures between 650 and 1, 050 degrees C, mostly for 50 h. The oxidation product was characterized by means of SEM/EDX, AES, XPS and XRD. Iron oxides nodules formed above a continuous layer of Fe-Si-oxide for SiMo. The alloy failed in forming a continuous silica layer at low temperatures. At 850 degrees and above silica was formed, but austenite formation enhanced the decarburization. Escaping CO/CO 2 increased the oxide porosity, and consequently the oxidation rate. The oxidation resistance of <b>Ni-Resist</b> was dependent on Cr assisting the formation of SiO 2. However, this effect was restrained to cell boundaries in particular when water enhanced the Cr evaporation or the diffusion was slow at low temperatures.

40|$|The work is {{particularly}} aimed at metallurgical problems connected with manufacture of castings of weight about 1 up to 40 tons from high-alloy austenitic nickel cast irons also known under the trade name <b>Ni-resist.</b> The main {{aim is to}} check and complement the knowledge about manufacture of heavy castings from austenitic nickel cast irons {{in a field of}} control of tapping and casting temperature, carbon content control with regard to the prediction of eutectic composition and in a field of setting a suitable chemical composition of cast iron with regard to the formation of chunky graphite and stability of the austenitic matrix and further on also possibilities of cast iron filtration during pouring the castings. Based on done experiments the formulae were determined that enable to calculate eutectic and liquidus temperatures on the basis of chemical composition of the cast iron. The use of several formulae given in the literature for calculating the carbon equivalent of austenitic nickel cast irons was compared and evaluated. For utilization of determined results in practice a calculating programme has been compiled making possible to be used in operational practice.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, tougher {{competition}} and stiffer government policies {{have forced the}} automotive industry into a race for safer, cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles at low cost. As a consequence, exhaust systems should resist to increased working temperatures. This trend towards higher peak firing temperatures is mainly intended to decrease fuel-consumption and exhaust gas emissions. Thus, the demands on mechanical and oxidation properties at high temperature of the alloys increase, and a better understanding is needed to improve these properties. This thesis concerns the high temperature corrosion of cast heat-resistant irons and steels, intended for exhaust manifolds and turbocharger housings, in dry air {{as well as in}} synthetic diesel and petrol exhaust gases. The examined alloys were two ductile irons, a SiMo (Fe 3. 9 Si 0. 6 Mo 3 C) and a <b>Ni-Resist</b> (Fe 32 Ni 5. 3 Si 1. 8 Cr 2. 1 C), and two cast heat-resistant stainless steels, one ferritic (Fe 18 Cr 1. 4 Nb 2. 1 Mn 0. 32 C) and one austenitic (Fe 20 Cr 9 Ni 1. 9 Nb 2. 7 W 0. 5 C). Primarily, coupons were oxidised for 50 h at 650 °C- 1050 °C. The effect of LCF on the oxidation process was also studied. Detailed analyses of the oxide scales, by means of XRD, SEM/EDX, and AES, were done to characterise the oxides growth. Models, based on thermodynamics and kinetics, were proposed for the oxidation of these alloys. Both cast irons developed a thick and porous outer Fe-oxide that nucleated preferentially at the former graphite nodules. The inner oxide on SiMo consisted of Fe-Si-oxide and (Fe,Si,Cr) oxides in an unoxidised (Ni,Fe) matrix for <b>Ni-Resist.</b> Both alloys failed in forming a continuous protective oxide layer at 650 °C or 750 °C within 50 h due to slow diffusion processes. At 850 ºC and above, interfacial SiO 2 was formed. However, decarburisation, and for <b>Ni-Resist</b> enhanced evaporation of Cr species, led to accelerated oxidation rates and fundamental differences in the oxide structure. The oxidation behaviours of the two cast stainless steels were strongly related to the microstructures. Interdendritic non-Cr carbides initiated thick oxides. The ferritic cast steel exhibited an interesting combination of (Mn,Cr) spinel, an intermediate Cr 2 O 3 layer and an interfacial SiO 2 film. The scale remained adherent and protective at all temperatures in all gases. Water vapour-induced Cr-evaporation was reduced, plausibly by the outer (Mn,Cr) spinel. Segregation of Cr during casting accelerated the formation of the Fe oxide nodules in the centre of the dendrites in the austenitic alloy. The alloy was very sensitive to water vapour and susceptible to catastrophic oxidation at 1050 °C in petrol gases. Low cycle fatigue promoted the nucleation of pits and nodules. Cracking and re-healing of the oxides accelerated the Si- or Cr-depletions leading to faster oxidation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{turbine housing}} of a {{turbocharger}} {{is exposed to}} extensive cyclic thermo-mechanical loading. This leads to multi-axial stress states with local plastifications, so that {{the design of the}} turbine housing becomes a major challenge in ensuring the guaranteed lifetime in relation to the high-temperature behavior of the materials. The first step was to develop and validate a phenomenological lifetime estimation approach, in conjunction with a constitutive material model applied in a preceding Finite-Element analysis, for application on the casting materials <b>Ni-resist</b> D 5 S and GJV. A satisfactory estimation of the number of cycles until crack initiation, by considering creep fatigue interaction, was demonstrated on specimens subject to characteristic load conditions derived by a critical plane approach.

40|$|Within the {{presented}} research, {{effect of}} annealing on nature of corrosion damages of medium-nickel austenitic {{nodular cast iron}} castings, containing 5. 5 % to 10. 3 % Ni, was determined. Concentration of nickel, lower than in the <b>Ni-Resist</b> cast iron, was compensated with additions of other austenite-stabilising elements (manganese and copper). In consequence, raw castings with austenitic matrix structure and gravimetrically measured corrosion resistance increasing along with nickel equivalent value EquNi were obtained. Annealing of raw castings, aimed at obtaining nearly equilibrium structures, led to partial austenite-to-martensite transformation in the alloys with EquNi value of ca. 16 %. However, corrosion resistance of the annealed alloys did not decrease in comparison to raw castings. Annealing of castings with EquNi value above 18 % did not cause any structural changes, but resulted in higher corrosion resistance demonstrated by smaller depth of corrosion pits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Brine {{recirculation}} {{pumps are}} essential components used for circulation of brine in multi-stage flashing chambers desalination plants. Failure of these pumps {{would result in}} shutdown of the desalination plants. The rotating parts of these pumps (shaft and impeller) are usually made out of stainless steels or Duplex stainless steels. The pressure parts (casings) are usually made out of <b>Ni-resist</b> ductile irons (NDI). In recent years {{there have been a}} number of cases in which NDI casing materials failed by stress corrosion cracking (SCC) especially in the Arabian Gulf region. This makes re-evaluation and further studies on the performance of these materials of paramount importance due to process-related economic and reliability considerations. As possible substitutes to NDI casing materials, the authors of this research have recently published material demonstrating the superiority of the SCC resistance of the super DSS, UNS S 32750, over the ASS, UNS S 31603, in hot brine environment. Economically, the idea of using chemical corrosion inhibitors to enhance the SCC resistance of the ASS, UNS S 31603, is appealing, non famous and worth looking at. In this work the effect of corrosion inhibition on the corrosion resistance and SCC of the ASS, UNS S 31603, in hot brine environment, is investigated. Brine water was injected with typical treat rate of 350 ppm of passivating type commercially available Molybdate corrosion inhibitor. Theoreticall...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of {{aluminum die casting}} as enclosures where internal equipment is rotating inside of the casting and could fracture requires a strong housing to restrain the fractured parts. A typical example would be a supercharger. In case of a failure, unless adequately contained, fractured parts could injure people operating the equipment. A number of potential reinforcement materials were investigated. The initial work was conducted in sand molds to create experimental conditions that promote prolonged contact of the reinforcing material with molten aluminum. Bonding of Aluminum bronze, Cast iron, and <b>Ni-resist</b> inserts with various electroplated coatings and surface treatments were analyzed. Also toughening of A 354 aluminum cast alloy by steel and stainless steel wire mesh with various conditions was analyzed. A practical approach to reinforcement of die cast aluminum components {{is to use a}} reinforcing steel preform. Such performs can be fabricated from steel wire mesh or perforated metal sheet by stamping or deep drawing. A hemispherical, dome shaped casting was selected in this investigation. A deep drawing die was used to fabricate the reinforcing performs. The tendency of aluminum cast enclosures to fracture could be significantly reduced by installing a wire mesh of austenitic stainless steel or a punched austenitic stainless steel sheet within the casting. The use of reinforcements made of austenitic stainless steel wire mesh or punched austenitic stainless steel sheet provided marked improvement in reducing the fragmentation of the casting. The best strengthening was obtained with austenitic stainless steel wire and with a punched stainless steel sheet without annealing this material. Somewhat lower results were obtained with the annealed punched stainless steel sheet. When the annealed 1020 steel wire mesh was used, the results were only slightly improved because of the lower mechanical properties of this unalloyed steel. The lowest results were obtained with unreinforced 356 aluminum casting. Good strength can be obtained with a sound die casting without any defects produced by squeeze casting. The use of higher pressure to produce the squeeze casting has been shown to increase the strength of a hemispherical dome casting. This dome shape casting has been produced both with and without reinforcement and tested to determine its pressure resistance under internal pressure of water. Only a slight improvement in strength could be determined because of water leaks at the seal between hemispherical dome and its flat supporting side. However, when the ability of the casting was tested under the compressive force of a plunger, the strengthening effect of wire mesh or sheet was evident. Higher loads to failure were obtained because of the reinforcement of the stainless steel wire and punched sheet. Rather than a sudden failure occurring, the reinforcement of the stainless steel wire or the punched hard stainless steel sheet held the material together and prevented any loss of the fractured casting to the surroundings. Unalloyed steel did not have the required strength or mechanical properties to increase the properties of the casting...|$|E
