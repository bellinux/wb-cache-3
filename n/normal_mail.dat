2500|$|Although FidoNet {{supported}} file attachments {{from even}} the earliest standards, this feature {{tended to be}} rarely used and was often turned off. File attachments followed the <b>normal</b> <b>mail</b> routing through multiple systems, and could back up transfers all along the line as the files were copied. A solution was offered {{in the form of}} file requests, which made file transfers driven by the calling system and used one-time point-to-point connections instead of the traditional routing. Two such standards became common, [...] "WaZOO" [...] and [...] "Bark", which saw varying support among different mailers. Both worked in a similar fashion, with the mailer calling the remote system and sending a new handshake packet to request the files.|$|E

25|$|Military mail {{systems are}} often subsidized {{to ensure that}} {{military}} mail does not cost the sender any more than <b>normal</b> domestic <b>mail.</b> In some cases, military personnel in a combat zone may post letters and/or packages to their home country for free.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a letter}} carrier uses a push cart, the <b>normal</b> 35-pound <b>mail</b> load limit does not apply. The two satchels on the cart are filled to {{capacity}} on each use, which could {{be as much as}} twice the normal 35-pound over-the-shoulder satchel mail load limit.|$|R
500|$|Smith was {{involved}} in another incident that scared him to death. One day when he was flying his <b>normal</b> air <b>mail</b> route from Hadley Field to Cleveland, he caught {{something out of the}} corner of his eye that looked like a skyscraper. He pulled back on the control stick to [...] quickly gain altitude and just missed hitting the U.S. Navy airship USS Los Angeles that was in his direct path. It was a close call of just over a hundred feet.|$|R

50|$|In the Netherlands, freepost is {{addressed}} {{exactly the same}} as <b>normal</b> <b>mail.</b> The recipient needs a special address: an answering number (antwoordnummer in Dutch). The sender can distinguish these addresses because they include the word 'antwoordnummer' and may choose whether or not to use a stamp. When no stamp is used, the recipient pays the costs plus a fee, but when the sender uses a stamp, no extra costs are made.|$|E
50|$|Rural {{carriers}} {{are responsible for}} furnishing all vehicle equipment necessary for safe and prompt handling of the mail, unless a USPS-owned/leased vehicle is assigned to the route. (If a USPS-owned/leased vehicle is assigned to the route, relief carriers may be requested, but not required, to furnish a vehicle during emergency situations). The vehicle is required to {{be large enough to}} accommodate the <b>normal</b> <b>mail</b> volume and constructed to protect the mail from loss or damage.|$|E
25|$|The Army Postal Service (APS), {{functions}} as a government-operated military mail system in India. A primary feature of Army Postal Service systems is that normally they are subsidized to ensure that military mail posted between duty stations abroad and the home country (or vice versa) does not cost the sender any more than <b>normal</b> domestic <b>mail</b> traffic. In some cases, Indian military personnel in a combat zone may post letters and/or packages to the home country for free, while in others, senders located in a specific overseas area may send military mail to another military recipient, also located in the same overseas area, without charge.|$|R
5000|$|Apart from Antyodaya and Jan Sadharan trains, un{{reserved}}/general {{coaches are}} non reserved coaches on <b>normal</b> Express / <b>Mail.</b> The restriction on such coaches is for 24 hours journey.

50|$|Occasionally, {{because of}} {{political}} instability when a post office could not provide <b>normal</b> services, incoming <b>mail</b> from a mail steamer would be delivered to a local delivery service, which would deliver the mail and charge the addressee an extra fee for the service. When this occurred, the local delivery service would place its own local service stamp or mark on the envelope when the extra fee was paid.|$|R
50|$|Some {{commentators}} have described Pegasus Mail as convoluted and cumbersome to configure, whereas others value Pegasus Mail for the features it offers. Pegasus has the facility, not provided by all mail clients, optionally to download headers only, allowing {{the user to}} select mail to ignore for now and deal with later, download and delete from the server (<b>normal</b> <b>mail</b> operation), download {{a copy of a}} message while leaving it on the server, or delete without downloading. Mail may be marked by the user as read or unread, overriding the default setting.|$|E

5000|$|SMTP is a {{delivery}} protocol only. In <b>normal</b> use, <b>mail</b> is [...] "pushed" [...] to a destination mail server (or next-hop mail server) as it arrives. Mail is routed {{based on the}} destination server, not the individual user(s) {{to which it is}} addressed. Other protocols, such as the Post Office Protocol (POP) and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are specifically designed for use by individual users retrieving messages and managing mail boxes. To permit an intermittently-connected mail server to pull messages from a remote server on demand, SMTP has a feature to initiate mail queue processing on a remote server (see Remote Message Queue Starting below). POP and IMAP are unsuitable protocols for relaying mail by intermittently-connected machines; they are designed to operate after final delivery, when information critical to the correct operation of mail relay (the [...] "mail envelope") has been removed.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Terminology== Confusion arises {{because of}} {{the wide variety of}} terms by which similar armors are known. Banded mail has been {{described}} as [...] "a form of mail reinforced with bands of leather", as [...] "overlapping horizontal strips of laminated metal sewn over a backing of <b>normal</b> chain <b>mail</b> and soft leather backing" [...] and as [...] "many thin sheets of metal are hammered or riveted together". The last description more closely fits splinted armor, which consists of long metal splints connected by mail/leather used for arm and leg protection. The final description of metal plates riveted to a sub-strate describe a coat of plates or brigandine, all of which consist of metal plates riveted to a leather or cloth fronting. Finally, armor constructed of rows of plates or platelets sewn or laced together, without backing/fronting, would be considered [...] "laminar". The current term for small metal plates joined together by chainmail is plated mail.|$|R
50|$|The company's first {{project was}} a Hungarian {{language}} play-by-mail game, Land of Survivors (Hungarian name: Túlélők Földje) programmed by Miklós Tihor in Borland C. Land of Survivors is a fantasy role-playing game, players develop their heroes by adventuring {{in a large}} playing area. The game is divided into turns. Each turn, a players sends his commands for his hero on a postcard to Beholder. They input the commands, and as a result, a laser-printed description of his adventures are sent back to him in mail. As of 2010, the game is still running, although most players send and get their turns in email instead of <b>normal</b> <b>mail.</b> There are players who are playing Land of Survivors for more than 10 years.|$|E
5000|$|Shigofumi {{primarily}} {{centers around}} a young-looking girl named Fumika {{who works as}} a mail carrier to deliver [...] "after death letters" [...] (shigofumi). These letters are written by people after they die and are delivered to the person the letter is addressed to in the living world. The letters contain things that the now-deceased could not say while they were alive, such as things they wanted to say before they died, or even to inform others about who killed them {{in the case of a}} murder. Accompanying Fumika is her talking staff Kanaka which can also float of its own accord and likes to be treated as if [...] "she" [...] were a human. In contrast to Fumika who is quiet and serious about her job, Kanaka is loud and boisterous. The story follows Fumika and Kanaka as they interact with the living via the shigofumi. Shigofumi mail carriers are assigned a specific area that they deliver letters to, just like a <b>normal</b> <b>mail</b> carrier. When they are not delivering letters from the dead, they are in another realm called Shigo. The mail carriers are usually now-dead humans who do not age, and take on the appearance of just before they died, but Fumika does age, signifying that she is not dead yet.|$|E

40|$|The Anderson {{transition}} in a 3 D system with symplectic symmetry is investigated numerically. From a one-parameter scaling analysis the critical exponent ν of the localization length is extracted and {{estimated to be}} ν = 1. 3 ± 0. 2. The level statistics at the critical point are also analyzed and shown to be scale independent. The form of the energy level spacing distribution P(s) at the critical point {{is found to be}} different from that for the orthogonal ensemble suggesting that the breaking of spin rotation symmetry is relevant at the critical point.
