It is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>who</b> his parents were, {{although}} they may have been George Wilkes, a cabinet maker, and Helen. Little is known of his upbringing before he became a law clerk for Enoch E. Camp. Wilkes left the legal profession for journalism, first working for a series of short-lived newspapers in New York City, the Flash, the Whip, and the Subterranean. He wrote and edited the Sunday Flash under a pseudonym, [...] "Startle". Among other topics, the Sunday Flash rated New York's brothels and published descriptions and reviews of them. He lost a libel case and was sentenced to a term in the city jail, the Tombs. After serving a month in jail, Wilkes wrote a pamphlet entitled The Mysteries of the Tombs: A Journal of Thirty Days Imprisonment in the N. Y. City Prison, which came out in 1844 and was based on his experiences in jail. Wilkes studied law after his stint in jail, and even called himself an attorney for a short time.|$|E

Very often, they conflict— most often, as a matter of fact.... I'm leading a normal life and right alongside me there is this myth, and it is growing and mushrooming and getting more and more warped.

2500|$|Among {{international}} film critics, {{the film has}} experienced a similar re-evaluation. Every ten years since 1952, the British Film Institute's film magazine Sight & Sound has asked the world's leading film critics to compile {{a list of the}} 10 best films of all time. Not until 1982 did Vertigo enter the list, and then in 7th place. By 1992 it had advanced to 4th place, by 2002 to 2nd. Vertigo was voted in first place in Sight & Sounds 2012 poll of the greatest films of all time, both in the crime genre and in general, displacing Orson Welles' Citizen Kane from the position it had occupied since 1962. Commenting upon the 2012 results, the magazine's editor Nick James said that Vertigo was [...] "the ultimate critics' film. It is a dream-like film about people who are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>who</b> they are but who are busy reconstructing themselves and each other to fit a kind of cinema ideal of the ideal soul-mate." [...] In recent years, critics have noted that the casting of James Stewart as a character who becomes disturbed and obsessive ultimately enhances the film's unconventionality and effectiveness as suspense, since Stewart had previously been known as an actor of warmhearted roles.|$|E
2500|$|Fr. Sorin {{decided that}} these plans were too grandiose, {{and that the}} church could not cost more than half that sum, since at the moment they had only about $8,000 dollars at hand. In January 1870, a new architect, Mr. T. Brady from St. Louis, drew new plans for the church. It is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>who</b> drew the {{definite}} plans, but {{it is likely that}} also Fr. Sorin, [...] Rev. Alexis Granger, C.S.C., and Irish-born Brother Charles Borromeo Harding, C.S.C., a hard-working, self-taught campus builder were part of the planning and building. The new church was erected in Gothic style rather than baroque, reflecting Fr. Sorin's French taste and his will to build a remarkable and striking landmark. Work on the foundations for the new church began in the spring of 1870, and the cornerstone was laid on May 31, 1871, with six bishops present, including Cincinnati Archbishop John Purcell. The building took many years to finish and underwent many changes. [...] As soon as it was inhabitable, university leaders installed an organ and held functions and celebrations in the unfinished building. [...] Bishop Joseph Gregory Dwenger finally consecrated the new sanctuary on August 15, 1888. In 1931, it underwent its first thorough renovation by designed by New York architect Wilfred E. Anthony. [...] In 1968, the church was renovated with the intention of bringing it in line with the liturgical reform of the Second Vatican Council, although some claim that renovations of this type were not mandated by the Council. The church again received a renovation 20 years later, executed by Conrad Schmitt Studios. The conservation and restoration of the historic stained glass windows, created in Le Mans, France, was one of the studio's largest single projects, with 116 windows and over 1,200 panels of glass. On January 17, 1992, Pope John Paul II raised the Church of the Sacred Heart to the status of Minor basilica. This designation is one factor in making it a popular destination for approximately 50,000 pilgrims and tourists who visit annually. From 1977 through 1997, Rev. Daniel R. Jenky, C.S.C., of the Diocese of Peoria, Illinois, served as rector of the basilica, before he became head of the religious community there and later Auxiliary Bishop and vicar general of The Dioceseof Fort Wayne–South Bend and later Bishop of the [...] Diocese of Peoria, Illinois. Under his tenure, the church was elevated to a basilica.|$|E
