The aim of this program is to increase the autonomy and quality of life of persons with tetraplegia in domestic and vocational environments. Taking advantage of its experience in <b>nuclear</b> <b>robotics,</b> the CEA has supported studies dealing with the use of such technical aids in the medical area since 1975 with the SPARTACUS project, followed by MASTER 10 years later, and its European extension in the framework of the TIDE/RAID program. The present system is composed of a fixed robotized workstation that includes a six-axis SCARA robot mounted on a rail to allow horizontal movement and is equipped with tools for various tasks. The Operator Interface (OI) has been carefully adapted to the most severe tetraplegia. Results are given following a 2 -year evaluation in real-life situations...|$|E
40|$|Remote {{response}} {{technology has}} {{advanced to the}} extent that a robot system, if properly designed and deployed, may greatly help respond to beyond-design-basis accidents at nuclear power plants. Particularly {{in the aftermath of the}} Fukushima accident, there is increasing interest in developing disaster robots that can be deployed in lieu of a human operator to the field to perform mitigating actions in the harsh environment caused by extreme natural hazards. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>robotics</b> team of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) is also endeavoring to construct disaster robots and, first of all, is interested in finding out to what extent safety benefits can be achieved by such a disaster robotic system. This paper discusses a new approach based on the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) technique, which can be used to quantify safety benefits associated with disaster robots, along with a case study for seismic-induced station blackout condition. The results indicate that to avoid core damage in this special case a robot system with reliability > 0. 65 is needed because otherwise core damage is inevitable. Therefore, considerable efforts are needed to improve the reliability of disaster robots, because without assurance of high reliability, remote response techniques will not be practically used...|$|E
40|$|Determining {{the spin}} {{properties}} of novel materials {{is necessary for}} the development of proposed spin-based information processing devices, or spintronics. While existing optical techniques work for some semiconductors, they are ineffective for other strategic material systems. In this dissertation, we explore gallium arsenide bismuthide alloys and irradiated gallium arsenide using conventional methods. We then introduce the novel techniques of Resonant and Time Resolved Spin Noise which may enable optical studies of previously inaccessible materials. Gallium arsenide bismuthide has a large tunable spin-orbit splitting, which could be desirable for spintronic applications. Hanle effect measurements reveal that the product of the g factor and effective spin lifetime (gTs) ranges from 0. 8 ns at 40 K to 0. 1 ns at 120 K, while below 40 K there was negligible change. The temperature dependence of gTs shows evidence of thermally activated behavior attributed to hole localization at Bi or Bi cluster sites. Modern electronics are sensitive to radiation damage and require extensive modification for use in space, <b>nuclear</b> <b>robotics,</b> and other environments, but the effects of long term exposure on spin properties had not previously been investigated. Time Resolved Kerr Rotation measurements of irradiated gallium arsenide reveal robust spin behavior to 5 MeV protons up to a 10 ^ 14 p/cm^ 2 fluence, even as photoluminescence intensity decreases by two orders of magnitude. Spin noise measurements are sensitive and capable of surpassing more established methods. However, the majority of schemes are restricted to Fourier analysis, record all sources of noise, and suffer digitizing restrictions. Since digitization involves discrete binning, amplitude resolution is limited by background fluctuations. Our novel techniques, Resonant and Time Resolved Spin Noise, bypass these issues using ultrafast laser pulses in tandem with analog electronic calculations that remove the background prior to digitizing. In principle, our system's accessible bandwidth for spin dynamics is 10 THz with sub-nanoradian/ Hz^(1 / 2) signal resolution using commercially available components. We demonstrate this measurement technique on a bulk n-type gallium arsenide sample and extract values for the g factor and dephasing time that are consistent with results from Time Resolved Faraday Rotation and Resonant Spin Amplication...|$|E

40|$|The {{discussions of}} motives and {{requirements}} for telerobotics application demonstrated that, in many cases, {{lack of progress}} was a result not of limited opportunities but of inadequate mechanisms and resources for promoting opportunities. Support for this conclusion came from Telerobotics, Inc., {{one of the few}} companies devoted primarily to telerobot systems. They have produced units for such diverse applications as nuclear fusion research, particle accelerators, cryogenics, firefighting, marine biology/undersea systems and <b>nuclear</b> mobile <b>robotics.</b> Mr. Flatau offered evidence that telerobotics research is only rarely supported by the private sector and that it often presents a difficult market. Questions on the mechanisms contained within the NASA technology transfer process for promoting commercial opportunities were fielded by Ray Gilbert and Tom Walters. A few points deserve emphasis: (1) NASA/industry technology transfer occurs in both directions and NASA recognizes the opportunity to learn a great deal from industry in the fields of automation and robotics; (2) promotion of technology transfer projects takes a demand side approach, with requests to industry for specific problem identification. NASA then proposes possible solutions; and (3) comittment ofmotivated and technically qualified people on each end of a technology transfer is essential...|$|R
40|$|Introduction As {{our society}} becomes more {{integrated}} with computer technology, information processing for human activities necessitates computing that responds to requests in real-time {{rather than just}} with best-effort. Many computer systems are now used to monitor and control physical devices and large complex systems which must have predictable and timely behaviors. We call such systems real-time systems. Some real-time systems must maintain and manipulate data shared by many tasks; thus {{they need to have}} databases which can provide the services needed by real-time computations. Real-time database systems (RTDBS) have (at least some) transactions with explicit timing constraints, such as deadlines and temporal distances.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} interface of NUClear, a new hybrid message-passing architecture for embodied humanoid <b>robotics.</b> <b>NUClear</b> is modular, has low latency, and promotes functional and expandable software design. It greatly reduces the latency for messages passed between modules as the message routes are established at compile time. It also reduces the number of functions that must be written using a system called co-messages, which aids in dealing with multiple simultaneous data. NUClear has primarily been evaluated on a humanoid robotic soccer platform and on a robotic boat platform. Evaluations show that NUClear requires fewer callbacks and cache variables over existing message-passing architectures. NUClear does have limitations when applying these techniques on multi-processed systems. It performs best in lower power systems where computational resources are limited.

40|$|The {{research}} {{behind this}} article primarily concerns {{the development of}} mobile robots for <b>nuclear</b> decommissioning. The <b>robotic</b> platform under study has dual, seven-function, hydraulically actuated manipulators, for which the authors have developed a vision based, assisted teleoperation interface for common decommissioning tasks such as pipe cutting. However, to improve safety, task execution speed and operator training-time, high performance control of the nonlinear manipulator dynamics is required. Hence, the present article focuses on an associated dynamic model, and addresses the challenging generic task of parameter estimation for a highly convex and nonlinear system. A novel approach for estimation of the fundamental parameters of the manipulator, {{based on the idea}} of multi-objectivization, is proposed. Here, a single objective output error identification problem is converted into a multi-objective optimization problem. This is solved using a multi-objective genetic algorithm with non-dominated sorting. Numerical and experimental results using the nuclear decommissioning robot, show that the performance of the proposed approach, in terms of both the output error index and the accuracy of the estimated parameters, is superior to the previously studied single-objective identification problem...|$|R

40|$|A succinct {{definition}} of the word bilateral is having two sides [1]. In robotics the term bilateral control is used to define the specific interaction of two systems by means of position and/or force. Bilateral systems are composed of two sides named master and slave side. The aim of such an arrangement is such that position command dictated by master side {{is followed by a}} slave side, {{and at the same time}} the force sensation of the remote environment experienced by slave is transferred to the mater - human operator. This way bilateral system may be perceived as an “impendanceless” extension of the human operator providing the touch information of the remote (or inaccessible) environment. In a sense bilateral systems are a mechatronics extension of the teleoperated systems. There are many applications of this structure which requires critical manipulations like <b>nuclear</b> material handling, <b>robotic</b> surgery, and micro material handling and assembly. In all these applications a human operator is required to have as close to real as possible contact with object that should be manipulated or in other word the telepresence of the operator is required. In this thesis work various important aspects of bilateral control systems are discussed. These aspects include problems of (i) acquisition of information on master and slave side, (ii) analysis and selection of the proper structure of the control systems to ensure fidelity of the system behavior. The work has been done to enhance the performance of the bilateral control system by: (i) Enhancing position and velocity measurements obtained from incremental encoder having limited number of pulses per revolution. A few algorithms are investigated and their improvements are proposed; (ii) Increasing system robustness by using acceleration controller based on disturbance observer. The robust system design based on disturbance observer is known but its application requires very fast sampling and high bandwidth of the observer. In this work the discrete time realization of the observer is presented in details and selection of the necessary filters and the sampling so to achieve a good trade-off for observer realization is discussed and experimentally confirmed; (iii) Increasing the bandwidth of force sensation by using reaction force observer. For transparent operation of a bilateral system the bandwidth of force sensation is of the major interest. All force sensors do have relatively slow dynamics and observer based structures seems providing better behavior of the overall system. In this work the observer of the interaction force is examined and design procedure is established. In order to verify all of the proposed ideas a versatile bilateral system is designed and built and experimental verification is carried out on this system...|$|R
