5|$|Having taken charge Huggins did <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> {{away from}} making {{personnel}} changes. Upon {{taking over the}} Yankees, he stressed fundamental baseball, drilling the Yankees {{in the art of}} the bunt. Huggins also made his first player transaction, acquiring Del Pratt and Eddie Plank from the St. Louis Browns trading Nick Cullop, Joe Gedeon, Fritz Maisel, Les Nunamaker, Urban Shocker and $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms), a move that led to criticism in the press.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this bird is <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> about being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E

5|$|Van Eyck does <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> from {{showing the}} {{physical}} {{effects of the}} canon's illness, including worn, crevassed and tired skin, weak vision, enlarged temporal arteries and swollen fingers. The awkwardness with which van der Paele clutches his breviary suggests weakness in his left arm; van de Paele probably suffered acute arm and shoulder pain, borne out by early 1430s church records documenting that he was excused from morning duties, and absent all day by 1434. His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the first}} couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> away from serious themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with the theme of the press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally {{as much to do with}} the arrival in Romania, at the time of the Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E

She has rows with other female residents, including Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton), Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), whom she suspects are trying to seduce her husband, although in truth, all that ever occurs is flirtation.|$|E

25|$|In 1569 the Union of Lublin {{established}} the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and much Ukrainian territory was transferred from Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, becoming Polish territory de jure. Under the demographic, {{cultural and political}} pressure of Polonisation, {{which began in the}} late 14th century, many landed gentry of Polish Ruthenia (another name for the land of Rus) converted to Catholicism and became indistinguishable from the Polish nobility. Deprived of native protectors among Rus nobility, the commoners (peasants and townspeople) began turning for protection to the emerging Zaporozhian Cossacks, who by the 17th century became devoutly Orthodox. The Cossacks did <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> from taking up arms against those they perceived as enemies, including the Polish state and its local representatives.|$|E
25|$|In April 1920, {{together}} with the Lithuanian Popular Socialist Democratic Party (LPSDP), she established publishing company AB Varpas (bell) that she headed until 1930. Because LPSDP shared office space with the press, in effect, she {{was in charge of}} the finances and daily operations of LPSDP. In February 1922, she revived the publication of Lietuvos žinios and Lietuvos ūkininkas. The publications were outspoken about their ideals and did <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> from criticism of the government for which Bortkevičienė faced fines and arrests. In 1923 alone there were 17 lawsuits where Bortkevičienė was named as the responsible party. For publishing a caricature of Prime Minister Vytautas Petrulis and Minister of Defense Leonas Bistras in October 1925, she was fined 2,000 litas or imprisonment for 1.5 months. Not having enough funds, she was imprisoned until her friends raised enough money.|$|E
25|$|When it was {{initially}} formed, Unomásunos reporters were not experienced in investigative journalism as other newspapers in Mexico City. However, as its reporters began {{to specialize in}} certain investigative topics, Unomásuno brought forward elements of readership diversity and professionalism that were not present in the Mexican press of the time. Between the late 1970s and early 1980s, Unomásuno built a reputation among Mexican readers for having an informative and fact-based character. Opinion-based sections, like editorial pages, were reduced while private advertisements grew. Unomásuno was categorized for having a center-left or left-wing orientation. Unomásuno {{was one of the}} leading independent leftist newspapers in Mexico. The newspaper tended to give a closer view of Mexico's daily life. It discussed the issues in rural sector and in unions, topics that were discussed with less frequency in other media outlets. Unomásuno also published articles about feminism, machismo, LBGT movements, and the rights of domestic workers. It did <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> away from using profanity and denouncing the government.|$|E

He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speaks of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E
25|$|Women were {{vital to}} the early Pentecostal movement. Believing that whoever {{received}} the Pentecostal experience had the responsibility to use it towards the preparation for Christ's second coming, Pentecostal women held that the baptism in the Holy Spirit gave them empowerment and justification to engage in activities traditionally denied to them. The first person at Parham's Bible college to receive Spirit baptism with the evidence of speaking in tongues was a woman, Agnes Ozman. Women such as Florence Crawford, Ida Robinson, and Aimee Semple McPherson founded new denominations, and many women served as pastors, co-pastors, and missionaries. Women wrote religious songs, edited Pentecostal papers, and taught and ran Bible schools. The unconventionally intense and emotional environment generated in Pentecostal meetings dually promoted, and was itself created by, other forms of participation such as personal testimony and spontaneous prayer and singing. Women did <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> away from engaging in this forum, {{and in the early}} movement the majority of converts and church-goers were female. Nevertheless, there was considerable ambiguity surrounding {{the role of women in}} the church. The subsiding of the early Pentecostal movement allowed a socially more conservative approach to women to settle in, and, as a result, female participation was channeled into more supportive and traditionally accepted roles. Auxiliary women's organizations were created to focus women's talents on more traditional activities. Women also became much more likely to be evangelists and missionaries than pastors. When they were pastors, they often co-pastored with their husbands.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Long Turkish War, a large number of refugees settled in the area Senj on the Holy Roman military frontier with the Ottoman Empire. The refugees swelled the ranks of Uskoks, a type of irregular militia that conducted cross border raids upon the Ottomans. Apart from their raiding activities, the Uskoks did <b>not</b> <b>shy</b> away from piracy, attacking ships without regard towards the ethnic background or religious affiliation of their crews. In 1606, the Ottomans and Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Zitva Torok which prohibited cross border raiding across the two states. In 1615, the treaty was renewed, prompting more Uskoks to turn towards piracy in the Adriatic Sea. Their activities had negatively impacted the mercantile interests of the Republic of Venice since as far as 1564, which was already aiming to expand its territory towards Habsburg Istria. Venice hired mercenaries in the Kingdom of England and the Dutch Republic, launching blockade of Holy Roman, Adriatic ports. On 20 December 1615, the blockade escalated into the Uskok War with a Venetian invasion of the coastal areas. The Spanish Viceroy of Naples Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna, intervened into the conflict on the Imperial side, without Spanish approval. The Habsburgs failed to mount an appropriate response as the country faced an internal power struggle. Nevertheless the Venetians were decimated by disease, failing to exploit their numerical superiority. Although negotiations continued throughout the conflict, an agreement was only reached in 1617 with the aid of Spanish, Papal and French mediation.|$|E
