5|$|McKellen and {{his first}} partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their {{relationship}} in 1964. Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in <b>Narrow</b> <b>Street,</b> Limehouse. In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and acording to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. Mathias later directed McKellen in Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease on The Grapes public house in <b>Narrow</b> <b>Street.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Møntergården {{cultural}} history museum of Odense {{is one of}} the most notable remaining Renaissance buildings of the city, built in 1646 by the nobleman Falk Gøye. It has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in Odense, and is named after the <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> Møntestræde adjacent to the building, where a coin workshop once operated in around 1420. Located in a courtyard of half-timbered houses, the museum also has exhibits on Funen's ancient history, as well as Odense in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris was a Catholic League stronghold, the organisers of the 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day {{massacre}} that killed thousands of French Protestants. The conflicts ended when crown-pretendant Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain {{entry to the}} capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris' first uncovered, sidewalk-doted bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension that connected it the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. The king would end {{his life in the}} capital, assassinated in a <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> by Les Halles marketplace in 1610.|$|E
5|$|To {{avoid the}} need to {{purchase}} agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways, where construction could be carried out without charge. At {{the northern end of}} the railway, {{the need to}} pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required {{to the west of the}} station. Because of the <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.|$|E
25|$|Union Street {{known locally}} as Smelly Alley due to its open fronted fishmonger's and greengrocer's shops, is a <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> which runs between Broad Street and the {{parallel}} Friar Street.

25|$|Further to the southwest, <b>Narrow</b> <b>Street,</b> Limehouse's {{historic}} spine, {{which runs}} {{along the back of}} the Thames wharves, boasts one of the few surviving early Georgian terraces in London. Next to the terrace is the historic Grapes pub, rebuilt in 1720 and well-known to Charles Dickens, featuring as the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters in Our Mutual Friend. A few doors along was Booty's Riverside Bar but this closed down in 2012. Almost every building {{on the other side of}} <b>Narrow</b> <b>Street</b> was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War, including hundreds of houses, Taylor Walker & Co's Barley Mow Brewery and a school. One notable exception is a former public house, known locally as 'The House They Left Behind', because it was the only Victorian terrace to survive. It still stands today, with the aid of three large supporting pillars.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the tomb}} {{and the walls}} {{as well as the}} main gate are dilapidated. Though Pakistani law forbids {{construction}} of new buildings within 150 feet of heritage sites, the tomb's boundary walls are separated from private homes by a <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> on its western and northern sides. Immediately north of the tomb is the shrine of Nim Pir, dating from the Mughal era.|$|E
25|$|The typical station {{comprises}} two central tracks {{flanked by}} two 4‑m-wide platforms. About 50 stations, generally current or former termini, are exceptions; most have three tracks and two platforms (Porte d'Orléans), or two tracks and a central platform (Porte Dauphine). Some stations are single-track, either due to difficult terrain (Saint-Georges), a <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> above (Liège) or track loops (Église d'Auteuil).|$|E

25|$|The {{church of}} Sant'Agostino, {{also known as}} the Spirito Santo, was built in 1507 by the Augustinians. The {{original}} portal has several inscriptions in Gothic characters. The interior has a series of paintings from the eighteenth century. Further on a <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> leads to the so-called “Area of the Bandiera Brothers”, the Vallone di Rovito. Here, the insurrectional patriots of 1844 were executed by a firing squad.|$|E
25|$|Beginning at Issy-les-Moulineaux, {{south-west}} of Paris, with a three way tunnel underneath l'avenue Victor-Cresson, the terminus is at Mairie d'Issy, and {{has only}} two tracks. It runs north-east, entering Paris at Porte de Versailles, a major station with three tracks, one of which gives access to the workshop at Vaugirard. The line then runs underneath rue de Vaugirard, following all the bends of this <b>narrow</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
25|$|The High Street was {{for many}} centuries known instead as the Bristol Road, being {{the road from}} Shrewsbury to Bristol. It was once a much wider street within the town, with the churchyard of St Laurence {{bordering}} directly onto the street. Over time buildings were erected on the street, {{in a similar fashion}} to other English market towns, such as in Ludlow. The High Street, which is a <b>narrow</b> <b>street,</b> is effectively only {{the eastern side of the}} original Bristol Road thoroughfare through the town. It was made more open when the old market hall was demolished to form the present town square.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} street blocks on Vasilyevsky Island is the same, as was later {{implemented}} in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 for Manhattan: elongated rectangles. The longest side of each block faces the relatively <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> with a numeric name (in Petersburg they are called Liniya (Line)) while the shortest side faces wide avenues. To denote avenues in Petersburg, a special term prospekt was introduced. Inside the grid of Vasilyevsky Island there are three prospekts, named Bolshoi (Big), Sredniy (Middle) and Maly (Small) while the far ends of each lines cross with the embankments of Bolshaya Neva and Smolenka rivers in the delta of the Neva River.|$|E
25|$|Spinningfields {{is an area}} in {{the west}} {{adjoining}} the middle part of Deansgate and the main business district of the city centre. The proposal to create a designated central business district originated in 1997 when Allied London purchased a number of buildings around the John Rylands Library. Allied London executive Mike Ingall was convinced of site's regeneration potential and Manchester City Council was keen to redevelop the city centre after the 1996 Manchester bombing. The development, named from a <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> which ran westwards from Deansgate, is bounded by Bridge Street to the north, Quay Street to the south, Deansgate to the east, and the River Irwell to the west.|$|E
25|$|<b>Narrow</b> <b>Street</b> forms {{a part of}} {{the north}} bank of the Thames Path and Cycle Superhighway CS3, the walk and cycle lane is between tall former {{warehouses}} and modern flats. Many were built with planning covenants granting river access, but these are now often barred to the public. Vehicular access is limited, as the area is cut off by the entrance to the Limehouse tunnel and parking is strictly controlled, however this makes the area reasonably quiet for cyclists. Public access to the foreshore is prohibited, apparently part of the security arrangements for former Foreign Secretary, David Owen. The National Cycle Route 1 also runs in Limehouse north and south.|$|E

25|$|On 24 November 1989, Muhammad Azzam {{was driving}} {{his father and}} brother to Friday prayers in Peshawar, when unknown assassins detonated a bomb as the vehicle approached. Lying in a <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> across from a gas station, the {{explosive}} had a 50-metre detonation cord {{which led to the}} sewerage system where the assailant presumably waited. According to Time magazine, Waheed Muzhda had noticed what he assumed was a crew doing routine road maintenance working on the culvert where the bomb was placed, the day before the assassination. Azzam and his sons were buried near the same site as his mother the year before, the Pabi Graveyard of the Shuhadaa' (martyrs), in Peshawar.|$|E
25|$|In 1689 the Lort Burn {{was covered}} over. At {{this time it}} was an open sewer. The channel {{followed}} by the Lort Burn became the present day Dean Street. At that time, the centre of Newcastle was still the Sandhill area, with many merchants living along the Close or on the Side. The path of the main road through Newcastle ran from the single Tyne bridge, through Sandhill to the Side, a <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> which climbed steeply on the north-east side of the castle hill until it reached the higher ground alongside St Nicholas' Church. As Newcastle developed, the Side became lined with buildings with projecting upper stories, so that the main street through Newcastle was a narrow, congested, steep thoroughfare.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} of protesters {{resulted in a}} mob forming and returning to the city centre, setting fire to government buildings and attacking Europeans in the city. Three British bank employees were beaten to death, and Miss Marcella Sherwood, who supervised the Mission Day School for Girls, was cycling around the city to close her schools when she was assaulted by a mob in a <b>narrow</b> <b>street</b> called the Kucha Kurrichhan. Sherwood was rescued from the mob by locals. They hid the teacher, who was hurt in the beating, before moving her to the fort. Dyer, who was the commandant of the infantry brigade in Jalandhar, decided to take action. He arrived on 11 April to assume command, then instructed the troops of the garrison regarding reprisals against the population.|$|E
