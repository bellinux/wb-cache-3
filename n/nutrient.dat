5|$|Agriculture {{is another}} {{significant}} source of the Sava River basin surface water pollution, specifically through livestock manure production. It is estimated that the <b>nutrient</b> pollution levels generated by manure production equal 32,394tonnes of nitrogen and 3,784tonnes of phosphorus per year. As a consequence, the Sava River is microbiologically polluted in areas affected by the <b>nutrient</b> pollution. One such part of the river is the lowermost part of its course between Šabac and Belgrade, where acceptable freshwater bacterial counts are exceeded.|$|E
5|$|All studies {{revealed}} minor {{improvements in}} household <b>nutrient</b> availability, with the 1985 study revealing an improvement of vitamin and mineral consumption over non-participating {{families and the}} 1993 study partially confirming these results. The most extensive study on <b>nutrient</b> availability was published in 1996, which concluded that nutrition did not change significantly after {{the implementation of the}} NAP program for all beneficiaries, however most improvements were noted for very low-income beneficiaries versus their non-participating equivalents.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems {{are designed to}} be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during <b>nutrient</b> stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's <b>nutrient</b> requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E

25|$|Most importantly, reefs recycle <b>nutrients,</b> {{which happens}} much {{less in the}} open ocean. In coral reefs and lagoons, {{producers}} include phytoplankton, as well as seaweed and coralline algae, especially small types called turf algae, which pass <b>nutrients</b> to corals.

In 100 grams, raw squash supplies 16 calories and is rich in vitamin C (20% of the Daily Value, DV), moderate in vitamin B6 and riboflavin (12–17% DV), but otherwise devoid of appreciable <b>nutrient</b> content (table), although the <b>nutrient</b> content of different Curcubita species may vary somewhat.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of <b>nutrient</b> requirements, cabbage is prone to <b>nutrient</b> deficiencies, {{including}} boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E

40|$|This {{preliminary}} study examined how two resources (light and <b>nutrients)</b> influence {{the ability of}} tomato plants to show growth compensation for defoliation by the tobacco homworm (Manduca sexta). Growth rate and biomass of plants grown under high {{and low levels of}} light and <b>nutrients,</b> and exposed to 4 levels of defoliation by Manduca sexta were measured. <b>Nutrients</b> affected plant growth rate much more strongly than did light. Light and <b>nutrients,</b> however, each influenced how herbivory affected plant growth. Defoliation significantly decreased growth rate only under conditions of low light and high <b>nutrients.</b> Biomass, on the other hand. was low under all resource treatments except high levels of both light and <b>nutrients,</b> and defoliation significantly decreased biomass only under high levels of both resources. Thus, plants appeared to compensate for damage. in terms of biomass, only under conditions of either low light and/or low <b>nutrients...</b>|$|R

5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (<b>nutrient</b> rich) and white sand (<b>nutrient</b> poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|E
