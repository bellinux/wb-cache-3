For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
40|$|House sparrow (Passer domesti-cus) nesting {{activities}} {{cause problems}} {{in and around}} structures and in <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> intended for other species. Previous {{studies have shown that}} house sparrows are selectively repelled from feeding sites by monofilament lines spaced 30 or 60 cm apart. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine house spar-row response to lines spaced about 37 cm apart around <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> One hundred forty-six <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were installed, with lines randomly assigned to 73 <b>boxes.</b> All <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were checked approximately every 5 days for nest materials, eggs, nestlings, and fledglings. Successful clutches were record-ed for nests that fledged at least one bird. Results indicated no difference between the numbers of treated and control <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> that had <b>nest</b> materials (70 control, 66 treat-ed), but onset of the first set of clutches was earlier (- 13 days) in control than in treated <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). In addition, there were more control <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> with eggs present (51 control, 34 treated, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and more control <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> with at least 1 (39 control, 21 treated, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) or 2 (24 con-trol, 6 treated, P 3 ̆c 0. 05) successful clutches. Although, monofilament lines do not repel house sparrows from <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> as they do from feeding sites, they do appear to reduce the number of clutches and fledglings. Still unclear is whether differences noted resulted directly from line interference with the nesting process or indirectly from some other factor such as age or experience of birds occupying the treated <b>nest</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R

In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> types, but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete, perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1.5°C warmer than their wooden counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Training {{methods are}} {{as varied as}} the pigeons themselves. Some fanciers believe their system is the secret to their success and guard these hard learned lessons closely. Most fanciers will explain their basic {{strategy}} but some may be reluctant to share the details of their success. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their <b>nest</b> <b>box.</b> After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> is upon returning from training or a race.

40|$|Abstract: We {{installed}} {{two types}} of artificial <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> made by wood chip mixed with cement (A-type) and recycled styrofoam (B-type) at the orchard areas (Apple Research Institute) in Sobo-myeon, Gunwi-gun, Gyungbuk Province in march 2003. And then, the breeding birds using the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were recorded during the breeding season of 2003 and 2004 for finding the effectiveness of two different <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> A total bred birds were five species, Great Tit (Parus major), Coal Tit (Parus ater), Varied Tit (Parus varius), Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) and Yellow-rumped Flycatcher (Ficedula zanthopygia). Sixteen pairs Great tits were bred in the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> so this species was the most dominant breeder and followed by Coal Tit three pairs, Varied Tit three pairs, Tree Sparrow two pairs and Yellow-rumped Flycatcher two pairs. The using rate of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> was 28. 2 % (11 out of 39) and 38. 5 % (15 out of 39) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Thus, the using rate was increased in 2004. Birds were using only A-type <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> so the using rate of A-type was 68. 0 % (17 out of 25) while none of bird used B-type (0 out of 14). From this result, the breeding bird showed preference for better <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (A-type) when there were abundant breeding sites...|$|R

These figures have been assisted by a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> scheme; in 2008 there were 49 occupied nest boxes which produced 270 fledged young, and by 2009 these numbers had increased to 65 and 352 respectively, including two owl species, barn owl and tawny owl.|$|E
40|$|Several {{animals of}} the Atlantic Forest depend on natural {{cavities}} for reproduction, shelter or feeding. Some {{aspects of their}} ecology can be examined {{with the use of}} <b>nesting</b> <b>boxes.</b> This study was developed with 48 <b>nesting</b> <b>boxes</b> confectioned with “Tetra Pak” package. Four areas of the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil, in four different successional stages, were sampled from August 2001 to August 2003. We aimed to verify: 1) the occupation of <b>nesting</b> <b>boxes</b> by small vertebrates, 2) the preference of the species for <b>nesting</b> <b>boxes</b> fixed at 2 or 4 m above the ground and for the position of the entrance hole (frontal or lateral), and 3) the viability of use of these <b>nesting</b> <b>boxes</b> in field research. Four species were found in the boxes: a tree frog (Hyla sp., one occupation), a green lizard (Enyalius iheringi, one occupation), the saffron finch (Sicalis flaveola, twenty-three occupations), and the wooly tailed mouse opossum (Micoureus paraguayanus, five occupations). Most occupations occurred in areas of early successional stages. There were no preferences for the height and position of the entrance hole. The <b>nesting</b> <b>boxes</b> proved to be relatively durable and useful in field research on small cavity-dependent vertebrates...|$|R

It {{is relatively easy to}} construct a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> camera because it involves little more than installing a camera in a <b>nest</b> <b>box,</b> remembering only to choose or construct a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> large enough to contain the camera, to have a box deep enough to enable proper focusing of the camera and to use a camera suitable for outdoor conditions.|$|E
40|$|Secondary cavity nesting (SCN) birds {{breed in}} holes {{that they do}} not {{excavate}} themselves. This is possible where there are large trees whose size and age permit the digging of holes by primary excavators and only rarely happens in forest plantations, where we expected a deficit of both breeding holes and SCN species. We assessed whether the availability of tree cavities influenced the number of SCNs in two temperate forest types, and evaluated the change in number of SCNs after adding <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> First, we counted all cavities within each of our 25 -m radius sampling points in mature and young forest plots during 2009. We then added <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> at standardised locations during 2010 and 2011 and conducted fortnightly bird counts (January–October 2009 – 2011). In 2011 we added two extra plots of each forest type, where we also conducted bird counts. Prior to adding <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> counts revealed more SCNs in mature than in young forest. Following the addition of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> the number of SCNs increased significantly in the points with <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in both types of forest. Counts in 2011 confirmed the increase in number of birds due to the addition of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> Given the likely benefits associated with a richer bird community we propose that, as is routinely done in some countries, forest management programs preserve old tree stumps and add <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> to forest plantations in order to increase bird numbers and bird community diversity...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate pens switching, closing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> after egg laying and <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> switching inside the same pen as management procedures for controlling broodiness in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders and their role in circulating prolactin. Black bronze turkey (n. = 350) and Muscovy duck (n. = 700) were randomly selected and housed on deep litter. The results showed a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) increase in egg production in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pens switching and closing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> after end of egg laying. While, there was no significant (P > 0. 05) difference in egg production in response to switching of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in turkey hens but a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) result was found in Muscovy ducks. On the other hand, there were significant (P ≤ 0. 05) decreases in circulating prolactin level and broodiness in both turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pen switching, closing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> after egg laying and <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> switching. In conclusion, application of these management procedures was associated with increased egg production while decreased expression of broodiness (incubation behaviour) and circulating prolactin in turkey hens and Muscovy ducks...|$|R
