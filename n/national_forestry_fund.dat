One of the main criticisms of the PSA is that the payment allocation has discriminated in practice against small farmers and indigenous peasants, above all those without registered property title deeds. Given that only owners of forested land who can show title are eligible for the benefit, many small farmers and peasants end up excluded.|$|R
40|$|What is the problem? Costa Rica faces a {{deterioration}} of its forests and resulting increases in emissions of greenhouse gases. At the same time, Costa Rica {{is a leader}} in terms of curbing this loss in Latin America and in the designing and developing a system of payment for environmental services (Russo et al. 2006). Which approach was taken? The Forestry Law (article 46) and the <b>National</b> <b>Forestry</b> Finance <b>Fund</b> (FONAFIFO) were created to promote forest development in Costa Rica by financing small and medium producers (Miranda et al. 2003). The work carried out by FONAFIFO through the Environmental Services Payment Program (ESPP) is aimed at guaranteeing the conservation of forests by providing a financial motivation to those who protect them (FONAFIFO, 2007). Since 1997, a program locally called Pagos de Servicios Ambientales (known as PSA in Spanish, or Payments for Environmental Services) has been providing payments to more than 4, 400 farmers and forest owners for reforestation, forest conservation, and sustainable forest management activities.

40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, {{allows the}} non Annex 1 {{countries}} to receive projects {{that contribute to}} reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable development in developing countries. The CDM, since its inception, has issued credits equivalent to 1. 434. 737. 562 tons of CO 2, distributed across 7. 450 projects around the world, from 15 different sectors. Sectors 14 that allow forestry projects (such as reforestation and afforestation) have registered 53 projects to date; 19 {{of which are in}} Latin America. Nevertheless, the contribution of this sector currently represents less than 1 % of CDM Certificates of Emissions Reduction (CERs) issued. In September 2013, through their <b>National</b> <b>Forestry</b> Financing <b>Fund</b> (FONAFIFO), Costa Rica registered their first CDM project with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), after having complied with all the project cycle processes. The project, known as "Carbon Sequestration in Small and Medium Farms, Brunca Region, Costa Rica" was a project executed by FONAFIFO under their Environmental Services Payment Program. This project was developed in Pérez Zeledón, San José, Costa Rica in partnership with the Cooperative Corporation CoopeAgri RL. The total goal of the project is to reduce the greenhouse gas emission by 176, 050 ton of CO 2 -e, in a period of 20 years and commercialize the CERs in the regulated carbon market...|$|R
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería Forestal). Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Ingeniería Forestal, 2014. Forest biomass concept, {{are those}} {{materials}} {{that emerge from}} timber harvesting and are not extracted {{because they are not}} convertible into sub-products, but can be used as fuel (Velázquez, 2006). This raw material represents a high interest for industries to cheapen production costs. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the current situation of forest biomass usage in the area of influence of the company Biomass Costa Rica, in the province of Guanacaste. This study counted with a record of companies in Guanacaste employing boilers obtained from a database from another project. A 30 % of all companies were sampled. Ten companies were sampled and a survey was applied. The potential demand for wooden chips was determined by the current consumption of the different fuels used; plus the actual cost of fuel was compared to the potential cost if this material is employed. The use of wooden chips is more profitable than using bunker, rice hulls, diesel and LPG. As for the cane bagasse, this is more profitable than chips. Forest biomass supply for Tectonagrandis (teak) was determined from the Payments for Environmental Services in Agroforestry (PSA SAF) recorded between the years 2009 - 2013 of the <b>National</b> <b>Forestry</b> Financing <b>Fund</b> (FONAFIFO). The estimated volume of forest biomass for teak at 20 years is 6700. 94 ton / year. This study results suggest that the use of wooden chips is a more profitable product than other fuels. Besides the supply available in the SAF is a source of constant supply of raw material demand. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Ingeniería Forestal. Biomass Costa Rica...|$|R

40|$|Funds {{generated}} through community forestry offer crucial {{and significant}} resources for rural in Nepal. This study examines <b>forestry</b> <b>funds</b> in 100 communities in three districts {{to assess how}} large {{they are and how}} they are utilized. The study finds that the income from community funds increases local development resources by about 25 %. This income is invested in schools, temples, roads, and water reservoirs, which bodes well for rural development. However, there are some critical problems with the 'pro-poor programme’, an effort to reduce poverty through the resources generated from community forestry. The study finds that timber is subsidized and the subsidies accrue mainly to the non-poor. Furthermore, income spent on loans tends to favor the non-poor. Overall some 74 % of the benefits of community <b>forestry</b> <b>funds</b> accrue to the non-poor while 26 % accrue to the poor in rural communities in Nepal. The study concludes that two actions may increase the benefits accruing to the poor: a) allowing all households to have an equal share in timber that is harvested; and b) increasing the participation of poor and less advantaged members in the executive committees that manage <b>forestry</b> <b>funds.</b> [SANDEE]Community <b>forestry</b> <b>funds,</b> Nepal, timber subsidies, loans, poverty...|$|R

40|$|As {{this is a}} {{difficult}} period for countries throughout the world, the developing countries must implement survival strategies {{and at the same time}} endeavour to safeguard natural resources. In view of the current difficulties it is not easy to make a choice. In some areas the situation is such that more money is spent on fuel than on food. There is hardly any alternative to cutting down trees and destroying the forests if the people wish to survive. If this situation were to continue, the next generations would without doubt have an environment without a future. The stakes are high The rational conservation and use of the forests and their resources is now an integral part of agricultural or global policies. The fact that regular meetings are held to establish a concerted policy against desertification and the protection of nature indicates just how high the stakes are and the determination demanded by the situation. The fact that there is to be an international convention on desertification and other post-Rio initiatives confirms the concern. However, forestry research organizations in many of the developing countries may find it difficult to respond to the demands made of them and to make forestry play the role which it should naturally have in the quest for long term socioeconomic development. Research arrived at resolving the essential problems associated with trees and forestry deserves constant commitment, backing and effort in view of the many important roles played by trees. Continuity of funding Unfortunately, in view of the lack of long-term commitment and the consequent lack of continuity in <b>funding,</b> <b>forestry</b> research is not in a position to contribute fully to development. <b>Funds</b> allocated to <b>forestry</b> research in Africa are generally very limited. The assistance of the decision-makers must be enlisted to grant additional <b>funds</b> to the <b>forestry</b> sector and at the same time to ensure that research has a little more funding. There should be some adjustment in favour of research since development projects, the principal users of the results of trials, must have access to research. It is not easy for those who understand the significance of forestry research in the developing countries to accept that under 0. 26 % of the value of forestry production is allocated to research. If all available means have to be used to find funds to complete a trial using plant material which has been given up because funding has been interrupted, the strain on research workers is considerable. This is the real world of the earnest worker for whom continuity is vital since the least pause or interruption will result in the work no longer being reliable. In order to ensure independence and the regular funding of research work, it appears that it is essential to have specific funds, provided by development projects and partly by taxes paid by those who exploit the forests and/or a significant contribution from the <b>national</b> <b>forestry</b> <b>funds.</b> United we stand [...] . Every country can set up structures to suit its resources and its forestry policy. However, it is now essential to translate the desire for integration expressed by the decision-makers and politicians into action. Forestry research structures in developing countries appear very fragmented as there is no concentration of manpower, funds and logistic resources. Resources must be concentrated to produce structures which will be viable in the long term and employ effective teams of workers. The indications are therefore that workers engaged on specific subjects should be formed into groups. Programmes, operations or individual research work of any description, such as the genetic improvement of Faidherbia (Acacia) albida, must not be dealt with individually by each country engaged in this work. Furthermore, it is not logical for each country to have its own in vitro culture research unit for woody species. It is to be hoped that the programme to support forestry research in Asia and the Pacific can be enhanced and adapted to serve as a model for Africa south of the Sahara. To provide satisfactory results forestry research needs quality infrastructures. Perseverance is essential and there must be agreement over which work is to be given priority. As this is {{a difficult}} period for countries throughout the world, the developing countries must implement survival strategies and at the same time endeavour to safeguard natural resources.
