His {{numerous}} diplomatic visits to the royal courts of Europe were mostly in an attempt to garner support for an anti-Ottoman uprising in Bulgaria, which he did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>to</b> witness. Nevertheless, his efforts in defending Christianity earned him a noble title from the Austrian emperors, and he took up several important positions within the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|He was {{particularly}} interested in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic differences in the brains of schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>to</b> see it published.|$|E

5|$|Meksi did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>to</b> see the 1827 {{publication}} of his translation of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, {{at the age of}} about 51. The first {{publication of}} a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000copies, a huge number for the time. It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty. A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens, but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{and during}} Israel's 1982 {{invasion}} of Lebanon, al-Wazir planned numerous attacks inside Israel against both {{civilian and military}} targets.

He settled in Amman for a two-year period and was then exiled to Tunis in 1986. From his base there, he started to organize youth committees in the Palestinian territories; these eventually became the backbone of the Palestinian forces in the First Intifada. However, he did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> <b>to</b> command the uprising. On April 16, 1988, he was assassinated at his home in Tunis, by Israeli commandos.|$|E
