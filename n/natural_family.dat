5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for <b>natural</b> <b>family</b> planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of condom use is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of <b>natural</b> <b>family</b> planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E
5|$|Religions {{vary widely}} in {{their views of}} the ethics of birth control. The Roman Catholic Church officially only accepts <b>natural</b> <b>family</b> planning, {{although}} large numbers of Catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods of birth control. Among Protestants {{there is a wide}} range of views from supporting none to allowing all methods of birth control. Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use both natural and artificial contraceptives. A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not. In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E

In 1989, Pride in her HELP for Growing Families periodical published portions of the correspondence between the Kippleys' and herself, during which Pride accepted NFP use only for couples who wished to remain healthy until {{they were ready to}} use no fertility control at all. Sheila Kippley credits the correspondence as the reason why Pride accepted NFP in such circumstances in her sequel, All the Way Home.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic {{position}} on contraception was formally explained and expressed by Pope Paul VI's Humanae vitae in 1968.

25|$|The Catholic Church {{permits the}} use of a small number of {{reproductive}} technologies and contraceptive methods like <b>natural</b> <b>family</b> planning, which involves charting ovulation times. The church allows other forms of reproductive technologies that allow conception to take place from normative sexual intercourse, such as a fertility lubricant. Pope Benedict XVI had publicly re-emphasised the Catholic Church's opposition to In vitro fertilisation, claiming it replaces love between a husband and wife.|$|E

25|$|Every action {{specifically}} {{intended to}} prevent procreation is forbidden, except in medically necessary circumstances. Therapeutic means necessary to cure diseases are exempted, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result, but only if infertility is not directly intended. This is held to directly contradict the moral order which was established by God. Abortion, even for therapeutic reasons, is absolutely forbidden, as is sterilization, even if temporary. Therapeutic means which induce infertility are allowed (e.g., hysterectomy), {{if they are not}} specifically intended to cause infertility (e.g., the uterus is cancerous, so the preservation of life is intended). If there are well grounded reasons (arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances), <b>Natural</b> <b>family</b> planning methods (abstaining from intercourse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle) are allowed, since they take advantage of a faculty provided by nature.|$|E

500|$|Contraception {{and certain}} other sexual {{practices}} are not permitted, although <b>natural</b> <b>family</b> planning methods {{are permitted to}} provide healthy spacing between births, or to postpone children for a just reason. Pope Francis said in 2015 that he is worried that the church has grown [...] "obsessed" [...] with issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage and contraception and has criticised the Catholic Church for placing dogma before love, and for prioritising moral doctrines over helping the poor and marginalised.|$|E
500|$|The church {{teaches that}} sexual {{intercourse}} should only take place between {{a married man}} and woman, and should be {{without the use of}} birth control or contraception. In his encyclical Humanae vitae (1968), Pope Paul VI firmly rejected all contraception, thus contradicting dissenters in the Church that saw the birth control pill as an ethically justifiable method of contraception, though he permitted the regulation of births by means of <b>natural</b> <b>family</b> planning. This teaching was continued especially by John Paul II in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, where he clarified the Church's position on contraception, abortion and euthanasia by condemning them as part of a [...] "culture of death" [...] and calling instead for a [...] "culture of life".|$|E

(Gaudium et spes)." [...] It recognizes that responsible parenthood sometimes calls for reasonable spacing or limiting of births and considers <b>natural</b> <b>family</b> planning as morally acceptable, but rejects all methods of artificial contraception. The Church rejects all forms of artificial insemination and fertilization because the techniques divorce the sexual act from the creation of a child.
