In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, {{during the reign}} of Stefan Batory (1576–1586), a peasant-based levy formation, piechota wybranicka (lit. drafted or {{selected}} infantry, also known as piechota łanowa, lit. acreage infantry) was formed. It was based on peasants from the royal estates only, who received a unit of land (łan) in exchange for their service. The formation numbered about 2,300 and after early disappointments was never seen as of much military value. It supplemented the few small units of haiduk infantry, which saw service in Poland primarily around late 16th and 17th centuries. In 1655 a new infantry unit was created, the żołnierz dymowy (or żołnierz łanowy– lit. chimney or łan soldier, named again after the type of tax applied). It required all lands, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> owned by king, nobles or the Church, to provide peasant recruits, and applied a similar requirement to towns.|$|E

5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>whether</b> it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E

On 3 November, Lady Norman-Walker responded to the incident for the first time. She explained that she had been serving out of Britain for too long a time and was eager to reside in England again.

40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis is “Internationalization process of Hi-Tech mobile crane to the {{emerging}} Indian Subcontinent markets e. g. Bangladesh: The case study of KramerKran GmbH”. The whole approach is based on KramerKran GmbH, a small crane service providing company which is located in Löffingen, Southern Germany. This study explores two specific research questions such as how KramerKran can enter to this attractive Indian Subcontinent especially into the Bangladeshi market and understand the degree of opportunity {{whether it is a}} good attempt to enter into this market or not. Here, Bangladesh is taken as an example of Indian subcontinent because {{it is one of the}} high growth emerging economies in this region and many business opportunities have yet been unexplored that might be attractive for German automotive companies (SMEs). In today’s globalization era, markets are becoming very competitive. It is difficult for many companies only to rely on the local or domestic market, <b>no</b> <b>matters</b> <b>whether</b> it is a big corporation or a small and medium sized enterprise (SMEs). In order to maintain a positive and sustainable business growth, internationalization plays a vital role nowadays, especially for small and medium sized enterprises in which emerging markets are very attractive from many aspects. Therefore, it can be said that, this topic is very much relevant with KramerKran’s further business development approach and crucial for doing business in a sustainable manner. In order to answer the research questions, the whole study is divided into seven chapters and very undamental points are e. g. theoretical framework, company present situation, empirical research, findings, recommendation and conclusion. The theoretical framework provides a general idea about the necessity of being global as well as various modes of international market entry. Company present situation and empirical research describes KramerKran’s position in the present market and the market situation of Bangladesh respectively. Empirical research has been conducted throughout expert interview, company data, personal observation and expert article and so on. Based on theory, company data and empirical research a two-step international market entry model has been recommended...|$|R
