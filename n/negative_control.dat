5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's <b>negative</b> <b>control,</b> a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as negative controls). They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E

40|$|Standardization of controls, both {{positive}} and <b>negative</b> <b>controls,</b> is needed for diagnostic immunohistochemistry (dIHC). The use of IHC-negative controls, irrespective of type, although well established, is not standardized. As such, the relevance and applicability of <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> continues to challenge both pathologists and laboratory budgets. Despite the clear theoretical notion that appropriate controls serve to demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the dIHC test, it remains unclear which types of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> are applicable and/or useful in day-to-day clinical practice. There is a perceived need to provide "best practice recommendations" {{for the use of}} <b>negative</b> <b>controls.</b> This perception is driven not only by logistics and cost issues, but also by increased pressure for accurate IHC testing, especially when IHC is performed for predictive markers, the number of which is rising as personalized medicine continues to develop. Herein, an international ad hoc expert panel reviews classification of <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> relevant to clinical practice, proposes standard terminology for <b>negative</b> <b>controls,</b> considers the total evidence of IHC specificity that is available to pathologists, and develops a set of recommendations for the use of <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> in dIHC based on "fit-for-use" principles.

25|$|A red-light {{perspective}} of administrative law embodies deep-rooted suspicion of governmental {{power and a}} desire to minimize the encroachment of the state on the rights of individuals. This envisions the courts being locked in an adversarial or combative relationship with the Executive and functioning as a check on administrative power. Where a green-light perspective is concerned, the focus is not so much on actively resisting administrative bodies as a form of <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> (as in the red-light perspective), but instead raising areas where public bodies may improve their various administrative procedures. This approach is derived from the utilitarian tradition, and the priority in achieving the greatest good for the greatest number is to encourage the contribution of the state through means of egalitarian and ameliorative social reform so as to deliver communitarian goals. Thus, the red-light perspective is more conservative and control-oriented, while the green-light perspective is more liberal or socialist in orientation and facilitative in nature.|$|E
25|$|The PCR {{method is}} {{extremely}} sensitive, requiring {{only a few}} DNA molecules in a single reaction for amplification across several orders of magnitude. Therefore, adequate measures to avoid contamination from any DNA present in the lab environment (bacteria, viruses, or human sources) are required. Because products from previous PCR amplifications are a common source of contamination, many molecular biology labs have implemented procedures that involve dividing the lab into separate areas. One lab area is dedicated to preparation and handling of pre-PCR reagents and the setup of the PCR reaction, and another area to post-PCR processing, such as gel electrophoresis or PCR product purification. For the setup of PCR reactions, many standard operating procedures involve using pipettes with filter tips and wearing fresh laboratory gloves, {{and in some cases}} a laminar flow cabinet with UV lamp as a work station (to destroy any extraneomultimer formation). PCR is routinely assessed against a <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> reaction that is set up identically to the experimental PCR, but without template DNA, and performed alongside the experimental PCR.|$|E

2500|$|Specific to Polyergus, {{when the}} queen first enters a Formica nest she {{releases}} a pheromone from her enlarged Dufour’s gland. Topoff did experiments {{to show that}} this pheromone has an important facilitative effect in colony usurpation; it reduces the aggression of the defending Formica workers. The researchers took the Dufour’s, pygidial, and poison glands from freshly mated Polyergus queens, using water as a <b>negative</b> <b>control.</b> These were crushed in distilled water to make a solution containing their extracts. Because {{it was impossible to}} prevent a Polyergus queen from secreting their own pheromones during a live encounter, they used the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex occidentalis (naturally attacked by Formica) as the subject.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To test {{sealants}} {{to prevent}} erosive tooth wear caused by extrinsic and intrinsic acids under long-term exposition. METHODS: 144 bovine enamel samples were randomly allocated to twelve groups (1 - 12). Samples of groups 1, 5 and 9 remained unsealed (positive controls), 2, 6 and 10 were sealed with Silicon Seal Nano Mix and 3, 7 and 11 with Seal&Protect. Groups 4, 8 and 12 were sealed with flowable composite (<b>negative</b> <b>controls).</b> Groups 1 - 4 were immersed in artificial saliva, 5 - 8 in hydrochloric acid and groups 9 - 12 in citric acid for 28 days, respectively. After 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21 and 28 days, solutions were renewed and enamel wear was quantified by assignation of (32) P in the solutions. RESULTS: In all immersion solutions, lowest mineral loss was observed for the <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> whilst highest loss was observed for unsealed positive controls.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{combination}} of enzymes in commercial laying hens {{need to be more}} explored in literature. To determine if the type of protease affects performance, egg quality, nutrient intake, and morphometry of intestinal mucosa of laying hens in peak egg production and fed with phytase, 780 25 -weeks Hy-Line W 36 hens were assigned to a completely randomized design composed of five treatments/diets (one positive <b>control,</b> two <b>negative</b> <b>controls,</b> and <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> plus protease A or B), with 12 replicates of 13 birds each. There was no effect of treatments (P > 0. 05) on egg production, egg mass and feed conversion, even though the nutritional restriction imposed by the <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> reduced egg weight (P = 0. 02), albumen height (P < 0. 01), and Haugh unit (P < 0. 01). Although inclusion of proteases in <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> did not cause the calculated intake of protein and amino acids to return to the same amount consumed by positive-control hens, egg quality parameters returned to positive control standards with protease A. Intestinal mucosa responded to treatment only at jejunum, where birds fed with protease B showed greater (P < 0. 01) villus height and crypt depth than those treated with protease A. These findings suggest that different proteases and phytases interact distinctly and, in consequence, induce different responses on the birds. Moreover, the behavior of egg quality parameters after protease A inclusion in the diet indicates that the nutritional contribution of the combination of this protease with phytase is greater than the contribution of protease alone...|$|R

All <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> were correctly reported as negative. Panel 2 samples were identified as C. pneumoniae positive to levels of 0. 01 IFU/PCR mixture (100 %) and 0. 005 IFU/PCR mixture (91 %), independent of the DNA extraction method used, and only one false-positive result was reported. For panel 3 samples, 5 of 240 (2 %) analyses (in which DNA extractions and PCR were performed at the same laboratory) were positive; the positive specimens were from three endarterectomy specimens and two <b>negative</b> <b>controls.</b> After exchange of DNA extracts between laboratories, 13 of 15 atheroma samples were C. pneumoniae DNA positive in at least 1 of a series of 48 analyses per atheroma sample; however, the overall positivity rate did not exceed 5 % (33 of 720 analyses) and therefore was lower than that for the <b>negative</b> <b>controls</b> (8 %; 19 of 240 analyses). Not a single positive result could be achieved when all panel 3 extracts (n = 240 analyses) were reamplified by a 16 S rRNA PCR followed by hybridization with a C. pneumoniae-specific probe.
