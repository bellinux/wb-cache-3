It was formed in November that year, bringing together regional groups already forming in the Midlands and the North. Stallard won the 1944 BLRC championship, and served as events organiser for a time, before being expelled for criticising the standard of events. He was also a moving force behind organisation of the fledgling Tour of Britain.|$|E

In his quest to further meditate on love between people (in this case, among three boys in their 20s), Chua embarked on this project to push his collaborators {{to work in a}} space where they had <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>but</b> to clean. Cleaning was an essential task that would bring these boys to the next phase of eternity.|$|E

Phipps also described the funeral scene as a highlight of the episode, finding that he grew to appreciate its mix of tragic and comic more over repeated viewings.

500|$|Montcalm {{was taken}} aback to learn of the British deployment, and his {{response}} has been regarded as precipitate. Though he might have awaited reinforcement by Bougainville's column (allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the British position) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces, or even yielded the city to Wolfe, he instead elected to confront Wolfe's force directly. [...] Had he waited, the British would have been entirely cut off—they had <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>but</b> back down the Foulon, {{and would have been}} under fire the entire way. To an artillery officer named Montbelliard, Montcalm explained his decision thus: [...] "We cannot avoid action; the enemy is entrenching, he already has two pieces of cannon. If we give him time to establish himself, we shall never be able to attack him with the troops we have." ...|$|E
500|$|Third Way {{contributor}} Graham Cray {{wrote that}} the song [...] " [...] more directly a culture which consists of a cacophony of voices and images but which has neither soul nor direction." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes noted that the lyrics were ambiguous in whether they took place in reality or fantasy, which he likened to the overarching theme of the album. Author David Kootnikoff believed that [...] "the pop melody conceals the lyric's dark theme about a victim of physical abuse who reasons her pain away with the line 'When he hurts you, you feel alive.'" [...] Mark Brown of The Orange County Register described it as [...] "the desperate tale of an abused woman with <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>but</b> back to her home." [...] He compared it to U2's 1987 song [...] "Running to Stand Still", saying [...] "That same sort of descriptive but distanced narrative is what made [...] so powerful." ...|$|E

50|$|By {{this time}} Lord Stanley was clearly leaning towards the Conservative Party. Any remote {{possibility}} of returning to the Whigs was scuttled by the Lichfield House Compact by which the Irish Repealers, Whigs and Radicals agreed to vote out Peel's government. This wasn't long in coming, and left the 'Derby Dilly' <b>nowhere</b> else <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> support Peel. When Peel resigned as Prime Minister in April 1835, the King invited not Stanley, but Melbourne and the Whigs, {{to form a new}} government, and Stanley received no invitation to rejoin the Whig fold.|$|R

5000|$|Guitar Techniques (magazine) {{gave this}} album a {{positive}} review stating: [...] "One {{of the biggest}} problems that every guitar-playing virtuoso faces is how to make all that instrumental expertise and technique appeal to {{more than a handful of}} dedicated followers. Well perhaps this Guitar Mashing, download only, release from the highly talented Tim Scott can provide at least one solution. Here seven highly intricate instrumental tracks have been given a solid dance back beat and a remix that makes them fun to listen to, and even if you're not about to spend the night in a sleazy club in Ibiza this is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. What's more it's still technically breath-taking so none of the expertise is lost, it's just made accessible to a much wider audience.

There was <b>nowhere</b> else <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>but</b> down, it was too artificial for him, and he wasn't an artificial person at all. He was actually, two weeks after he died, he was supposed to come here and he wanted to record a bunch of Leadbelly covers. It was kind of in secret, because, I mean, people would definitely not allow him to do that. You also have to wonder, he was a billion-dollar industry at the time, and if the industry had any idea at all of him wishing or wanting to get out, they couldn't have allowed that, you know, in life, because if he was just {{to get out of the}} scene, he'd be totally forgotten, but if he was to die, he'd be immortalized.|$|R

What does it feel like to find the city's edge, to explore its forgotten tunnels and scale unfinished skyscrapers high above the metropolis? "Explore Everything" reclaims the city, recasting it as a place for endless adventure. Plotting expeditions from London, Paris, Berlin, Detroit, Chicago, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, Bradley L. Garrett has evaded urban security in order to experience the city in ways beyond the boundaries of conventional life. He calls it 'place hacking' the recoding of closed, secret, hidden and forgotten urban space to make them realms of opportunity. "Explore Everything "is an account of the author's escapades with the London Consolidation Crew, an urban exploration collective. The book is also a manifesto, combining philosophy, politics and adventure, on our rights to the city and how to understand the twenty-first century metropolis...|$|R

There are 4. 7 million members consisting mostly of small depositors, small farmers, fisherfolks, market vendors and the micro, small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs).

5000|$|Tayu Usukawa (...) (1-48) is Doukoku's {{right hand}} {{and the only one}} he is kind to, {{provided}} she knows her place as his obedient, unquestioning servant. Doukoku takes her in after her rebirth as a Gedoushu, giving her the name she now goes by and telling her that she has <b>nowhere</b> else <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> him. But her unique origins set her apart from normal Gedoshu as she can move freely in the mortal realm. In life, she was Usuyuki (薄雪) a shamisen player who obsessed over a man named Shinza. Scorned that he loved another woman instead of her, Usuyuki set fire to the building holding his wedding ceremony, killing him, his bride, and the entirety of their wedding party, in a suicidal crime of passion. Seeing that her love would remain unrequited to the bitter end, Usuyuki's emotions corrupt her soul and caused her rebirth into Tayu. The transformation also forcefully bonded Shinza's soul into the shamisen that Tayu carries with her, creating the eerie and unsettling songs that serve to soothe Doukoku's rage. The shamisen's headstock also doubles as the hilt of a shortsword Tayu uses in battle.|$|R

60|$|The square {{served as}} a cool retreat for the {{inhabitants}} of crowded tenements {{and those who had}} <b>nowhere</b> else <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>but</b> Margaret Keith was not fastidious about her company. She was interested in the unkempt emigrants who, waiting for a Westbound train, lay upon the grass, surrounded by their tired children, and she had sent Millicent down the street to buy fruit to distribute among the travellers; she liked to watch the French Canadian girls who slipped quietly up the broad cathedral steps. They were the daughters of the rank and file, but their movements were graceful and they were tastefully dressed. Then the blue-shirted, sinewy men, who strolled past, smoking, roused her curiosity. They had not acquired their free, springy stride in the cities; these were adventurers who had met with strange experiences in the frozen North and the lonely West. Some of them had hard faces and a predatory air, but that added to their interest. Margaret Keith liked to watch them all and speculate about their mode of life; that pleasure could still be enjoyed, though as she sometimes told herself with humorous resignation, she could no longer take a very active part in things.|$|R

5000|$|There's {{a case to}} be {{made that}} the Beatles <b>went</b> on <b>to</b> do Sgt. Pepper's because there was <b>nowhere</b> else <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>but</b> too far. With Revolver, they had mapped out the pop {{universe}} so perfectly that all they could do next was tear it up and start again. - David Quantick, writing in Q magazine, 2000 Whereas Sgt. Pepper had long been identified as the Beatles' greatest album, since the 2000s Revolver has often surpassed it in lists of the group's best work. Sheffield cites the album's 1987 CD release, with the full complement of Lennon compositions, as marking the start of a process whereby Revolver [...] "steadily climbed in public estimation" [...] to become recognised as the Beatles' finest work. In Britain, its supremacy over Sgt. Pepper was one of the cultural revisions established by the Britpop phenomenon in the 1990s. Writing on the BBC's website in August 2016, Greg Kot identified the [...] "More popular than Christ" [...] controversy and the attention subsequently afforded the release of Sgt. Pepper in 1967 as the two factors that had contributed to Revolver being relatively overlooked. Kot concluded that the ensuing decades had seen this impression reversed, since Revolver [...] "does everything Sgt Pepper did, except it did it first and often better. It just wasn’t as well-packaged and marketed." ...|$|R
