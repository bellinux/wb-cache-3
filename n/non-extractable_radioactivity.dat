40|$|The {{fate and}} the {{formation}} of non-extractable residues of the fungicide 14 C-metalaxyl has been observed in in vitro experiments as well as in incubation experiments using non-sterile and sterile soil from Ultuna (Uppsala, Sweden). The main focus of the present study laid on the influence of extracellular phenoloxidases and peroxidases on the NER formation. The results from the in vitro experiments leads to the assumption that a covalent linkage between the fungicide and representatives of the humic substances like resorcinol as well as humic matter fractions which were directly isolated from the soil before incubation is likely. These linkages have been catalyzed by phenoloxidases, represented by laccase from Trametes versicolor, and peroxidases, represented by lignin-peroxidase. Based on actual conceptions, these enzymes catalyze oxidative coupling reactions of the soil organic matter. Additionally, they drive the incorporation of the xenobiotic substance by co-polymerisation in a radical mediated process. The use of sterilized soil samples enabled the possibility to differentiate between the different sources of oxidative activity. In all samples, the major part of the applied radioactivity remained extractable (> 70 %) because metalaxyl and its first major transformation product metalaxyl acid were highly mobile within the soil water phase and did not interact with the surfaces in soil very much. The microbial decomposition of both substances was very low and therefore only a low mineralization has been detected in the samples (~ 4, 7 % within non-sterile soil after 92 days of incubation). The amounts of <b>non-extractable</b> <b>radioactivity</b> correlated with the microbial activity, the organic matter content and the activities of extracellular phenoloxidases and peroxidases in the soil. Therefore about 24, 6 % of the applied radioactivity remained unextractable in non sterile bulk soil samples, between 5 and 9 % remained in bulk soil samples without microbial activity but remaining exocellular activities and about 3 % remained in bulk soil samples with abiotic influence after 92 days of incubation and exhaustive extraction. These NER consist partly of metalaxyl and metalaxyl acid and were therefore incorporated and covalently bound xenobiotic substances. Only minor amounts of the NER can be biogenic residues. These xenobiotic NER have a high environmental risk (incorporated NER) o rather a low environmental risk (covalently bound NER). Analogous to the in vitro experiments, it can be assumed that a portion of the applied radio-labeled fungicide and its first transformation product were covalently bound to the soil organic matter as a consequence of enzymatically mediated oxidative coupling. After incubation of clay and silt fractions which have been isolated from the soil, it was possible to confirm these suggestions. Again the enzymatically mediated incorporation of radioactivity took place if factors influencing this process are located together in the soil. The enzymatic influence was finally proofed in incubation systems including sterile soil, and laccase that has been immobilized on alginate. In these samples about 6, 3 % of the applied radioactivity remained unextractable after exhaustive extraction compared to soil without immobilized laccase (3 – 4 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Recent {{epidemiological}} studies reveal associations between exposure to environmental pollutants and cardiovascular disorders in humans. Elevated serum concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have for instance {{been associated with}} cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension (1 - 3). Exposure to the carbonate plastic monomer bisphenol A (BPA) {{has been associated with}} an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and atherogenic changes in the vascular wall (4 - 6). The contention that the human cardiovascular system is a sensitive target for toxic chemicals gain support from our earlier and recent experimental studies in rodents, birds and fish, as well as in cultured human primary endothelial cells. It is also compatible with earlier observations that certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental carcinogens that may also contribute to atherosclerosis in mice and birds (7, 8). In this presentation we will briefly discuss effects of Ah receptor (AhR) agonists (e. g. the coplanar PCB 126 or BNF, ß-naphthoflavone) on the expression of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 enzymes in various endothelia in rodents in vivo or ex vivo, as well as in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The CYP 1 -dependent bioactivation and irreversible binding of prototype polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and heterocyclic amines such as benzo(a) pyrene (BaP), 7, 12 -dimethyl- benz(a) anthracene (DMBA) and 3 -amino- 1, 4 -dimethyl- 5 H-pyrido- [4, 3 -b]indole (Trp-P 1) in these endothelia will be reviewed. We will also report how PCB 126 affects vasoactive factors in HUVEC, and how these effects are modulated by physiological 17 ß-oestradiol concentrations. Some effects of PCB 126, 1 -nitropyrene (1 -NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) on biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction, cell stress and DNA damage in HUVEC will finally be presented. Material and methods Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Science Cell Research laboratories, Carlsbad, CA. C 57 Bl mice and Wistar or Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from various suppliers. All animal experiments were approved by the Local Ethical Committee for Research on Animals in Uppsala and the studies followed the guidelines laid down by the Swedish and European Union legislation on animal experimentation. Rodents, tissue-slices and cultured cells were treated with model chemicals as previously described. Tape section and light microscopy autoradiographic imaging using 3 H-labelled BaP, DMBA and Trp-P- 1 and immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (9 - 19). Precision-cut tissue slices for in vitro autoradiography were prepared as described in (14) and the slices were incubated with various 3 H-labelled chemicals. HUVEC were exposed to various compounds and the detection of biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, DNA damage were performed as described (20 - 22). Finally, female Fischer rats were exposed to BPA (0. 025, 0. 25 and 2. 5 mg/l) and fructose (50 g/l) in the drinking water from 5 to 15 weeks of age to mimic human exposure (unpublished data). Results and discussion Co-localization of CYP 1 A 1 expression and BaP, DMBA and Trp-P- 1 adduct formation in endothelial linings As demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, a high CYP 1 A immunoreactivity occurred in capillaries of the heart, skeletal muscle, uterus and in blood-brain interfaces such as the leptomeninges and plexus choroideus, whereas no expression was observed for instance in cerebral capillary endothelial cells of mice treated with AhR agonists (9 - 11). No, or very low constitutive immunoreactivities were observed in these endothelia in vehicle-treated animals. No basal or induced CYP 1 B 1 expression was observed in endothelial cells, while a weak CYP 1 B 1 immunostaining was detected in the muscle layer of small arteries. It should be noted that in subcellular preparations of whole organs, e. g. heart and brain, the CYP 1 A 1 in endothelial cells is diluted due to cells that do not express high levels of CYP 1 A 1, for examples myocytes or neurons, in excess. A cell-specific metabolism in endothelial cells may therefore remain undetected due to the presence of metabolically inactive cells. In order to detect minor sites of bioactivation such as endothelial linings we employed light microscopic autoradiographic imaging to examine the bioactivation and subsequent irreversible binding of the radiolabelled prototype toxicants in tissues of animals pretreated with AhR-agonists. As determined by light microscopic autoradiography of AhR-agonist-treated mice exposed to 3 H-labelled BaP, DMBA or Trp-P- 1 and birds exposed to 3 H-Trp-P- 1 a significant accumulation of <b>non-extractable</b> <b>radioactivity</b> occurred in endothelial linings (9 - 18). The bound radioactivity occurred in the nuclei and the perinuclear cytoplasm, suggesting that the autoradiograms depict both DNA- and protein-bound adducts. Since the binding sites of 3 H-labelled BaP, DMBA or Trp-P- 1 corresponded with the sites of CYP 1 A 1 induction, we concluded that rodents express a constitutively low but highly inducible and functional CYP 1 A 1 in endothelial cells. The binding of reactive metabolites in endothelial cells exceeded the binding in all other cell types in AhR-agonist treated mice and was abolished by pretreatment with the CYP 1 A 1 inhibitor ellipticine, supporting a CYP 1 A 1 -catalysed metabolic activation in situ to a reactive species (9, 10, 12). These findings imply that there is a preferential CYP 1 A 1 -catalysed formation of reactive metabolites from all three carcinogens in endothelial cells expressing high CYP 1 A 1 levels. Interestingly, however, carcinogenesis in endothelial cells is a relative rare finding, suggesting that degenerative lesions and cell death may be more prevalent responses to metabolism-activated carcinogens/mutagens in these cells. Experiments with 3 H-DMBA and 3 H-Trp-P- 1 in HUVEC confirmed that AhR-agonists induced an increased bioactivation, suggesting that also human endothelial cells should be targets for toxicity of reactive intermediates formed from CYP 1 A 1 - activated carcinogens/mutagens (17 - 18). This conclusion is supported by immunohistochemical studies on the heavily vascularized human endometrium demonstrating an expression of CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1 protein in and around human endometrial blood vessels, although a large interindividual variation was observed (19). None of the endometrial biopsy samples displayed vascular expression of CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 B 6, CYP 2 C 8 / 2 C 9 / 2 C 19, CYP 2 D 6, or CYP 3 A 4 / 5 protein. Effects of PCB 126, 1 -NP, and BPA on biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and cell stress in endothelial cells In vitro studies demonstrated that PCB 126 increased the levels of vasoconstriction factors and decreased the levels of vasodilating factors in cultured HUVEC in a fashion that is characteristic for endothelial dysfunction related to human hypertension. The study showed that the co-planar PCB 126 induced expression of the endothelium-derived vasoconstriction factor COX- 2 and stimulated formation of the vasoconstrictor prostaglandin PGF 2  via the AhR in HUVEC (20). COX- 2 is known {{to play a role in}} hypertension by catalysing the formation of vasoconstriction prostaglandins and by stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Further studies demonstrated that PCB 126 increased the production of the vasoconstriction prostaglandin PGF 2  and ROS in HUVEC. The relationship between increased ROS production and human hypertension is well established, ROS promotes vasoconstriction by stimulating the production of vasoconstriction prostaglandins and by reducing bioavailability of the vasorelaxing factor NO. Indeed, exposure to PCB 126 slightly reduced the production of NO in HUVEC. Furthermore, the PCB 126 -induced mRNA expressions of CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 B 1 and COX- 2 in HUVEC were enhanced in the presence of physiological levels of 17 - estradiol. This suggests that increased levels of oestrogen stimulate AhR-dependent transcription of genes previously associated with endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. In another study we have examined the effects of a nitrated PAH, 1 -nitropyrene, that is abundant in diesel exhausts (21). The results revealed that 1 -NP induced DNA damage, increased levels of ROS and increased protein expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress chaperone GRP 78 in cultured HUVEC. Induction of CYP 1 A 1 by PCB 126 as well as inhibition of nitroreductive metabolism by dicoumarol attenuated the induction of DNA damage, intracellular ROS levels and GRP 78 expression. This suggests that the effects of 1 -NP on HUVEC were mediated by metabolites mainly formed at nitroreduction and not by CYP 1 -dependent bioactivation to reactive intermediates. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that bisphenol A increased the mRNA expression of genes that regulate vasoconstriction and angiogenesis in HUVEC (eNOS, VEGF, VEGFR 2, connexin 43 and ACE 1) and in human cardiomyocytes (eNOS and ACE 1) (22). The results also showed that BPA increased the expression of P-eNOS(ser 1177) and the production of NO in HUVEC. NO is the main effector molecule in angiogenesis downstream of VEGF. Based on the findings that BPA increase the expression of proangiogenic factors we investigated whether BPA could stimulate in vitro angiogenesis in HUVEC using the endothelial tube formation assay. The results demonstrated that BPA increased HUVEC tube formation suggesting that BPA can act directly on the endothelium and stimulate angiogenesis. Long-term exposure in rats revealed that environmentally relevant levels of BPA, increased the cardiac mRNA expression of genes that regulate vasoconstriction and angiogenesis. Ten weeks exposure of rats from preadolescence to adulthood to BPA in the drinking water increased the expression of eNOS, VEGF, VEGFR 2 and ACE 1 in the heart. Taken together, the genes that were upregulated in rat cardiac tissues in vivo were also upregulated in human endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes in vitro. The heart is a heavily vascularized tissue that consists mainly of cardiac endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes and although cardiomyocytes dominate the volume of the myocardium the number of endothelial cells exceeds the number of cardiomyocytes by approximately three to one. Thus, the effects of BPA on eNOS VEGF, VEGFR 2 and ACE 1 mRNA expression in rat cardiac tissues are most likely to be related to an effect of BPA on endothelial cells but may also involve cardiomyocytes. We conclude that endothelial cells may be targets for bioactivation and toxicity of environmental pollutants. The immunohistochemical and autoradiographic data demonstrated a differential expression of CYP 1 enzymes and metabolic activation of pollutants in various endothelial linings suggesting that some but not all endothelial linings may be targets for xenobiotics metabolised by AhR-regulated enzymes. Studies on the effects of PCB 126, 1 -nitropyrene and BPA in cultured human primary endothelial cells demonstrated up-regulation of various biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction and cell stress suggesting that the human endothelium may be a sensitive target for these pollutants. The bioactivation and effects of environmental pollutants in endothelial cells should be further studied in order to unravel the role of these chemicals in human cardiovascular disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of different fractions of {{soil organic matter}} on the retention of the herbicide isoproturon (IPU) has been evaluated. Water and methanol extractable residues of 14 C labeled isoproturon have been determined in two Moroccan soils by β-counting–liquid chromatography. The quantification of bound residues in soil and in different fractions of soil humic substances has been performed using pyrolysis/scintillation-detected gas-chromatography. Microbial mineralization of the herbicide and soil organic matter has been also monitored. Retention of isoproturon residues after 30 -days incubation ranged from 22 % to 32 % (<b>non-extractable</b> fraction). The <b>radioactivity</b> extracted in an aqueous environment was from 20 % to 33 % of the amount used for the treatment; meanwhile, methanol was able to extract another 48 %. Both soils showed quantities of bound residues into the humin fraction higher than humic and fulvic acids. The total amount of residues retained into the organic matter of the soils was about 65 % of non-extractable fraction, and this percentage did not change with incubation time; on the contrary, the sorption rate of the retention reaction is mostly influenced by the clay fraction and organic content of the soil. Only a little part of the herbicide was mineralized during the experimental time...|$|R
40|$|Microcystins are {{the most}} common cyanotoxins and may be {{expected}} wherever blooms of cyanobacteria occur in surface waters. Their persistence both in the irrigation water and in the soil can lead to their transfer and bioaccumulation into agricultural plants. The aim of this work was to investigate microcystin accumulation in Solanum lycopersicum cultivar MicroTom. The plant was exposed to either Microcystis aeruginosa crude extracts containing up to 100 μg eq. MC-LR L− 1 in a soil–plant system for 90 days or pure radiolabeled 14 C-MC-LR in a hydroponic condition for 48 h. Toxin bioaccumulation in the soil and different plant tissues was assessed both by the PP 2 A inhibition assay and by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). After 90 days of exposure, microcystins persisted in the soil and their free extractable concentrations accumulated were very low varying between 1. 6 and 3. 9 μg eq. MC-LR kg− 1 DW. Free MC-LR was detected only in roots and leaves with concentrations varying between 4. 5 and 8. 1 μg kg− 1 DW and between 0. 29 and 0. 55 μg kg− 1 DW, respectively. By using radioactivity (14 C-MC-LR), the results have reported a growing accumulation of toxins within the organs roots > leaves > stems and allowed them to confirm the absence of MC-LR in fruits after 48 h of exposure. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) was 13. 6 in roots, 4. 5 in leaves, and 1. 4 in stems. On the other hand, the results highlight the presence of two radioactive fractions in different plant tissues. The <b>non-extractable</b> fraction of <b>radioactivity,</b> corresponding to the covalently bound MC-LR, was higher than that of the extractable fraction only in roots and leaves reaching 56 % and 71 % of the total accumulated toxin, respectively. Therefore, results raise that monitoring programs must monitor the presence of MCs in the irrigation water to avoid the transfer and accumulation of these toxins in crops...|$|R
