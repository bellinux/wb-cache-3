The GMR intensity measured in rapidly solidified Cu(100 -x) Co(x) ribbons (x = 5 to 25 %) depends not only on the nominal composition of the alloy but also on microstructural parameters. In this work, the magnetisation behavior of Cu(100 -x) Co(x) melt-spun ribbons has been studied as a function of temperature in tempering condition. A different magnetisation behavior has been identified as a function of Co content. The deviations from the low-temperature Langevin law are investigated for all the studied alloys...|$|R

30|$|The two-step {{method is}} largely {{used in the}} {{synthesis}} of nanofluids. In this method, nanoparticles, nanotubes or other non-materials employed are first produced as dry powders by chemical or physical methods. Then the <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> are <b>dispersed</b> in a fluid in the second processing step {{with the help of}} ultrasonic agitation, high-shear mixing, homogenizing and ball milling. The two-step method is the most beneficial method to produce nanofluids in large scale, because nanoparticle synthesis processes have already been scaled up to industrial production levels. For example, Wang et al. (1999) used this method to produce Al 2 O 3 nanofluids. Murshed et al. (2005) made TiO 2 suspension in water using this method. As compared to the one-step method, the two-step method works better for nanoparticles containing oxides, while it is not effective with metallic particles.|$|R

30|$|Energy {{concerns}} {{have come up}} {{as the most important}} problem for the world's scientists and engineers. Thermal loads are increasing day by day and have wide variety of use in electronics, transportation, power plants, food industry, air conditioning, refrigeration, etc. The conventional heat transfer fluids, such as water, oil, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol are mostly used in industries. These fluids contain poor thermal properties. In order to increase heat transfer rates, the use of extended-surface thermal control technologies such as fins and micro channels, vibration of heated surface, injection or suction of fluid and applying electrical or magnetic fields has reached to the bottleneck. Therefore, new technologies with the potential to improve the thermo-physical properties of the conventional cooling fluids have been an area of great potential for researchers. The solids have better thermal properties than fluids. Ahuja (1975) and Liu et al. (2999) carried experiments to enhance the thermo-physical properties of fluids by adding micrometre- and millimetre-sized solid particles in the base liquids. However, real-world applications of these fluids are fewer due to the reasons, i.e. large-sized particles tend to quickly settle out of suspension and thereby, in passing through micro channels, cause clogging and a considerable rise in the pressure drop. Furthermore, the abrasive actions of these particles cause erosion of components and pipelines. To overcome these problems, <b>nanosized</b> <b>particles</b> <b>dispersed</b> in the base fluid known as nanofluids, were firstly introduced by Choi (1995) at the Argonne National Laboratory. These novel fluids indicated improved heat transfer properties such as higher thermal conductivity, long-standing stability and uniformity along with the negligible obstruction in flow channels due to very small sizes and large specific areas of the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles used to prepare the nanofluids are basically metals (e.g. Cu, Ni, Al), oxides (e.g. Al 2 O 3, TiO 2, CuO, SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, BaTiO 3) and some other compounds (e.g. CNT, TNT, AlN, SiC, CaCO 3, graphene) with a size of 1 to 100  nm. The great quantum of research on heat transfer enhancement shows the appreciable growth and the necessity of heat transfer enhancement technology in the field of nanofluids.|$|R

The electrical conductivity, measured in the oxygen partial pressure range of 10 (- 20) to 0. 5 atm at 940 - 1270 K, increases with manganese and strontium additions which lead, however, to higher reducibility. In addition to the thermodynamic stability limitations under the SOFC anodic conditions, the latter factor raises the importance of chemically induced expansion, as for Fe-substituted (La,Sr) CrO 3 (- delta).

In this thesis, two strategies were applied to achieve this goal: i) <b>nanosized</b> iridium <b>particles</b> were <b>dispersed</b> on porous aerogel antimony- or niobium-doped tin dioxide (ATO or NTO); ii) different thermal treatment protocols were used for bimetallic IrRu. Catalysts were prepared using wet chemical synthesis method by reducing IrCl 3 or RuCl 3 in anhydrous ethanol. By adding aerogel support and introducing vanadium, the mass activity and stability of the catalyst were improved. Electrochemical characterization, such as cyclic voltammogram (CV), chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used for evaluating its electrochemical performance; SEM and EDX were carried out to analyze the morphologies and elements distribution of the catalysts. In addition, copper under potential deposition (Cu-UPD) on supported iridium catalysts was performed to determine the number of surface iridium atoms available for electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, bimetallic IrRu catalyst was thermally treated using various thermal treatment protocols and evaluated electrochemically by cyclic voltammogram.

This study combines a theoretical approach based on a force analysis with an experimental study of the removal of <b>nanosized</b> slurry <b>particles.</b> In the theoretical part, all forces affecting the adhesion and the removal of particles are evaluated to determine which are dominant in two extreme removal mechanisms: lifting and rolling. In the experimental part, the removal efficiency of 34 nm SiO 2 particles is investigated by using the haze approach. Based on a study of the aging of contaminated wafers, conditions are selected where no chemical bonds are formed between a particle and a substrate.

This synthesis is summarized by three sequential precipitation reactions: (1) precipitation of nanosized acicular goethite (α-FeOOH) using a high OH/Fe molar ratio (= 5); (2) instantaneous precipitation of portlandite (Ca(OH) 2) by adding CaCl 2 salt to a goethite alkaline suspension (2 NaOH + CaCl 2 =Ca(OH) 2 + 2 NaCl) and; (3) sub-micrometric calcite precipitation by injection of CO 2 into a goethite-portlandite alkaline suspension (Ca(OH) 2 + CO 2 =CaCO 3 +H 2 O). The XRD patterns have confirmed the goethite and calcite mineral composition in the composite precipitated at 30 and 70 °C. FESEM and TEM observations have revealed the formation of <b>nanosized</b> goethite <b>particles</b> well <b>dispersed</b> with sub-micrometric calcite particles, leading to an orange-brown colour nanocomposite with high specific surface area of around 92 m 2 /g for a composite synthesized at 30 °C and 45 m 2 /g for a composite synthesized at 70 °C.
