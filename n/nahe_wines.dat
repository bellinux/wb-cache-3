5000|$|Niederhausen’s {{structure}} is characterized mainly by winegrowing. Twelve individual winegrowing locations - Einzellagen - are distributed among roughly 120 ha of vineyards. One {{of the best}} known winegrowing operations was the Königlich-Preußische Weinbaudomäne Niederhausen-Schloßböckelheim (“Royal Prussian Winegrowing Domain”). It was already fostering winegrowing in the 19th century, especially against the phylloxera plague introduced from the United States along with the rise in fungal pests. This winegrowing domain gave <b>Nahe</b> <b>wines</b> added strength on the market, having before been sold under other names such as “Rüdesheimer” (referring to Rüdesheim am Rhein rather than Rüdesheim an der Nahe) or “Rhine Wine”, having no well known identity of its own.

Today the {{majority}} of <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> is consumed domestically with the nine member estates of the VDP having the largest export market of the region. Unlike other German wine regions, co-operatives have a smaller presence that pales in comparison to the influences of the large German supermarket chains that form a large sector of the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> market.|$|R

The local winemakers offer their wares each year on the last weekend in August at the village square. There the festival begins with the tapping of the Meddersheim wine barrel and the free {{dispensing}} of the contents by the incumbent mayor. As well, the local clubs supply the guests with alcohol-free drinks and food. This festival draws hundreds to the village each year.|$|R
50|$|Schöneberg’s {{preferred}} vineyard locations {{have been}} found since yore {{at the edge of}} the Aubach or Steyerbach valley. These locations are distinguished mainly by their cultivation using slopes. The wines from these vineyards are mainly fruity and tangy. For years, however, the number of winemakers has fast been falling. The two locations known as Schäfersley and Sonnenberg lie at the northern edge of the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region and belong to the winemaking appellation - Großlage - Pfarrgarten. Winegrowing was brought to the region by the Romans.|$|R
5000|$|The Rhine {{forms the}} eastern and {{northern}} boundary of the region, with the Nahe River {{to the west and}} the Haardt Mountains to the south. The Palatinate wine region lies to the south, the Rheingau lies across the Rhine to the north, and the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region to the west. Known as the [...] "land of the thousand hills", the terrain is undulating with vineyards mixed with orchards and other forms of farming. Its larger towns include: Mainz, Worms, Bingen, Alzey, Nieder-Olm and Ingelheim.|$|R
5000|$|The {{southern}} {{foothills of}} the Hunsrück and the northern North Palatine Uplands {{on either side of}} the Nahe are both described as the [...] "Naheland". The Naheland extends for about 80 km from west to east from the source of the river in the Saarland to its mouth on the River Rhine in the town of Bingen. Whilst the narrow strip of land in the west is covered by woods and agricultural land, vineyards of the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region dominate the wider eastern section.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the region}} was {{populated}} already in Roman times, and the village of Monzingen was mentioned as a wine village as early as 778, the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region was defined only with the 1971 German wine law. Before that, the wines were sold as plain [...] "Rhine wine". In recent decades, several Nahe producers have {{made a name for}} themselves with Riesling wines that have been rated very highly by international wine critics, and have come to be seen as being on par with the best wines of Moselle and Rheingau wines.|$|R
5000|$|Rümmelsheim {{belongs to}} the Nahetal Winegrowing Area within the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region.

50|$|Flowing through Gutenberg is the Gräfenbach. Gutenberg {{belongs to}} the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region and lies {{at the foot of}} the Soonwald in the Hunsrück. Its {{elevation}} is roughly 145 m above sea level and it lies some 7 km from the district seat, Bad Kreuznach. Bad Sobernheim, Idar-Oberstein, Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg and Bingen am Rhein also lie relatively nearby. Gutenberg is distinguished by the consistency of its weather, low rainfall averaging only 480 mm yearly and a great many sunny days. This has led the municipality to adopt the slogan “Gutenberg - auf der Sonnenseite der Welt” (“Gutenberg - on the sunny side of the world”).|$|R
50|$|Bad Sobernheim {{belongs to}} the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region. The {{winemaking}} appellation - Großlage - is called Paradiesgarten, while individual Sobernheim wineries - Einzellagen - are Domberg and Marbach. Winegrowing and tourism {{go hand in hand}} here. The Weinwanderweg Rhein-Nahe (“Rhine-Nahe Wine Hiking Trail”), the Nahe-Radweg (“Nahe Cycle Way”) and the Naheweinstraße (“Nahe Wine Road”) all run through the town’s municipal area and on through the Verbandsgemeinde. Even today, agriculture still defines part of the region’s culture, giving rise to, among other things, a great grape and fruit market in the town each autumn. Many winemakers also have gastronomical enterprises. The traditional grape variety is Riesling.|$|R
5000|$|Hochstätten {{is known}} for its wine growing. Once {{precious}} locations have had to be given up because the steep slopes had become ever more troublesome to work, and thus unprofitable. The vines on the southern slopes, on soil that is in part slaty, produce good wine, known far beyond the borders of the Nahegau as Hochstätter Liebesbrunnen. Today, about 32 ha (80 acres) of vineyards are worked. Hochstätten was home to Ilse Theobald, German Wine Queen [...] "Ilse I" [...] in 1966-67, and also to Barbara Laubenstein, the <b>Nahe</b> <b>Wine</b> Queen [...] "Barbara I" [...] in 1984-85. Sandra Laubenstein shared this honour in 1996-97.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the vineyards in the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region are found {{along the banks of}} the Nahe from Martinstein, near the historic village of Monzingen and then downstream to its confluence with the Rhine at Bingen am Rhein. The region is broadly divided into three subregions, though there are quality wines that carry the [...] "Nahe" [...] designation that are produced outside of these. The main regions are the Upper Nahe, Bad Kreuznach and Lower Nahe. The wine-producing areas outside of these subregions includes the river Alsenz area that meets the Nahe at Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg and the villages of Bockenau, Roxheim, Sommerloch and Wallhausen several miles northwest of the Nahe.|$|R
50|$|The Nahe {{was one of}} {{the last}} few German wine regions to develop {{significant}} plantings, being planted nearly six centuries after the Romans first cultivated the Mosel region. By the Middle Ages, viticulture was flourishing in the region under the care of Church-run vineyards. During the 19th century, the Nahe was considered one of Germany's finest wine regions and continued its prosperity till experiencing economic downturns following the world wars of the 20th century. While other German wine regions became more industrialized, the more rural Nahe fell behind and its resence on the world's wine market was dramatically reduced. Towards the end of the 20th century, reforms and renewed optimism among the Nahe winemakers would usher in a period of renaissance in the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> industry.|$|R
50|$|The subregion of Bad Kreuznach {{includes}} the vineyards {{north of the}} town that are dominated with clay- and loess-based soils. The area has been traditionally led by large family-owned estates, {{such as those of}} the Anheuser family (of which the brewer Eberhard Anheuser was a part) and the Reichsgrafen von Plettenberg who are still producing wine today. These families were instrumental in the years after World War II in sustaining the reputation of <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> but the Bad Kreuznach region, as a whole, has seen a steady decline {{since the end of the}} 20th century with very few vineyards participating in the VDP (Verband Deutscher Prädikats- und Qualitätsweingüter) organization. The region still has some quality vineyards with the Kahlenberg and Krötenpfuhl being the most significant.|$|R
5000|$|Odernheim lies at {{the edge}} of the North Palatine Uplands at the mouth of the River Glan, where it empties into the River Nahe. This village, lying at the foot of the Disibodenberg, an {{important}} monastic centre in the Middle Ages, is surrounded by vineyards, forests and meadows in the southeastern part of the Verbandsgemeinde of Bad Sobernheim, and in the middle of the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region. Among nearby towns, the Verbandsgemeinde seat of Bad Sobernheim lies 4 km to the northwest, the district seat of Bad Kreuznach 16 km to the northeast, Kirn 20 km to the west and Meisenheim 7 km to the south. Farther afield, Bingen am Rhein lies roughly 27 km to the northnortheast, while to the northeast lie Mainz (48 km), Wiesbaden just beyond and Frankfurt (80 km) ...|$|R

50|$|On 5 October 1950, Niederhausen {{was granted}} {{approval}} by the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior to bear arms. It may well {{be one of the}} few coats of arms in Rhineland-Palatinate that so clearly expresses a winegrowing village’s character. Moreover, it shows the importance and standing that are accorded the Qualitätswein made here. All this is represented by the main charge, the three bunches of grapes. The other charge, the crown in chief (the uppermost level of the shield) refers not only to the village’s former patron saint Mechtildis, whose crown also appeared in the old court seal, but also to the marketing slogan for the <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region: Nahewein - Ein Edelstein (“Nahe wine - a precious stone”). The connection, however, is lost in the translation. The crown is held to remind one of the Edelstein, as this German word for “precious stone” literally means “noble stone”.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Nahe</b> <b>wine</b> region {{follows the}} path of the Nahe river in its northeasterly descent towards the Rhine. The river helps {{moderate}} the temperate climate of the region and the valleys of the Nahe's tributaries help foster diverse microclimates through the region. The Soonwald ranges to the northeast and rocky foothills to the east help retain heat and moderate the amount of rainfall that the region receives. Some south-facing vineyards have microclimates that are similar to a Mediterranean climate and are being experimented with for red wine grape cultivation. The Nahe flows parallel to the Moselle and lies 40 km to the southeast of the Mosel wine region. The Mittelrhein and Rheingau wine regions lie to the north/northeast with the Rheinhessen forming the region's eastern border. Vineyards are located on steep slopes along the Nahe and its tributaries typically at elevations of 100-300 meters (330-985 ft).|$|R

She thus became the eighth German Wine Queen from the <b>Nahe.</b> The <b>wine</b> princesses during her twelve-month reign are Ramona Diegel (Rheinhessen) and Sabine Wagner (Rheingau).
