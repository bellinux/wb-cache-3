The survey contained an over sample of respondents from the Ukrainian-controlled areas of the Donbass, a majority of whom also affirmed their wish for the entire region to stay in Ukraine. The survey results showed that 80% of Ukrainians nationally and 73% of people living in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts supported that the separatist-controlled areas should remain part of Ukraine. Although, around 60% of the people do not believe Ukraine is doing enough to regain the lost territories because of the Minsk agreements.|$|E

25|$|Years {{of contact}} with Westerners and {{a high level of}} {{literacy}} had allowed a literate upper class of clerks, farmers, and traders to emerge. This class were familiar with European law and conventions, which allowed them to pressure the German colonial government with petitions, legal proceedings, and special interest groups to oppose unpopular or unfair policies. A series of these began in 1910, when the German administration initiated a <b>new</b> <b>poll</b> tax, attempted to seize lands in Douala township, and then tried to oust the native population from the town completely. King Bell's successor, King Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to rally resistance by sending emissaries to visit the leaders of inland groups. Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum tipped the Germans off, and Bell and his collaborators were executed in 1914 for high treason.|$|E
25|$|A poll tax, {{also called}} {{a per capita}} tax, or {{capitation}} tax, is a tax that levies a set amount per individual. It {{is an example of}} the concept of fixed tax. One of the earliest taxes mentioned in the Bible of a half-shekel per annum from each adult Jew (Ex. 30:11–16) was a form of poll tax. Poll taxes are administratively cheap because they are easy to compute and collect and difficult to cheat. Economists have considered poll taxes economically efficient because people are presumed to be in fixed supply and poll taxes therefore do not lead to economic distortions. However, poll taxes are very unpopular because poorer people pay a higher proportion of their income than richer people. In addition, the supply of people is in fact not fixed over time: on average, couples will choose to have fewer children if a poll tax is imposed. The introduction of a poll tax in medieval England was the primary cause of the 1381 Peasants' Revolt. Scotland was the first to be used to test the <b>new</b> <b>poll</b> tax in 1989 with England and Wales in 1990. The change from a progressive local taxation based on property values to a single-rate form of taxation regardless of ability to pay (the Community Charge, but more popularly referred to as the Poll Tax), led to widespread refusal to pay and to incidents of civil unrest, known colloquially as the 'Poll Tax Riots'.|$|E

When Dead Man's Chest grossed over [...] worldwide, Ian Nathan attributed this to Sparrow's popularity: [...] "Pirates, the franchise, only had to turn up. There was a powerful holdover from the cheeky delights of its debut, something we hadn't felt since the Clone Wars called it a day." [...] Empire in 2006 declared Depp's performance the seventy-fourth [...] "thing that rocked our world" [...] and later named him the eighth greatest movie character of all time. In 2015, a <b>new</b> <b>poll</b> of the 100 greatest film characters of all time placed him as the fourteenth greatest. A survey of more than 3,000 people showed Jack Sparrow was the most popular Halloween costume of 2006, and a 2007 poll held by the Internet Movie Database showed Sparrow to be the second most popular live action hero after Indiana Jones. In a 2007 Pearl& Dean poll, Jack Sparrow was listed as Depp's most popular performance.|$|E

[...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush put his hand on McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't give me that shit.

2500|$|Since its inception, {{the impact}} of the {{stimulus}} has been a subject of disagreement. Studies on its effects have produced a range of conclusions, from strongly positive to strongly negative and all reactions in between. In 2012, the IGM Forum poll conducted by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found 80% of leading economists agree unemployment was lower at the end of 2010 {{than it would have been}} without the stimulus. Regarding whether the benefits of the stimulus outweighed its costs: 46% [...] "agreed" [...] or [...] "strongly agreed" [...] that the benefits outweighed the costs, 27% were uncertain, and 12% disagreed or strongly disagreed. IGM Forum asked the same question to leading economists in 2014. This <b>new</b> <b>poll</b> found 82% of leading economists strongly agreed or agreed that unemployment was lower in 2010 than it would have been without the stimulus. Revisiting the question about the benefits outweighing the costs, 56% strongly agreed or agreed that it did, 23% were uncertain, and 5% disagreed.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 June 2009, Kraft {{released}} {{a new version}} of Vegemite. The formula combines Vegemite and Kraft cream cheese, spreads more easily and has a considerably less salty and milder taste than the original. To coincide with the release of the new recipe, Kraft ran a competition to give the new flavour a name. The new name was announced during the broadcast of the 2009 AFL Grand Final as iSnack 2.0. The name was chosen by a panel of marketing and communication experts to appeal to a younger market, capitalising on the popularity of Apple's iPod and iPhone. The choice immediately drew universal criticism and ridicule within Australia. Within days, opinion columns and social networking sites were flooded with derision and vitriol, and after only four days, Kraft released plans to abandon the iSnack name, admitting that {{it may have been a}} mistake. Two days later, Kraft opened a <b>new</b> <b>poll</b> on its website, and the final name was announced on 7 October 2009 as [...] "Vegemite Cheesybite", with Kraft claiming that the name had received 36% of the 30,357 votes that were cast for a name option, or approximately 10,900 votes. It was noted that the popular suggestion [...] "Cheesymite", long associated with the popular Cheesymite scroll, was already trademarked by other organisations.|$|E

In some of the latest Russian {{population}} polls, United States and its allies, constantly top the list of [...] "greatest threats". In 2013, 30% of Russians had a [...] "very unfavorable" [...] or [...] "somewhat unfavorable" [...] view of Americans and 40% viewed the U.S. in a [...] "very unfavorable" [...] or [...] "somewhat unfavorable" [...] light, up from 34% in 2012. Recent Polls from the Levada center survey shows that 71% of Russians have a negative or somewhat negative attitude to the U.S., up from 38% in 2013. It is the largest figure since the collapse of the USSR. In comparison to the 1990's the number of Russians unhappy with American policies at that time was only under 10%. In 2015, a <b>new</b> <b>poll</b> by the Levada center showed that 81% of Russians now hold unfavorable views of the United States, presumably as a result of U.S. and Western sanctions imposed against Russia because of the Ukrainian Crisis. Anti-Americanism in Russia is reportedly at its highest since the end of the Cold War.

One poll was part the 2014 poll of issues regarding the NFL, which included one question indicating 71% {{of the general public}} are in favor of keeping the name, with 18% in favor of a change. On their website the team states: [...] "This poll, along with the poll taken among Native Americans by the Annenberg Institute, demonstrates continued, widespread and deep opposition to the Redskins changing our name. The results of this poll are solidly in line with the message we have heard from fans and Native Americans for months – our name represents a tradition, passion and heritage that honors Native Americans. We respect {{the point of view of}} the small number of people who seek a name change, but it is important to recognize very few people agree with the case they are making." [...] The Oneida Indian Nation [...] "believes more Americans would favor changing the team name of the Washington NFL club if they understood the full context of what the Oneidas and others consider a racial slur." [...] Mike Florio points out that since an AP poll taken in April 2013 showed 79% in favor of keeping the name; the 71% result in the <b>new</b> <b>poll</b> is a significant decrease in support in a short time. A 2014 AP-Gfk Poll, however, showed 83% support keeping the name.|$|E
