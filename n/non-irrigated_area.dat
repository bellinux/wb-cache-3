40|$|Background This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Bura irrigation scheme in Tana River County and the pastoral area in Ijara, Garissa County in the eastern Kenya to establish the knowledge, attitude and practices on malaria transmission, control and management, and determine malaria prevalence and the associated risk factors. Methods A cross sectional survey design that involved 493 randomly selected people from 334 households was used between November and December 2013. All the randomly selected people were screened for malaria parasites using rapid diagnostic test (RDT) —Carestart™ malaria HRP 2 (pf) kit. A questionnaire was administered to determine potential risk factors and perceptions on malaria exposure within a period of 2 months prior to the survey. Two logistic regression models were fitted to the data; one used the RDT results while the other used data from the questionnaire survey. Results Using RDT, the prevalence of malaria was 4. 68 % (95 % CI: 1. 48 – 7. 88 %) and 0. 31 % (− 0. 30 to 0. 92 %) in irrigated and non-irrigated areas, respectively. From the questionnaires, 14. 62 % (9. 27 – 19. 97 %) and 23. 91 % (19. 23 – 28. 60 %) of the participants perceived to have had malaria in the irrigated and pastoral areas, respectively. The main malaria control measure was the use of bed nets: average of three nets per household in Bura irrigation scheme and one in Ijara. Artemether–lumefantrine was the main drug of choice mainly in the irrigated area while sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine was likely {{to be used in the}} <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>area.</b> Households located > 5 km from the nearest health facility had higher prevalence of Plasmodium infection than those located ≤ 5 km. Conclusion The residents of Bura irrigation scheme were more likely to be infected compared to those living in the <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>area</b> of Ijara. However, those in the <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>area</b> were more likely to be treated or use over-the-counter medication for perceived malaria illnesses compared to those in the irrigated area. There is a need, therefore, to formulate effective ways of managing malaria especially in irrigated areas and build capacity on differential diagnosis for malaria, especially in the pastoral areas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of the economic development on the farm households of Suphan Bri province in the Central Plain in Thailand, with an focus on the labor employment. During the last 25 years, Thailand has become a middle-income country from a low-income country and its economy has been changed from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy. These changes in the economic environment had various influences on the agricultural sector in Suphan Bri province, including the increased wage rates. According to the Village Basic Data Survey (Kor Chor Chor 2 (Soon) Kho) for a period of 1986 - 2001, the following facts are observed in Suphan Bri province: the increased number of villages; the increases in wage rates; the decreases in the family size; the increased number of non-farm households in a village; the increased paddy yield per land; and the increased use of chemical fertilizers and adoption of the high yield variety and the insecticide for the purpose of increasing paddy yield per land. Rationality of the labor input in the paddy production is investigated by using the individual samples from the firm economic survey conducted in three villages from each of the irrigated area, <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>area</b> and flood prone area in Suphan Bri province in 1987 and 1998. For this purpose, the Cobb-Douglas type production functions of paddy production are first estimated. Then, the marginal productivities of labor estimated for each sample farm household are compared with the wage rates. Based on the full sample analysis of 1987 and 1998, rationality of labor input in the paddy production is confirmed for two thirds of the farm households, while irrational excessive input is found for the remaining one third. Based on the village-by-village analysis of 1998, the excessive labor input is observed in most of the farm households in Sa Ka Chome village that belongs to the <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>area.</b> Unlike the other two villages that were successful in adjusting in the economic environment, Sa Ka Chome village failed for such an adjustment. The reasons of this failure are unavailability of the combines during harvesting and threshing time, and few rainfalls that resulted in decreased annual yield per land by half. In conclusion, the investment in irrigation facilities and the introduction of the combines during harvesting and threshing time are necessary in Sa Ka Chome village...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the stable isotope ratio of a plant's water source using the plant's transpired water is proposed {{as an alternative to}} standard xylem extraction methods. The method consists of periodically sampling transpired waters from shoots or leaves enclosed in sealed, transparent bags which create a saturated environment, preclude further evaporation and allow the progressive mixing of evaporated transpired water and un-evaporated xylem water. The method was applied on trees and shrubs coexisting in a <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>area</b> where stable isotope ratios of local environmental waters are well characterized. The results show Eucalyptus globulus (tree) and Genista monspessulana (shrub) using water sources of different isotopic ratios congruent with groundwater and soil water respectively. In addition, tritium concentrations indicate that pine trees (Pinus sylvestris) switch water source from soil water in the winter to groundwater in the summer. The method proposed is particularly useful in remote or protected areas and in large scale studies related to water management, environmental compliance and surveillance, because it eliminates the need for destructive sampling and greatly reduces costs associated with laboratory extraction of xylem waters from plant tissues for isotopic analyses...|$|E

The goal {{of this research was}} to map irrigated agricultural areas and explain methods and protocols using remote sensing. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data and time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to map irrigated agricultural areas as well as other land use/land cover (LULC) classes, for Ghana. Temporal variations in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pattern obtained in the LULC class were used to identify irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas.</b> First, the temporal variations in NDVI pattern were found to be more consistent in long-duration irrigated crops than with short-duration rainfed crops due to more assured water supply for irrigated areas. Second, surface water availability for irrigated areas is dependent on shallow dug-wells (on river banks) and dug-outs (in river bottoms) that affect the timing of crop sowing and growth stages, which was in turn reflected in the seasonal NDVI pattern.

For each household, and index of intensity of infection was computed by grouping individual log-transformed egg counts as an age-sex adjusted Z score. Few households had a sanitary installation or a domestic water supply. However, neither water-contact nor contaminative behavior were indiscriminate. The people made considerable effort to defaecate far from a water source, to obtain household drinking water from the cleanest source, and to bathe only at certain sites where privacy is assured. Land ownership and literacy correlated poorly with the household index of intensity of infection.

Introduction of irrigation activities incorporated flows that lowered salinity and increased nitrate concentration in the basin. The zones/years with most irrigation showed the greatest exports of salts and nitrates, with temporal variations related to rainfall patterns and spatial variations related to soil salinity and nitrogenous fertilization.

During soil sampling, each area was sub-divided and multiple soil samples were taken to ensure adequate spatial representation of each area. The results showed {{there were no differences}} in TN between the farms, but differences were detected between the paddocks (P < 0. 001), largely due to the significant interaction between the areas (gates and troughs) in different paddocks (P < 0. 001). The greatest variability in TN was around the gates, due to either much higher or lower TN near the entrance of the gates. The TN levels returned to concentrations that were similar to those in the surrounding pasture after 4 m distance from the gates. This study shows while TN concentrations are relatively consistent spatially within pastures, there is high variability in TN in proximity to some farm infrastructure, such as gates and troughs...|$|R

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ethephon spray as a defoliant in the development and production of the &# 8216;Niagara Rosada&# 8217; vine when subjected to double cropping, and the influence this bioactivator may have on carbohydrate reserves in the branch. The experiments were conducted in a commercial, <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>area</b> in agricultural years of 2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013. The length, diameter and total carbohydrate reserves of the branches, as well as bud break, number of clusters, crop production, length, width and mass of cluster, berry diameter, soluble solids and titratable acidity were evaluated. Ethephon treatments were applied at a concentration of 1, 440 mg L- 1 and 2, 160 mg L- 1 at 20 and 15 days before pruning. As a control, the vines were defoliated by hand at the time of pruning. A randomized block experimental design was used. Data was subjected to analysis of variance and means were compared by the Tukey test at 5 % significance level. In conclusion, we propose that ethephon sprays promoted vine defoliation and improved the bud break, altered plant development and crop production. This was not due to increases in concentration of carbohydrate reserves in the branches, but due to a higher induction stimulus of bud break, which allowed the vines to express their higher yield capacity...|$|E

Water should, therefore, be used for productive activities in an economically viable, environmentally sustainable and socially equitable manner. This study aims at determining the sustainability (defined broadly as {{the ability of a}} system to maintain a certain well defined level of performance or output overtime) of agricultural development under different irrigated systems in the upper part of Mae Ing river basin, Phayao Province, Northern Thailand. In this paper, the elements of sustainable agricultural development are a) increasing productivity in a stable manner b) economic efficiency and c) equitability in sharing the benefits of agricultural production. The results indicate that irrigation increases productivity in a stable manner. Irrigation improves rice productivity by 10 to 38 % in irrigated systems compared to non-irrigated system. Rice production in irrigated systems is more profitable than in non-irrigated system. The gross margin of the production {{resources are}} attributed to different resources amongst the irrigated systems.

Mathematical models {{can be used to}} explain the effects {{of irrigation}} on malaria transmission dynamics. This study aimed at developing and validating a one-host one-vector deterministic model made up of a mosquito population sub-module and disease transmission sub-module. Model parameters were obtained from the literature. Data covering the year 2013 were collected and these included the amount of irrigation water per unit area of irrigated land, rainfall, temperature and prevalence of malaria from the local hospitals. The Fuzzy distribution function was used to relate rainfall and irrigation patterns with oviposition and mortality rates of acquatic stages of mosquitoes. The model was fitted to malaria prevalence data obtained from the local hospitals by varying the parameters of the Fuzzy distribution function. Parameter values that gave the least variance between predicted and observed prevalence were used. The model was implemented in MS Excel using difference equations. The model fitted the data well and predicts an upsurge in the number of malaria cases 2 - 3 months after the rains or active irrigation. The model could be used to predict the prevalence of malaria in this area enabling decision makers to implement appropriate control measures in good time.

The increasing availability of remotely sensed data has led to significant advances in the frequency and spatial resolution of ET estimates, derived from energy balance principles with variables such as temperature used to estimate surface latent heat flux. Although remote sensing methods excel at depicting spatial and temporal variability, estimation of ET independently of other water budget components can lead to inconsistency with other budget terms. Methods that rely on ground-based data better constrain long-term ET, but are unable to provide the same temporal resolution. Here we combine long-term ET estimates from a water-balance approach with the SSEBop (operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance) remote sensing-based ET product for 2000 – 2015.

O aumento no volume de dejetos Ã devido Ã intensificaÃÃo da produÃÃo de proteÃna animal, que faz uso de confinamento e adota grandes plantÃis de animais por unidade de Ãrea. A utilizaÃÃo dos resÃduos orgÃnicos na agricultura estÃ aumentando, devido Ã conscientizaÃÃo acerca da utilizaÃÃo da adubaÃÃo orgÃnica na RegiÃo. Assim, o objetivo deste estudo foi verificar a decomposiÃÃo dos adubos orgÃnicos, gerados na RegiÃo Oeste do ParanÃ, bem como a mineralizaÃÃo dos nutrientes e o efeito sobre os teores destes no solo abaixo das cÃpsulas sem irrigaÃÃo e com irrigaÃÃo. Foram utilizadas cÃpsulas porosas, com diÃmetro de 5, 3 cm e 9, 8 cm de comprimento. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos casualizados com cinco tratamentos. Foram realizados dois experimentos com 100 cÃpsulas irrigadas e 100 cÃpsulas sem irrigaÃÃo. Os tratamentos foram: vermicomposto peletizado (V); vermicomposto peletizado + fosfato de Arad (VF); composto (C); composto biodinÃmico (CB); cama de aviÃrio de trÃs lotes (CA). Para a acomodaÃÃo das cÃpsulas, foram abertos sulcos com profundidade superior ao diÃmetro das cÃpsulas, e cobertas com uma camada de solo. As cÃpsulas foram dispostas no sentido horizontal em relaÃÃo ao perfil do solo. A irrigaÃÃo foi por gotejamento, efetuada a cada dois dias. As coletas dos materiais orgÃnicos para as anÃlises foram aos 7, 14, 35, 65 e 100 dias. O material orgÃnico do interior da cÃpsula foi seco em estufa e pesado para determinar a decomposiÃÃo por diferenÃa de massa. Foram avaliados teores de nitrogÃnio, fÃsforo, potÃssio, cÃlcio, magnÃsio, zinco, ferro, cobre e manganÃs dos materiais orgÃnicos, com e sem irrigaÃÃo. Para o solo, foram analisados os mesmos nutrientes dos materiais orgÃnicos, exceto nitrogÃnio, mas foram determinados os teores de carbono. A taxa de decomposiÃÃo anual foi estimada por meio de equaÃÃes logarÃtmicas, assim como a meia-vida dos materiais orgÃnicos. A CA, sem irrigaÃÃo, apresentou maior decomposiÃÃo entre os materiais orgÃnicos V, VF, C, CB e em relaÃÃo ao sistema irrigado. Por outro lado, a decomposiÃÃo dos materiais orgÃnicos V, VF, C, CB, na Ãrea irrigada, foi superior em relaÃÃo Ã Ãrea sem irrigaÃÃo. A mineralizaÃÃo da CA para os nutrientes carbono, nitrogÃnio, fÃsforo, potÃssio, sÃdio, zinco, ferro, cobre e manganÃs foi maior na Ãrea sem irrigaÃÃo, em comparaÃÃo aos demais tratamentos e em relaÃÃo Ã Ãrea com irrigaÃÃo. Os materiais orgÃnicos V, VF, C e CB para os elementos: carbono, nitrogÃnio, fÃsforo, potÃssio, sÃdio, zinco, ferro, cobre e manganÃs apresentaram superioridade na mineralizaÃÃo com a utilizaÃÃo do sistema irrigado. The western ParanÃ is {{a region}} that rears poultry, swine and cattle. Such activities produce significant amounts of waste. The increase on its amount is due to an animal intensive system, whose management is in feedlot and adopts large herds per unit area. The use of organic waste in agriculture is increasing due to some awareness of organic manure application in the studied region. Thus, this study aimed at investigating the decomposition of organic fertilizers produced in western ParanÃ as well as nutrients mineralization {{and the effect of}} their contents on soil bellow porous capsules, without and with irrigation. Porous capsules (ceramic candles) were used, whose diameter was 5. 1 cm and 9. 8 cm length. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with five treatments. Two trials were carried out: one with 100 capsules under irrigation and the second one without irrigation. The treatments were: pelletized vermicompost (V); pelletized vermicompost + phosphate Arad (VP); compost (C); biodynamic compost (BC); poultry litter of three batches (PL). In order to place the capsules, furrows were opened deeper than the capsules diameter (5 cm) and covered with a layer of soil. The capsules were put horizontally on soil profile. Irrigation was by drip. Samples of such organic materials were collected for analyses at 7, 14, 35, 65 and 100 days. The material inside capsules was oven-dried and weighed to determine decomposition by difference of mass. The contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper and manganese of different organic materials were evaluated with and without irrigation. For soil, the same nutrients of organic materials were analyzed, except for nitrogen; besides, carbon contents were determined. The decomposition rate was estimated by logarithmic equations, as well as half-life of organic materials. The PL treatment without irrigation showed higher decomposition of organic materials (V, VP, C, CB), {{as well as for the}} irrigation system. On the other hand, the decomposition of organic materials (V, VP, C, CB) in the irrigated area was superior than without irrigation. The PL mineralization for nutrients as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc, iron, copper and manganese was higher in <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>area</b> when compared with the other treatments and in relation to the area under irrigation. The organic materials (V, VP, C and CB) in relation to nutrients as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc, iron, copper and manganese showed a better answer in mineralization when under an irrigation system...|$|E
40|$|Paokahu {{landfill}} operated near Gisborne from 1977 to 2002. About {{1 million}} cubic metres of mixed domestic and industrial (predominantly food processing) wastes were disposed {{of at the}} site. The Paokahu landfill {{is located on the}} Poverty Bay Flats on low lying flat ground, which was originally the base of a tidal lagoon. A 300 m wide band of costal dunes separates the landfill from the Poverty Bay coast. The landfill covers an area of approximately 20 Ha and is unlined but fully capped. Leachate is collected in a cut-off drain which surrounds three quarters of the landfill. Disposal of the leachate is by spray irrigation onto the landfill cap with 13, 000 - 15, 000 m 3 of leachate irrigated annually. The site is currently used for grazing sheep. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} improve our understanding of the effect that Paokahu landfill is having on the environment and to determine if the current management practices are sustainable. Specific objectives were to collate and review all the groundwater and leachate monitoring data held by Gisborne District Council to determine if the landfill was affecting the local groundwater and to investigate the effect of leachate irrigation on the landfill cap's soil and vegetation. The groundwater monitoring data showed the local groundwater was generally affected by salt water intrusions giving the groundwater high anion and cation concentrations. There was no evidence of a leachate plume originating from the landfill and no conclusive evidence of leachate contamination in any of the groundwater monitoring bores. The leachate had a high electrical conductivity (mean = 9350 Scm- 1) and high soluble salts content (mean values, Na = 845 gm- 3, K= 496 gm- 3, Ca = 240 gm- 3, Mg = 127 gm- 3, Cl = 1346 gm- 3). Heavy metals were present in low concentrations and Semi Volatile Organic Compounds were no longer present in the leachate. Cation and anion concentrations were generally higher in the groundwater than in the leachate. The main risk to groundwater quality from leachate contamination was from ammonical nitrogen and nitrate. The leachate irrigation had caused an increase in soil cation concentrations particularly Na in the landfill cap. However, the soil Exchangeable Sodium Percentage of 1. 5 - 2. 9, leachate Sodium Adsorption Ratio (6. 5) and Electrical Conductivity of (4317 S cm- 1) and silty soil material of the landfill cap indicated that soil swelling and dispersion was unlikely to occur in irrigated areas of the landfill cap. Dispersion index testing supported this conclusion with no significant increase in aggregate dispersion under the irrigated areas of the landfill compared to the <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas.</b> Soil metal concentrations were low and there was no significant difference in soil heavy metal concentrations between the irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> of the landfill cap. Leachate Mn concentrations (mean = 1. 39 g m- 3) were high enough to be potentially toxic to plants, but the soil pH (7. 4) and Ca (46. 7 me/ 100 g) content mean that Mn toxicity is unlikely to occur. Leachate irrigation appears sustainable under current conditions...|$|R
40|$|Irrigation {{increases}} soil moisture, {{which in}} turn controls water and energy fluxes from the land surface to the planetary boundary layer and determines plant stress and productivity. Therefore, developing a realistic representation of irrigation is critical to understanding land–atmosphere interactions in agricultural areas. Irrigation parameterizations are becoming more common in land surface models and are growing in sophistication, but there is difficulty in assessing the realism of these schemes, due to limited observations (e. g., soil moisture, evapotranspiration) and scant reporting of irrigation timing and quantity. This study uses the Noah land surface model run at high resolution within NASA's Land Information System to assess the physics of a sprinkler irrigation simulation scheme and model sensitivity to choice of irrigation intensity and greenness fraction datasets over a small, high-resolution domain in Nebraska. Differences between experiments are small at the interannual scale but become more apparent at seasonal and daily timescales. In addition, this study uses point and gridded soil moisture observations from fixed and roving cosmic-ray neutron probes and co-located human-practice data to evaluate the realism of irrigation amounts and soil moisture impacts simulated by the model. Results show that field-scale heterogeneity resulting from the individual actions of farmers is not captured by the model {{and the amount of}} irrigation applied by the model exceeds that applied at the two irrigated fields. However, the seasonal timing of irrigation and soil moisture contrasts between irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> are simulated well by the model. Overall, the results underscore the necessity of both high-quality meteorological forcing data and proper representation of irrigation for accurate simulation of water and energy states and fluxes over cropland...|$|R
40|$|Background: Coxiellosis (Q fever) is a {{zoonotic}} disease {{caused by the}} bacterium Coxiella burnetii. The bacteria is commonly found in various livestock and wildlife species such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, rodents, birds, dogs, cats, etc. In this study, we sought to estimate the prevalence of Coxiella burnetii IgG antibodies among humans and to identify risk factors for exposure. Methodology: Blood samples were collected from a total of 272 randomly selected subjects in Bura irrigation scheme and manyattas around the scheme. Serum were prepared from these samples in the study sites and transported to Nairobi for analysis. Screening was done using a commercial ELISA antibody test kit (SERION ELISA classic Coxiella burnetii Phase 1 IgG) {{for the detection of}} human antibodies in serum directed against Coxiella burnetii Phase 1. Results: The seroprevalence of coxiella burnetii in humans was 26. 8 %. This was higher in subjects sampled in the irrigation scheme (30. 2 % [95 % CI]) relative to those sampled in the <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> (16. 4 % [95 % CI]). The seroprevalence for CB among adults, children and adolescents was 34. 2 % (95 % CI), 26. 8 % (95 % CI) and 23. 2 % (95 % CI), respectively. There were marginal differences in the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii between males and females; these were estimated to be 28 % and 26 %, respectively. Risk factors associated with seropositivity in univariate analysis included occupation and age. Conclusion: Farmers have a high level of exposure to Coxiella burnetii compared to pastoralists. This is an unexpected observation and more analyses are being done to determine potential routes of exposure...|$|R
40|$|A Decision Support System {{has been}} set up {{as the result of a}} {{fruitful}} cooperation between several public and research institutions in the framework of a large cooperation program. The DSS aims to compare spatially and temporally sectorial water demands of the Haouz-Mejjate plain (Morocco) in regard to available surface and groundwater resources. It is composed of a tool for satellite estimation of Agricultural Water Demand (SAMIR), a tool for integrated water resources planning (WEAP) and a groundwater model (MODFLOW) each of them relying on a common Geographical Information System not described here. The DSS is operating on a monthly time scale. Agricultural water demand accounts for about 80 % of the total demand. In areas where groundwater abstraction is difficult to quantify by direct methods, multitemporal remote sensing associated to the FAO methodology is a simple and efficient alternative to estimate Evapotranspiration (ET). In this work, a monthly estimate of ET from irrigated areas is derived from freely available MODIS NDVI for the 2001 - 2009 period. An important part of the paper deals with the validation of these estimates with eddy covariance flux measurements installed on different irrigated crops of the region. Results are satisfactory with a minus 6. 5 % error per year on the monthly time scale. This preprocessing allows to dichotomize irrigated versus <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas,</b> and then, to estimate groundwater abstraction in subareas distinguishing by their operating modes: traditional, dam or privately irrigated. A dynamic linkage between MODFLOW and WEAP transfers the results of one model as input data to the other. The model restitutes both spatial and temporal variations in head charges and allows the calculation of the ground water balance. After calibration, piezometric validation is acceptable for the majority of the 21 head control points...|$|R
40|$|With {{the passage}} of time, {{reclamation}} and reuse of wastewater gain global importance as the demand for water increases and usable sources of water dwindle due to high consumption rates and quality degradation resulting from anthropogenic pollution. The problem is even further manifested in arid and semiarid regions such as Kuwait where desalination plants provide most of the freshwater supplies. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of the infiltrating return water as it passes through the soil and the corresponding changes on chemistry, mineralogy, and hydraulic parameters of the soil. The study was conducted in the United Agricultural Production Company (UAPCO) Farm which is located in Sulaibiya area at the west of Kuwait City. The UAPCO Farm has been irrigated with tertiary treated wastewater since 1976. For the purpose of this study, data were collected through drilling of boreholes, establishment of ceramic cups and lysimeters, collection of soil samples from different depths, field penetration and infiltration tests as well as laboratory infiltration tests through sand columns. Soil samples were collected from irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> down to a depth of 1 m below the ground surface at 10 -cm intervals to investigate the soil’s characteristics. The chemical constituents of the leachate that was prepared from extracts of the soil samples were analyzed for nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, sulphate, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD). The collected soil samples were also analyzed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) to identify their mineralogical composition, with special emphasis on the clay content. Physical and chemical analyses of the soils revealed that there has been no negative impact of the wastewater used for irrigation on the upper 50 -cm layer of the soil. Therefore, treated wastewater (with an EC of 1. 47 dS/m) was considered appropriate for irrigation of forage crops...|$|R
40|$|As {{irrigation}} {{is increasingly}} needed for agricultural production, {{it is becoming}} progressively more important to understand not only how irrigation impacts water availability, but how the introduction of this water into the soil impacts weather and climate through land-atmosphere interactions. In the summer of 2012, the Central Plains of the United States experienced {{one of its most}} severe droughts on record. This study examines the meteorological impacts of irrigation during this drought through observations and model simulations using the Community Land Model (CLM) coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. A simple parameterization of irrigation processes is added into the WRF model. In addition to keeping soil moisture in irrigated areas at a minimum of 50 % of soil moisture capacity, this irrigation scheme also has the following new features: (1) accurate representation of the spatial distribution of irrigation area in the study domain by using MODIS-based 250 -m resolution land surface classification; and (2) improved representation of the time series of leaf area index (LAI) values derived from crop modeling and satellite observations in both irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas.</b> Several numerical sensitivity experiments are conducted. The WRF-simulated temperature field when including soil moisture and LAI modification within the model is shown to be most consistent with ground and satellite observations, all indicating a 2 - 3 K decrease of temperature in irrigated areas compared to the control run. Modification of leaf area index in irrigated and dryland areas led to smaller changes, with a 0. 2 K temperature decrease in irrigated areas and up to a 0. 5 K temperature increase in dryland areas. Furthermore, the increased soil moisture and modified leaf area index is shown to lead to increases in surface divergence, increases in surface pressure, and decreases in planetary boundary layer height over irrigated areas.

40|$|Exclosures {{have been}} widely {{implemented}} in north Ethiopia {{in the last few}} decades for rehabilitation of degraded areas. Despite decades of establishment, the effectiveness of exclosures is constrained by lack of adequate management such as supplementing additional water to the rain water which is characterized as short and erratic. There is no knowledge on the response of vegetation to such additional water application. This study is aimed to evaluate the effects of spate irrigation on species diversity, stocking and ring width growth of trees in exclosures. Two exclosures (May Ba’ati and Adi Kolakol), Dogu’aTemben district, north Ethiopia, were used for this study. 55. Each exclosure was divided in two blocks (irrigated and control) to allow comparison of vegetation growth. May Ba’ti was irrigated in 2005 while Adi Kolakol was irrigated from 2012 – 2016 but monitored by the researchers from 2014 to 2016. The amount of irrigation water applied is in the same order of magnitude as the direct rainfall on the site. Different species diversity indices and mean tree ring width growth were used to compare the irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas.</b> The result showed that trees in irrigated block have larger species richness, Shannon Wiener diversity index, tree density per ha, abundance, evenness and basal area than in the control area. The changes of these indices were negative in years with a short rainy season in the control area, whereas most indices remain positive under irrigated area. Moreover, tree ring width growth analysis exhibits the role of additional water to vegetation growth. The result of this study indicates diverting runoff to exclosures results in 15 % to 22 % increase in ring width as compared to non-irrigated trees. In addition, there is strong abstraction of storm runoff in gullies...|$|R
40|$|There is {{very little}} {{information}} on salinity hazards {{and the risk of}} further salinisation in the Northern Gulf region. In this report we summarise the information that is known, referencing all studies that have been done. Large naturally saline areas occur on the coastal plains, and smaller outbreaks are known to occur further inland. From the sparse data available we can infer that there may be significant salt stores in soil profiles and aquifers in considerable areas. However, due to the limited extent of tree-clearing to date, the risk of further salinisation is low in <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas.</b> Currently available hazard and risk maps are broad, based on very little information, and should not be used to advocate any changes in land use without further studies. In irrigated or potential irrigation areas, it is essential that thorough studies of salt stores and hydrogeology be carried out if salinisation is to be prevented. The main areas of current concern for development of salinity in the irrigated areas of the region are in the Cattle Creek and Two-Mile Creek sub-catchments (MDIA) of the Upper Mitchell River. In some parts of these areas salt loads occur in the groundwater or in the lower strata of the soils. In some of these areas the groundwater has risen to within 2 - 4 m of the soil surface. This combination of factors presents an imminent threat of salinisation. Hence continued monitoring of groundwater levels and quality is essential in all irrigated areas. One of these risk areas (Cattle Creek) is currently the subject of a pilot salinity risk assessment. Once the risk factors and processes are better understood land and water management strategies can be further improved to minimize the risk of salinisation...|$|R
40|$|Maps of {{irrigated}} {{areas are}} essential for Ghana’s agricultural development. The goal {{of this research was}} to map irrigated agricultural areas and explain methods and protocols using remote sensing. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data and time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to map irrigated agricultural areas as well as other land use/land cover (LULC) classes, for Ghana. Temporal variations in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pattern obtained in the LULC class were used to identify irrigated and <b>non-irrigated</b> <b>areas.</b> First, the temporal variations in NDVI pattern were found to be more consistent in long-duration irrigated crops than with short-duration rainfed crops due to more assured water supply for irrigated areas. Second, surface water availability for irrigated areas is dependent on shallow dug-wells (on river banks) and dug-outs (in river bottoms) that affect the timing of crop sowing and growth stages, which was in turn reflected in the seasonal NDVI pattern. A decision tree approach using Landsat 30 m one time data fusion with MODIS 250 m time-series data was adopted to classify, group, and label classes. Finally, classes were tested and verified using ground truth data and national statistics. Fuzzy classification accuracy assessment for the irrigated classes varied between 67 and 93 %. An irrigated area derived from remote sensing (32, 421 ha) was 20 – 57 % higher than irrigated areas reported by Ghana’s Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA). This was because of the uncertainties involved in factors such as: (a) absence of shallow irrigated area statistics in GIDA statistics, (b) non-clarity in the irrigated areas in its use, under-development, and potential for development in GIDA statistics, (c) errors of omissions and commissions in the remote sensing approach, and (d) comparison involving widely varying data types, methods, and approaches used in determining irrigated area statistics using GIDA and remote sensing. Extensive field campaigns to help in better classification and validation of irrigated areas using high (30 m) to very high (&lt; 5 m) resolution remote sensing data that are fused with multi temporal data like MODIS are the way forward. This is especially true in accounting for small yet contiguous patches of irrigated areas from dug-wells and dug-outs...|$|R
