Bacillus subtilis B 315 isolated from rhizospheric potato has antibiosis mechanism against Ralstonia solanacearum in vitro and become potentially used as controlling method of bacterial wilt in the field. The objectives {{of this research}} were to study the {{mechanism of}} B. subtilis B 315 in controlling bacterial wilt disease, to study of B. subtilis B 315 potency as both biocontrol and plant growth promoter, and to evaluate the mechanism as biocontrol agent. This green house experiment used CRD (Completely Randomized Design) with 5 treatments and 6 replicates. The treatments were control (without B. subtilis B 315), B. subtilis B 315 wild type, antibiosis mutant M 16, antibiosis mutant M 4, and antibiosis mutant M 14. Variables observed were incubation <b>period,</b> disease <b>index,</b> infection <b>rate,</b> effectiveness of control, and growth components (i. e number of bud, plant height, leaf area, plant fresh and dry weight). The result of this research showed that B. subtilis B 315 could delay incubation period, suppressed the disease index up to 64, 9 % and could promote the plant growth (leaf area). B. subtilis B 315 had the antibiosis and other mechanisms that induced sistemic resistance. The implication {{of this research was}} that B. subtilis B 315 could be used for biocontrol the bacterial wilt and promoted the potato growth...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which in each of a succession of time periods the State and the private economy interact to determine rules under which the private agents will operate in the <b>next</b> <b>period,</b> and rules and resources that constrain interventions of the State in the <b>next</b> <b>period.</b> The set of State institutions, called regulators, that are the instruments of State intervention is endogenously determined in each period. The model is a multiperiod game consisting of two phases. The first is a (noncooperative) game played by private economic agents in each period, the rules for which are given by the regulators in the preceding period. The second phase is political. In each period the private agents acting politically determine the legal and budgetary constraints under which the regulators will operate in the <b>next</b> <b>period,</b> and thereby determine the noncooperative game to be played in the <b>next</b> <b>period.</b> Formal entities in the model allow {{a wide variety of}} regulatory instruments and transfer payments to be represented. ...|$|R
