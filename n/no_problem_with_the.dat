Quatermass leaves the inquiry, then returns with Fowler to find that Broadhead has been 'marked' and now claims there is <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> project. Fowler takes Quatermass to meet with civil servant Rupert Ward, who {{has the authority to}} inspect the plant. Back at the Rocket Group, Leo and Paula deduce and discover with a radio telescope that an asteroid is orbiting the Earth invisibly and discharging the meteorites when it reaches the near point, 400 000 miles over Southern England every 14 hours.|$|E

Branyan started the season earning praise from manager Ned Yost and soon saw increased playing time. Later in the season, however, Branyan's playing time was decreased.|$|E

25|$|Swanson invited Will Hays {{for lunch}} and {{summarized}} the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise {{that he would have}} <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> making of such a film. Swanson set about getting the rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. Thus {{they were able to get}} the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke as to just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham requesting that he write an original story that served as a sequel. The sequel would involve following what became of Sadie in Australia. Maugham agreed to write a new story (for $100,000) but a sequel was never made.|$|E

Maugham claimed Fox had asked about a sequel at the same time Swanson had bought the original story's rights. The sequel was to follow the further exploits of Sadie in Australia, but was never made.|$|E
25|$|Under normal circumstances, a tiny {{amount of}} urobilinogen, if any, is {{excreted}} in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, {{some of the}} conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing {{an increase in the}} amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase in urine urobilinogen. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.|$|E

While Burton has stated he had <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Prince songs, he was less {{enthusiastic}} with their use in the film. On the film, Burton remarked, [...] "I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It's OK, {{but it was more}} of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} Folie à Deux arrived in stores (December 15), Fall Out Boy had planned on staging an impromptu concert in New York City's Washington Square Park. However, the band did not obtain {{a permit to}} do so. Taking {{inspiration}} from Bob Dylan and similar folk singers from the 1960s, the group {{wanted to do something}} free and spontaneous as a gift to fans. The band and its management argued with the NYPD about allowing the show to go on. In the end, they were told that picking up any instruments would earn them a trip to jail, so the band instead led the audience in a sing-along. Stump sang while Wentz and Trohman played air guitar and Hurley drummed on his knees. Stump later commented in an interview that [...] "Those cops back there—and I have <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cops, trust me—but those cops were like the Grinch.

500|$|Darwin's {{views on}} social and {{political}} issues reflected his time and social position. He {{grew up in a}} family of Whig reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported electoral reform and the emancipation of slaves. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave John Edmonstone, who he long recalled as [...] "a very pleasant and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the Beagle voyage. These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century, but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against [...] "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people. He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect that savage peoples who did not become civilised faced extinction. Darwin's theories presented this as natural, and were cited to promote policies that went against his humanitarian principles.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the five parodies on the album, Yankovic had several parody ideas that were turned down. Originally, Yankovic wanted to turn The Offspring's hit [...] "Come Out and Play" [...] into an ode about doing laundry called [...] "Laundry Day". There are conflicting stories {{as to why the}} song was never recorded; either Yankovic never approached The Offspring about releasing the parody, or the band denied permission. Either way, Yankovic performed the song in concert from 1996 through 2000. Despite not being able to parody [...] "Come Out and Play", Yankovic would later be granted permission to parody their 1998 hit [...] "Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)" [...] as [...] "Pretty Fly for a Rabbi" [...] on his 1999 album Running with Scissors. Yankovic also wanted to record a parody of The Beatles' Anthology hit [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] entitled [...] "Gee, I'm a Nerd". Yankovic asked Paul McCartney, a supporter of Yankovic's work, if he could parody [...] "Free as a Bird". McCartney had <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> parody, but because [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] was written by John Lennon, McCartney turned the decision over to Yoko Ono, who denied permission because she was uncomfortable with the parody idea.|$|E

Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Diana Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing. A large proportion of the crossover was filmed in a road tunnel in Caernarfon, Wales. Watson commented: [...] "It {{was the only one that}} we could hire for two weeks without causing huge traffic jams. The whole shoot was five weeks long. Staging stunts like car accidents is difficult and stressful at the best of times, but doing all that in a tunnel doubled it.
