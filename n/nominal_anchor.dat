25|$|The fixed JG wage {{provides}} an in-built inflation control mechanism. Mitchell (1998) called {{the ratio of}} JG employment to total employment the buffer employment ratio (BER). The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government’s announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. So instead of a buffer stock of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. Replacing the current non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), the BER that results in stable inflation is called the non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio (NAIBER) (Mitchell 1998). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent {{on a range of}} factors including the path of the economy. There is an issue about the validity of an unchanging <b>nominal</b> <b>anchor</b> in an inflationary environment. The JG wage would be adjusted in line with productivity growth to avoid changing real relativities. Its viability as a <b>nominal</b> <b>anchor</b> relies on the fiscal authorities reining in any private wage-price pressures.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of Bretton Woods, <b>nominal</b> <b>anchoring</b> has grown in importance for monetary policy makers and inflation reduction. Particularly, governments sought to use anchoring in order to curtail rapid and high inflation during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, countries began to explicitly set credible <b>nominal</b> <b>anchors.</b> In addition, many countries chose a mix {{of more than one}} target, as well as implicit targets. As a result, global inflation rates have, on average, decreased gradually since the 1970s and central banks have gained credibility and increasing independence.|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the experience with orthodox stabilization policies, which are based on a tight fiscal stance and not supported by a system of price controls. The analysis of these policies is structured as follows. Part I analyzes in detail the question of why purely orthodox policies were especially effective in stopping hyperinflation as opposed to chronic inflation processes. Part II turns to chronic inflation countries and analyzes three basic types of stabilization. The first type is based almost exclusively on fiscal adjustment. The second considers programs which employ <b>nominal</b> <b>anchors</b> in conjunction with fiscal adjustments. The third type examines the exchange rate based stabilizations which often evolve out of a monetary-fiscal package. In the final part of the paper, the authors consider the long run view which extends beyond specific programs and emphasizes the importance of persistence in fiscal discipline and in adherence to <b>nominal</b> <b>anchors.</b> Environmental Economics&Policies,Inflation,Banks&Banking Reform,Economic Stabilization,Economic Theory&Research...|$|R

50|$|Instead of blindly {{adhering}} to {{fixed exchange rate}} until running out of its foreign reserve, in the self-fulfilling model the government will abandon pegged exchange rate when it is optimal. The possible benefits from maintaining fixed exchange rate include the following: facilitating international trade and international investment, using fixed exchange rate as <b>nominal</b> <b>anchor</b> to prevent inflation, gaining good reputation of policy consistency. Meanwhile, the government usually needs to raise domestic short-term interest rate to prevent speculative attack, and the associated cost from raising interest rate includes higher deficit pressure, harming financial stability and higher unemployment rate and economic recession consequently. Therefore, conflicts arise between the government’s incentives, or between internal balance and external balance. If people believe that the currency will depreciate in the future, by uncovered interest parity, the short-term interest rate will rise as a result, which makes defending fixed exchange rate more costly. When the cost is sufficiently high, fixed exchange rate is abandoned and currency crisis happens.|$|E
