5|$|Salford's built {{environment}} {{is made up}} of a range of building stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in <b>negative</b> <b>equity</b> and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition.

5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who {{administrated}} the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a <b>negative</b> <b>equity</b> and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E
40|$|This paper solves {{a dynamic}} {{model of a}} household’s {{decision}} to default on its mortgage, taking into account labor income, house price, in‡ation, and interest rate risk. Mortgage default is triggered by <b>negative</b> home <b>equity,</b> which results from declining house prices in a low in‡ation environment with large mortgage balances outstanding. Not all households with <b>negative</b> home <b>equity</b> default, however. The level of <b>negative</b> home <b>equity</b> that triggers default depends {{on the extent to}} which households are borrowing constrained. High loan-to-value ratios at mortgage origination increase the probability of <b>negative</b> home <b>equity.</b> High loan-to-income ratios also increase the probability of default by tightening borrowing constraints. Comparing mortgage types, adjustable-rate mortgage defaults occur when nominal interest rates increase and are substantially a¤ected by idiosyncratic shocks to labor income. Fixed-rate mortgages default when interest rates and in‡ation are low, and create a higher probability of a default wave with a large number of defaults. Interest-only mortgages trade o ¤ an increased probability of <b>negative</b> home <b>equity</b> against a relaxation of borrowing constraints, but overall have the highest Many di¤erent factors contributed to the global …nancial crisis of 2007 - 09.

40|$|A firm 2 ̆ 7 s book equity is {{a measure}} of the value held by a firm 2 ̆ 7 s {{ordinary}} shareholders. Increasingly, it is being reported as a negative number. Because a firm 2 ̆ 7 s limited liability structure means that shareholders cannot have negative value, <b>negative</b> book <b>equity</b> has no obvious interpretation. Consequently, both practitioners and academics typically omit such stocks in their analysis. While these stocks are small in number, they are disproportionately represented in extreme growth-value sectors and, therefore, can have an impact on applications where value is defined in terms of book equity. The authors propose a new approach that classifies <b>negative</b> book <b>equity</b> stocks across the growth-value spectrum by considering how close their returns correspond to those of stocks that fit more obviously into these classifications. They find that this new value factor, which includes <b>negative</b> book <b>equity</b> stock, is economically and statistically different from the old value factor that excludes such stocks. Although they illustrate how this approach can be used to classify <b>negative</b> book <b>equity</b> stock, the approach is quite general and may be used whenever particular accounting data are unavailable or otherwise suspect. <br /...|$|R
50|$|When {{total assets}} {{are greater than}} total liabilities, {{stockholders}} have a positive equity (positive book value). Conversely, when total liabilities are greater than total assets, stockholders have a <b>negative</b> stockholders' <b>equity</b> (<b>negative</b> book value) — also sometimes called stockholders' deficit. A stockholders' deficit {{does not mean that}} stockholders owe money to the corporation as they own only its net assets and are not accountable for its liabilities, though {{it is one of the}} definitions of insolvency. It means that the value of the assets of the company must rise above its liabilities before the stockholders hold positive equity value in the company.|$|R
5|$|Growth, {{employment}} and household income have lagged behind the South, {{and the five}} most deprived districts in England are all in Northern England, as are ten of the twelve most declining major towns in the UK. The picture is not clear-cut, as the North has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable Southern areas such as Surrey. Yorkshire's Golden Triangle which extends from north Leeds to Harrogate and across to York is an example, as is Cheshire's Golden Triangle, centred on Alderley Edge. There are major disparities even across individual cities: Sheffield Hallam {{is one of the}} wealthiest constituencies in the country, and is the richest outside London and the South East, while Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, just {{on the other side of}} the city, is one of the most deprived. Housing in Northern England is more affordable than the UK average: the median house price in most Northern cities was below £200,000 in 2015 with typical increases of below 10% over the previous five years. However, some areas have seen house prices fall considerably, putting inhabitants at risk of <b>negative</b> <b>equity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since re-capitalization in 2003–04, Roma had a {{short-lived}} financial self-sustainability, until the takeover in 2011. The club {{had set up}} a special amortisation fund using Articolo 18-bis Legge 91/1981 mainly for the abnormal signings prior 2002–03 season, (such as Davide Bombardini for €11million account value in June 2002, when the flopped player exchange boosted 2001–02 season result) and the tax payment of 2002–03 was rescheduled. In 2004–05, Roma made a net profit of €10,091,689 and followed by €804,285 in 2005–06. In 2006–07 season the accounting method changed to IFRS, which meant that the 2005–06 result was reclassified as net loss of €4,051,905 and 2006–07 season was net income of €10,135,539 (€14.011million as a group). Moreover, the special fund (€80,189,123) was removed from the asset and co-currently for the equity as scheduled, meant Roma group had a <b>negative</b> <b>equity</b> of €8.795million on 30 June 2007. In 2007–08, Roma made a net income of €18,699,219. (€19million as a group) However, 2008–09 saw the decrease of gate and TV income, co-currently with finishing sixth in Serie A, which saw Roma made a net loss of €1,894,330. (€1.56million as a group) The gate and TV income further slipped in 2009–10 with a net loss of €21,917,292 (already boosted by the sale of Alberto Aquilani; €22million as a group) despite sporting success (finishing in second place in 2009–10). Moreover, despite a positive equity as a separate company (€105,142,589), the AS Roma Group had a <b>negative</b> <b>equity</b> on the consolidated balance sheet, and fell from +€8.8million to −€13.2million. In the 2010–11 season, Roma was administrated by UniCredit as the Sensi family failed to repay the bank and the club was put on the market, which also saw Roma not have a major signing in 2010–11. Concurrently with no selling profit on the players, Roma's net loss rose to €30,589,137 (€30.778million as a group) and the new owner already planned a re-capitalization after the mandatory bid on the shares. On the positive side, TV income was increased from €75,150,744 to €78,041,642, and gate income increased from €23,821,218 to €31,017,179. This was because Roma entered 2010–11 Champions League, which counter-weighed the effect of the new collective agreement of Serie A. In 2011–12, the renewal of squad and participation in 2011–12 UEFA Europa League had worsened the financial result, which the €50million capital increase (in advance) was counter-weighted totally by the net loss. In the 2012–13 season, the participation in domestic league only, was not only not harmful to the revenue but increase in gate income as well as decrease in wage bill, however Roma still did not yet break even (€40.130million net loss in consolidated accounts). NEEP Roma also re-capitalized AS Roma in advance for another €26,550,000 during 2012–13. A proposed capital increase by €100million for Roma was announced on 25 June 2014; however, until 22 May 2014, NEEP already injected €108million into the club, which depends on public subscription; more than €8million would convert to medium-long-term loan from shareholder instead of becoming share capital.|$|E
