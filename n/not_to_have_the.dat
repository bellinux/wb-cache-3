5|$|As 1953 began, Ferrier {{was busy}} rehearsing for Orpheus, an English {{language}} version of Orfeo ed Euridice to be staged in four performances at the Royal Opera House in February. Barbirolli had instigated this project, with Ferrier's enthusiastic approval, some months previously. Her only other engagement in January was a BBC recital recording, {{in which she}} sang works by three living English composers: Howard Ferguson, William Wordsworth and Edmund Rubbra. During her regular hospital treatment she discussed with doctors the advisability of an oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), but on learning that the impact on her cancer would probably be insignificant and that her voice might be badly affected, she chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> operation.|$|E
5|$|But if {{you were}} here, my father, you'd tell me to stand by my job and not to desert Mr. McClure in this crisis. It would mean such a serious loss to him in money and {{influence}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> March article come out—Everyone would think he was beaten and scared out, for the articles are under such a glare of publicity and such a fire of criticism. I {{had nothing to do}} with the January article remember, my work begins to appear in February. Mr. McClure is ill from worry and anxiety...|$|E

In order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same name as his father-in-law, {{his own name}} was changed to Yehudah Aryeh Leib. He {{is said to have}} been attached to the name Yehudah, and was upset at not being able to use it as his name any longer.|$|E
25|$|At Fleet City, doctors {{discovered}} Young {{had a large}} {{growth of}} calcium on his right thigh bone. They wanted to operate and thought it would grow larger, but told Young he would lose significant use of his leg after surgery.

Grant also noted that he wanted to shift forces to the west so that Warren would have his whole force available to reinforce Ayres.|$|E

25|$|The {{assassination}} triggered major {{suppression of}} civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result.|$|E
25|$|By March 1916, despite {{frequent}} {{encounters with}} Fokkers {{and the continued}} success of the German Eindecker aces, the scourge was over. The bogey of the Fokker Eindecker as a fighter was finally laid in April, when an E.III landed by mistake on a British aerodrome. On test, it was found <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> superior performance it had been credited with. The first British aircraft with a synchronisation gear was a Bristol Scout, which arrived on 25March 1916, and on 24May the first Sopwith 1½ Strutter aircraft were flown to France by a flight of No. 70 Squadron.|$|E
25|$|After the German reunification {{the united}} German {{government}} decided to merge the abortion laws. It would be legal {{within the first}} twelve weeks of pregnancy but only after the woman received counseling on her decision. If she still decided to proceed {{she would have to}} present a certificate saying she had completed the counseling sessions. The German Bishops' Conference established counseling centres that saw 20,000 women. After being counseled, roughly 5,000 decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> abortion. In 1997 Pope John Paul II ordered the German bishops to withdraw the counseling support. Cardinal Ratzinger, as prefect of the Congregation for the Faith, was given the task of carrying out John Paul's instructions. In 1999 the German bishops unanimously rejected the demands of the CDF. Only in 2000 did the bishops conference end the counseling service, which was preventing 5,000 abortions a year.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{thereafter}} Father Norbert wrote {{a biography}} of his life. In 1866, {{four years after the}} death of Gabriel, the Passionists were forced to abandon the monastery of Isola del Gran Sasso, and the church where Gabriel lay buried went deserted for 30 years. Since his death, the fame of Gabriel’s sanctity had spread through the local area, as well as amongst the Passionists. In 1891 the Congregation decided to formally open proceedings for Gabriel’s canonisation and, a year later, a committee visited his grave to examine his remains. Upon the arrival of the committee at Isola del Gran Sasso, the townspeople surrounded the church, determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> body of Gabriel taken from their midst. Two years later the Passionist returned to resume their life at Isola del Gran Sasso near the city of Teramo.|$|E
25|$|Vouvrays {{are known}} for their {{longevity}} and aging potential, particularly if the vintage was favorable. Some wines, most notably the sweeter Moelleux styles, have the potential to age and develop in the bottle for several decades to a century. While modern producers are contributing to making examples more approachable to drink while young, some premium examples still made in the traditionally high acid style will often need 3 to 7 years of bottle age before the acidity tones down. Dry or Sec examples from favorable vintages can have the potential to age for 15–20 years or more but many are ready to drink within 4 or 5 years after vintage. Sparkling Vouvrays tend <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same aging potential as their still wine counterparts or vintage dated Champagne and are usually meant to be consumed within 3 years of vintage or, for non-vintage bottling, soon after purchase.|$|E
25|$|On the {{following}} episode of Impact!, Fortune formed {{an alliance with}} Hulk Hogan's and Eric Bischoff's new stable, Immortal. On the November 18 episode of Impact!, Flair returned to the ring, competing in a match where he faced Matt Morgan, who had {{been kicked out of}} Fortune the previous month; Morgan won the match after Douglas Williams turned on the rest of Fortune, when they interfered in the match. On January 25, 2011, it was reported that Flair had pulled out of TNA's Maximum Wooo! tour of Europe mid–tour after monetary disputes. After missing a show in Berlin, Germany, Flair returned to the tour on January 27 in Glasgow, Scotland, reportedly apologizing to the locker room prior to the show. On January 29, Flair wrestled his only match of the tour, defeating Douglas Williams in London, tearing his rotator cuff in the process. During Flair's time away from TNA, Fortune turned on Immortal. Flair returned at the February 14 tapings of the February 17 episode of Impact!, turning on Fortune during a match between A.J. Styles and Matt Hardy and jumping to Immortal. On the March 10 episode of Impact!, Flair defeated Styles and Hardy in a three–way street fight, contested as more of a two–on–one handicap match. On April 17 at Lockdown, Immortal, represented by Flair, Abyss, Bully Ray and Matt Hardy, was defeated by Fortune members James Storm, Kazarian and Robert Roode and Christopher Daniels, who replaced an injured A.J. Styles, in a Lethal Lockdown match, when Flair tapped out to Roode. The match was used to write Flair off television, as {{the following}} week he was scheduled to undergo surgery for his torn rotator cuff; however, Flair ultimately chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> surgery as it would have required six months of rehab.|$|E

Images of the toddler from her mother's Facebook page were later released to the public.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{named it}} a 'Critics Pick' of 2009. Andrew O'Hehir of Salon praised {{the film and}} called its {{production}} a sign [...] "of hope in the impenetrable impasse of the contemporary Middle East". Benjamin Secher of The Daily Telegraph labeled it [...] "absorbing, sensitive, beautifully-shot" [...] and drew favorable comparisons with Erin Brockovich. Mark Jenkins of National Public Radio stated that it featured [...] "subtle performances by its striking stars" [...] {{and served as a}} parable about border issues. AMC's Chris Cabin criticized the movie, arguing that its director [...] "seems <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> faintest idea of how to properly approach the subject", because the film is, in Cabin's view, [...] "unabashedly pro-Palestine".|$|E

50|$|Complaints {{from the}} ultra-orthodox {{community}} led <b>to</b> an agreement <b>not</b> only <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> posters taken down, but also that—given {{the presence of}} God's name—they would be buried in a genizah burial site for sacred texts, not merely discarded.|$|R
500|$|Following the rain-soaked Belgian Grand Prix, Massa {{expressed}} his {{hope that the}} Italian Grand Prix would be held on a dry track, saying [...] "it would be nice <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> rain here and not have any opportunity to have a consistent race." [...] The close nature of the Championship meant that Ferrari's home race {{had the potential to}} be a turning point in the season. Testing at the Monza circuit in early September had indicated that the performance gap between McLaren and Ferrari had narrowed. Despite this, Ferrari were hoping that their straight-line speed would be better suited to Monza's long straights. Ferrari confirmed on September 12 that Räikkönen would continue to drive for the team until at least 2010, ending media speculation that he could be about to retire.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{government}} {{line was}} that the regular army had taken the actions. ARVN radio broadcasts bore the influence of Nhu's abrasive tone in directing the Republican Youth {{to cooperate with the}} government. Nhu accused the Buddhists of turning their pagodas into headquarters for plotting anti-government insurrections. He claimed the Buddhist Intersect Committee operated under the control of [...] "political speculators who exploited religion and terrorism". Lodge believed Diệm remained in control but that Nhu's influence had risen to unprecedented levels. He thought that Nhu's divide and conquer tactics had split the military into three factions, respectively led by Generals Đôn and Đính, and Colonel Tung. Đôn was believed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> allegiance of Đính and Tung, who took their orders directly from Gia Long Palace. The two loyalists had support from various pro-Diệm elements. Lodge predicted that if the army deposed Diệm, fighting could break out within the ARVN.|$|E
500|$|As {{the leader}} of the Soviet Union, Brezhnev's {{conservatism}} and carefulness to reach decisions by consensus {{with the rest of the}} Politburo resulted in sustained political stability within the country. However, his hostility towards reform and active cultivation of cronyism ushered in a period of pervasive corruption and socioeconomic decline that came to be known as the Brezhnev Stagnation. Such internal problems were further compounded by an enormous arms buildup that eventually grew to comprise 12.5% of the nation's GNP. On the world stage, Brezhnev pushed hard for the adoption of détente, a commitment by both two superpowers towards the relaxation of Cold War tensions and economic cooperation. Despite such diplomatic gestures, Brezhnev's regime presided over an aggressive foreign policy characterized by the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, massive military support for Communist forces in Vietnam, and the 1979 armed intervention in Afghanistan. Ultimately, in December 1981, he opted [...] <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Soviet military suppress unrest in Poland [...] thereby marking the end of the interventionist Brezhnev Doctrine.|$|E
