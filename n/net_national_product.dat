After a boom in new investment banks after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, the destruction of the French banking industry wrought by the crash cast a pall over the financial sector that lasted until the dawn of the 20th century.

25|$|During the {{depression}} of 1873–96, most European countries experienced a drastic fall in prices. Still, many corporations {{were able to}} reduce production costs and achieve better productivity rates, and, as a result, industrial production increased by 40% in Britain and by over 100% in Germany. A comparison of capital formation rates {{in the two countries}} helps to account for the different industrial growth rates. During {{the depression}} the British ratio of net national capital formation to <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> fell from 11.5% to 6.0% while Germany's rose from 10.6% to 15.9%. In essence, {{during the course of the}} depression, Britain took the course of static supply adjustment while Germany stimulated effective demand and expanded industrial supply capacity by increasing and adjusting capital formation. For example, Germany dramatically increased investment with regard to social overhead capital, such as in the management of electric power transmission lines, roads, and railroads, while this input stagnated or decreased in Britain and the investment helped to stimulate industrial demand in Germany. The resulting difference in capital formation accounts for the divergent levels of industrial production in the two countries and the different growth rates during and after the depression.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to present}} {{a review of the}} main {{features}} of India's economic growth and human development during nearly 50 years of India's planned development. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines all major aspects of India's growth such as growth in <b>net</b> total <b>national</b> <b>product</b> and per capita product, changes in the production and occupational structure resulting from growth, changes in government revenue, infrastructure and social services, in income distribution and in poverty. Findings – Although the growth was uneven and low up to 1980, the country recorded a reasonable and steady improvement in most aspects of growth. Nevertheless the effects of growth have not produced better results in poverty alleviation. Originality/value – Reviews the main features of India's economic growth and human development.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent papers have {{examined}} the role of environmental variables in accounting for economic growth, and have concluded that <b>net</b> measures of <b>national</b> <b>product</b> are superior to gross measures in portraying {{the outcome of the}} growth process. This paper argues that the two measures are not substitutes, but complements which reveal different aspects of economic growth: gross product is the output concept for estimating the structure of production. while net product is the correct concept for getting at the welfare consequences of economic growth. It is then shown that this capacity-welfare nexus is mirrored in the Hicksian and Harrodian definitions of technical change. An alternative to the conventional Solow growth accounting framework is presented in which the change in national wealth is decomposed into components corresponding to labor input and the Harrodian rate of technical change. ...|$|R

2500|$|Niall Ferguson {{partially}} {{supports this}} analysis. He says that had reparations not been imposed, Germany {{would still have}} had significant problems caused {{by the need to}} pay war debts and the demands of voters for more social services. Ferguson also says that these problems were aggravated by a trade deficit and a weak exchange rate for the mark during 1920. Afterwards, as the value of the mark rose, inflation became a problem. None of these, he says, were the result of reparations. Ferguson says that even without reparations, total public spending in Germany between 1920 and 1923 was 33 per cent of total <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>product.</b> A.J.P. Taylor says, [...] "Germany was a net gainer by the financial transactions of the nineteen-twenties: she borrowed far more from private American investors...than she paid in reparations". P.M.H. Bell says the creation of a multi-national committee, which resulted in the Dawes Plan, was done to consider ways the German budget could be balanced, the currency stabilized, and the German economy fixed to ease reparation payments. Max Winkler says that from 1924 onward, German officials were [...] "virtually flooded with loan offers by foreigners". Overall, he says, the German economy performed reasonably well until the foreign investments funding the economy and the loans funding reparations payments were suddenly withdrawn after the 1929 Stock Market Crash. This collapse was magnified by the volume of loans provided to German companies by US lenders. Even the reduced payments of the Dawes Plan were mainly financed through a large volume of international loans.|$|E

40|$|While the short-run {{financial}} status of Social Security is secure, its long-run {{financial status}} is very uncertain. The retirement and disability {{part of the}} system (OASDI) is projected to be in long-run actuarial deficit under the Social Security Administration's intermediate economic and demographic f 9 recasts. Hospital Insurance (HI) is projected to run a large deficit, beginning in the 1990 s. OASDI is projected to accrue a very large surplus over the next thirty years, peaking at almost 30 % of GNP. Social Security has never accrued a surplus this large; it may well be dissipated for other purposes, such as to bail out HI, fund other programs, raise benefits, or cut taxes. These alternatives may affect <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving, directly because Social Security surpluses or deficits are part of government sector saving and indirectly through effects on private saving or the non-Social Security part of the federal government budget. This paper documents how various systematic deviations from, or return to, pay-as-you-go finance of the Social Security system may affect <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving. For example, under base case assumptions with respect to the non-Social Security deficit, a constant net private saving rate of 6 %, and long-run budget balance in the state and local government sector, the Social Security deficit offsets 40 % of other <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving over the Social Security Administration's 75 -year projection period. In the first 25 -year sub-period, the Social Security surplus adds one-sixth to other <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving; in the second, it offsets almost one-half; and in the third, it offsets five-sixths of other <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving. Of course, private saving may respond to changes in Social Security's funding as may the non-Social Security balance in the federal budget. The paper presents several alternative scenarios such as benefits increasing or taxes falling during the OASDI surplus period, various stylized rules concerning the non-Social Security budget deficit, and separate balancing of HI via outlay reductions or tax increases. The results indicate that OASDI may effect <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving substantially. For example, if benefits ratchet up during what would have been the period of the OASDI surplus, the OASDI system may subsequently offset virtually all of remaining <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving. On the other hand, if HI is brought into balance and the OASDI surplus is allowed to accrue, Social Security will offset only about 4 % of other <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving. Changes in private saving may accentuate or ameliorate the swings in the <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving rate generated by the future financing of OASDHI, but the alternative financing options will be important determinant of <b>net</b> <b>national</b> saving, and therefore of private domestic investment and international capital flows. ...|$|R

40|$|The present work is {{organized}} in five chapters and it proposes and applies alternative measures of productivity constructed using input-output tables and based {{mainly on the}} Sraffian scheme. The first three chapters of the thesis are devoted to the development and the empirical application of new productivity measures. These chapters form {{the main part of}} the work. The last two chapters are devoted to sensitivity analysis. In the first chapter, entitled ‘Productivity accounting based on production prices’ an alternative method of productivity accounting is proposed. By using input–output tables from four major OECD countries between 1970 and 2000, we compute the associated wage-profit frontiers and the <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>products</b> curves, and from these we derive two measures of productivity growth based on production prices and a chosen numeraire. The findings support the general conclusions in the existing literature on the productivity slowdown and later rebound, and supply new important insights to the extent and timing of these events. The second chapter is entitled ‘New measures of sectoral productivity’. The objective of this chapter is to propose alternative methods of sectoral productivity accounting based the theoretical work of Goodwin (1976), Gossling (1972), Pasinetti (1973), and Sraffa (1960). The indexes developed in this study differ from the standard indexes of productivity because they are designed on the basis of some of the following desiderable features: take into account the interconnections among economic sectors, aggregate heterogeneous goods by using production prices, and compute productivity by using quantity of goods instead of their values. These indexes are then be tested empirically by computing productivity of four major OECD countries. The third chapter is entitled ‘Productivity in the Italian regions: development of Alternative Indicators based on input-output tables’. This chapter calculates indices of aggregate productivity, sectoral productivity, and technological progress for a selected sample of Italian regions. Besides these indices, two different versions of the so-called technological frontier were calculated. The contemporary frontiers that are constructed from all the production techniques extracted from the regional input-output tables in a given year and the intertemporal frontier that is computed for the full set of techniques available over time and across regions. The availability of the technological frontiers allows the calculation of the recently developed Velupillai-Fredholm-Zambelli indices of convergence (Fredholm and Zambelli, 2009) that are based on the distance between the region-specific wage-profit frontiers and the technological frontiers. Given the important role played by the production prices, this chapter also examines the price curves for each region and industry and it identifies remarkable regularities. Not surprisingly, analyses of the findings reveal that there is a productivity gap between the regions of North and South. However, the analysis of sectoral productivity reveals two important facts. The first is that the techniques of some industries are more productive in the South than in the North. The second, who follows from the first, is that all regions could therefore improve productivity through greater integration. Chapter four is entitled ‘An Inquiry into the choice of Numeraire’. This chapter has several objectives. The main aim is to examine the robustness of the results obtained by applying the new approach to measuring productivity if we change the numeraire chosen. However, it should be mentioned that the problem of the choice of numeraire is a general one and for this reason, the chapter also proposes universal guidelines to be followed in choosing the numeraire and in testing the robustness of the results to changes in the numeraire. Finally, chapter five is entitled ‘An Inquiry into the effect of aggregation of input-output tables’. The aim of this chapter is to test the robustness of the results from a progressive aggregation of the input-output tables...|$|R
