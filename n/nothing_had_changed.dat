5|$|On March 3, 1918, Germany and the now-Bolshevik Russia {{signed the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It {{declared}} that the Baltic nations were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On March 23, Germany recognized independent Lithuania {{on the basis of}} the December 11 declaration. However, in substance, <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> either in Lithuania or in the Council's status: any efforts to establish an administration were hindered. This situation changed when the German Revolution started and Germany lost the war in the fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position to dictate terms. The Council of Lithuania adopted the first provisional constitution on November 2. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and Augustinas Voldemaras was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers of Lithuania. Complete international recognition took several years; the US affirmed it on July 28, 1922.|$|E
25|$|On March 31, 2004, the Danish and Canadian governments {{denied that}} Herman {{or any other}} Canadian {{official}} was summoned to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Both governments stated that the dispute was a long-standing issue, and that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> in the matter.|$|E
25|$|Several {{theories}} were {{advanced to}} explain {{the emergence of the}} new virus. These included increased contact between humans and mice due to a 'bumper crop' in the deer mouse population. Another theory was that something within the virus had changed, allowing it to jump to humans. A third theory was that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed,</b> that hantavirus cases had occurred previously, they just had not been properly diagnosed before. This last theory {{turned out to be the}} correct one when it was discovered that the first known case had actually occurred in a 38-year-old Utah man in 1959.|$|E
30|$|In most cases, {{the curve}} is drawn with (1  − β), the {{probability}} of recognizing a positive occurrence within the universe of all positives. We use β, which fits better in our arguments below. Conceptually <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bill Gibron, of DVD Talk, wrote, [...] "This critic didn't {{like this}} movie {{when he first}} saw it back in the late '80s, and <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> since then. He didn't find it funny, inventive, or scary".|$|R
5000|$|Koshiro didn't {{resign from}} his job in the manga. In volume 5 chapter 34 he thinks to himself [...] "Unexpectedly, <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> ... However, really, some things are {{starting}} to change", that last thought referring to Nanoka.|$|R
25|$|Henry Cow {{returned}} to London in early 1977, where they {{merged with the}} entire Mike Westbrook Brass Band and folk singer Frankie Armstrong to form the Orckestra. They played their first concert at the Moving Left Revue at The Roundhouse in London {{and then at the}} Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park. The Orckestra later went on to tour in France, Italy and Scandinavia (extracts from some of these performances were released in 2006 on a CD-single included in the Henry Cow Box). At {{more or less the same}} time they set up Music for Socialism and its May Festival. It had been three years since Henry Cow had performed more than one concert a year in their own country. In an attempt to break the apathy that seemed to be discouraging anyone from wanting to put them on, they tried to organise a small alternative tour themselves, but abandoned it after 11 concerts when they started losing money: clearly <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Morton Feldman's I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg was {{inspired}} by a vision he had of the dead Heine as he walked through Heine's old neighborhood in Paris: [...] "One early morning in Paris I was walking along the small street on the Left Bank where Delacroix's studio is, just as {{it was more than a}} century ago. I'd read his journals, where he tells of Chopin, going for a drive, the poet Heine dropping in, a refugee from Germany. <b>Nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> in the street. And I saw Heine up at the corner, walking toward me. He almost reached me. I had this intense feeling for him, you know, the Jewish exile. I saw him. Then I went back to my place and wrote my work, I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg." ...|$|E
60|$|La Boulaye {{dropped the}} keys into a bucket and went within. In the common-room <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed,</b> {{and the men}} lay about {{precisely}} as he had left them. Reassured, he went above and took a peep at the Captain, whom he found snoring lustily.|$|E

2500|$|Some people {{discussed}} racism {{becoming less}} explicit after the March. Reverend Abraham Woods of Birmingham commented: [...] "Everything <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> And {{when you look}} at it, <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> Racism is under the surface, and an incident that could scratch it, can bring it out." ...|$|R
25|$|Lloyd's Register listed Countess of Harcourt from 1818 to 1831. One {{concern with}} Lloyd's Register {{information}} {{is that a}} lack of change may either mean that <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> from the previous year, or that the owner did not provide updated information.|$|R
60|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> there. She {{closed her}} eyes and saw the little dining room in all the dignity of Sunday dinner, the big silver soup tureen {{catching}} the sun, the flowered china with the gilt edges, and even a glimpse of lace paper when the closet door opened; Aunt Mary and Uncle Tom, with Peter between them. And these, strangely, were the only tangible things and immutable.|$|E
60|$|Like so many {{scenes of}} childhood, {{the room of}} the clocks was sharply stamped on Betty's memory, and, as she came into it now, {{it seemed to her}} that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b> There were the clocks, all round the walls, of every shape and size, the big clocks with the human faces and the small, perky clocks. There was the dingy, {{medium-sized}} clock that held the trumpeter. And there, looking at her with just the old sandy-cat expression in her pale eyes, was Mrs. Oakley.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{the brown}} one, the big brown one. I {{sat down on}} a fallen pillar and held her in my arms [...] . Silent after the first babble was over. And after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again, as though nothing unusual was going on, as though <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> [...] . It was tremendously still there, the sun high and the shadows still; even the shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were still--in spite of the thudding and banging that went all about the sky.|$|E

60|$|But the {{complexion}} even {{of external}} things seemed to suffer transmutation as her announcement progressed. The {{fire in the}} grate looked impish--demoniacally funny, as {{if it did not}} care in the least about her strait. The fender grinned idly, as if it too did not care. The light from the water-bottle was merely engaged in a chromatic problem. All material objects around announced their irresponsibility with terrible iteration. And yet <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> since the moments when he had been kissing her; or rather, nothing in the substance of things. But the essence of things had changed.|$|E
60|$|Yes. She {{was back}} home! <b>Nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b> She {{had never been}} away. California? Had she seen it? Had she for one minute left this {{scraping}} sound of the small shovel in the ash-pit of the furnace? But Kennicott preposterously supposed that she had. Never had she been quite so far from going away as now when he believed she had just come back. She felt oozing through the walls the spirit of small houses and righteous people. At that instant she knew that in running away she had merely hidden her doubts behind the officious stir of travel.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Chalk, {{with his}} mind {{full of the}} story he had just heard, walked homewards like {{a man in a}} dream. The air was {{fragrant}} with spring and the scent of lilac revived memories almost forgotten. It took him back forty years, and showed him a small boy treading the same road, passing the same houses. <b>Nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> so much as the small boy himself; nothing had been so unlike the life he had pictured as the life he had led. Even the blamelessness of the latter yielded no comfort; it savoured of a lack of spirit.|$|E

5000|$|He {{has never}} married {{and is not}} {{planning}} to do so. [...] "I have never {{wanted to get into}} relationship, have a burden of wife and kids. I knew I couldn't handle it. ... I wanted to be alone. And <b>nothing</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> since then." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{stood by}} the open window in silence. <b>Nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b> It was not yet time for the singing of the {{earliest}} birds. The tiny village lay behind them, silent and asleep; in front, nothing but the marshes, uninhabited, lonely and quiet, the golf club-house empty and deserted. They stood and watched, their faces turned steadfastly in a certain direction. Gradually their eyes, growing accustomed to the dim and changing light, could pierce the black line above the grey where the sea came stealing up the sandy places with low murmurs, throwing with every wave longer arms into the land.|$|E
60|$|Many weeks {{had passed}} away, and <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed,</b> in any {{material}} way, since the spring. Mrs. Lyddell's condition was still unsatisfactory, {{and she seemed}} to be settling into a confirmed state of ill health, and almost of hypochondriacism. So many shocks, following each other in such quick succession, on a person entirely unprepared by nature, experience or self-regulation, had entirely broken her down, and shattered her nerves and spirits in a manner which she seemed less and less like to recover. She was only able to rise late in the day, take a short drive, and after dining in her own room, come down in the evening, if they were alone, and it was a good day with her.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole world}} had changed for Isabel and me; {{and we tried}} to pretend that <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> except a small matter between us. We {{believed}} quite honestly at that time {{that it was possible to}} keep this thing that had happened from any reaction at all, save perhaps through some magically enhanced vigour in our work, upon the world about us! Seen in retrospect, one can realise the absurdity of this belief; within a week I realised it; but that does not alter the fact that we did believe as much, and that people who are deeply in love and unable to marry will continue to believe so to the very end of time. They will continue to believe out of existence every consideration that separates them until they have come together. Then they will count the cost, as we two had to do.|$|E

6000|$|He {{was fairly}} launched. [...] "It's the blind folly of it! In {{the days before}} the war it was different. Then there was abundance. A little {{grabbing}} or cornering was all to the good. All to the good. It prevented things being used up too fast. And the world was running by habit; the inertia was tremendous. You could take all sorts of liberties. But all this is altered. We're living in a different world. The public won't stand things it used to stand. It's a new public. It's--wild. It'll smash up the show if they go too far. Everything short and running shorter--food, fuel, material. But these people go on. They go on as though <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed....</b> Strikes, Russia, nothing will warn them. There are men on that Commission who would steal the brakes off a mountain railway just before they went down in it.... It's a struggle with suicidal imbeciles. It's--! But I'm talking!

6000|$|... "To the man {{it seemed}} a miracle. The dream of those early days came back to him. Surely there was nothing now to {{separate}} them. <b>Nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> but the years, bringing to them both wider sympathies, calmer, more enduring emotions. She welcomed him again with the old kind smile, a warmer pressure of the hand; and, allowing {{a little time to}} pass for courtesy's sake, he told her what was the truth: that he had never ceased to love her, never ceased to keep the vision of her fair pure face before him, his ideal of all that man could find of help in womanhood. And her answer, until years later he read the explanation, remained a mystery to him. She told him that she loved him, that she had never loved any other man and never should; that his love, for so long as he chose to give it to her, she should always prize as the greatest gift of her life. But with that she prayed him to remain content.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not very}} long after noonday that, with a stifled remark of disapprobation upon her lips, she drew up {{at the foot of}} the broad flight of steps by which one crossed the fence into the Midbranch yard. Giving Billy into the charge of Plez, with {{directions}} to take him round to the stables and tell somebody to put him up and feed him, she mounted the steps, and stopped for a minute or so on the broad platform at the top; looking about her as she stood. Everything, the house, the yard, the row of elms along the fence, the wide-spreading fields, and the farm buildings and cabins, some of which she could see around the end of the house, were all on a scale so much larger and more imposing than those of her own little estate that, although <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> for the better since the days when she was familiar with Midbranch, she was struck with the general superiority of the Brandon possessions to her own. Her eyes twinkled, and she smiled; but there did not appear to be anything envious about her.|$|E
