The letters requested monetary compensation for downloads of the company's licensed material. The recipients were asked to contact Odex within one week and pay settlement fees from S$3,000 to S$5,000 or face legal action. The recipients also had to sign a <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>agreement,</b> promise to destroy all copies of the downloaded anime, and stop downloading the copyrighted material.|$|E
5|$|The iPad {{does not}} employ digital rights {{management}} (DRM), but the OS prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of Apple's platform without authorization, such as TV shows, movies, and apps. Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>agreement</b> and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process {{and control of the}} platform itself could stifle software innovation. Of particular concern to digital rights advocates is Apple's ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time.|$|E
5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

Although most open-source drivers were written before this, it has helped to solve compatibility issues.|$|E

25|$|The {{recycling}} of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, {{and credit card}} numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if {{there is more than}} one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

Vanunu said his knowledge was outdated and that he had nothing more he could reveal that is not already widely known. Despite the stated restrictions he gave interviews to the foreign press since his release, for which he has been arrested.|$|E
25|$|A {{trade secret}} is {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>agreement</b> and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are {{that the value of}} a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public. The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E

25|$|The {{sale was}} not {{announced}} until January 2007 {{as a result}} of a <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>agreement</b> with the previous owner. The sale drew a mixed response from the San Francisco community. Many people welcomed this use of The Armory as a way of revitalizing the structure and bringing back business to the area without altering the appearance of the historic building, as well as being in keeping with San Francisco's tradition of accommodating sexual minorities. Others were disturbed that a pornography studio would be located in the middle of a residential neighborhood near schools, or were opposed to the abandonment of plans for low-income housing at the site, as well as the lack of community input into this use of The Armory.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Metra CEO Alex Clifford {{abruptly}} resigned his position with no public comment. It gradually {{was reported that}} his exit had been demanded by the Metra board, which negotiated a $871,000 severance package including a <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>agreement.</b> Clifford's ouster was allegedly arranged because he rejected requests for patronage hiring and promotion, including a request to promote a longtime supporter of State Representative Michael Madigan. In the wake of this scandal, five board members resigned. In August 2013, the remaining board members unanimously elected Don Orseno as interim CEO. (The six-member board was operating with reduced membership and thus lacked the authority to elect a permanent CEO. Orseno and Alex Wiggins shared duties as co-executive directors.) Orseno's long railroad career, beginning with work to set up trains and check doors for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad played favorably in the board's decision. By October 2013, local officials had restored Metra's board to 11 members. After reviewing four candidates, the re-constituted board formally appointed Orseno CEO of Metra in January 2014.|$|E
25|$|After touring duties for {{the album}} were finished, Metallica {{filed a lawsuit}} against Elektra Records, which tried to force the record label to {{terminate}} the band's contract and give the band ownership of their master recordings. The band based its claim on a section of the California Labor Code that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. Metallica had sold 40million copies worldwide upon the filing of the suit. Metallica had been signed to the label for over a decade but was still operating under the terms of its original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate. The band members said they were taking the action because they were ambivalent about Robert Morgado's refusal to give them another record deal along with Bob Krasnow, who retired from his job at the label shortly afterwards. Elektra responded by counter-suing the band, but in December 1994, Warner Music Group United States chairman Doug Morris offered Metallica a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit, which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January 1995, both parties settled out of court with a <b>non-disclosure</b> <b>agreement.</b> Metallica played the album in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour.|$|E
