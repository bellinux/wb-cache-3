5|$|Conspiracy theorists, such as American writer Jim Marrs, {{claim that}} some ex-Nazis, {{who survived the}} fall of the Greater German Reich, along with sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere, given haven by {{organizations}} like ODESSA and Die Spinne, have been working behind the scenes since the end of World War II to enact at least some principles of Nazism (e.g., militarism, imperialism, widespread spying on citizens, corporatism, the use of propaganda to manufacture a <b>national</b> <b>consensus)</b> into culture, government, and business worldwide, but primarily in the U.S. They cite the influence of ex-Nazi scientists brought in under Operation Paperclip to help advance aerospace manufacturing in the U.S. with technological principles from Nazi UFOs, and the acquisition and creation of conglomerates by ex-Nazis and their sympathizers after the war, in both Europe and the U.S.|$|E

The <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E

25|$|There is {{considerable}} degree of inter-provincial {{variation in the}} Canadian Paramedic practice. Although a <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> (by way of the National Occupational Competency Profile) identifies certain knowledge, skills, and abilities as being most synonymous with a given level of Paramedic practice, each province retains ultimate authority in legislating the actual administration and delivery of emergency medical services within its own borders. For this reason, any discussion of Paramedic Practice in Canada is necessarily broad, and general. Specific regulatory frameworks and questions related to Paramedic practice can only definitively be answered by consulting relevant provincial legislation, although provincial Paramedic Associations may often offer a simpler overview of this topic when it is restricted to a province-by-province basis.|$|E
25|$|On appeal, Kennedy {{challenged}} {{the constitutionality of}} executing a person solely for child rape, and the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected the challenge {{on the grounds that}} the death penalty was not too harsh for such a heinous offense. The court distinguished the U.S. Supreme Court's plurality decision in Coker v. Georgia (1977), concluding that Cokers rejection of death as punishment for rape of an adult woman did not apply when the victim was a child. Rather, the Louisiana Supreme Court applied a balancing test set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in more recent death penalty cases, Atkins v. Virginia and Roper v. Simmons, first examining whether there is a <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> on the punishment and then considering whether the court would find the punishment excessive. The Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that the adoption of similar laws in five other states, coupled with the unique vulnerability of children, satisfied Atkins and Roper.|$|E
25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1911, some {{prominent}} Mongolian nobles including Prince Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren persuaded the Jebstundamba Khutukhtu to convene a meeting of nobles and ecclesiastical officials to discuss independence. The Khutukhtu consented. To avoid suspicion, he used as a pretext the occasion of a religious festival, at which time the assembled leaders would discuss the need to reapportion taxes among the khoshuuns. The meeting occurred on July 10 and the Mongolians discussed {{whether it would be}} better to submit to or resist the will of the Qings. The assembly became deadlocked, some arguing for complete, others for partial, resistance. Eighteen nobles decided to take matters into their hands. Meeting secretly in the hills outside of Urga, they decided that Mongolia must declare its independence. They then persuaded the Khutuktu to send a delegation of three prominent representatives—a secular noble, an ecclesiastic, and a lay official from Inner Mongolia—to Russia for assistance. The particular composition of the delegation—a noble, a cleric, and a commoner—may have been intended to invest the mission with a sense of <b>national</b> <b>consensus.</b>|$|E

25|$|Initial steps towards some {{convergence}} of European higher education systems were {{taken with the}} signature of the Sorbonne declaration by the Ministers in charge {{of higher education in}} France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Germany, in 1998, and later, in 1999, with the signature of the Bologna declaration. The Bologna process, aimed at creating a European Higher Education Area by implementing a comparable degree structure, common quality assurance standards and by promoting the mobility of students and faculty members, was a major revolution in Europe's higher education. Globalization, technological change and increased international competition for scarce high-skilled labor highlighted the importance of making European higher education institutions attractive and competitive worldwide. A more integrated European Higher Education Market enhanced competition between European universities—a necessary condition for producing leading-edge innovations and for catching up with the US economy. In Portugal, the University of Coimbra decided to defer the adoption of the new Bologna Process model from 2006 to 2007/2008 (with exceptions authorized for a few programs on which a <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> for change had been reached among institutions) {{in order to make the}} transition maintaining the highest standards of quality and academic integrity. Only in the 2008/2009 school year did the entire university fully adopt the new programs within its 8 faculties.|$|E
500|$|Despite his errant reputation, Shaw's propagandist {{skills were}} {{recognised}} by the British authorities, and early in 1917 {{he was invited}} by Field Marshal Haig to visit the Western Front battlefields. Shaw's 10,000-word report, which emphasised the human aspects of the soldier's life, was well received, and he became less of a lone voice. In April 1917 he joined the <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> in welcoming America's entry into the war: [...] "a first class moral asset to the common cause against junkerism".|$|E
500|$|Scalia {{believed}} {{that the death penalty}} is constitutional. He dissented in decisions that hold the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to certain groups, such as those who were under the age of 18 at the time of offense. In Thompson v. Oklahoma (1988), he dissented from the Court's ruling that the death penalty could not be applied to those aged 15 {{at the time of the}} offense, and the following year authored the Court's opinion in Stanford v. Kentucky, sustaining the death penalty for those who killed at age 16. However, in 2005, the Court overturned Stanford in Roper v. Simmons, and Scalia again dissented, mocking the majority's claims that a <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> had emerged against the execution of those who killed while underage, noting that less than half of the states that permitted the death penalty prohibited it for underage killers. He castigated the majority for including in their count states that had abolished the death penalty entirely, stating that doing so was [...] "rather like including old-order Amishmen in a consumer-preference poll on the electric car. Of course they don't like it, but that sheds no light whatever on the point at issue". In 2002, in Atkins v. Virginia, the Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to the mentally retarded. Scalia dissented, stating that it would not have been considered cruel or unusual to execute the mildly mentally retarded at the time of the 1791 adoption of the Bill of Rights and that the Court had failed to show that a <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> had formed against the practice.|$|E

500|$|Social critics accuse governments, corporations, and {{the mass}} media of being {{involved}} in the manufacturing of a <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> and, paradoxically, a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power. The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control—a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control {{of his or her own}} thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions. These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate-style brainwashing of sleeper agents (Project MKULTRA, [...] "Project Monarch") to engineering psychological operations (water fluoridation, subliminal advertising, [...] "Silent Sound Spread Spectrum", MEDUSA) and parapsychological operations (Stargate Project) to influence the masses. The concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists.|$|E
500|$|Emigration {{rose again}} {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, {{reaching}} a new peak of about 35,000 Swedes in 1903. Figures remained high until World War I, alarming both conservative Swedes, who saw emigration as a challenge to national solidarity, and liberals, who feared the disappearance of the labor force necessary for economic development. One-fourth of all Swedes had made the United States their home, and a broad <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> mandated that a Parliamentary Emigration Commission study the problem in 1907. Approaching the task with what Barton calls [...] "characteristic Swedish thoroughness", the Commission published its findings and proposals in 21 large volumes. The Commission rejected conservative proposals for legal restrictions on emigration and in the end supported the liberal line of [...] "bringing the best sides of America to Sweden" [...] through social and economic reform. Topping the list of urgent reforms were universal male suffrage, better housing, and general economic development. The Commission especially hoped that broader popular education would counteract [...] "class and caste differences" ...|$|E

Important {{to the theme of}} the book, this part convincingly shows just how pervasive Soviet collapse has been and how much evolution of new <b>national</b> <b>consensuses</b> are needed before effective socio-economic production systems can evolve. It discusses the need to see the production systems of irrigated agriculture and pastoralism as separate but complimentary activities that pay attention to the old climate imperatives, emerging new climate pressures, and the different cultural traditions of agriculture and livestock.|$|R

2500|$|The Court then {{described}} how a <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> that {{the mentally retarded}} should not be executed had emerged. In 1986, Georgia was {{the first state to}} outlaw the execution of the mentally retarded. Congress followed two years later, and the next year Maryland joined these two jurisdictions. Thus, when the Court confronted the issue in Penry in 1989, the Court could not say that a <b>national</b> <b>consensus</b> against executing the mentally retarded had emerged. Over the next twelve years, nineteen more states exempted the mentally retarded from capital punishment under their laws, bringing the total number of states to twenty-one, plus the federal government. While there are 50 states, 19 don't allow the death penalty under any circumstance, making 21 out of 31 a clear majority of the death penalty states. In light of the [...] "consistency of direction of change" [...] toward a prohibition on the execution of the mentally retarded, and the relative rarity of such executions in states that still allow it, the Court proclaimed that a [...] "national consensus has developed against it." [...] The Court, however, left it to individual states to make the difficult decision regarding what determines mental retardation.|$|E
