40|$|In the {{biodiesel}} industry, homogeneous alkaline catalysts such as NaOH, KOH and NaOCH 3 {{are used}} most widely. These catalysts provide high transesterification reaction yield and ester content with a minimal reaction time. However, homogeneous basic catalysts {{can not be}} regenerated for repeated use. Usually after the synthesis process homogeneous alkaline catalysts that are in a high concentration in the crude biodiesel and glycerol, are neutralized by using mineral acids and isolated {{in the form of}} salts. These operations and following washing and drying of crude biodiesel significantly increase the cost of biodiesel production. Therefore the use of effective heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification reaction in biodiesel production would enable the development of a <b>non-waste</b> <b>technology</b> and would give an economic benefit. This abstract summarizes the results of investigation the influence of various synthesised heterogeneous catalysts on the rapeseed oil methanolysis process...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{biodiesel}} {{production processes}} {{have been widely}} studied in laboratory and on an industrial scale {{with the purpose of}} decreasing the final cost of the desired product. In the biodiesel industry, the most widely used catalysts are alkali (NaOH, KOH and NaOCH 3). These catalysts provide high efficiency in transesterification reactions, as they are of a homogeneous nature and are soluble in alcohols. However, homogeneous alkaline catalysts have one major drawback – the regeneration for reuse in biodiesel production process isn’t possible. Therefore the use of heterogeneous catalysts as an alternative for the transesterification reaction in biodiesel production could enable the development of a <b>non-waste</b> <b>technology</b> with a beneficial economic effect. This abstract summarizes the results of the rapeseed oil methanolysis process using various heterogeneous catalysts that are supported on plasma processed alumina nanopowder porous granules with a specific surface area of 50 m 2 /g...|$|E
40|$|According to European legislation, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to dump any chromium-containing waste in Europe. The minimization of wastes is a key element in that strategy. It involves the application of clean technologies: low and <b>non-waste</b> <b>technologies.</b> The tanning industry generates substantial quantities of chromium-containing solid waste in the form of shavings and trimmings. The recycling and reuse of those wastes must be the primary target in optimizing processes of the leather industry. The problem is in a satisfying chromium separation from collagen fibers. Common hydrolysis processes-alkaline or acidic-give gelatins containing residual chromium (III). By using an oxidation agent (H 2 O 2) before alkaline hydrolysis, in was demonstrated that chromium from chromium-containing leather wastes can be almost fully recovered by the previous oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI). This chromium can be reused in the tanning process. That would represent an economic saving. The best result of the dechroming process was a gelatin hydrolyzate with only 1. 11 in respect to the initial amount...|$|R

40|$|The paper substantiates the {{necessity}} for creation of a technological machinery system in multi-industry construction complex that is from development of raw material resources and production of construction materials (logging and mining industry, woodworking, production of crushed stone, cement, concrete etc.) to construction of actual 3 D and plate objects. Attention has been attracted to continuous renovation of construction technologies and emergence of new construction materials that requires corresponding technical facilities for their efficient application and creation of these facilities is lagging behind under existing conditions. Such approach leads to saturation of the Republican machinery park by import equipment and technology that correspond to introduced technologies and construction materials according to their parameters. In order to ensure success in import substitution {{it is necessary to}} create a prospective system of technological machinery that corresponds to new technologies and materials. Experience in creation of separate fragments of the machinery system reveals machinery similarity irrespective of construction complex sector. Such approach permits to create multi-functional technical facilities having not only similar basic machines but key equipment as well that differs only in design of finite element of working tool. It has been established that multi-functionality favours a significant reduction in financial expenses for renovation of machinery parks and an increase of modular machine number. It has been shown that the machinery system prompts in due time what technical facilities are to be created in order to realize <b>non-waste</b> <b>technologies</b> in the construction complex which are completed by production of certain useful products. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the alcohol}} {{industry}} {{it is important}} to create <b>non-waste</b> <b>technology</b> for grain processing into alcohol. The aim of research was the development of technology for wheat processing into ethanol and protein product. We studied the process of enzymatic hydrolysis of starch with glucoamylase of Glucogam preparation. We determined the optimal dosage of the enzyme 8 units. GlA/g of starch, and the temperature of 55 °C. In the study of protein hydrolysis by the concomitant to glucoamylase protease of enzyme Glucogam preparation accumulation of amino nitrogen of 4. 5 mg / cm 3 in 7 hours of bioconversion takes place. Separation of the resulting saccharified mass was carried out by centrifugation into the filtrate and protein mass. Centrifugation was carried out at a rotational speed of 2500 rev / min for 8 minutes. Protein was dried to 5 % moisture content at temperatures not exceeding 35 °C, milled, and examined its properties in comparison with native wheat gluten. The resulting product had the following characteristics: the solubility of 10 %, water-holding capacity of 1. 53 g / g, and fat binding capacity of 1. 9 g /g. We investigated the process of fermentation of clarified wort with the dry solids concentration of 14 %. We used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae of race XII and Saccharomyces cerevisiae of race IMB Y- 5007 in the dose of 120 million cells per 1 cm 3 of wort. Optimum composition of mineral salts was determined. For the yeasts of race XII and IMB Y- 5007 fertilizing with diammonium phosphate in a dosage of 1. 5 g / dm 3 is necessary. The alcohol yield when using the yeasts of race IMB Y- 5007 was 60. 7 dal/ ton of conditional starch, when using yeasts of race XII it accounts 60, 6 dal / ton of conditional starch...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Modernization of {{cold-rolled}} pipes {{mills in}} order to increase functionality, regardless of their physical wear and tear. Design/methodology/approach. Constantly increasing demands on the pipe geometry and properties of materials perfectly satisfied by cold rolling (HPT), which evolves by optimizing the modes of deformation and improvement of equipment for its implementation. It offers system-modular approach to modernize the equipment of cold rolling mills, realizing one of the few <b>non-waste</b> <b>technologies</b> for the production of products with high consumer characteristics. The main producers of cold-rolled pipes mills (company SMS Meer and NGOs EZTM) more than a 80 year period of existence and development of technology HPT released about a thousand mill pipe diameters from 4 to 450 mm. Findings. System-modular approach to the unit that implements the method of production of goods HPT, based on the analysis of both technological and regime of the functioning of its mechanisms, and design options for their execution and layout, allows efficient use of the existing equipment and, if necessary, to expand its capabilities. The growing demand for cold-rolled tube can be satisfied both by the modernization of existing units and replacing them with new ones. For the design and manufacture of advanced mill HPT Ukraine has not only technical capabilities but also professionals able to offer solutions {{at the level of the}} best world standards. Originality/value. As part of undergoing a painful restructuring of the Ukrainian pipe production is more than 200 cold rolling mills pipes of different sizes and constructive accomplishments. This production will be effective in diversification - "merging" with the production of final products (for example, the production of ball bearing steel and bearing production at factories of the company "Timken" USA; production of heat exchangers in a SMPO them.
