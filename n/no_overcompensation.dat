40|$|Existence of {{traveling}} waves for integral recursions with nonmonotone growth functions. (English summary) J. Math. Biol. 58 (2009), no. 3, 323 – 338. The authors study {{the growth and}} spread of a synchronized single-species population represented via the integral recursion model (1) un+ 1 (x) = Q[un](x) := k(x − y) f(un(y)) dy, where un(x) is the density of individuals at point x and time n, with the density-dependent fecundity f(u), and the dispersal function k(x − y). The recursion (1) describes the reproduction and dispersal of a time-synchronized species. It is known {{that if there is}} <b>no</b> <b>overcompensation</b> in the fecundity function f(u), the recursion has an asymptotic spreading speed c ∗, characterized as the speed of the slowest non-constant traveling wave solution. A class of integral recursions with overcompensation can be obtained by using the ideas in [H. R. Thieme, J. Reine Angew. Math. 306 (1979), 94 – 121; MR 0524650 (80 g: 92033) ]. The present paper gives a large subclass of these models with overcompensation for which the spreading speed can still be characterized as the slowest speed of a non-constant traveling wave...|$|E

However, it remains unclear whether the low-growing plant community can maintain its productivity {{for a long period}} and whether pastoralists consider future rangeland use when making current grazing decisions. Although McNaughton (1979)suggested that moderate grazing stimulates plant compensation for biomass loss as long as grazing is not too heavy, several studies reported <b>no</b> <b>overcompensation</b> when grazing intensity exceeded the plant growth rate (Leriche et al. 2003; Patton et al. 2007).For example, in a mixed-grass prairie of North Dakota grazed by livestock and wildlife, grass production was maintained under moderate grazing treatments, but decreased under heavy grazing treatments (Patton et al. 2007). In order to maintain the plant productivity at our study sites, future studies will be needed to identify the point along the grazing gradient where plant productivity is reduced. Through collaborative research, local knowledge and research-based ecological knowledge can be exchanged (Briske et al. 2008), with the aim of identifying and resolving the conflicting perceptions of ecological conditions often held by pastoralists and researchers (Fernandez-Gimenez 2000). Further assessments of the ecological status of Mongolian rangelands should provide a foundation for ecologically sound and culturally appropriate rangeland management.|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} large samples of smart {{metering}} data allows policymakers to design Feed‐in Tariffs {{which are more}} targeted and efficient. This paper presents a methodology which uses these data to design FITs for domestic scale gridconnected PV systems in Ireland. A sample of 2, 551 household electricity demand data collected at ½‐hourly intervals, electricity output from a 2. 82 kWp PV system over the same time interval as well as PV system costs and electricity tariffs {{were used to determine}} the required FIT to make it worthwhile for the households to invest in the PV system. The methodology shows {{that it is possible to}} design single, multiple and continuous FITs. Continuous FITs are the most efficient and result in <b>no</b> <b>overcompensation</b> to the housholder while single and multiple FITs are less efficient since they result in different levels of overcompensation. In the PV case study considered, it was shown that the use of three FITs (0. 3170, 0. 3315 and 0. 3475 €/kWh) resulted in a 59. 6 % reduction in overcompensation compared to a single FIT of 0. 3475 €/kWh; assuming immediate and complete uptake of the technology, this would result in NPV savings of over € 597 m to the Irish government over a 25 year lifetime...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. : To {{assess the}} effect on visual acuity of {{compensating}} fixation instability by controlling retinal image motion in people with macular disease. Methods. : Ten patients with macular disease participated in this study. Crowded and noncrowded visual acuity were measured using an eye tracking system to compensate for fixation instability. Four conditions, corresponding to four levels of retinal image motion, were tested: no compensation (normal motion), partial compensation (reduced motion), total compensation (<b>no</b> motion), and <b>overcompensation</b> (increased motion). Fixation stability {{and the number of}} preferred retinal loci were also measured. Results. : Modulating retinal image motion had the same effect on crowded and noncrowded visual acuity (P = 0. 601). When fixation instability was overcompensated, acuity worsened by 0. 1 logMAR units (P < 0. 001) compared with baseline (no compensation) and remained equal to baseline for all other conditions. Conclusions. : In people with macular disease, retinal image motion caused by fixation instability does not reduce either crowded or noncrowded visual acuity. Acuity declines when fixation instability is overcompensated, showing limited tolerance to increased retinal image motion. The results provide evidence that fixation instability does not improve visual acuity and may be a consequence of poor oculomotor control...|$|R
