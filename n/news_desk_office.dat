40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} requirements analysis for a next generation digital newspaper publishing system. It contains detailed requirements {{in the form}} of use cases for the following categories: Functional requirements, context awareness and extended services.

Context awareness requirements allow a media consumer’s newspaper to be adapted to the consumer’s personal taste, reading behaviour and his current whereabouts. Extended services requirements extend newspapers with services from third party service providers (e. g. concert ticket offices, book stores, restaurants [...] .) which can target consumers that match a particular profile. These requirements are illustrated using a number of real life scenarios. Example quality scenarios show how non-functional requirements should be addressed.

40|$|This paper „EU Reporting from Brussels and European Public Sphere“ {{is trying}} {{to engage in the}} debate about European sphere. Analyzing the work of Brussels correspondents from various European countries, the paper is looking for {{elements}} in their work affecting the European public sphere. The rejection of EU constitution by French and Dutch voters has once again pointed out the EU communication and legitimacy deficit. As described by Jürgen Gerhards already in 1993, the generation of European public sphere is lagging behind the economic and political integration. This process threatens to undermine the achievements of EU integreation so far. Various theoretical models suggest the European public sphere as necessary element in overcoming these deficits, however there is no single widely-accepted model of European public sphere and none has solid empirical proof. We can only find some cases of segmented europeanization. This paper is part of the AIM (Adequate Information Management) project and is based on 142 semi-structured interviews made with Brussels correspondents of 11 European countries. The interviews suggest that national point of view is still the prevailing discourse for journalists covering EU affairs. The vertical transnationalism discourse that would suit best for curing communication deficit is rather absent from journalists’ preferred discourses. The paper concludes that although it is easier in Brussels to access information with transnational content, the deficiencies of EU information and the traditions of the <b>news</b> <b>desk</b> in home <b>office</b> make it hard to report from an European angle. Broadening the choice of sources allowed to speak on-the-record would help journalists to gather information more easily and add more personification to the story, thus making is more acceptable with the home office and the audience...|$|R
