40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} an {{intelligent}} {{image processing method}} for the video surveillance systems. We propose a technology detecting and tracking moving Human Body, which {{can be applied to}} consumer electronics such as home and business surveillance systems consisting of an internet protocol (IP) camera and a <b>network</b> <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (NVR). A real-time surveillance system needs to detect moving objects robustly against noises and environment. In the proposed system SVM classifies the data in a wide variety range of applications. SVM is powerful to approximate any training data and generalizes better on given datasets. Extended Kalman filter which makes the system more robust by tracking and reduce the noise introduced by inaccurate detections. Extended Kalman filter outperforms other state-of –the –art algorithms in terms of efficiency, robustness and accuracy.

50|$|Network DVR (NDVR), or <b>network</b> {{personal}} <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (NPVR), or {{remote storage}} digital <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (RS-DVR) is a network-based digital <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (DVR) stored at the provider's central location {{rather than at}} the consumer's private home. Traditionally, media content was stored in a subscriber's set-top box hard drive, but with NDVR the service provider owns a large number of servers, on which the subscribers' media content is stored. The term RS-DVR is used by Cablevision for their version of this technology.|$|R

40|$|The major {{challenge}} in surveillance system and visual sensor network lies {{in how to}} compress and store video. The deployment from a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) to <b>Network</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Recorder</b> (NVR) made the challenge more complicated, {{since there is no}} central unit controlling on the compression and highlight the big data problem on the other hand. This paper presents an algorithm to compress videos considering the contained information. Information {{is the result of a}} combination between faces and motion detection techniques. That is when information increases the quality of the stored frame (image) increase and vice-versa. The proposed algorithm is tested under different videos with varied time and information. These videos are also compressed using JPEG- 2000 algorithm. The obtained results showed that the proposed algorithm produced less video size with more detailed information than the others.

40|$|An IPTV is {{a system}} used to deliver {{television}} services to the consumers who are registered subscribers for this system. This delivery of digital television is made possible by using Internet Protocol over a broadband connection, usually in a managed network rather than the public Internet to preserve quality of service guarantees. In addition to this there is provision to include Internet service such as web access and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Currently, digital television is gradually replacing analogue TV. Although these digital TV services can be delivered via various broadcast networks (e. g., terrestrial, cable, satellite), Internet Protocol TV over broadband telecommunication networks offers much more than traditional broadcast TV. This paper first {{provides an overview of}} a typical IPTV network architecture and some basic servearchitecture design. This paper further argues that the availability of larger buffers in the network enables IPTV to better offer new services (in particular, time-shifted TV, <b>network</b> personal <b>video</b> <b>recorder,</b> and video-on-demand) than the competing platform...|$|R
40|$|The {{delivery}} of video content {{is expected to}} gain huge momentum, fueled by the popularity of user-generated clips, growth of video-on-demand (VoD) libraries, and widespread deployment of Internet Protocol television (IPTV) services with features such as CatchUp/PauseLive TV and <b>network</b> personal <b>video</b> <b>recorder</b> (NPVR) capabilities. The time-shifted nature of these personalized applications defies the broadcast paradigm underlying conventional TV networks and increases the overall bandwidth demands by orders of magnitude. Caching strategies provide an effective mechanism for mitigating these massive bandwidth requirements by storing copies {{of the most popular}} content closer to the network edge, rather than keeping it in a central site. The reduction in the traffic load lessens the required transport capacity and capital expense and alleviates performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we develop lightweight cooperative cache management algorithms aimed at maximizing the traffic volume served from cache and minimizing the bandwidth cost. As a canonical scenario, we focus on a cluster of distributed caches and show that under certain symmetry assumptions, the optimal content placement has a rather simple structure. Besides being interesting in its own right, the optimal structure offers valuable guidance for the design of low-complexity cache management and replacement algorithms. We establish that the proposed algorithms are guaranteed to operate within a constant factor from the globally optimal performance, with benign worst-case ratios, even in asymmetric scenarios. Numerical experiments reveal that typical performance is far better than the worst-case conditions indicate...|$|R
