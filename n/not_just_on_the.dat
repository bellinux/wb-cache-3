As usual, Burton kept very detailed notes, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> geography {{but also on the}} languages, customs, and even sexual habits of the people he encountered. Although it was Burton's last great expedition, his geographical and cultural notes proved invaluable for subsequent explorations by Speke and James Augustus Grant, Samuel Baker, David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley. Speke and Grant's (1863) exploration began on the east coast near Zanzibar again and went around the west side of Lake Victoria to Lake Albert and finally returned in triumph via the River Nile. However, crucially, they had lost track of the river's course between Lake Victoria and Albert. This left Burton, and others, unsatisfied that the source of the Nile was conclusively proven.|$|E

500|$|Eisenhower said {{he would}} not [...] "leave his {{successor}} with the monstrosity" [...] of the uncoordinated and un-integrated forces that then existed. In early November 1960, he sent Kistiakowsky to SAC Headquarters in Omaha to evaluate its war plans. Initially, Kistiakowsky was not given access, and Eisenhower sent him back, with a much stronger set of orders for SAC officers to cooperate. Kistiaknowsky's report, presented on November 29, described uncoordinated plans with huge numbers of targets, many of which would be attacked by multiple forces, resulting in overkill. Eisenhower was shocked by the plans, and focused <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> creation of the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), but on the entire process of picking targets, generating requirements, and planning for nuclear war operations.|$|E

[...] "By force of matters purely musical I {{turned out to}} be the head of the Belyayev circle", he wrote. [...] "As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief". In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual Glinka prize, and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, through which he published works by Borodin, Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov at his own expense. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.|$|E

In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya in the final. In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president {{in a desperate attempt}} to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905.

[...] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.|$|E

[...] Another critic wrote of the same story that it was [...] "richly plotted, action-packed," [...] and that [...] "Chabon skilfully elaborates his world and draws <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steampunk worlds of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling and Michael Moorcock, but on alternate histories by brilliant science fiction mavericks such as Avram Davidson and Howard Waldrop.

[...] While The Village Voice called The Final Solution [...] "an ingenious, fully imagined work, an expert piece of literary ventriloquism, and a mash note to the beloved boys' tales of Chabon's youth," [...] The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "he genre of the comic book is an anemic vein for novelists to mine, lest they squander their brilliance." [...] The New York Times states that the detective story, [...] "a genre that is by its nature so constrained, so untransgressive, seems unlikely {{to appeal to the}} real writer," [...] but adds that [...] "... Chabon makes good on his claim: a successful detective story need not be lacking in literary merit." ...|$|E
500|$|Hechicero was one {{of sixteen}} wrestlers {{given a chance to}} compete in the 2014 En Busca de un Ídolo ("In search of an idol") tournament. The En Busca de un Ídolo tournament {{featured}} younger wrestlers, mostly low-to-mid-card wrestlers where they were given an opportunity to showcase their wrestling skills on a national scale. As part of the tournament each wrestler would earn points from the outcome of their matches, feedback from a panel of judges and a weekly online poll. Hechicero was one eight wrestlers to qualify as he survived a Torneo cibernetico elimination match along with Cavernario, Chachorro, Dragon Lee Guerrero Negro, Jr., Soberano, Jr., Star Jr., and Super Halcón, Jr. Hechicero ended up on the team being coached by Virus each week, with coaching focusing <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual wrestling but also how to play their characters in the ring, interact with the fans and so on. During the weekly judging Hechicero received praise for his in-ring skills but also got several comments on {{the fact that he did}} not wrestle a very rudo style and needed to be more aggressive in the ring, something he tried to incorporate from week to week. After the first round Hechicero won almost every single weekly online poll, propelling him to the top of the ranking at the end with a total of 565 points, 114 more than the second place Cavernario. In the week between the first and the second round Hechicero teamed up with Virus and Cachorro to defeat Negro Casas, Cavernario and Dragon Lee on the May 23 Super Viernes show. In the second round Hechicero lost to Cavernario but defeated both Dragon Lee and Cachorro to earn a total of 250 points, including the majority of the online poll votes. The point score qualified Hechicero for the finals against Cavernario. In the final Cavernario defeated Hechicero two falls to one to win the tournament. The following week all eight [...] "Busca" [...] competitors two trainers faced off in a torneo cibernetico elimination match that saw Negro Casas eliminate Virus as the last man to win the match, Hechicero was eliminated as the sixth man by as he and Cavernario pinned each other at the same time. In the weeks following the En Busca de un Ídolo finals Hechicero began teaming with Mephisto and Ephesto for a couple of shows, possibly signaling that CMLL had plans to make them a trio after Mephisto and Ephesto's regular partner Averno had left CMLL. Later when Mephisto and Ephesto were announced as teaming with El Hombre Sin Nombre ("The Man with No Name") there was initial confusion if that meant Hechicero was being given a new ring identify, but once El Hombre Sin Nombre made his debut, it was obvious that the physical appearance and wrestling style did not match Hechicero. On the October 10, 2014 Super Viernes show Hechicero debuted a new look, including a new mask design and trunks in black with gold or red embellishment. As part of his image makeover Hechicero began carrying a bowl that burned with red flames as part of his entrance rituals. At ringside Hechicero often touches and sometimes scoops out the flames from the bowl without hurting his hands.|$|E

2500|$|Spinors are {{characterized}} by the specific {{way in which they}} behave under rotations. [...] They change in different ways depending <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> overall final rotation, but the details of how that rotation was achieved (by a continuous path in the rotation group). [...] There are two topologically distinguishable classes (homotopy classes) of paths through rotations that result in the same overall rotation, as famously illustrated by the belt trick puzzle (below). [...] These two inequivalent classes yield spinor transformations of opposite sign. [...] The spin group is the group of all rotations keeping track of the class. It doubly covers the rotation group, since each rotation can be obtained in two inequivalent ways as the endpoint of a path. The space of spinors by definition is equipped with a (complex) linear representation of the spin group, meaning that elements of the spin group act as linear transformations on the space of spinors, in a way that genuinely depends on the homotopy class.|$|E

[...] Bakke focused <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> economic characteristics of unemployment but also on the social and psychological consequences and costs from it. [...] As such, Bakke became known for the sensitivity which he brought to this subject. [...] He emphasized the distaste the unemployed often had in applying for government relief, as illustrated by quotes like [...] "I'd rather be dead and buried" [...] and, when another was ultimately compelled to do so, [...] "I would hide my face in the ground and pound the earth." [...] The 2004 Encyclopedia of the Great Depression states that Bakke's New Haven study stands [...] "as a powerful statement of the importance of stable, adequately-paying work opportunities for individual well-being, as well as broader social well-being" [...] and that even given his other contributions to sociology, economics, and industrial relations, [...] "Bakke's study of Depression-era unemployment remains his most influential and far-reaching work."

As well, the LDP was [...] "crumbling into disarray" [...] in the wake of Hatoyama's victory. In the profile, Nakasone described the moment [...] "as a national opening on par with the wrenching social and political changes that followed defeat in the [...] war [...] praised the appearance of a strong second political party as a step toward true democracy". [...] "Being knocked out of power is a good chance to study in the cram school of public opinion", he was quoted as saying of the LDP. He [...] "faulted Mr. Hatoyama for giving Washington the impression that [...] valued ties with China more than he did those with the United States. 'Because of the prime minister’s imprudent remarks, the current situation calls for Japan to make efforts to improve things,' he said. The [...] relationship with the United States is different from that with China, he said, because 'it is built on a security alliance, and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> alliance, but on the shared values of liberal democracy, and on its shared ideals.'"
