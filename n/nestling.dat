5|$|Many {{species of}} birdlice are {{present on the}} birds and in their nests, and mites of the genus Knemidocoptes {{have been known to}} infest populations, {{resulting}} in lesions on the legs and toes. Parasitisation of nestlings by Protocalliphora blow-fly larvae is a significant factor in <b>nestling</b> mortality. Egg size does not influence <b>nestling</b> mortality, but chicks from large eggs grow faster.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, {{they are}} born {{relatively}} immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the <b>nestling</b> stage because there are higher levels of <b>nestling</b> predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch {{but there is no}} increase during the egg stage.|$|E

40|$|The case {{describes}} <b>Nestle</b> and <b>Nestle</b> Waters' {{social conflict}} with trade unions at the Perrier plant in France in 2005 {{and its consequences}} {{for the future of}} the brand within <b>Nestle</b> Waters' portfolio. The performance of Perrier, one of <b>Nestle</b> Waters' strongest international brands is problematic. Perrier sales grow at less than the overall growth rate for <b>Nestle</b> Waters. Its position in the US and European markets, the largest bottled water markets, continues to be strong, but its productivity remained low, it was barely making any profit, and the restructuring of the Perrier production remains difficult because of the opposition of strong trade unions, restrictive French laws, and governmental intervention. In February 2006, <b>Nestle</b> and <b>Nestle</b> Waters faced several difficult questions about the future of Perrier: (1) does Perrier still fit within <b>Nestle</b> Waters' brand portfolio? (2) does Perrier contribute to <b>Nestle</b> Waters' brand portfolio? (3) should <b>Nestle</b> divest or relocalise Perrier? (4) would this divestment or relocalisation affect <b>Nestle's</b> image and reputation in France or Globally?

5|$|The <b>nestling</b> period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer <b>nestling</b> periods. It is also {{affected}} by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the <b>nestling</b> period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Male {{and females}} are {{involved}} in the process of provisioning at similar rates throughout most nest stages, with the males providing slightly more in the <b>nestling</b> stages. Both sexes increase their provision rates as the nestlings grow in age.|$|E
5|$|The <b>nestling</b> is born nearly featherless {{except for}} tiny primary quills {{and a fine}} down along its spine, humerus, forearm, and femur. Its skin is dark pink but {{displays}} variable black patches on its upperside. The gape is yellow. As the <b>nestling</b> develops, its plumage begins to resemble that of the adult, though it has white flecks on its wing coverts and the featherless skin on the head is black or dark brown, not powder blue, on the forecrown and dark reddish brown, not carmine, on the hindcrown. After fledging, the immature closely resembles the adult except for the bare patch {{on the back of}} the head being golden yellow instead of carmine and the tail being only a third as long as that of an adult.|$|E

5|$|The {{whistlers}} and shrikethrushes are a {{large group}} of stocky passerines found in Australia and surrounding regions. Primarily insectivorous, larger species may also eat small vertebrates such as frogs or <b>nestling</b> birds. Most have drab plumage, the golden whistler a notable exception, and several are accomplished songsters. Three species are found in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|Most non-human-related {{mortality}} involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive {{their first}} year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived {{to their first}} year. Occasionally, <b>nestling</b> or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and <b>nestling</b> mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (Gulo gulo), hawks, owls, eagles, bobcats (Lynx rufus), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) parasitizes pied currawong nests, laying eggs {{which are}} then raised by the unsuspecting foster parents. The eggs closely {{resemble}} those of the currawong hosts. Pied currawongs {{have been known to}} desert nests once cuckoos have visited, abandoning the existing currawong young, which die, and a channel-billed cuckoo has been recorded decapitating a currawong <b>nestling.</b> The brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus) and lace monitor (Varanus varius) have also been recorded taking nestlings.|$|E
50|$|When SMC {{spun off}} its {{ice cream and}} milk {{business}} into a joint-venture with <b>Nestlé</b> in 1996, forming Magnolia-Nestlé Corporation, the Aurora Boulevard property remained under the ownership of SMC and served as the venture's main production facility and site of its ice cream parlor. After SMC withdrew from the venture in 1998, <b>Nestlé</b> Philippines continued with the business under the <b>Nestlé</b> brand name (the ice cream parlor became known as <b>Nestlé</b> Creamery). <b>Nestlé’s</b> production was gradually transferred to a new site and in 1999, <b>Nestlé</b> closed down operations in the Aurora Boulevard facility.|$|R

5|$|Tree sparrows {{are also}} subject to {{bacterial}} and viral infections. Bacteria {{have been shown}} to be an important factor in the failure of eggs to hatch and in <b>nestling</b> mortality, and mass deaths due to Salmonella infection have been noted in Japan. Avian malaria parasites have been found in the blood of many populations, and birds in China were found to harbour a strain of H5N1 that was highly virulent to chickens.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{black-throated blue warbler}} is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting the occurrence of extra-pair matings. <b>Nestling</b> parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of mercury in their blood and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire mercury in its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren <b>nestling</b> and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, a {{wide variety}} of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its low clutch size (one young per nest), {{combined}} with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to artificial population decline. Significant past damage to the condor population has also been attributed to poaching, especially for museum specimens, lead poisoning (from eating animals containing lead shot), DDT poisoning, electric power lines, egg collecting, and habitat destruction. During the California Gold Rush, some condors were even kept as pets. The leading cause of mortality in <b>nestling</b> condors is the ingestion of trash that is fed to them by their parents.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{lies in the}} Lower Severn/Avon plain affording it {{a degree}} of shelter caused {{by virtue of its}} <b>nestling</b> in between the Cotswold hills to the east, the Welsh Hills and Mountains to the west, and Birmingham plateau to the north. Although as with all the British Isles it has a {{maritime}} climate, the local topography means summer warmth can become emphasised by a slight foehn effect off the surrounding hills. The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the year will reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher and the annual warmest day should reach 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.|$|E
5|$|The California condor {{conservation}} project {{may be one}} of {{the most}} expensive species conservation projects in United States history, costing over $35million, including $20million in federal and state funding, since World War II. As of 2007 the annual cost for the condor conservation program was around $2.0 million per year. However, nesting milestones have been recently reached by the reintroduced condors. In 2003, the first <b>nestling</b> fledged in the wild since 1981. In March 2006, a pair of California condors, released by Ventana Wildlife Society, attempted to nest in a hollow tree near Big Sur, California. This was the first time in more than 100 years that a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the remiges (and alulae) of <b>nestling</b> hoatzins is much delayed compared to the {{development of}} these feathers in other young birds, presumably because young hoatzins are equipped with claws on their first two digits. They use these small rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and feathering on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their claws sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though callused-over and unusable— into adulthood.|$|E
5|$|The {{wedge-tailed eagle}} (Aquila audax) preys on adult, <b>nestling,</b> and fledgling Australian ravens, while the little eagle (Hieraaetus morphnoides) also takes nestlings, and {{powerful}} owl (Ninox strenua) {{has been recorded}} killing adults; other birds of prey are seen as threats, {{yet there is no}} evidence they have successfully preyed on the ravens. The introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes) competes with the Australian raven for carrion and can drive it off. It may also kill young birds that it catches on the ground. The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) has been recorded as a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|Various {{causes for}} the {{dramatic}} decreases in population have been proposed, including predation, in particular by Eurasian sparrowhawks; electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones; and diseases. A shortage of nesting sites caused {{by changes in}} urban building design is probably a factor, and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows. A primary cause of the decline {{seems to be an}} insufficient supply of insect food for <b>nestling</b> sparrows. Declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops, the heavy use of pesticides, the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas, and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol, which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite.|$|E
