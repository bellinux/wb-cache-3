50|$|Nucleosides must be triphosphorylated, while nucleotides, which possess one phosphonated group, must be diphosphorylated. This {{stepwise}} activation process occurs {{inside the}} cell and is mediated by a coordinated series of enzymes. The first, and often rate limiting, phosphorylation step (for nucleoside analogues) are most commonly catalyzed by deoxynucleoside kinases. Addition {{of the second}} phosphate group to <b>nucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate</b> analogues is completed by the <b>nucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate</b> kinases (NMP kinases). A variety of enzymes are able to catalyze the final phosphorylation step for NRTIs, including nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase), phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase and creatine kinase, resulting in formation of respective antivirally active triphosphate analogues.In their respective triphosphate forms, NRTIs and the only NtRTI available compete with their corresponding endogenous deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) for incorporation into the nascent DNA chain (see figure 1). Unlike dNTPs substrate, NRTIs lack a 3´-hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose moiety. Once incorporated into the DNA chain, {{the absence of a}} 3´-hydroxyl group, which normally forms the 5´- to 3´- phosphoester bond with the next nucleic acid, blocks further extension of the DNA by RT, and they act as chain terminators.|$|E

40|$|Prodrug {{technologies}} {{aimed at}} delivering <b>nucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> into cells (protides) {{have proved to}} be effective in improving the therapeutic potential of antiviral and anticancer nucleosides. In these cases, the <b>nucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> are delivered into the cell, where they may then be further converted (phosphorylated) to their active species. Herein, we describe one of these technologies developed in our laboratories, known as the phosphoramidate protide method. In this approach, the charges of the phosphate group are fully masked to provide efficient passive cell-membrane penetration. Upon entering the cell, the masking groups are enzymatically cleaved to release the phosphorylated biomolecule. The application of this technology to various therapeutic nucleosides has resulted in improved antiviral and anticancer activities, and in some cases it has transformed inactive nucleosides to active ones. Additionally, the phosphoramidate technology has also been applied to numerous antiviral nucleoside phosphonates, and has resulted in at least three phosphoramidate-based nucleotides progressing to clinical investigations. Furthermore, the phosphoramidate technology has been recently applied to sugars (mainly glucosamine) in order to improve their therapeutic potential.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that acylphosphatase possesses ATP-diphosphohydrolase (apyrase-like) activity. In fact, acylphosphatase first catalyses the hydrolysis of the gamma-phosphate group of nucleoside triphosphates, and then attacks the beta-phosphate group of the initially produced nucleoside diphosphates, generating <b>nucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates.</b> In contrast, it binds <b>nucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> but does not catalyse their hydrolyses. The calculated k(cat) values for the nucleoside triphosphatase activity of acylphosphatase are of the same order of magnitude as those displayed by certain G-proteins. An acidic environment enhances the apyrase-like activity of acylphosphatase. The true nucleotide substrates of acylphosphatase are free nucleoside di- and triphosphates, {{as indicated by the}} Mg(2 +) ion inhibition of the activity. We have also demonstrated that, although nucleoside triphosphates are still hydrolysed at pH 7. 2 and 37 degrees C, in the presence of millimolar Mg(2 +) concentrations this occurs at a lower rate. Taken together with the previously observed strong increase of acylphosphatase levels during induced cell differentiation, our findings suggest that acylphosphatase plays {{an active role in the}} differentiation process (as well as in other processes, such as apoptosis) by modulating the ratio between the cellular levels of nucleoside diphosphates and nucleoside triphosphates...|$|R
