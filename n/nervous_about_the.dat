5|$|Ben Palmer, the {{director}} of the first Inbetweeners film, was involved with Simon Pegg's film Man Up, so Morris and Beesley directed The Inbetweeners 2.

5|$|Chaplin was <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film's {{reception}} because silent {{films were}} becoming obsolete by then, and the preview had undermined his confidence. Nevertheless, City Lights {{became one of}} Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed works. Following the good reception by American audiences, with earnings of $2 million, a quarter of which came from its 12-week run at the Cohan, Chaplin went on a sixteen-date world tour between February and March 1932, starting with a premiere at London's Dominion Theatre on February 27. The film was enthusiastically received by Depression-era audiences, earning $5 million during its initial release.|$|E

5|$|The {{dampening}} {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that he should go on tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} Prison Break—a man deliberately getting himself {{sent to prison}} {{in order to help}} someone escape—was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring {{thought it was a good}} idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series. Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds. Thus, the miniseries never materialized. Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24, Fox decided to back the production in 2004. The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script.|$|E

25|$|According to critic Roger Ebert, both {{executive}} producer Darryl F. Zanuck and director John Ford were odd choices {{to make this}} film because both were considered politically conservative. Zanuck was <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> left-wing political views of the novel, especially the ending. Due to the red-baiting common to the era, Darryl Zanuck sent private investigators to Oklahoma to help him legitimize the film.|$|E

25|$|Studio {{executives}} were <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film's commercial prospects when preview audiences laughed at scenes of serious intent. Industry insiders {{said that the}} release delay was because nervous executives ordered the film's ending completely re-shot. There was also {{the question of the}} size of the film's budget: 20th Century Fox stated that the budget was $43 million, a figure Cameron himself has reiterated. However, estimates put the figure higher with The New York Times estimating the cost at $45 million and one executive claiming it cost $47 million, while box office revenue tracker website The Numbers lists the production budget at $70 million.|$|E
25|$|The Depression of the 1930s, {{followed}} by {{the outbreak of the}} Sino-Japanese War, had the effect of ending Chinese emigration to Malaya. This stabilised the demographic situation and ended the prospect of the Malays becoming a minority in their own country. At the time of independence in 1957, Malays comprised 55% of the population, Chinese 35% and Indians 10%. This balance was altered by the inclusion of the majority-Chinese Singapore, upsetting many Malays. The federation increased the Chinese proportion to close to 40%. Both UMNO and the MCA were <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possible appeal of Lee's People's Action Party (then seen as a radical socialist party) to voters in Malaya, and tried to organise a party in Singapore to challenge Lee's position there. Lee in turn threatened to run PAP candidates in Malaya at the 1964 federal elections, despite an earlier agreement that he would not do so (see PAP-UMNO Relations). Racial tensions intensified as PAP created an opposition alliance aiming for equality between races. This provoked Tunku Abdul Rahman to demand that Singapore withdraw from Malaysia. While the Singaporean leaders attempted to keep Singapore {{as a part of the}} Federation, the Malaysian Parliament voted 126–0 on 9 August 1965 in favor of the expulsion of Singapore.|$|E
25|$|On September 6, President McKinley was {{attending}} the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York {{when he was}} shot by Leon Czolgosz. Roosevelt was vacationing in Vermont, and traveled to Buffalo to visit McKinley in the hospital. It appeared that McKinley would recover, so Roosevelt resumed his vacation in the Adirondacks. When McKinley's condition worsened, Roosevelt began the trip to Buffalo. McKinley died on September 14, and Roosevelt was informed while he was in North Creek; he continued on to Buffalo and was sworn in at the Ansley Wilcox House. As there was no formally designated order of succession for the post in the event that a president resigned, became incapacitated, or died (the Twenty-fifth Amendment would not be drafted and ratified until the 1960s), Roosevelt served his first term without a vice president. McKinley's supporters were <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> new president, and Hanna was particularly bitter that the man he had opposed so vigorously at the convention had succeeded McKinley. Roosevelt assured party leaders that he intended to adhere to McKinley's policies, and he retained McKinley's Cabinet. Nonetheless, Roosevelt sought to position himself as the party's undisputed leader, seeking to bolster the role of the president and position himself for the 1904 election.|$|E

He had scored previous Bungie projects, including , while working for his audio company, TotalAudio, along with Michael Salvatori. O'Donnell was <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> project, saying he approached it, [...] "with fear and trepidation". O'Donnell stated his main influences were music he liked—"a little Samuel Barber meets Giorgio Moroder". Bungie's Director of cinematics, Joseph Staten told O'Donnell, [...] "the music should give a feeling of importance, weight, and sense of the 'ancient' to the visuals of Halo".|$|E

500|$|According to {{director}} Kevin Lima, [...] "thousands" [...] {{of references}} {{are made to}} past and future works of Disney in Enchanted, which serve as both a parody of and a [...] "giant love letter to Disney classics". It took almost eight years for Walt Disney Studios to greenlight {{the production of the}} film because it [...] "was always quite <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tone in particular". As Lima worked with Bill Kelly, the writer, to inject Disney references to the plot, it became [...] "an obsession"; he derived the name of every character as well as anything that needed a name from past Disney films to bring in more Disney references.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{does not}} provide the voice, Arnold Schwarzenegger is President of the United States rather than then-President George W.

The scene {{was one of the first}} worked on for the film, but the producers were <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> segment because they thought it would earn the movie an R rating.
