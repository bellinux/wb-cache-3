5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any <b>needs</b> <b>that</b> arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E

5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have <b>needs</b> <b>that</b> must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children and the arrival of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan have {{conducted}} research that {{eventually led to}} the proposition of the self-determination theory (SDT).

SDT identifies three innate <b>needs</b> <b>that,</b> if satisfied, allow optimal function and growth: competence, relatedness, and autonomy.|$|E

25|$|A {{healthcare}} system, {{sometimes referred}} to as health system, is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver healthcare services to meet the health needs of target populations. A culturally competent health system not only recognizes and accepts the importance of cultural diversity at every level but also assesses the cross-cultural relations, stays vigilant towards any changes and developments resulting from cultural diversity, broadens cultural knowledge, and adapts services to meet the <b>needs</b> <b>that</b> are culturally-unique.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory that}} has been posited {{to account for the}} {{occurrence}} of accusative systems is that of functional pressure. When applied to languages, this theory operates around the various needs and pressures on a speech community. It has been suggested that languages have evolved to suit the needs of their users.These communities will develop some functional system to meet the <b>needs</b> <b>that</b> they have. So, it has been proposed that the accusative system arose from a functional pressure to avoid ambiguity and make communication a simpler process.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Nike and UNLV {{entered into}} a {{contract}} that makes Nike the exclusive product supplier and sponsor of all UNLV athletic teams.

UNLV's three-year deal covers men's basketball for $155,000 per year for a combined value of $465,000. The five-year contracts are for football ($230,000 annually, $1.15 million total) and all other sports ($277,000 and $1.385 million). Previous to the new contract, UNLV used a combination of Nike, Russell Athletic, and Adidas for its shoes and apparel.|$|E

25|$|Generally, DG {{work can}} be seen as taking two approaches: one views democratization as a {{political}} struggle between democrats and non-democrats and directs aid toward political processes and institutions such as elections, political parties, and civil society; and the second views democratization as a slower, longer-term process and directs aid at a wide range of political and socioeconomic sectors. In terms of implementation, donor country development agencies, such as USAID, UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), design and fund programs (according to donor country interests and local <b>needs)</b> <b>that</b> are often carried out by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in coordination with local and international groups.|$|E
25|$|While many {{theories}} on motivation have a mentalistic perspective, behaviorists {{focus only on}} observable behavior and theories founded on experimental evidence. In the view of behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about what factors cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motives would be ignored. Where others would speculate about such things as values, drives, or <b>needs,</b> <b>that</b> may not be observed directly, behaviorists {{are interested in the}} observable variables that affect the type, intensity, frequency and duration of observable behavior. Through the basic research of such scientists as Pavlov, Watson and Skinner, several basic mechanisms that govern behavior have been identified. The most important of these are classical conditioning and operant conditioning.|$|E
25|$|A chance {{encounter}} {{led to a}} {{new lease}} and the eventual sale of the property. Tayloe had become engaged to Phoebe Warren, a wealthy young woman from Troy, New York. Miss Warren was traveling on the steamer Niagara (a vessel which traveled {{up and down the}} Hudson River) when she met Henry Willard, a Chief Steward aboard the vessel. Warren was so impressed with the way Willard handled the ship's and passengers' <b>needs</b> <b>that</b> she recommended him to her fianceé. Willard visited Washington, D.C., in October 1847 to meet with Tayloe, who subsequently leased the six buildings to him for use as a hotel. Willard combined the six structures into one building in 1850, added two additional stories, and called the new business the Willard Hotel.|$|E

25|$|Non-deliverable {{forwards}} (NDF): A strictly risk-transfer {{financial product}} {{similar to a}} Forward Rate Agreement, but used only where monetary policy restrictions on the currency in question limit the free flow and conversion of capital. As the name suggests, NDFs are not delivered but settled in a reference currency, usually USD or EUR, where the parties exchange the gain or loss that the NDF instrument yields, and if the buyer of the controlled currency truly <b>needs</b> <b>that</b> hard currency, he can take the reference payout {{and go to the}} government in question and convert the USD or EUR payout. The insurance effect is the same; it's just that the supply of insured currency is restricted and controlled by government. See capital control.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that objectively ranking MBA {{programs}} {{by a combination of}} graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can reasonably duplicate the top 20 list of the national publications, and concluded that a truly objective ranking would be individualized to the needs of each prospective student. National publications have recognized the value of rankings against different criteria, and now offer lists ranked different ways: by salary, GMAT score of students, selectivity, and so forth. While useful, these rankings have yet to meet the critique that rankings are not tailored to individual <b>needs,</b> <b>that</b> they use an incomplete population of schools, may fail to distinguish between the different MBA program types offered by each school, or rely on subjective interviews.|$|E
25|$|Many {{recipes and}} dishes {{traveled}} along with transatlantic immigrants to their destinations in the New World. Some authors {{question whether the}} Hamburg America Line was part of this, arguing that the hamburger was created to meet <b>needs</b> <b>that</b> arose amongst immigrants already in the New World. Others, however, support the thesis that the Hamburg America Line brought the first Hamburger steaks from Europe to the Americas. The hamburger {{as it is known}} today has multiple invention claims ranging between 1885 and 1904, but it is clearly the product of the early 20th century. During the following 100 years, the hamburger spread throughout the world {{as a result of the}} emerging concept of fast food and a new business model: the franchise.|$|E
