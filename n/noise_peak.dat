Pb-doped BiSrCaCuO targets were prepared from oxide with different ratios of metals. Oxygen pressure during deposition was found to affect {{the composition of the}} as-deposited films. Although the substrate heating improved morphology of the films, it did not have a strong effect on the stoichiometry. Good quality superconducting films were produced after a two-step annealing with a controlled rate of temperature increase, which was determined by the chamber pressures used. The onset critical temperature for the superconducting films was between 86 and 118 K and the zero critical temperature was between 77 and 106 K. These critical temperatures are the highest ones obtained so far for BiSrCaCuO films prepared by the CO$ sb 2 $ laser ablation technique. The critical current density of the films was in the range of $ 10 sp 2 sim 10 sp 3 $ A/cm$ sp 2 $. The films were found to contain 2212 and 2223 superconducting phases, with a dominant 2223 phase. The composition was uniform along the films and the average ratio was close to that for the standard 110 K high-T$ sb{ rm c}$ phase. The noise of the BiSrCaCuO films in normal state was inversely proportional to frequency and was at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than the noise of typical metals.

Our purpose here was to determine how the strength of NF regulation affects the characteristics of gene expression in yeast cells harboring chromosomally integrated transcriptional cascades that consist of the yEGFP reporter controlled by (i) the constitutively expressed tetracycline repressor TetR or (ii) TetR repressing its own expression. Reporter gene expression in the cascade without feedback showed a steep (sigmoidal) doseâresponse and a wide, nearly bimodal yEGFP distribution, giving rise to a <b>noise</b> <b>peak</b> at intermediate levels of induction. We developed computational models that reproduced the steep doseâresponse and the <b>noise</b> <b>peak</b> and predicted that negative autoregulation changes reporter expression from bimodal to unimodal and transforms the doseâresponse from sigmoidal to linear. Prompted by these predictions, we constructed a âlinearizerâ circuit by adding TetR autoregulation to our original cascade and observed a massive (7 -fold) reduction of noise at intermediate induction and linearization of doseâresponse before saturation. A simple mathematical argument explained these findings and indicated that linearization is highly robust to parameter variations.

40|$|Continuous {{oscillations}} of the Earth {{are observed}} for frequencies between 2 and 7 mHz {{at almost every}} seismically quiet site in the world. These oscillations ride on a broad <b>noise</b> <b>peak</b> which spans the frequency band from 3 to 15 mHz and reaches its maximum at 7 - 9 mHz. We propose an oceanic excitation hypothesis which explains both the modal oscillations and the broad <b>noise</b> <b>peak,</b> specifically the action of oceanic infragravity waves on the solid Earth. Using the estimated amplitudes of oceanic infragravity waves from observation, although they are limited in number at the moment, we {{show that there is}} sufficient energy in these waves to excite observed seismic signals; for a given time window, the contribution from a small area (which may be as small as 100 km x 100 km) is all that is required to explain the seismic observations. The advantage of this oceanic mechanism over the previously proposed atmospheric mechanism is in the simultaneous explanation of the above two features in seismograms, whereas the atmospheric hypothesis has only explained the modal oscillations. The oceanic mechanism naturally explains the predominant 6 -month periodicity as a result of semi-hemispheric ocean-wave activities in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, showing a good match between seismic data and satellite ocean-wave data both in the amplitude and phase of seasonal variation.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} noise from {{intrinsic}} ellipticities of source galaxies, in this paper, we study the peak statistics in weak-lensing convergence maps around clusters of galaxies and beyond. We emphasize how the <b>noise</b> <b>peak</b> statistics {{is affected by}} the density distribution of nearby clusters, and also how cluster-peak signals are changed by the existence of noise. These are the important aspects to be understood thoroughly in weak-lensing analyses for individual clusters as well as in cosmological applications of weak-lensing cluster statistics. We adopt Gaussian smoothing with the smoothing scale Î¸_G= 0. 5 arcmin in our analyses. It is found that the <b>noise</b> <b>peak</b> distribution near a cluster of galaxies depends sensitively on the density profile of the cluster. For a cored isothermal cluster with the core radius R_c, the inner region with R 5 for R_c= 1. 7 arcmin and the true peak height of the cluster Î½= 5. 6, where Î½ denotes the convergence signal to noise ratio. For a NFW cluster of the same mass and the same central Î½, the average number of peaks with Î½> 5 within R< R_c is â¼ 1. 6. Thus a high peak corresponding to the main cluster can be identified more cleanly in the NFW case. In the outer region with R_c<R< 5 R_c, the number of high noise peaks is considerably enhanced in comparison with that of the pure noise case without the nearby cluster.
