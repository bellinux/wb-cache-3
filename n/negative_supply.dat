25|$|Specific {{rail-to-rail}} comparators with p-n-p input transistors, {{like the}} LM139 family, allow the input potential to drop 0.3nbsp&volts below the <b>negative</b> <b>supply</b> rail, {{but do not}} allow it {{to rise above the}} positive rail. Specific ultra-fast comparators, like the LMH7322, allow input signal to swing below the negative rail and above the positive rail, although by a narrow margin of only 0.2nbsp&V. Differential input voltage (the voltage between two inputs) of a modern rail-to-rail comparator is usually limited only by the full swing of power supply.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an n-type switch, the body is {{connected}} to the most <b>negative</b> <b>supply</b> (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, the more the MOSFET can conduct. An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than Vgate–Vtn. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.|$|E
25|$|If the {{three-phase}} bridge rectifier is operated symmetrically (as positive and <b>negative</b> <b>supply</b> voltage), the center {{point of the}} rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the {{three-phase bridge}} rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Phase-locked loops (PLLs) which employ voltage {{regulators}} for low supply-noise sensitivity often rely upon significant decoupling capacitance to suppress <b>negative</b> (Gnd) <b>supply</b> noise and maintain low jitter. This paper compares various supply regulation techniques {{on the basis}} of their ability to reject noise from both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>supplies.</b> A novel replica-based dual-supply regulation technique is proposed which allows for significant reduction in decoupling capacitance for a given supply noise rejection. Comparison simulations in a 90 nm CMOS technology show the replica-based dual-supply regulation technique achieving a worst case noise sensitivity of 1. 6 rad/V, an improvement of 7. 5 rad/V (15. 1 dB) relative to a single-supply replica-based regulator topology. At 4. 7 GHz, the replica-based dual-supply regulated PLL consumes 11 mW from a 1. 2 V supply. I...|$|R

Even though the game was a best seller during the holiday season, retailers still stated that its sales figures did not meet expectations. Warner Communications also expressed disappointment at the number of sales. Lower-than-expected sales figures combined with excess inventory, which produced a <b>negative</b> <b>supply</b> and demand event, prompted retailers to repeatedly discount price. According to Ray Kassar, about 3.5 million of the 4 million produced were sent back to the company as unsold inventory or customer returns. Despite sales figures, the quantity of unsold merchandise, coupled with the expensive movie license and the large number of returns, made E.T. a major financial failure for Atari.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, China has {{achieved}} remarkable long-term economic growth. Using quarterly data, we study {{the effects of}} money supply on real output and inflation in China between 1993 and 2008. To this end, we use money supply shocks after filtering out the expected component of the money supply. Our findings provide evidence supporting the asymmetric effect of positive and <b>negative</b> money <b>supply</b> shocks on real output and inflation in China. That is, real GDP growth in China responds to <b>negative</b> money <b>supply</b> shocks but not positive money supply shocks. In addition, inflation responds to positive money supply shocks but not <b>negative</b> money <b>supply</b> shocks. We conclude that the People's Bank of China's policy of steady monetary growth appears to be appropriate. Our study offers important policy implications for China.

5000|$|The MOSFETs are n-type {{enhancement}} mode transistors, {{arranged in a}} so-called [...] "pull-down network" [...] (PDN) between the logic gate output and <b>negative</b> <b>supply</b> voltage (typically the ground). A pull up (i.e. a [...] "load" [...] that {{can be thought of}} as a resistor, see below) is placed between the positive supply voltage and each logic gate output. Any logic gate, including the logical inverter, can then be implemented by designing a network of parallel and/or series circuits, such that if the desired output for a certain combination of boolean input values is zero (or false), the PDN will be active, meaning that at least one transistor is allowing a current path between the <b>negative</b> <b>supply</b> and the output. This causes a voltage drop over the load, and thus a low voltage at the output, representing the zero.|$|E
