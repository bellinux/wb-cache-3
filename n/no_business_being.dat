He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, and I loved her very much. But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had <b>no</b> <b>business</b> <b>being</b> romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them." [...] Moby initially disliked the track, criticizing his production as [...] "mushy" [...] and his vocals as [...] "really weak". He had dismissed [...] "Porcelain" [...] as [...] "average" [...] and later recalled that he [...] "couldn't imagine anyone else wanting to listen to it" [...] – however, he was eventually talked into including it on Play.|$|E
500|$|The {{field of}} 34 drivers {{was the biggest}} in an IndyCar series race in 14 years. A typical oval track race has six to eight fewer drivers, except for the Indianapolis 500, which {{normally}} has a 33-car field. ESPN.com senior motorsports writer Terry Blount wrote: [...] "Obviously more cars presents more danger. They wanted {{a whole lot of}} cars cause obviously this is their season finale and they wanted it to be a big deal. Some of the people that were driving in this event yesterday had <b>no</b> <b>business</b> <b>being</b> in it. Some of them had never driven on a track like this. That was a mistake". Chris Powell, president of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, defended the race, saying that the circuit had passed all of the IndyCar Series' accreditation procedures and was deemed suitable for racing. He also went on the record to say that despite the media reporting the concerns of several drivers over the safety of the event, none of those concerns had been raised with him.|$|E

[...] Tamar Anitai, a blogger for MTV, said the episode was [...] "hilarious". He said [...] "The South Park writers actually appeared to sympathize, if not side with, the Jonas Brothers ... In the end, Disney and Christianity ended up getting a far more severe skewering than the Jonas Brothers." [...] Alan Sepinwall, television writer for The Star-Ledger, {{said he thought the}} Mickey Mouse character was used as an effective satirical device for corporate greed, but said he was not particularly impressed with the overall episode because [...] "its targets — the Jonas Brothers, and the Disney company for using them to sell sex to little girls with impunity — were so easy to hit". In contrast, Parents Television Council (PTC), criticized the episode for such elements, and they named this episode the [...] "Worst Cable Content of the Week".|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} nine hundred people {{attended}} the event. Canadian Online Explorer writer Mark Xamin rated the entire event a {{six out of}} ten, which was lower than the {{seven and a half}} out of ten given to the 2007 Final Resolution event by Chris Sokol, but equal with the second Final Resolution held in December 2008 given by Bryan and Chris Sokol. Final Resolution's rating was lower than TNA's previous event Turning Point, which was given a six and half out of ten. It was also lower than the seven and half given to TNA's next event Against All Odds. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's Royal Rumble PPV event held on January 27, Final Resolution was rated lower as Royal Rumble was given an eight out of ten by Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk. In Xamin's review two matches were rated an eight out of ten, his overall highest rating given in the review. The first was the TNA Women's Knockout Championship defense by Gail Kim against Awesome Kong in a No Disqualification match. Xamin felt it was an [...] "absolutely fantastic match" [...] and that they showed [...] "the world how good women's wrestling can be." [...] The second match given this score was the main event between Kurt Angle and Christian Cage for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Xamin felt it was a [...] "very solid match" [...] and that they put on a [...] "wrestling clinic." [...] The TNA World Tag Team Championship match and the Six Man Tag Team Ultimate X match were both rated six out of ten. Xamin stated that in the Tag Team Championship match [...] "Nash looked his age" [...] despite the efforts of Joe and Styles doing [...] "their best to carry the match"; although he felt it was still an [...] "entertaining segment." [...] Xamin also thought that due to Team 3D's creativity in the Ultimate X match they [...] "stole the show in a match they had <b>no</b> <b>business</b> <b>being</b> in." [...] Regarding the overall event, Xamin wrote that [...] "Final Resolution was more about advancing storylines and entertainment value than it was about watching good wrestling." [...] He also believed that Final Resolution had two [...] "stand-out matches (Gail Kim vs Awesome Kong and Angle vs Christian Cage)" [...] despite the rest of the card being [...] "lacklustre at best." ...|$|E

But we're still not there. We should have saved Rachel Corrie's life that day, either by sending out a spotter or delaying the bulldozer's work.

Sometime in 1945, Gein later recounted, he {{and his mother}} visited a man named Smith, who lived nearby, to {{purchase}} straw. According to Gein, Augusta witnessed Smith beating a dog. A woman inside the Smith home came outside and yelled to stop. Smith beat the dog to death. Augusta was extremely upset by this scene. What bothered her {{did not appear to be}} the brutality toward the dog but the presence of the woman. Augusta told Ed that the woman was not married to Smith so had <b>no</b> <b>business</b> <b>being</b> there. [...] "Smith's harlot", Augusta angrily called her. She had a second stroke soon after, and her health deteriorated rapidly. She died on December 29, 1945, at the age of 67.

60|$|It was {{flood tide}} when Daniel Quilp sat himself {{down in the}} ferry to cross to the {{opposite}} shore. A fleet of barges were coming lazily on, some sideways, some head first, some stern first; all in a wrong-headed, dogged, obstinate way, bumping up against the larger craft, running under the bows of steamboats, getting into every kind of nook and corner where they had <b>no</b> <b>business,</b> and <b>being</b> crunched on all sides like so many walnut-shells; while each with its pair of long sweeps struggling and splashing in the water looked like some lumbering fish in pain. In some of the vessels at anchor all hands were busily engaged in coiling ropes, spreading out sails to dry, taking in or discharging their cargoes; in others no life was visible but two or three tarry boys, and perhaps a barking dog running to and fro upon the deck or scrambling up {{to look over the}} side and bark the louder for the view. Coming slowly on through the forests of masts was a great steamship, beating the water in short impatient strokes with her heavy paddles as though she wanted room to breathe, and advancing in her huge bulk like a sea monster among the minnows of the Thames. On either hand were long black tiers of colliers; between them vessels slowly working out of harbour with sails glistening in the sun, and creaking noise on board, re-echoed from a hundred quarters. The water and all upon it was in active motion, dancing and buoyant and bubbling up; while the old grey Tower and piles of building on the shore, with many a church-spire shooting up between, looked coldly on, and seemed to disdain their chafing, restless neighbour.|$|R
