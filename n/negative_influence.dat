5|$|The Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an {{underground}} rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded {{him with his}} own record label, Shady Records, and he embarked on an extensive touring schedule to promote the album. In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the Vans Warped Tour and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a <b>negative</b> <b>influence</b> on American youth.|$|E

25|$|Holmestrand Municipal Council {{voted on}} 20 November 1900 {{in favor of}} a station at the square with a {{connection}} over Gausen, estimated to cost NOK43,000, including the connection line. Because this avoided running via the docks, this gave the lowest cost. Other alternatives cost as much as NOK154,000. However, NSB's district chief stated on 18 May 1901 that the state railways were opposed to this alternative because the link would have a <b>negative</b> <b>influence</b> on operations at Holmestrand Station.

In the U.S. alone, three of the band's albums have been awarded platinum status and three more went gold, and the band has had eight releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums.

Dick Lecter, the CEO of multi-industrial conglomerate LecterCorp, learns of Pootie Tang's positive influence on society — and his <b>negative</b> <b>influence</b> on LecterCorp's bottom line. After his henchmen and a vile villain named Dirty Dee are sent away by Pootie's friends, Lecter encourages his right-hand lady, Ireenie, to seduce Pootie Tang into signing an agreement with LecterCorp that would stop Pootie Tang's influence on America's children.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometry}} of the normal, open grid is evidently unsuitable for protecting or enhancing the social environment of a street from the <b>negative</b> <b>influence</b> of traffic. Similarly, a 1972 ground-breaking study by Oscar Newman on a Defensible Space Theory described {{ways to improve the}} social environment and security of neighbourhoods and streets. In a practical application of his theory at Five Oaks, the neighbourhood's grid pattern was modified to prevent through traffic and create identifiable smaller enclaves while maintaining complete pedestrian freedom of movement. The positive outcome of these changes reinforces Appleyard's findings and the need to reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, open grid.|$|E

The band was hopeful of success, but amid disastrous engagements at Chequers and the Whisky A Go Go, ran afoul of both the police and organised crime simultaneously. After unsuccessful album recording sessions in North Sydney, the group began to disintegrate, sacking Tek from TV Jones as a <b>negative</b> <b>influence.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} between free-run and pressed juice is that pressed juice often has lower acidity levels, higher potassium and pH level, more phenolic compounds such as tannins and more suspended solids such as natural gum and proteins. Some of these attributes can be positive {{influences on the}} wine with the increased phenolics offering more body, aroma characteristics (such as the varietal aromas from terpenes) and aging potential. Other attributes may have more <b>negative</b> <b>influence</b> such as increased astringency and bitterness, precursor for browning pigments in white wine, mouthfeel and balance issues (as well as potential microbial instability) from the increased pH and the enhance need for fining agents {{to assist in the}} clarification and stabilization of the wine with the increase in suspended solids.|$|E
25|$|Around a {{year after}} alcohol {{restrictions}} in the Valley came into place, in October 2008, a community meeting led by the MWRC and Nindilingarri Cultural Health Services gathered to talk about FASD and other problems related to alcohol.

ELT is a term that defines issues that have a <b>negative</b> <b>influence</b> on a child’s development, such as poor nutrition, neglect, stress and violence. In November 2008, Oscar jointly developed a draft strategy to fight these issues titled Overcoming Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and Early Life Trauma (ELT) in the Fitzroy Valley: a community initiative.|$|E

25|$|During 1932, {{there were}} {{significant}} problems of morale and discipline due to subversion within the 2nd Air Regiment near Sarajevo. Steady progress continued {{to be made in}} developing the air force, but several weaknesses were evident, including; lack of first-class aircraft, dependence on foreign sources for the bulk of aviation construction material, inadequate repair and maintenance facilities, the slow development of the home-grown aircraft industry, and the <b>negative</b> <b>influence</b> exerted by senior army officers with no aviation experience or knowledge. It was acknowledged that the air force had no difficulty in attracting high quality recruits, and the Sarajevo incident aside, that morale and discipline were high within the air arm. Two additional squadrons were added to each of the six air regiments during 1932. As a result, the number of aircraft in service increased to approximately 430, with a reserve of 300. The state factory at Kraljevo produced about 150 Breguet 19 aircraft during the year, with forty Potez 25s also being delivered from the Ikarus factory. Six bombers were obtained for evaluation during the year; two each from Junkers, Dornier and Fokker.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to {{the regular}} growth of the last years, Sicily is the eighth richest region of Italy in terms of total GDP (see List of Italian regions by GDP). A series of reforms and {{investments}} on agriculture such as the introduction of modern irrigation systems have made this important industry competitive. In the 1970s there was a growth of the industrial sector {{through the creation of}} some factories. In recent years the importance of the service industry has grown for the opening of several shopping malls and for a modest growth of financial and telecommunication activities. Tourism is an important source of wealth for the island thanks to its natural and historical heritage. Today Sicily is investing a large amount of money on structures of the hospitality industry, in order to make tourism more competitive. However, Sicily continues to have a GDP per capita below the Italian average and more unemployment than the rest of Italy. This difference is mostly caused by the <b>negative</b> <b>influence</b> of the Mafia that is still active in some areas although it is much weaker than in the past.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{forms in}} Chinese martial arts are {{intended}} to depict realistic martial techniques, the movements are not always identical to how techniques would be applied in combat. Many forms have been elaborated upon, {{on the one hand}} to provide better combat preparedness, {{and on the other hand}} to look more aesthetically pleasing. One manifestation of this tendency toward elaboration beyond combat application is the use of lower stances and higher, stretching kicks. These two maneuvers are unrealistic in combat and are used in forms for exercise purposes. Many modern schools have replaced practical defense or offense movements with acrobatic feats that are more spectacular to watch, thereby gaining favor during exhibitions and competitions. This has led to criticisms by traditionalists of the endorsement of the more acrobatic, show-oriented Wushu competition. Historically forms were often performed for entertainment purposes long before the advent of modern Wushu as practitioners have looked for supplementary income by performing on the streets or in theaters. Documentation in ancient literature during the Tang Dynasty (618–907) and the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1279) suggests some sets, (including two + person sets: dui da also called dui lian) became very elaborate and 'flowery', many mainly concerned with aesthetics. During this time, some martial arts systems devolved to the point that they became popular forms of martial art storytelling entertainment shows. This created an entire category of martial arts known as Hua Fa Wuyi. During the Northern Song period, it was noted by historians this type of training had a <b>negative</b> <b>influence</b> on training in the military.|$|E

25|$|On November 12, 2010, Rodríguez was {{involved}} in an incident where a pickup truck was partially damaged. He and a companion were burned, being initially attended {{at a hospital in}} Vega Baja, before both were transferred to the specialized burn care unit of Centro Médico in San Juan, where he was placed in preventive intubation to ease the stress on his lungs. Rodríguez suffered second degree burns in approximately 66% of his body, most of the damage focusing in his back and legs. Due to the incident, Rodríguez was removed from a scheduled dual, but was kept among the recipients of a grant issued by the COPUR. By late December he was already training two to three days per week, while admitted in the burn unit and still wearing bandages around one of his arms and both legs. His trainer, Orlando Rodríguez, noted that {{this was the first time}} that he worked with a pugilist while still recovering in a hospital. Consequently, a special regime was prepared to work on his footwork, speed and strength, while including other standard practices such as shadow boxing and pads. In his first interview since the incident, Rodríguez noted that he intended to focus on his career and education from that point onwards, severing ties with any <b>negative</b> <b>influence.</b> The following week, the possibility of infection was dismissed by the medical personnel, who allowed more contact with external items, including haircutting tools. Upon being released, the original plan was to participate in the qualification of the 2011 Pan American Games, but he received a negative report from Enrique Amy, chief doctor of the COPUR's Anti-Doping Commission. The amateur boxing federation followed the recommendation. Consequently, Rodríguez spent several months of additional recovery, focused on treatment to avoid re-injuring or infecting the scar tissue in his left arm.|$|E
