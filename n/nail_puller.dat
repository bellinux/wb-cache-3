25|$|As {{development}} {{began on}} the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the nail — head and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire <b>nail</b> <b>pull</b> out of the frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the less chance there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the nail's head while still making it compatible with popular nail gun models. After finding the ideal nail head size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire <b>nail</b> from <b>pulling</b> out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, {{it was noted that}} above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible to shearing. The final touch to the original prototype was a special high-carbon alloy designed by a metallurgist that had the perfect combination of stiffness and pliability, giving it the highest possible strength.|$|R

30|$|The {{resistance}} of nailed joints under single-shear loading {{is determined by}} various factors, e.g., bending properties of <b>nail,</b> <b>pull</b> out strength of nail from wood, nail-head pull-through resistance. In addition, the combination of plywood embedment and solid wood embedment resistances {{is also one of}} the important factors for it; however, the above studies [22 – 25] did not ignore the resistance produced by solid wood. The authors posit that only the resistance produced in plywood should be considered to clarify the influence of the grain direction of plywood. Some studies have conducted embedment tests on plywood specimens [18, 26, 27], and Kamada [28] showed the experimental data of the two grain directions (i.e., the grain direction of surface veneer was parallel or perpendicular to the load direction) using 3 -ply plywood made of larch. According to his data, the higher stiffness was observed when the grain direction of surface veneer was parallel to the loading direction, whereas almost same maximum load was observed in the two. In this study, an embedment test was conducted on plywood specimens with grain directions of surface veneers that are parallel and perpendicular to the load direction. Moreover, to understand the resisting mechanism of plywood precisely, the method for calculating the resistance–deformation relationship exhibited by individual parallel and perpendicular veneers was proposed.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} response {{and performance of}} connections are particularly important to assess the vulnerability of timber-framed structures to windstorms. Finite element (FE) analysis using ABAQUS (6. 12 - 3) software is {{used in this study}} to determine the {{structural response}} and uplift capacities of typical roof to wall connections. Results (i. e. force-displacement relationship and failure modes) of the FE model were compared with experimental tests and the model validated from the test results. The FE model accounts for large deformation as well as the contact between nail and timber through the elastic and post-elastic phases up to failure. The dominant failure modes observed are nails and framing anchor bending, and <b>nail</b> <b>pull</b> out. The FE model produced structural responses and uplift capacities that generally agree with the experimental results. Construction defects (i. e. missing nails) in a roof to wall connection influences the design uplift capacity. Nails located near the centre line of the loading action in a triple grip connection (i. e. common roof to wall connection used in the timber-framed house of Australia) significantly affect the stiffness of this connection. The response of these nails dominated the uplift capacity and failure types of triple grip connection to loading. Missing a nail in both truss and top-plate in the triple grip connection reduces the design uplift capacity by 40...|$|R

25|$|Starting at {{the bottom}} of the nail, the ring shanks on the lower half of the nail are {{enhanced}} with angular barbs, which add maximum resistance to the <b>nail</b> being <b>pulled</b> out. The middle of the nail has no extra features, which leaves the section most likely to be damaged during an earthquake thicker and least prone to damage. The area directly below the head of the nail features a spiral-style shank used to enhance the nail's strength in holding boards together. This enhancement keeps boards that are nailed together from moving around under nature's forces and overall weakening the joints. The final feature of this nail is the nail head, which is 25% larger than the average, allowing it to be more resistant to being pulled completely through attached pieces of wood.|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of field pullout tests on soil nails {{have been carried out}} to provide {{valuable}} information for enhancing the understanding of pullout resistance of soil-grout interface and for reliability evaluation of soil-nailed slopes. In this paper, a data set of 167 field pullout tests performed in 23 nailed completely decomposed granite cut slopes is used for a statistical evaluation of four factors influencing the pullout resistance of soil nails, namely overburden pressure, grout length, soil suction, and soil dilatancy. For the tests in which <b>nails</b> were <b>pulled</b> out, the measured pullout resistance is essentially independent of the effective overburden pressure. A bias factor r(*) is defined as the ratio of the measured pullout resistance and the calculated value using a design equation. The mean value of r(*) is 4. 30 and the coefficient of variation is 47 %. When the uncertainties in grout length, soil suctions around nails, and the soil shear dilatancy are considered, the mean value of r(*) can finally be reduced to 0. 99. The quantification of the uncertainties provides a better physical understanding of the working mechanisms of soil nails...|$|R

2500|$|Independent {{tests of}} the nail's stretch were {{conducted}} by several organizations, including Florida International University and the International Code Council. Those tests confirmed what the researchers at Bostitch had claimed, that they had created a better nail. Among all of the different tests, {{it was found that}} the new nail had twice the [...] "uplift capacity" [...] of other power driven nails, as well as increasing a home's resistance to wind and increasing earthquake resistance by up to 50%. For further testing, Sutt asked for the assistance of Scott Schiff, the coordinator of the graduate program in civil engineering and engineering mechanics at Clemson University. Tests at the Clemson Wind Load Test Facility confirmed what had already been stated. With equipment to simulate the force of winds, roofs attached with traditional <b>nails</b> were <b>pulled</b> apart at around 13,500 pounds of force (60.1 kN). At forces up to 16,000 pounds (71kN), walls built with the HurriQuake environment nail showed minimal wall movement. As the pressure increased to 17,000 pounds (75kN), then 18,000 (80kN), then 19,000 (85kN), the walls began to make creaking and groaning noises but they still stayed attached. As the test rig pushed 20,000 pounds (89kN), the maximum it was capable of testing, it gave out, showing that the HurriQuake environment nail sustained 20,000 pounds of force (89kN) and still was not sheared or completely pulled out.|$|R
40|$|A design {{methodology}} for earthquake resistant plywood sheathed shear walls is presented. The sheathing nailing is {{selected as the}} ductile load limiting element, whereby the large displacement demands imposed during an earthquake can be sustained without failure of the timber members in bending, shear or tension. Analytical models for predicting the elastic behaviour and ultimate strength of shear walls are formulated {{in order to develop}} the design procedure. An experimental study of nailed sheathed joints was undertaken, and showed that such joints were able to sustain large reverse cycles well into the inelastic range. Complementary to the experimental study, an analytical strength model for nailed joints is described, and identifies nail diameter, nail length and nail coating as being the variables most influential on joint strength. Eleven full scale plywood sheathed shear walls were subjected to reverse cyclic quasi-static loading and shaketable excitation. The performance of the sheathing nailing, framing connections and anchorage connections is reported in detail. The test walls exhibited progressive stiffness degradation resulting in pinched hysteresis loops, prior to failure through the <b>nail</b> heads <b>pulling</b> through the plywood, or the nail point withdrawing from the framing. A theoretical time-history single degree of freedom idealisation is described to predict the dynamic response of shear walls. Theoretical predictions compared well with the experimental shaketable behaviour of the full scale test walls. The displacement demands on shear walls which exhibited pinched hysteresis loops are compared with the corresponding displacement demands on an elastoplastic structure...|$|R
