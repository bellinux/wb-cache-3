50|$|Usually during {{removal of}} the pattern from the mold cavity, the pattern is rapped all around the faces, in order to {{facilitate}} easy removal. In this process, the final cavity is enlarged. To compensate for this, the pattern dimensions need to be reduced. There are no standard values for this allowance, as it is heavily dependent on the personnel. This allowance is a <b>negative</b> <b>allowance,</b> and a common way of going around this allowance is to increase the draft allowance. Shaking of the pattern causes an enlargement of the mould cavity and results in a bigger casting.|$|E

40|$|Celiac {{disease is}} a lifelong {{disorder}} characterised by permanent intolerance to gluten and typical inflammatory changes in the small intestine. These changes lead to malabsorption of all nutrients, minerals, vitamins and water. The first attack of this disorder mostly occurs in childhood because the small intestine is greatly stressed by other nutrition supply. The only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet. This thesis, called Primary, secondary and tertiary prevention in children with celiac disease, consists of two parts; a theory part for which both professional publications and internet have been used and an empirical part, that comprises research itself with its results. The research target of this thesis was the sector of celiac disease occurring in children. Within the research, there were determined four objectives. The first objective was {{about to find out}} how primary, secondary and tertiary prevention is provided to children with celiac disease in GP ambulances for children and teenagers. Another task was to trace what profits the regime education brings to parents of children having celiac disease. We also dealt with the impact of the disease on the life of the child, his/her family and surrounding society. Then we investigated whether respondents take the help from outside, state support, institutions and in-kind assistance. In the empirical part of the thesis we used a method of qualitative research. For this research we chose a method of questionings through individual semi-structured interviews with two groups of respondents. The first group was made of nine nurses working in GP ambulances for children and teenagers having celiac disease. The second group was formed by nine children with celiac disease and their parents. The outcome of the research indicates that for quality health care supply it is important to obtain family anamnesis, carry out regular physicals in stated intervals within growth measurement monitoring and breastfeeding education and add other nutrition to diet. Monitoring suspicious symptoms, such as failure to thrive, inexplicable weight loss, growth retardation, abdominal pain, recurrent diarrhoea, digestive discomfort, dermatitis, stomatitis, anaemia, can soon detect celiac disorder. The secondary prevention is expressed by the work of nurses, such as biological material analysis, education, advice, help and support. Great urgency is given to risk factor monitoring, such as diabetes mellitus, Down syndrome, thyroid disorder, or genetic predispositions. The tertiary prevention is focused on the adaptation support of the child and his/her family to this chronic disorder, normal growth, and whole constitution examining and complication prevention. The outcomes indicate that the biggest problem of celiac people is financial burden of gluten-free food and also frequent limits in out-of- home eating. The financial burden of the diet influences, for example, vacation planning. It is necessary for the society to respect their disease, for example, canteens and teachers should have knowledge of the diet restrictions and provide suitable feeding. Furthermore, our findings show that only few families use financial support, because they are afraid of <b>negative</b> <b>allowance</b> examination because of their comfortable income. They mainly use allowance from Health Insurance Companies. On the grounds of the acquired information has been created an informative handout for the parents of the children with the celiac disease. The results of our research will be provided to the nurses who work in general practitioner ambulances...|$|E
50|$|Several {{fundamental}} questions of finance are {{connected with the}} taxation of income and have been dealt with by English practice. Small incomes claim lenient treatment; and, as mentioned above, this leniency means in England complete freedom. Again, earned incomes appear to represent lower ability to pay than unearned ones. Long refused on practical grounds (as by Gladstone and Lowe), the concession of an abatement of 25% on earned incomes of £2,000 and under was granted in 1907. The question whether savings should be exempt from taxation as income has (with the exception of life insurance premiums) been decided in the <b>negative.</b> <b>Allowances</b> for depreciation and cost of repairs are partially recognized.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAllowances {{have been}} {{developed}} for future rise of relative sea-level (i. e. sea level relative to the land) based on the projections of regional sea-level rise, its uncertainty, and the statistics of tides and storm surges (storm tides). An ‘allowance’ is, in this case, the vertical distance that an asset needs to be raised under a rising sea level, so that the present likelihood of flooding does not increase. This continues the work of Hunter (2012), which presented allowances based on global-average sea level and local storm tides. The inclusion of regional variations of sea-level rise (and its uncertainty) significantly increases the global spread of allowances. For the period 1990 – 2100 and the A 1 FI emission scenario (which the world is broadly following at present), these range from <b>negative</b> <b>allowances</b> caused by land uplift (in the northern regions of North America and Europe) to the upper 5 -percentile which is greater than about 1 m (e. g. on the eastern coastline of North America) ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{this ideal}} {{condition}} would in practice only be approximated and would generally require wrench-assisted assembly, possibly causing the galling of the threads. For this reason, some allowance, or minimum difference, between the PDs {{of the internal}} and external threads has to generally be provided for, to eliminate the possibility of deviations from the ideal thread form causing interference and to expedite hand assembly up to the length of engagement. Such allowances, or fundamental deviations, as ISO standards call them, are provided for in various degrees in corresponding classes of fit for ranges of thread sizes. At one extreme, no allowance is provided by a class, but the maximum PD of the external thread is specified to be the same as the minimum PD of the internal thread, within specified tolerances, ensuring that the two can be assembled, with some looseness of fit still possible due to the margin of tolerance. A class called interference fit may even provide for <b>negative</b> <b>allowances,</b> where the PD of the screw is greater than the PD of the nut by at least the amount of the allowance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the methodology of}} computing sea-level rise allowances for Atlantic Canada in the 21 st century under conditions of uncertain sea-level rise. The sea-level rise allowances are defined as the amount by which an asset needs to be raised {{in order to maintain}} the same likelihood of future flooding events as that site has experienced in the recent past. The allowances are determined by combination of the statistics of present tides and storm surges (storm tides) and the regional projections of sea-level rise and associated uncertainty. Tide-gauge data for nine sites from the Canadian Atlantic coast are used to derive the scale parameters of present sea-level extremes using the Gumbel distribution function. The allowances in the 21 st century, with respect to the year 1990, were computed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A 1 FI emission scenario. For Atlantic Canada, the allowances are regionally variable and, for the period 1990 – 2050, range between – 13 and 38 cm while, for the period 1990 – 2100, they range between 7 and 108 cm. The <b>negative</b> <b>allowances</b> in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence region are caused by land uplift due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) ...|$|R
40|$|Taking a {{benchmark}} scenario, {{the current situation}} in Switzerland, and using a microsimulation technique, we compare the effectiveness of various income maintenance schemes for reducing inequality and poverty. A full <b>negative</b> income tax <b>allowance</b> designed to eliminate poverty is shown to reduce income inequality most drastically. An integrated federal linear tax rate of 62 percent is required to make it viable. Aggregate work hours are reduced by approximately 10 percent and average disposable income falls by 9. 3 pecent under such circumstances. A participation income restricted to adults in employment and covering 50 percent of subsistence costs is however shown to result in an unambiguous social welfare improvement over the current situation in Switzerland...|$|R
5000|$|Tax codes {{followed}} by the letter L represent the size of tax free personal allowance on earnings. This is {{the total amount of}} money, per year, one can earn tax free. The number attached to them represents tax free earnings divided by 10. In the tax year 2013/2014 the standard tax free allowance on income is £9440, which means the standard code, and the emergency tax code is 944L. [...] Persons over 65 and 75 have an increased personal allowance.Tax free Personal allowances can only be taken once across earnings. A second job or a job with a pension is taxed at a basic rate of 20%, or the tax allowance can be split across both sources of income.Non-standard codes are used when usual tax free allowances do not apply. Where no allowances exist, code BR is used to tax at basic rate (20%), and code D0 is used to tax at higher rate (40%). If no tax is to be collected, code NT is used. If tax has to be collected on an income above PAYE earnings, a K code is used. This works as equivalent to a <b>negative</b> tax <b>allowance.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper investigates {{mechanized}} bucking of conifers with {{a processor}} {{mounted on a}} cable crane system in the mountain conditions of the Alpine foothills. It analyses the measurement accuracy of various log types and explains {{its effect on the}} market price of these products. In the studied area, trees were felled by chain saw and the full-tree method was used to skid the felled trees to the cable yarder site using the Syncrofalke cable crane with a mounted Woody H 60 processor head. Further wood processing operations were carried out at the yarder site. Length measurement accuracy was illustrated through the frequency distribution and the modus of various lengths. The share of logs within a 5 cm interval - modus - (the best five) was 54. 3 %. The difference between the nominal log length and the minimum required length resulted in a loss of 4. 38 % of the total log value. Further more, it was established that {{the first quarter of the}} stem actually contained 64 % of the total stem value. This means that the first cross-cut was responsible for nearly 50 % of the total loss and the second crosscut pushed the figure to 80 %. The present research only considered the losses incurred either by positive or <b>negative</b> cross-cut <b>allowance</b> or by insufficiently accurate length measurement of a certain log type...|$|R
40|$|Cap {{and trade}} {{programs}} impose limits on industry emissions but offer individual firms {{the flexibility to}} choose among different operational levers toward compliance, including inputs, process changes, {{and the use of}} allowances to account for emissions. In this paper, we examine the relationships among (1) levers for compliance (at-source pollution prevention, end-of-pipe pollution control, and the use of allowances); (2) environmental performance; and (3) firm market performance for the context of stringent cap and trade regulation with allowance grandfathering (i. e., the allocation of allowances for free). To investigate these relationships, we use data on publicly traded utility firms operating coal-fired generating units regulated by the U. S. Acid Rain Program from three principal sources: the U. S. Energy Information Administration, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Compustat database. Our results indicate a significant relationship between better environmental performance and lower firm market performance over at least a three-year period. From a regulatory perspective, our results show a <b>negative</b> association between <b>allowance</b> grandfathering and firm environmental performance. Overall, by explicitly considering the context of stringent regulation, we find a counter-example to the view that better environmental performance generally associates with better economic performance...|$|R
