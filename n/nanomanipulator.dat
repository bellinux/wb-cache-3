Besides, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is appropriate for the studies of synthetic polymer molecules. AFM provides a unique possibility of 3D visualization of polymer chains. For instance, AFM tapping mode is gentle enough for the recording of adsorbed polyelectrolyte molecules (for example, 0.4 nm thick chains of poly(2-vinylpyridine)) under liquid medium. The location of two-chain-superposition correspond in these experiments to twice the thickness of single chain (0.8 nm {{in the case of}} the mentioned example). At the application of proper scanning parameters, conformation of such molecules remain unchanged for hours that allows the performance of experiments under liquid media having various properties., Furthermore, by controlling the force between the tip and the sample high resolution images can be obtained.Optical tweezers have also been used to study and quantify DNA-protein interactions.|$|R

Nanowire pick-place has been typically performed via teleoperation, which is time-consuming and highly skill-dependent. This paper presents an au-tomated approach to the pick-place of single nanowires. Through SEM visual detection and vision-based motion control, the system automatically transferred individual silicon nanowires from their growth substrate to a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device that characterized the nanowires’s electromechanical prop-erties. The performance of the nanorobotic pick-up and placement procedures was experimentally quantified. Note to Practitioners—Manipulation of single nanowires or nanotubes is important for their characterization and nanodevice construction. Joystick-based teleoperation of <b>nanomanipulators</b> installed inside a SEM is a commonly used approach for the pick-place of individual nanowires/nanotubes. Nevertheless, the manual process is tedious and time-consuming, even for skilled operators.

40|$|Abstract — Current {{research}} {{work on the}} development of a nanohandling robot station for automated characterization of biological cells is presented. The station consists of a sample piezo scanning stage with three degrees of freedom (DoF) and a three-axes <b>nanomanipulator</b> that is equipped with a piezoresistive atomic force microscope (AFM) probe as an endeffector. Thus, the endeffector can be used both to measure mechanical properties of the sample and as a force sensor giving a feedback signal to the underlying control sys-tem. While the endeffector can be positioned coarsely by the <b>nanomanipulator,</b> fine positioning of the sample is performed by the piezo stage. As a visual sensor for the station an inverted optical microscope is utilized. The setup is enhanced by a second nano-manipulator equipped with a pipette for injection/extraction tasks or patch clamp purposes. Alterna-tively, a second piezoresistive AFM probe can be used as an endeffector for the second <b>nanomanipulator.</b> The station pro-vides the opportunity to automatically determine a region-of-interest (i. e. a single cell) by means of object recognition in previously acquired images from the optical microscope. Next, the endeffector is brought into proximity to the sample, and an automated, mechanical characterization of the cell is performed. First experiments cover recordings of single force-distance curves to gain information on elasticity and adhesion of the cell. Using the fast piezo stage, complete adhesion or elasticity maps of the region-of-interest can be obtained. This mechanical characterization delivers valuable information about cell mechanics concerning cell to cell contact or cell motility. It is also of interest in oncology, since tumor cells tend to have a different elasticity than healthy cells. The use of a second <b>nanomanipulator</b> surpasses the capabilities of a standard AFM system, since it enables the station to cover areas as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction, measurements of reactions to drug injection or electrophysiological measurements of stress activated ion channels.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in microtechnology {{and the development}} of new electronics and micro/nanosystem devices in automotive industry, communication sector and life science have led to a strong need in material characterization on the micro and nano scale. Defects occurring due to thermal or mechanical material mismatches have to be analyzed by suitable methods. If they cannot be avoided completely, e. g. microcracks in materials or at interfaces, evaluation of their effect on reliabilty of the component is inevitable. In addition, the development and evaluation of interface concepts of biological structures to microelectronic materials such as polymers, metals, ceramics and semi-conducting materials will be a fundamental challenge. To fulfil these needs new strategies for reliability assessment on the submicron scale are essential. Under this prerequisite Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) serves {{as the basis for the}} development of the nanoDAC method (nano Deformation Analysis by Correlation), which allows the determination and evaluation of 2 D displacement fields based on SPM data. In-situ SPM scans of the analyzed object are carried out at different thermo-mechanical load states as shown in Fig. 1. In the illustrated case a Scanning Force Microscopy topography signal serves as the imaging technique. It is also possible to use other SPM image sources such as Phase Detection Microscopy or Ultrasonic Force Microscopy. The obtained images are compared utilizing digital image correlation (DIC) based on grayscale cross correlation algorithms. This allows the tracking of local image patterns (compare to Fig. 1) of the analyzed surface structure. The measurement results of the nanoDAC technique are full-field displacement fields. For the images of Fig. 1 the determined vertical (crack opening) displacement field is illustrated in Fig. 2. The nanoDAC method is suited for measurement of mechanical properties such as fracture properties, Young?s modulus, Coefficient of Thermal Expansion, Poisson?s ratio. Furthermore the technique should be used for tracking of structures or particles driven by diffusion processes or <b>nanomanipulators.</b> Future generations of SPM equipment will provide modes for observation of dynamic processes. The nanoDAC method will be a useful tool for evaluation of time-dependent processes observed by in-situ SPM techniques. In addition to the nanoDAC method the fibDAC method will be presented. With the fibDAC (Focused Ion Beam based Deformation Analysis by Correlation) method the classical hole drilling method for stress release measurement has been downscaled to the nanoscale. The ion beam of the FIB station is used as a milling tool which causes the stress release at silicon microstructures of MEMS devices (Fig. 3). The analysis of the stress release is achieved by DIC applied to load state SEM images captured in cross beam equipment (combination of SEM and FIB). The results of the DIC analysis are deformation fields which are transferred to stress solution by application of finite element analysis. In another step the resolution of the method has been improved by the application of trench milling instead of milling of holes. Thereby deformation measurements in the nm range are established. With the presented methods the basis is provided for an experimental reliability analysis of MEMS/NEMS and nanodevices.

The <b>nanomanipulator</b> was driven by a piezomotor and could move around all three axes to a maximum distance of 120  mm. To measure the load applied to the nanomaterial, a force sensor (Klocke) similar to an AFM tip was attached to the front side of the <b>nanomanipulator.</b> By using the attached force sensor, a single MWCNT filament selected from among a bundle of MWCNTs was attached to the force sensor using carbon deposition and was drawn out from the bundle. The carbon deposition process was continued until the surface of the MWCNT bundle was sufficiently covered. For firm fixation, carbon deposition was continued for 1  h. The end of the MWCNT filament that was drawn out was attached to the jig such that both ends of the MWCNT were firmly fixed. As shown in Fig.  4 d II, the force sensor was moved {{along the length of the}} MWCNT such that the MWCNT received a tensile load and eventually broke. Figure  4 d III shows the stress–strain curve of an MWCNT grown by the arc-discharge method and an MWCNT grown by the thermal CVD method, indicating that the mechanical properties of MWCNTs vary depending on the growth method. Moreover, the rate of resistance change regarding the tensile deformation of the CNT was measured in this study [81]. In this case, instead of a force sensor, an Au-coated tungsten tip was attached to the <b>nanomanipulator.</b> Feedthrough was used to connect the tungsten tip installed inside the SEM to an external measurement program and multimeter. By utilizing the same method, the MWCNT was fixed. While moving the tungsten tip along the length of the MWCNT, tensile stress was applied, increasing the electric resistance. The electric sensitivity of the MWCNT was thereby calculated.|$|E

Optical video microscopy allows a fast recognition of the sample and exact positioning of the AFM tip in the particular region of interest, while UV-laser ablation offers the possibility of noncontact manipulation {{of a wide range of}} materials, including biological specimens. Two different control approaches have been implemented in the <b>NanoManipulator</b> system: (i) automated control using a vector-scan module, and (ii) interactive control based on the use of a haptic interface. Using the <b>NanoManipulator,</b> the two different standard AFM lithography techniques based on dynamic methods (namely dynamic and modulated plowing) are compared by performing nanopatterning on thin resist films. The results reflect that modulated plowing, where the AFM tip is in permanent contact with the resist surface while the force is being modulated, offers the highest reliability, minimizing undesired side effects. The isolation and extraction of localized regions of human metaphase chromosomes represents a promising alternative to standard methods for the analysis of genetic material. The <b>NanoManipulator</b> is an excellent tool for such application, as it is here illustrated by comparing AFM based mechanical dissection and noncontact ablation on side by side chromosomes. The results are analyzed in situ using AFM imaging, revealing the high precision of mechanical dissection. Acoustical force nanolithography is a novel method for AFM based lithography where the cantilever is actuated using an acoustic wave coupled through the sample surface. The influence of acoustic wave frequency and magnitude, along with the preloading force of the cantilever are studied in detail. Acoustical force nanolithography can be used as a stand alone method or as a complement for the fine adjustment of manipulation forces...|$|E

40|$|Scanning probe {{imaging and}} {{manipulation}} of matter is of crucial importance for nanoscale science and technology. However, its resolution {{and ability to}} manipulate matter at the atomic scale is limited by rather poor control over the fine structure of the probe. In the present communication, a strategy is proposed to construct a molecular <b>nanomanipulator</b> from ultrathin single-walled carbon nanotubes. Covalent modification of a nanotube cap at predetermined atomic sites makes the nanotube act as a support for a functional "tool-tip" molecule. Then, a small bundle of nanotubes (3 or 4) with aligned ends can act as an extremely high aspect ratio parallel <b>nanomanipulator</b> for a suspended molecule, where protraction or retraction of individual nanotubes results in controlled tilting of the tool-tip in two dimensions. Together with the usual SPM three degrees of freedom and augmented with rotation of {{the system as a}} whole, the design offers six degrees of freedom for imaging and manipulation of matter with precision and freedom so much needed for advanced nanotechnology. A similar design might be possible to implement with other high-aspect ratio nanostructures, such as oxide nanowires. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures, 2 table...|$|E

40|$|Until {{there is}} greater {{consensus}} on proposals for realizing better-than-best-effort services on the Internet, developers of multimedia and distributed virtual environment applications {{must rely on}} best-effort media adaptations to ameliorate the effects of network congestion. We present {{the results of a}} study on the use of adaptations originally developed for audio and video applications for the data-flows generated by the UNC <b>nanoManipulator.</b> The <b>nanoManipulator</b> is a virtual environment interface to a scanned-probe microscope that has been used by scientists as a tool for basic research in the material and biological sciences. We are building a distributed version of the system for operation over the Internet and are investigating media adaptations for realizing application performance requirements. The results of early experiments with audio and videocentric media adaptations applied to the flows generated by a microscope and a haptic force feedback device are promising. A simple forward error correction scheme provides good recovery from packet loss and an elastic display-queue management scheme limits the impact of delay-jitter and results in more continuous playout of media samples. These preliminary results provide evidence that a sophisticated virtual environment interface can operate over modest distances over the Internet to control a remote microscope in real-time...|$|E
