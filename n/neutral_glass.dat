40|$|The {{form of the}} {{low-temperature}} {{interactions between}} defects in <b>neutral</b> <b>glasses</b> is reconsidered. We analyse the case where the defects can be modelled either as simple 2 -level tunneling systems, or tunneling rotational impurities. The coupling to strain fields is determined up to 2 nd order in the displacement field. It is shown that the linear coupling generates not only the usual $ 1 /r^ 3 $ Ising-like interaction between the rotational tunneling defect modes, which cause them to freeze around a temperature $T_G$, but also a random field term. At lower temperatures the inversion symmetric tunneling modes are still active - however the coupling of these to the frozen rotational modes, now via the 2 nd-order coupling to phonons, generates another random field term acting on the inversion symmetric modes (as well as shorter-range $ 1 /r^ 5 $ interactions between them). Detailed expressions for all these couplings are given. Comment: 12 pages, 2 figures. Minor modifications, published versio...|$|R
40|$|Unilateral {{visuospatial}} deficits {{have been}} observed in children with brain damage. While the effectiveness of prism adaptation for treating unilateral neglect in adult stroke patients has been demonstrated previously, the usefulness of prism adaptation in a pediatric population is still unknown. The present study aims at evaluating the feasibility of prism adaptation in children with unilateral brain lesion and comparing the validity of a game procedure designed for child-friendly paediatric intervention, with the ecological task used for prism adaptation in adult patients. Methods: Twenty-one children with unilateral brain lesion randomly were assigned to a prism group wearing prismatic glasses, or a control group wearing <b>neutral</b> <b>glasses</b> during a bimanual task intervention. All children performed two different bimanual tasks on randomly assigned consecutive days: ecological tasks or game tasks. The efficacy of prism adaptation was measured by assessing its after-effects with visual open loop pointing (visuoproprioceptive test) and subjective straight-ahead pointing (proprioceptive test). Results: Game tasks and ecological tasks produced similar after-effects. Prismatic glasses elicited a significant shift of visuospatial coordinates which was not observed in the control group. Conclusion: Prism adaptation performed with game tasks seems an effective procedure to obtain after-effects in children with unilateral brain lesion. The usefulness of repetitive prism adaptation sessions as a therapeutic intervention in children with visuospatial deficits and/or neglect, should be investigated in future studies.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{bioactive}} glasses can cause a significant increase in pH due to the rapid release of calcium and/or sodium ions. Consequently, preconditioning of the glass is usually required prior to surgery to negate the effect of this sudden release of ions. However, preconditioning for several days is far from ideal and also preconditioning is not practical for novel organic/inorganic sol-gel hybrids currently being developed since the organic phase will start to hydrolyze and dissolve. This study describes a bioactive glass that dissolves without causing a significant change in pH from physiologically optimal values and requires no preconditioning prior to use. The bioactivity of the pH <b>neutral</b> <b>glass,</b> hydroxyapatite formation, and cellular responses, are measured and compared directly with results from archetypal 45 S 5 and S 70 C 30 bioactive glasses. A hydroxyapatite layer was found to rapidly form (within 1 day) {{on the surface of the}} pH <b>neutral</b> <b>glass</b> upon reacting with simulated body fluid. In addition, improved cell compatibility was observed compared with 45 S 5 and S 70 C 30 glasses. Therefore, this pH <b>neutral</b> <b>glass</b> has significant potential for bone repair applications...|$|E

Unless otherwise stated, a standard procedure was used to distribute the material into individual ampoules. The procedure was as follows. Upon receipt by the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), London, materials were stored temporarily in the dark at a temperature of - 10 °C or lower, and protected from moisture. At a convenient time they were brought back to room temperature, mixed, and distributed into individual <b>neutral</b> <b>glass</b> ampoules so that each ampoule contained 50 - 100 mg of powder. If it was known that the material was light-sensitive non-actinic glass ampoules were used. After exhaustive drying in vacuum over phosphorus(V) oxide, the ampoules were either constricted (up to 1963) or fitted with capillary leak plugs, dried for a further period under the same conditions, filled with dry nitrogen, and sealed by fusion of the glass.

40|$|Unilateral neglect is a {{disabling}} syndrome frequently observed following {{right hemisphere}} brain damage. Symptoms range from visuo-motor impairments through to deficient visuo-spatial imagery, but impairment can also affect the auditory modality. A {{short period of}} adaptation to a rightward prismatic shift of the visual field is known to improve {{a wide range of}} hemispatial neglect symptoms, including visuo-manual tasks, mental imagery, postural imbalance, visuo-verbal measures and number bisection. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess whether the beneficial effects of prism adaptation may generalize to auditory manifestations of neglect. Auditory extinction, whose clinical manifestations are independent of the sensory modalities engaged in visuo-manual adaptation, was examined in neglect patients before and after prism adaptation. Two separate groups of neglect patients (all of whom exhibited left auditory extinction) underwent prism adaptation: one group (n = 6) received a classical prism treatment ('Prism' group), the other group (n = 6) was submitted to the same procedure, but wore <b>neutral</b> <b>glasses</b> creating no optical shift (placebo 'Control' group). Auditory extinction was assessed by means of a dichotic listening task performed three times: prior to prism exposure (pre-test), upon prism removal (0 h post-test) and 2 h later (2 h post-test). The total number of correct responses, the lateralization index (detection asymmetry between the two ears) and the number of left-right fusion errors were analysed. Our results demonstrate that prism adaptation can improve left auditory extinction, thus revealing transfer of benefit to a sensory modality that is orthogonal to the visual, proprioceptive and motor modalities directly implicated in the visuo-motor adaptive process. The observed benefit was specific to the detection asymmetry between the two ears and did not affect the total number of responses. This indicates a specific effect of prism adaptation on lateralized processes rather than on general arousal. Our results suggest that the effects of prism adaptation can extend to unexposed sensory systems. The bottom-up approach of visuo-motor adaptation appears to interact with higher order brain functions related to multisensory integration and can have beneficial effects on sensory processing in different modalities. These findings should stimulate the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at bypassing the affected sensory processing modality by adapting other sensory modalities. © The Author 2010...|$|R

The constraints of similarity have been investigated and discussed, {{and the use of}} sodium liquor as a cold modelling solution has been developed. Methylene Blue and Sulphacid Brill Pink are used as delineators, and a technique for analysing the concentration of each even in a mixture has been developed. The residence/time distributions from the model have been simulated using a mixed model computer program which identifies the nature and size of the most significant flow streams within the furnace. The results clearly show that the model gives a true representation of the furnace and illustrates a number of alternatives for operating or design changes which will lead to improved production efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} two recent publications that have struck a deep chord {{in the intellectual}} life of Australia. Rarely could it {{be the case that}} the almost simultaneous publication of a legal and then an historical tract has led to such a strong debate {{about the nature of the}} disciplines of law and history. In his widely reproduced article on judicial activism Justice Heydon gave an intellectual fillip to legal positivism by arguing that a neutral and autonomous concept of law was a precondition for the operation of the rule of law. Keith Windschuttle's history of frontier conflict between whites and Aborigines in colonial Tasmania became an overnight publishing sensation and a reaffirmation of the positivist precept that an historian was a <b>neutral</b> looking <b>glass</b> whose craft was based on historical facts that were separate from the political and philosophical presuppositions of the observer. This article lowers the disciplinary drawbridge between law and history by challenging the methodological framework of Justice Heydon and Keith Windschuttle. It argues that Justice Heydon and Keith Windschuttle are kindred spirits joined at the intellectual hip by a method that espouses impartiality, but in practice operates to produce judicial decisions and historical judgments that are a condensation of a particular brand of politics and philosophy. In sum, these two thinkers have only ideological illusions to offer in the fields of law and history. 33 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Thermal algae in {{alkaline}} {{hot springs}} of Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming) grow as compact mats in which self-shading is extensive, {{as shown by}} measurement by autoradiog-raphy of photosynthetic activity of cells at different levels in the mat. The effect of light intensity on photosynthesis of the algal mats was studied using neutral density filters during incubation with l”CO Despite the intense sunlight at the altitude of Yellowstone, light inhibition by full sur$ght was observed only occasionally; the rate of photosynthesis fell progressively with decreasing light, although the most efficient use was at 7 - 14 s of full sunlight. Later, the light intensity over portions of the algal mats was reduced to 18 % of full sunlight by installing <b>neutral</b> density <b>glass</b> plates, and changes of chlorophyll content, cell number, and response of photosynthesis to light intensity were determined over the next year. Although the chlorophyll content of the algae at {{the surface of the}} mat rose quickly, the chlorophyll content of the mat as a whole rose slowly or not at all; the photosynthetic response of the algal mats to full and reduced sunlight also changed slowly or not at all. Although individual algal cells can adapt rapidly to changes in light, the entire population, because of its existence in compact mats, adapts slowly. At the latitude of Yellowstone there is sufficient light throughout the year to enable algal growth to occur even at temperatures near the upper limit at which blue-green algae can grow; in Iceland, hot spring algae cannot grow during several winter months. Natural ultraviolet radiation neither inhibited nor stimulated photosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|Maladaptive disgust {{responses}} are tenacious and resistant to exposure-based interventions. In a similar vein, laboratory {{studies have shown}} that conditioned disgust is relatively insensitive to Conditioned Stimulus (CS) -only extinction procedures. The relatively strong resistance to extinction might be explained by disgust’s adaptive function to motivate avoidance from contamination threats (pathogens) that cannot be readily detected and are invisible to the naked eye. Therefore, the mere visual presentation of unreinforced disgust eliciting stimuli might not be sufficient to correct a previously acquired threat value of the CS+. Following this, the current study tested whether the efficacy of CS-only exposure can be improved by providing additional safety information about the CS+. For the CSs we included two neutral items a pea soup and a sausage roll, whereas for the Unconditioned Stimulus (US) we used one video clip of a woman vomiting and a <b>neutral</b> one about <b>glass</b> blowing. The additional safety information was conveyed by allowing actual contact with the CS+ or by observing an actress eating the food items representing the CS+. When additional safety information was provided via allowing direct contact with the CS+, there was a relatively strong post-extinction increase in participants’ willingness-to-eat the CS+. This beneficial effect was still evident at one-week follow up. Also self-reported disgust was lower at one-week follow up when additional safety information was provided. The current findings help explain why disgust is relatively insensitive to CS-only extinction procedures, and provide helpful starting points to improve interventions that are aimed to reduce distress in disgust-related psychopathology...|$|R
5000|$|Unique tower {{envelope}} made of cold-bent glass {{emphasizes the}} lightness and {{dynamic of the}} form visually denying the gravity force. Two hundred meters high sculpture, crafted of materials traditionally believed to be fragile and inflexible, symbolizes the idea of evolution spiral as the pinnacle of progress {{and the power of}} human intellect, challenging the forces of nature and the laws of physics. Original façade concept and innovative construction technology allow to create visually organic and flowing 3D form. Double curved tower envelope is provided by the cold bending of reflective glass units. The innovative cold-bent glazing in the curtain wall uses flat double glazed units cold-formed in 3D within the aluminum frame to avoid stepping in geometry. This approach appeared to be both more energy-efficient and more cost-efficient solution in comparison to the stepped curtain wall units previously applied in some twisted unitized facades. During factory fabrication the glass unit is placed in the twisted aluminum frame horizontally and then takes curved shape by its own weight without any thermal treatment. Maximum corner deformation does not exceed 50 mm relative to the opposite corner of the unit. Finally façade looks like continuously twisted spiral glass surface. Currently this curtain wall is the world’s largest cold bent façade in terms of the area in one building. Organic cold-bent glazed ribbon with constant leaning angle at the corners (approx. 14 degrees vertically) creates a stunning optical illusion reflecting the surrounding cityscape vertically with 90-degree twist.Evolution tower total façade area is 40,500 sq m, including 34,500 sq m of the typical facade areas from 3-rd to 51-st level. On each floor the curtain wall consists of 108 parallelogram façade panels 4.3 m high and 1.5m wide. 27 of them have 2 types of different sizes that vary with twist angle from +14 to -14 that largely complicated the construction logistics. However the implementation of this façade structure was successful due to involvement of German façade company Joseph Gartner (Permasteelisa Group) in design and production of tower curtain wall, atrium glazing and canopies /entrances. The company was selected through the tender with 30 façade manufacturers competing for a prestigious contract. The aluminum profiles were extruded in Russia at a specially arranged production line. Despite glass units fabrication in Germany with all associated delivery and customs duties the overall façade cost per m2 remained within the budget of a ‘standard’ benchmark high-rise tower, that was an achievement of German logistics. Double glazed units with energy-efficient multi-functional glass (manufactured by Guardian) provide the energy efficiency and thermal insulation parameters (U-Value) similar to those of standard triple glazed units but with less weight in panoramic floor to ceiling application. The units themselves were assembled in Germany by BGT, who provided long-time warranty for cold bent heat-strengthened glass in a result of multiple tests. Transparent double glazed units consist of triplex 8+6mm from heat-strengthened glass from the outside and 8mm Guardian Standard HP <b>Neutral</b> 60/40 tempered <b>glass</b> on the inside with application of energy efficient coating, significantly reducing the solar gain whilst providing the double glazed unit thermal performance equal to a standard triple glazed unit normally used in Moscow to withstand harsh winter conditions. Guardian SunGuard production technology allows to create almost perfect combination of transparent and spandrel façade areas. Guardian magnetron coating has a special feature - it is colored outside and transparent on the inside, which does not distort the view color unlike tinted glass in mass. With no color filter (color is from the coating, not from coloured glass) the high color quality provides comfortable environment inside the building given that the glass panel is 3m high (floor to ceiling) the perfect daylighting is provided in the office spaces. Glass unit formula with heat-strengthened triplex outside and tempered glass inside allows bending of the unit in installation position to achieve required façade geometry providing additional safety of envelope structure , as in case of destruction the tempered glass (5 times stronger than usual) is fractured in small pieces and triplex lamination film protects it from falling out. Heat strengthened glass triplex gains additional strength and reduces the risk of glass destruction via associated heat soak tests as part of the production process.|$|R
