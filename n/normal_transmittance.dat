40|$|A {{combined}} {{analytical and}} experimental study is presented for infrared radiation characteristics of thin plastic films {{with and without}} a metal substrate. On {{the basis of the}} thin-film analysis, a simple analytical technique is developed for determining band-averaged optical constants of thin plastic films from spectral <b>normal</b> <b>transmittance</b> data for two different film thicknesses. Specifically, the band-averaged optical constants of polyethylene terephthalate and polyimide were obtained from transmittance measurements of films with thicknesses in the range of 0. 25 to 3 mil. The spectral normal reflectance and total normal emittance of the film side of singly aluminized films are calculated by use of optical constants; the results compare favorably with measured values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Measurements {{of middle}} ear (ME) {{acoustic}} power flow (power reflectance, power absorption, and transmittance) and normalized impedance (acoustic resistance, acoustic reactance, and impedance magnitude) were compared for their utility in clin-ical applications. Transmittance, {{a measure of}} the acoustic power absorbed by the ME, was found to have several important advan-tages over other measures of acoustic power flow. In addition to its simple and audiologically relevant physical interpretation (absorbed power), the <b>normal</b> <b>transmittance</b> curve has a simple shape that is visually similar to the ME transfer function. The acoustic impedance measures (resistance and reactance) provided important additional information about ME status and supple-mented transmittance measurements.

The structural characterization {{has been done by}} X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using a X-ray diffractometer operating with a continuous scan of Cu Kα 1 radiation with λ = 1.54056 Å. The optical/thermochromic behavior has been evaluated in an optical spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV- 3101 PC) with an embedded sample heating-cooling cell. It has been done by measuring the spectral <b>normal</b> <b>transmittance</b> at the UV-Vis-near-infrared (NIR) range, from 250 to 2500 nm, under and above the transition temperature. The determination of the transition temperature was carried out by evaluating the optical transmittance change with temperature at a given NIR wavelength, in this case at λ = 2500 nm. The transition temperatures were then estimated by determining the first derivative of both curves of the hysteresis loops (heating and cooling) and considering the mean value.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{delivery}} of high power Er:YAG laser pulses through a silica hollow core photonic crystal fibre is demonstrated. The Er:YAG wavelength of 2. 94 ím is well beyond the <b>normal</b> <b>transmittance</b> of bulk silica but the unique hollow core guidance allows silica to guide in this regime. We have demonstrated {{for the first time}} the ability to deliver high energy pulses through an all-silica fibre at 2. 94 ím. These silica fibres are mechanically and chemically robust, biocompatible and have low sensitivity to bending. A maximum pulse energy of 14 mJ at 2. 94 ím was delivered through the fibre. This, to our knowledge, is the first time a silica hollow core photonic crystal fibre has been shown to transmit 2. 94 ím laser light at a fluence exceeding the thresholds required for modification (e. g. cutting and drilling) of hard biological tissue. Consequently, laser delivery systems based on these fibres have the potential for the realization of novel, minimally-invasive surgical procedures...|$|E

The effects of the deposition parameters, such as evaporation rate and substrate temperature, on the optical, and structural properties {{as well as the}} resulting composition of the films were studied. The optical parameters of the films (Le. refractive index, absorption coefficient, optical band gap and film thickness) were calculated from the <b>normal</b> <b>transmittance</b> data. A 'model was proposed for the calculation of the optical parameters from the transmittance spectra. The transmittance formula, derived for using in the proposed model, includes most of the parameters affecting the transmittance spectra, i. e finite substrate thickness. absorption of the substrate, thickness irregularity of the film surface, reflection from {{the back side of the}} substrate in addition to the refractive index and absorption of the film itself.

Comparison of fitting of different transmittance formulas, as well as different models for the refractive index and the absorption coefficient also were done. For reducing the resistivity of ZnTe films. Doping with different materials were performed. Cu and Ag doping was done by an ion exchange process, which is by immersion of the ZnTe films into a copper nitrate solution (in case of Cu doping). The solution temperature was fixed, and the effect of the immersion time and post vacuum heat treatment, on the physical properties and the composition of the resulting films was studied. Three sourced evaporation from the elemental sources, was used for Sb doping.

3000|$|Ge QDs {{embedded}} in silica {{have been obtained}} by magnetronco-sputtering of SiO 2 and Ge targets (Ar atmosphere,nominal deposition temperature 400 °C), upon fused silicasubstrates. Thermal annealing in the 600 °C to 800 °C range(1 h, N 2 ambient) promoted the phase separation of SiGeOfilm into SiO 2, GeO 2, and Ge clusters (due toprecipitation of the exceding Ge). The thickness of the SiGeO film (approximately 280 nm) was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the elemental composition was determined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS, 2.0 MeV He+ beam). The spectra, simulated with SIMNRA software [30], revealed that in the as-deposited sample, the Si, Ge, and O contents are 24, 16, and 60 at.%, respectively, homogeneous in depth. Because of the annealing, the overall Ge amount contained in the SiGeO film slightly decreases from 3.0 × 1017 cm- 2 (in the as-deposited sample) to 2.6 × 1017 cm- 2 (800 °C-annealed sample) due to the Ge out-diffusion through the surface, as already evidenced in the literature [20]. <b>Normal</b> <b>transmittance</b> (T) and the 20 ° reflectance (R) spectra in the 200 - to 2000 -nm wavelength range were measured, by using a Varian Cary 500 double beam scanning UV/Visible/NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) for extracting the absorption coefficient of the films, as described in Ref.

Cross-section transmission electron microscopy in high resolution (HR-TEM) or scanning mode (STEM) was used to verify the formation of Ge clusters, to measure their size distribution, and to evidence the crystalline phase.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the optical constants of absorbing films, particularly on opaque substrates, is a difficult problem when solely using spectroscopic ellipsometry. First, unwanted backside reflections are incoherent with the desired reflection from the front side, which makes the fitting of optical constants difficult. Second, the optical constants of substrate must be carefully characterized in advance, as any small absorption in the substrate would be mixed into the film's overall optical constants. Third, thickness and optical constants are strongly correlated with each other, which may prevent a unique solution for absorbing films. For the above reasons, quartz, glass slide, cover glass and float glass substrates are studied. Backside reflections of the substrates are suppressed by index matching technique. The {{results show that the}} simple technique works well for substrate materials with refractive index in a range from 1. 43 to 1. 64, including materials such as fused silica, float glass, etc. in a spectral range from 190 nm to 1700 nm. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of the substrate are fitted by ellipsometric psi data and the <b>normal</b> spectral <b>transmittance</b> T- 0.

From the imaginary part, the optical absorption coefficient was determined {{as a function of}} photon energy. It was shown that CrSi 2 possesses an indirect forbidden energy gap of slightly less than 0. 31 eV, and yet it is a very strong absorber of light above the absorption edge. On the other hand, the ReSi 2 films exhibit an absorption edge in the vicinity of 0. 2 eV. Measurements of the thermal activation energy of resistivity for ReSi 2 indicate a bandgap of 0. 18 eV.

40|$|International audienceThis study aims to {{quantify}} systematically {{the effect of}} non-absorbing cap-shaped droplets condensed on the backside of transparent windows on their directional-hemispherical transmittance and reflectance. Condensed water droplets have been blamed to reduce light transfer through windows in greenhouses, solar desalination plants, and photobioreactors. Here, the directional-hemispherical transmittance was predicted by Monte Carlo ray-tracing method. For the first time, both monodisperse and polydisperse droplets were considered, with contact angle between 0 and 180 °, arranged either in an ordered hexagonal pattern or randomly distributed on the window backside with projected surface area coverage between 0 and 90 %. The directional-hemispherical transmittance {{was found to be}} independent of the size and spatial distributions of the droplets. Instead, it depended on (i) the incident angle, (ii) the optical properties of the window and droplets, and on (iii) the droplet contact angle and (iv) projected surface area coverage. In fact, the directional-hemispherical transmittance decreased with increasing incident angle. Four optical regimes were identified in the normal-hemispherical transmittance. It was nearly constant for droplet contact angles either smaller than the critical angle θ cr (predicted by Snell's law) for total internal reflection at the droplet/air interface or larger than 180 °-θ cr. However, between these critical contact angles, the normal-hemispherical transmittance decreased rapidly to reach a minimum at 90 ° and increased rapidly with increasing contact angles up to 180 °-θ cr. This was attributed to total internal reflection at the droplet/air interface which led to increasing reflectance. In addition, the <b>normal</b> -hemispherical <b>transmittance</b> increased slightly with increasing projected surface area coverage for contact angle was smaller than θ cr. However, it decreased monotonously with increasing droplet projected surface area coverage for contact angle larger than θ cr. These results can be used to select the material or surface coating with advantageous surface properties for applications when dropwise condensation may otherwise {{have a negative effect on}} light transmittance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis work is {{regarding}} {{the properties of}} deposited gas phase nanoclusters. In our cluster research group, we have been succesfully trying to tailor diverse properties of deposited clusters. The latter is mostly accomplished through {{the control of the}} cluster production parameters or the deposition rate. Less conventional is heating the substrate during deposition, or introducing a reactive gas into the cluster production. These last two approaches to tailor cluster properties have been used in this thesis work. This thesis is based on experimental work and is written based on a collection of papers. Some of these manuscripts are already published, others are submitted or merely preliminary summaries of the conducted experiments and need some additional input. The thesis consists of three different subject areas. The first is regarding hydrogen absorption/adsorption properties of cluster assembled layers. The second subject area is {{regarding the}} catalytic properties of mass selected clusters in liquid and also in gas flow reactors. The third and last part of the thesis entails the possibility of tailoring magnetic properties of cluster assembled films with the use of hydrogen gas. In the first section, the aim is to study the hydrogen absorption of cluster assembled thin films covered by a palladium (Pd) thin film which is a known hydrogen absorbing material. Pd is used as a means to deliver atomic hydrogen to an underlying layer of clusters. We have observed the interaction of the systems with hydrogen through the changes in the optical properties in the visible range. Samples consisting of Co clusters capped with Pd were produced. Different samples were fabricated at different substrate temperatures during deposition. Transparent sapphire substrates were used for all samples. Other series of samples were made in which the Co clusters were replaced with Nb or Nb alloy clusters. Optical measurements were performed on these samples with near <b>normal</b> reflectance and <b>transmittance.</b> The resistance was measured with a Keithley resistivity bridge which allows measurements with 4 points connections. A vacuum chamber was filled with hydrogen gas reaching a given pressure from 3 to 120 torr, during which the optical and electrical measurements were done. All this was done at room temperature. In the case of the Co samples, the reduction of cobalt oxide upon hydrogenation at room temperature is remarkable given that this is normally achieved at high temperatures. This phenomenon could be of importance in nanostructured systems that combine palladium and cobalt. In the case of the Nb samples, we observed that a sputtered film of Nb capped with Pd does not absorb hydrogen. Changing the Nb layer by a Nb cluster layer we obtain a remarkable hydrogen uptake, comparable to pure Pd films. This result is very unexpected. In the second section we have deposited mass selected gas-phase nanoclusters to perform catalytic reaction experiments using single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy (SMFS). Here we implemented our noveltype of mass selector for cluster beams. It consists of a four fold electrostatic deflector geometry. For the SMFS experiments, a total of 76 samples were produced containing pure Au, Pd or Pt clusters but also AuPd or AuPt species. Previous work attributing the catalytic activity to the metallic core of a similar system is a concern at this point. We did not see any relevant catalytic activity for resazurin to highly fluorescent resorufin by NH 2 OH. A variety of alloys was also used, which assures a change in the surface states. This however, did not show any increase in activity when compared to a blank sample. In a different experiment, we discuss the CO oxidation by deposited Au nanoclusters. We have deposited these preformed gas phase nano-particles of Au on borosilicate substrates. The reaction was carried out at room temperature in a quartz fixed bed flow reactor. The gas mixtures were passed through a catalytic bed. The reactor outlet was analyzed using a mass spectrometer. The experiments with CO oxidation on Au show that the nano particles are catalytically active. They are however, not as reactive as other commercially available systems. The question regarding the reactivation of nano-particles has also been verified: small particles are able to be restored to initial parameters. We stress that these investigations are in an early stage. In the short term, new samples as well as an experimental procedure need to be worked out. This work has an incredible potential in the short term and should be carried out as soon as possible. The last section studies the oxygen concentration in nanosized materials. Oxygen concentration is a crucial parameter that has to be included in real world materials. Partial or complete oxidation may inhibit the relevant functionalities under study. In order to prevent oxidation, samples are often covered with capping material to avoid contact with the ambient. In this section, we discuss the factual possibility of controlling the oxygen content of cluster assembled films by adding 2 % H 2 gas in the initial phase of the cluster production. Furthermore, we address the magnetic properties of samples exposed to 2 % H 2 gas during production. This demonstrates that the magnetic properties can be tailored that way. These measurements point out that the hydrogen-treated Co-nanocluster films present an in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The fact that magnetic domains are considerably larger than a single particle confirms the enhancement of magnetic interactions between clusters in these films. The hydrogen-treatment method can be used to tailor the magnetic properties of the Co-nanocluster assembled films as well as films composed of other ferromagnetic clusters. In particular, we have created hard and soft magnetic materials. A second aspect under study is the exchange bias effect. We measure an exchange bias shift in-plane and out-of-plane which are very similar in magnitude. This may suggest the possible spherical structure of the FM and AF interfaces. status: publishe...|$|R
