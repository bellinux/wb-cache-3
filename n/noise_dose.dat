The use of hearing protective devices {{is considered an}} [...] "interim protective measure" [...] while engineering controls are developed. The goal of these controls is to reduce ambient steady-state noise levels to 85 dBA regardless of TWA exposure and to reduce impulse noise levels to below 140 dBP. The DOD requires that personnel be entered into a hearing conservation program when continuous snd intermittent noise levels ale grs {{greater than or equal}} to 85 dBA TWA, when impulse SPL are at or in excess of 140 dBP, or when the personnel is exposed to ultrasonic frequencies. The DOD integrates all sound levels between 80 dBA to a minimum of 130 dBA when determining an individual or representative <b>noise</b> <b>dose.</b> When used, hearing protectors must be capable of attenuating worker noise exposure below 85 dBA TWA. Hearing protection is required to be carried by personnel who work in designated noise areas, such as those exposed to gunfire or ordnance tests and Service musicians.

It is further specified that a shift in 15 dB at 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hz is an early warning sign for an STS; follow-up retraining is required in this case. (DOD Instruction 6055.12).|$|E

Sixty-seven college students of classical music were recruited representing 17 primary instruments. Of these students, 57 completed 2 days of <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> measurements using Cirrus doseBadge programed according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health criterion. Sound exposure was measured for 2 days from morning to evening, ranging from 7 to 9 h.

The main sources of noise occurring in agriculture are: agricultural tractors mounted with a set of farm machinery, self-propelled machines, machinery for the production of fodder and workshop equipment. The review of literature showed that the highest values of equivalent exposure to noise (EA, T) or <b>noise</b> <b>doses</b> (d) were noted during the summer-autumn season and in spring. Mean noise levels for the entire year (of over 90 dB-A), considerably exceeded permissible values. The primary sources of the whole body vibration are agricultural vehicles including agricultural tractors of various types and self-propelled agricultural vehicles. In these vehicles vibration transmitted from the seat to the whole body is of basic importance. The measurements of vibration acceleration indicated that mechanical vibration on seats was produced while performing following activities: hay tedding and raking, sowing of fertilizers, aggregation of soil, grass mowing and cultivation. All of them may create a considerable health risk. These work activities are performed at elevated working speeds of tractors, most often along with hardened or uneven surfaces. In relation to the standard values (A(8) 40. 8 m/s 2), the mean daily vibration acceleration values remain below the permissible levels during all months of the year.

This study aims to acoustics analysis of theairblower workroomand sound source characteristics in order to present noise controlmeasuresinthe steel industry.. Material and Method: Measurement of noiselevel and its frequency analysis was performed usingsound levelmetermodelof CASELLA-Cell. 450. Distribution of noise level in the investigated workroom in form of noise map was provided using Surfer software. In addition, acoustic analysis of workroom and control room was performed in view point of soundabsorption andinsulation. Redesignofdoor and window of controlroom and installation of soundabsorbing materialson theceiling of the workroom were proposed and the efficiency of these interventionswasestimated.. Result: The totalsound pressurelevelin the blower workroom was 95. 4 dB(L) and the dominant frequency was 2000 Hz. Sound pressure level inside the room control was 80. 1 dB(A). The average absorption coefficient and reverberation time in the blower workroom was estimated equal to 0. 082 Sab. m 2 and 3. 9 seconds respectively. These value in control room was 0. 04 Sab. m 2 and 3 / 4 seconds respectively. In control room, sound transmission loss between the {{two parts of the}} wall dividing was 13. 7 dB(A).

There is a worldwide rapid increase {{in the use of}} call centers with headset phone operators for quick satisfaction of consumer demand. Operator’s exposure to noise from communication headsets above specified limits can result in permanent hearing loss. Therefore measurement and monitoring <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> for the operator is necessary. Exposure noise levels can be very different for the same headphone used by different operator, depending on head geometry, acoustic impedance of the ear, position of the headphone, etc. The <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> of the operator depends not only on the type of headphone, but also on the ambient noise in the working place, including lay-out of the room, distance between operators, acoustic characteristics of the working place, quality of the headset, maintenance and volume of the headphone.

This review article aims to {{provide an overview of}} clinical applications of IR techniques in coronary CT angiography with a focus on the effects of different IR techniques on CAC score assessment...|$|R
40|$|Hearing Conservation Program is {{an ongoing}} program which aims to prevent hearing loss due to noise in the workplace. Mining process uses multi open pit mining method which {{involves}} a lot of heavy equipment {{with a variety of}} function, sizes, and types. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze compliance and quality of implementation of Hearing Conservation Program in PT. Kaltim Prima Coal compared with the applicable regulations and standards. The type of this research was descriptive with the qualitative approach. There were nine workers who participated in this study. Triangulation in this study was the results of indepth interviews with triangulation informants, observation, and applicable standards. The results showed that PT. Kaltim Prima Coal complied 78, 6 percent of the required criteria of OSHA and NIOSH elements such as policies, resources, surveys noise, technical and administrative noise control, education and motivation, ear protection, hearing acuity monitoring, recording, and reporting, evaluation, and audit program; while 21, 4 percent had not complied. In conclusion, the implementation of hearing conservation program in PT. Kaltim Prima Coal had been good enough. PT. Kaltim Prima Coal should do the noise mapping based on <b>noise</b> exposure <b>dose...</b>|$|R
40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to loud noise can cause permanent {{damage to the}} auditory nerve and/or its sensory components. Despite regulations and efforts by government and industry to reduce noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), {{it is still a}} problem in the U. S. coal mining industry. The Mine Safety and Health Administration noise standard (30 CFR 3 62), which was enacted in September 2000, is aimed at reducing NIHL in the mining industry. To address NIHL in various aspects of coal mining and provide the necessary information to effectively implement control technologies, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted a cross-sectional survey of noise sources and worker noise exposures. Noise surveys consisting of full-shift worker <b>noise</b> exposure (<b>dose)</b> determination, timemotion studies (task observations), and equipment and/or area noise profiling were completed in 8 underground coal mines, 10 surface coal mines, and 8 coal preparation plants. The studies revealed that more than 40 % of all workers monitored were subject to noise exposures above 90 dBA TWA 8. A summary of these studies is presented, their application to administrative and engineering controls is discussed, and exposure reduction methods are reviewed. " - NIOSHTIC-...|$|R
