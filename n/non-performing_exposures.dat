Total loans: €62 bn (€52.5 bn in Greek loans, €9.5bn {{in loans}} abroad). 51.3% are <b>non-performing</b> <b>exposures</b> using the European Banking Authority definition, with a 50% Provision {{coverage}} and €31.4 bn in deposits (€26.3 bn in Greek deposits).

40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 59 European banks over the period 2006 - 2011, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of the}} loan loss provisioning (LLP) together with a wide array of credit-risk exposure and performance variables on systematic risk measured by betas. We develop a model for assessing whether management behaviour, accounting policies, such as LLP, and the quality of loan portfolio {{play a significant role in}} explaining the banks’ systematic risk exposure. Our results suggest that financial performances do not have a direct significant relation with betas; rather measures of risk exposures (risk weighted assets on total assets) substantially affect systematic risk. During crisis systematic risk significantly responsive to provisions and their impacts on performances. Our study has several implications, in particular at light of changing European regulation on <b>non-performing</b> <b>exposures</b> reporting and forbearance practices alongside with regulators forcing banks to strengthen their capital base...|$|E
40|$|Most credit {{portfolio}} models exclusively calculate the loss distribution for {{a portfolio of}} performing counterparts. Conservative default definitions cause considerable insecurity about the loss {{for a long time}} after the default. We present three approaches to account for defaulted counterparts in the calculation of the economic capital. Two of the approaches are based on the Poisson mixture model CreditRisk+ and derive a loss distribution for an integrated portfolio. The third method treats the portfolio of <b>non-performing</b> <b>exposure</b> separately. All three calculations are supplemented by formulae for contributions of the counterpart to the economic capital. [...] Portfolio credit risk,CreditRisk+,Recovery...|$|R
40|$|Greece’s <b>non-performing</b> <b>exposure</b> {{ratio is}} the second highest in Europe, largely linked to the {{unprecedented}} contraction of domestic economic activity in recent years. Causality is known to go both ways, with persistently high non-performing loans (NPLs) constituting a drag on credit and GDP growth. Theoretically, Greek governments keen to reduce the debt overhang and restore the productive pillars of the economy should have created the conditions for a rapid and effective workout of NPLs. The country’s third bailout programme has provided a road map for reform, with the Institutions bent on facilitating or enforcing ownership. Conditionality, anchored on a ‘reforms for cash’ logic, has reduced perceived or real margins for noncompliance...|$|R
