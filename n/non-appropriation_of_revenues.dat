40|$|The {{concept of}} {{decentralization}} {{consists of the}} breaking down of heavy government machinery into smaller administrative units at the local level. This article attempts to examine the decentralization and forest management in the southeastern region of Cameroon, {{as well as their}} impacts on the way of life of the local population (Bantu and Baka). This study is based on a historical approach and socio-anthropological analyses, and highlights the difficulties faced by the public administration in the implementation of these new dispensations at the local level. Further, this study equally demonstrates the <b>non-appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the new management tools by the parties concerned. This therefore explains the reticence of the central administration, administrative delays, and its adoption by the Bantu and Baka...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} professional education. The aim is {{to analyze}} how IFRN is materializing according to the vision of teachers, the curriculum proposal of high school courses integrated in Electrotechnology, Agroecology, Food and Computer Science. Methodologically, the study falls into the qualitative category, of exploratory character, having the dialectic as conductor of the analyses. The information sources are the 2004 political pedagogical project, course plans, questions that deal only with curricular integration, taken from the printed questionnaire applied to 186 teachers and the semi-structured interviews, carried out individually with 10 of them, two from each course. <b>Non-appropriation</b> <b>of</b> the design and foundations of the integrated curriculum by teachers and related pedagogical practices allowed us to infer that concrete materialization of the integrated high school doesn’t occur in IFRN and, yes, {{that only a few}} didactic actions, not systematic or planned collectively, contribute to this purpose. ...|$|R

The system and framework for international and domestic laws were established through the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. The rules, terms and agreements that space law authorities consider {{to be part of the}} active body of international space law are the five international space treaties and five UN declarations. Approximately 100 nations and institutions were involved in negotiations. The space treaties cover many major issues such as arms control, <b>non-appropriation</b> <b>of</b> space, freedom of exploration, liability for damages, safety and rescue of astronauts and spacecraft, prevention of harmful interference with space activities and the environment, notification and registration of space activities, and the settlement of disputes. In exchange for assurances from the space power, the nonspacefaring nations acquiesced to U.S. and Soviet proposals to treat outer space as a commons (res communis) territory which belonged to no one state.|$|R

40|$|With a {{geographic}} holistic and multi-scales approach {{of physical and}} human factors combining Very High Resolution satellite imagery interpretation, a survey on the ground (observation, interview, DGPS measurement) and a Geographic informatic system (GIS), this study helped to explain {{by a set of}} physical and especially human factors that intra-urban gully erosion is a complex phenomenon with multiple causalities. Those are the orthogonality of roads on the slopes, the tracks traced in the direction of (the highest point of) the slope, housing construction techniques on weeded and loosened terraces offering no resistance to concentrated water runoff, soil sealing residential towns upstream of spontaneous settlements, sewerage that fail at the outlet and erosion control devices poorly maintained or not, the <b>non-appropriation</b> <b>of</b> public spaces and the late intervention in the management. This intervention in the erosion control is asymmetrical from a temporal point of view. This delay not only worsens the living conditions in poor neighborhoods, but also it allows the gully erosion to accelerate, to branch out and take dramatic dimensions.

40|$|In {{recent times}} utility {{companies}} have to orient to effective business due to hard market conditions. Thus, companies want to diminish business expenses and increase the revenues. Effective revenue capture is, after all, the aim <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance. Actually the revenue capture is usually not perfect and without losses. A part <b>of</b> <b>revenues</b> are always lost on the way from a service to payment, which is called revenue leakage and causes a financial loss. The revenue leakage is above all the result of bad infrastructure management, ineffective human and IT processes, ineffective billing and debt collection, frauds etc. The base <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> correction is unified understanding {{of the problem and}} standardization <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance, which could be achieved by determination <b>of</b> responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance and aspects <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> leakage. It is important to determine the objectives and aims of leakage correction. Understanding of problem reflects in the revenue assurance maturity. The thesis explains the revenue leakage and determines the areas <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance in utility companies as well as the relations among them. Varieties <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> leakages are determined and it is explained why and where they occur; thus solutions of problems are presented. The proposals for leakage corrections and problems which should be considered at leakage correction are presented as well. Main tasks that should be undertaken to achieve the core aims <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance are presented too. The point of view <b>of</b> eligibility <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assurance and leakage correction is emphasized. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} international {{experience with the}} assignments <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> sources to different levels of government, the public finance literature still lacks a general theory <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assignments. Two sets of arguments have been separately developed in the literature to explain and guide the practice <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assignments. The first is based on Musgrave and Oates’ tradition, and emphasizes the benefit principle and other means for increasing accountability and efficiency in the allocation of public expenditures. The second is based on optimal taxation principles, which emphasizes the marginal cost of public funds and the correct mix <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> instruments. The two approaches provide important insights to the problem, but they remain practically unconnected. This paper develops a theory <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> assignments that integrates the two approaches. We discuss the validity and scope <b>of</b> currently applied <b>revenue</b> assignment rules, and provide practical recommendations to implement an optimal assignment <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> sources...|$|R
