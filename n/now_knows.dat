500|$|Actress {{and writer}} Jacquetta May, {{who played the}} {{character}} Rachel Kominski between 1991 and 1993, has discussed the storyline {{and the role of}} women in an article about EastEnders. According to May, the scriptwriters were faced with a problem once Peggy, [...] "a key figure of the community", was shown to exhibit such [...] "pig-headed ignorance and appalling prejudice". In order for Peggy to be redeemed, she had to be seen to be punished, and so the character was given breast-cancer later that year. May comments, [...] "Peggy, malicious gossip and bigot, herself becomes the victim of a life-threatening illness. At Christmas they run a Christian forgiveness story. Peggy calls on Mark and tells him she <b>now</b> <b>knows</b> what it is like to suffer as he has. She apologises, thus underlining one of the basic tenets of the programme: underneath the skin we are all the same, human and vulnerable, and recognition of this should unite us not divide us. Along the way, a great deal of useful information about these illnesses was broadcast. So, although EastEnders endlessly repeats its conservative format, and although all issues are there primarily to feed the great hungry story-beast, its positive by-products cannot be denied." ...|$|E
