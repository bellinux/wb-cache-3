5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area <b>networks</b> (LANs)--computer <b>networks</b> that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because <b>networks</b> on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger <b>networks</b> and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
