The first one {{is the creation of}} names for parodistic purposes, where the author makes use of intertextuality, mostly with courtly romances as the main hypotext. The second one involves the reuse of names and naming practices pertaining to the Germanic tradition. The last naming strategy inserts in the fictional text names of real historical characters.

40|$|Catalogues are at {{the core}} of Spatial Data Infrastructures. The most {{noticeable}} catalogue specification in the geospatial domain is the Catalogue Services specification issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium.

The Web of Data is an alternative approach to the publication of data and metadata on the Web that enables the use of generic clients and the mix of information from different domains.

50|$|Many newly {{discovered}} plants, animals and insects were <b>named</b> and <b>catalogued</b> by Linnaeus and apostles.

Additionally, one of Linnaeus' admirers, the English Botanist Joseph Banks, was inspired to begin the tradition for all British research ships to have a naturalist aboard. Thus apostles had a direct influence on future expeditions such as Charles Darwin's expedition aboard HMS Beagle.|$|R

5|$|The {{traditional}} name Capella is Latin for (small) female goat; {{the alternative}} name Capra was {{more commonly used}} in classical times. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star <b>Names</b> (WGSN) to <b>catalogue</b> and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table {{of the first two}} batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Capella for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star <b>Names.</b> The <b>catalogue</b> of star <b>names</b> lists Capella as applying to the star with the designations α Aurigae, HR 1708, HD 34029, and HIP 24608, which suggests only the primary component of the Capella system should receive that name. The IAU's own documentation makes it explicit that the proper name should strictly only be applied to the visually brightest component. In this case it is somewhat uncertain which of the components is the brightest and the IAU list does not specify.|$|R

30|$|While {{the modern}} {{use of the}} term “metropolis” had already been applied to a few world cities {{since the turn of the}} nineteenth and twentieth century, in 1960 Jean Gottmann {{introduced}} the successful definition of Megalopolis to indicate the recently-formed continuous urban area lying between Boston and Washington D.C. on the North-East coast of the United States. Later, the same phenomenon took place in other countries and became a typical settlement pattern. In 1966 the English geographer Peter Hall considered the Ruhr Gebiet and the Randstad Holland as “urban systems” formed by a network of small and mid-size towns that operated conjunctly so that, as a whole, they could be considered “world cities” in as much as classic metropolises such as London, Paris, New York, Tokyo and Moscow. However, the exceptional migration of people towards few urban areas spurred geographers and planners to formulate new terms to describe human settlement landscapes. Terms such as metropolitan areas, conurbations, attraction or gravitation poles, polarized or polycentric growth, became commonly used in urban and regional planning and soon also in the current language. It would be interesting to carry out research about the history of how urban settlements have been <b>named,</b> <b>catalogued</b> and classified in the last century or so.|$|R

40|$|The {{world and}} society are now {{constantly}} evolving through scenarios of global change and development having {{direct and indirect}} impact on manufacturing companies. The related manufacturing value chains require different assessment and evaluation of strategic dimensions such as Quality, Innovation, Flexibility and Sustainability. In order to capture and evaluate these dimensions, value modeling methodologies are currently used. Since sustainability is gaining attention as a close future business driver, in this paper an existing and specific Manufacturing Value Modeling Methodology (MVMM) is firstly shortly described to focus then on the analysis and development of sustainability dimension. Implementing manufacturing sustainability into the MVMM requires the setting of a structured information set (<b>named</b> <b>catalogue)</b> that presents an overview of sustainable challenges and opportunities {{in order to identify}} a correct structure of metrics (and relevant key performance indicators) for assessment and evaluation, which translate business goals into consistent manufacturing strategy, and allows to improve operational performance by suggesting, and then adopting, a set of best practices. To this end, a qualitative literature review on industrial sustainability performance management has been performed with the aim of analyzing the existing body of literature, re-organizing these data accordingly to a hierarchy of structured KPIs, identifying poor analyzed areas, and finally providing a first comprehensive database of metrics to build up and structure the aforementioned catalogue...|$|R
