5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Peter Turcan, who also developed similar turn-based strategies such as Waterloo and Borodino for home computers in the 1980s. Austerlitz is presented in a 3D perspective over a battlefield; however, it features <b>no</b> <b>sound.</b> The game received mostly positive reviews upon release. Critics praised the graphics and presentation; however, some were divided over the historical accuracy of the battle and lack of sound.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E
5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E

5|$|Rotating the map using {{a compass}} is {{essential}} for ensuring an army moves in the desired direction. The order of a moving unit will not be carried out until the unit has reached its destination or {{if they have been}} killed before arriving there. Each order carried out is announced through the game's command box, which is situated {{at the bottom of the}} screen. Actions such as battles and unit losses are also announced. In order to attack the enemy from a distance, the player is able to order a unit to commence shelling, which will neutralise an enemy unit if successful. The game features <b>no</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Magnavox Odyssey is {{the first}} {{commercial}} home video game console. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates and released by Magnavox in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played, and with <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> capabilities. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to create visuals, and {{the one or two}} players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia {{to go along with the}} games, and a peripheral controller—the first video game light gun—was sold separately.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford in England dates from 1634, {{when it was}} established by new statutes for the university brought in by William Laud (Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of the University). The first holder of the post was Brian Twyne, who prepared an index of the archives in 1631 {{as part of the}} preparatory work for the statutes: he was appointed Keeper of the Archives as a reward for his work. The archives were moved from the University Church of St Mary the Virgin into the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library under Twyne and his successor, and some of the storage cupboards built at that time are still in use. The archives include charters, title deeds, university registers and records, and other official documentation from the university (but not from the colleges of the university, which keep their own archives). Most of the material dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with few photographs and <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> or video recordings.|$|E

25|$|Problematic point(s):, linguistically speaking, {{these do}} not {{constitute}} an actual compound (because the meaning is not institutionalized), so there is <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> reason for writing them in one word. In addition, the normal alternative for writing in one word is writing with hyphens, rather than writing separately, so this opposition is unusual in Hungarian orthography.|$|E
25|$|SDMI did {{not accept}} that Felten had {{successfully}} broken the watermark {{according to the rules}} of the contest, noting that there was a requirement for files to lose <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> quality.

25|$|Critics see {{the change}} in {{calendar}} as an unwarranted innovation, influenced by Western society.

25|$|A solid body {{electric}} guitar, {{made up of}} hardwood with a lacquer coating, is {{an electric}} guitar that has no hollow internal cavity to accommodate vibration. There are <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> holes such as those used to amplify string vibrations in acoustic guitars. The sound that is audible in music featuring electric guitars is produced by pickups on the guitar that convert the string vibrations into an electrical signal, usually fed into an amplifier or a speaker. The solid body guitar was invented in 1941 by American recording artist Les Paul.|$|E
25|$|On December 6, 2006, Deming {{testified before}} the US Senate {{committee}} on the Environmental and Public Works, concluding that The amount of climatic warming {{that has taken place}} in the past 150 years is poorly constrained, and its cause--human or natural--is unknown. There is <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty. If the climate does warm, {{it is likely to be}} beneficial to humanity rather than harmful. In my opinion, it would be foolish to establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria.|$|E
25|$|Their {{ancestor}} was one Richard Ladde, {{grandfather of}} the Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward, who {{changed his name}} to Montagu in about 1447. His descendants claimed a connection with the older house of Montagu or Montacute, Barons Montagu or Montacute and Earls of Salisbury, but there is <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> evidence that the two families were related. A case has been made out for the possibility that the Ladde alias came from a division among coheirs about 1420 of the remaining small inheritance of a line of Montagus at Spratton and Little Creton, also in Northamptonshire (Sources:English Genealogy, Anthony Wagner).|$|E
