5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is called}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake, {{named after the}} United States President {{who presided over the}} authorization and completion of the dam. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including Native Americans whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish-ladders, <b>neither</b> <b>does</b> the next down-stream dam, Chief Joseph Dam. This means that no salmon ever reach the Grand Coulee Dam, rendering the possibility of added fish-ladders superfluous. Despite this, the second large dam down-stream, Rocky Reach Dam, does contains an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning. Being itself 473 miles upstream of the mouth of the Columbia River, there is currently no issue with salmon spawning that Grand Coulee or Chief Joseph dams are at fault for.|$|E

Additionally, Brazil has no contested {{territorial}} disputes with any of its neighbours and <b>neither</b> <b>does</b> it have rivalries, like Chile and Bolivia have with each other.

25|$|The {{action of}} the play takes place {{over the course of}} 12 years (1624 to 1636), {{represented}} in 12 scenes. Some give a sense of Courage's career, but do not provide time for viewers to develop sentimental feelings and empathize with any of the characters. Meanwhile, Mother Courage is not depicted as a noble character. The Brechtian epic theatre distinguished itself from the ancient Greek tragedies, in which the heroes are far above the average. <b>Neither</b> <b>does</b> Brecht's ending of his play inspire any desire to imitate the main character, Mother Courage.|$|E

25|$|Since then {{alterations}} to {{the structure}} have been minimal and mostly due to new regulations by the Department of Health or to serve the community better. The main alteration {{to the structure}} was {{the addition of a}} new emergency entrance on the southern side on the Bertoly Street facade. This small addition does not contribute to the value of the property but <b>neither</b> <b>does</b> it hinder the structure's architectural integrity since it was designed and built with a compatible architectural vocabulary. This is also true of the 1928 second floor, which was clearly separated from the 1885 construction by means of visually acceptable wall.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{phenomena}} in quantum mechanics, such as quantum entanglement, might give the superficial impression of allowing {{communication of information}} faster than light. According to the no-communication theorem these phenomena do not allow true communication; they only let two observers in different locations see the same system simultaneously, without any way of controlling what either sees. Wavefunction collapse {{can be viewed as}} an epiphenomenon of quantum decoherence, which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and all of its environment. Since the underlying behaviour does not violate local causality or allow FTL it follows that <b>neither</b> <b>does</b> the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real or apparent.|$|E
25|$|All real {{property}} and personal property {{is subject to}} tax unless specifically exempted by law. Personal property also is taxed, although most personal property owned by individuals is exempt. Personal property tax applies to personal property used when conducting business or to other personal property not exempt by law. All property taxes are paid to the county treasurer's office where the property is located. Washington does not impose a tax on intangible assets such as bank accounts, stocks or bonds. <b>Neither</b> <b>does</b> the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Washington does not collect inheritance taxes; however, the estate tax is decoupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore the state imposes its own estate tax.|$|E

500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and <b>neither</b> <b>does</b> “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E
