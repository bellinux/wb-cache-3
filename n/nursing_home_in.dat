40|$|Background and Objectives: We {{sought to}} obtain {{data about the}} {{prevalence}} of dementia <b>in</b> rural <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> Germany. Methods: We conducted our data between 2007 and 2009 in the diocese of Passau, Germany. By using a questionnaire we asked all <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> the area {{to provide information about}} patients with dementia. We obtained detailed data from three <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> by personal visits, telephone calls and mail. Results: Out of 72 <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> 40 provided the requested data. The 40 facilities included in our study house a total of 3, 928 residents, 1, 892 of whom are diagnosed with dementia (48 %). Three <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> provided us with more detailed information. Conclusions: We conclude that the prevalence of dementia <b>in</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> Germany is comparable to those rates reported in other countries. As {{there is a lack of}} information globally on rural populations affected by dementia, further international research in this area will give important insights into the risk factors, the variables influencing the course of the disease, and the special care needs of this population...|$|R

40|$|This {{study on}} the role and future {{development}} of <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> Ireland is a further contribution by the National Council for the Elderly to the series of studies on institutional care services for the elderly begun by its predecessor, the National Council for the Aged. Taking the Community as its focus, the Council's 1985 study, Institutional Care of the Elderly in Ireland established {{the context in which}} the general hospital and other hospital and institutional care services can best support the community caring network in achieving its full potential. The role of assessment and the concept of the community hospital were outlined and the issues of registration and funding of <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> were addressed. Two studies followed, <b>Nursing</b> <b>Homes</b> <b>in</b> the Republic of Ireland: A Study of the Private and Voluntary Sector and "It's Our Home": The Quality of Life in Private and Voluntary <b>Nursing</b> <b>Homes,</b> <b>in</b> 1986. These studies established the first profile of the structure and process of care in the private and voluntary sector as well as some of the perceptions of <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> residents about the quality of care. Together, these reports have contributed to the development of policy and legislation concerning <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> recent years. Many of the recommendations in The Years Ahead - A Policy for the Elderly (1988) and some of the provisions of the Health (<b>Nursing</b> <b>Homes)</b> Act, 1990 reflect the influence of these research reports...|$|R
50|$|There {{are special}} <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> Japan that offer service and {{assistance}} {{to more than}} 30 residents.

With many <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> Japan, the demand for more caregivers is high. In Japan, Family caregivers are preferred as the main caregiver, {{because it is a}} better support system if an elderly person is related to his/her caregiver. Therefore, it is possible that Japanese elderlies can perform ADL's with little assistance and live longer if his/her caregiver is a family caregiver.|$|R
