5|$|Baltimore {{was home}} to a major doo wop scene {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, which began with The Orioles, who are {{considered}} one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially. By the 1950s, Baltimore {{was home to}} numerous African American vocal groups, and talent scouts scoured the city for the <b>next</b> <b>big</b> stars. Many bands emerged from the city, including The Cardinals and The Plants. Some doo wop groups were connected with street gangs, and some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of The Marylanders. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street gang culture, and with the success of some local groups, pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a rough boundary between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as The Sonnets, The Jollyjacks, The Honey Boys, The Magictones and The Blentones, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as The Twilighters and The Four Buddies.|$|E

During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the <b>next</b> <b>big</b> thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States. He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that {{if any of the}} European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States. Newspapers printed his concerns that the <b>next</b> <b>big</b> war would be fought in the sky. Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller power driven airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible airship twenty-eight miles an hour and such an airship or a war airship twice that size traveling at forty-five miles an hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed. He was encouraging the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E
5|$|Tolliver {{began his}} junior year facing Florida State, a game where he {{suffered}} a hairline fracture in his foot, leaving him doubtful for the match. He missed the first three {{games of the season}} but returned in Texas Tech's fourth game against Baylor, completing 14 of 25 passes for 189 yards, a touchdown and an interception in a 36â€“22 loss. Tolliver's <b>next</b> <b>big</b> performance came against TCU, the same team he defeated 63â€“7 as a freshman. He threw a touchdown pass to Wayne Walker in the last minute to beat TCU, 36â€“35. He finished the season having passed for 1,422 yards and seven touchdowns in eight games. The next season, his senior year, Tolliver and Texas Tech sought to win the Southwest Conference. He started the season strong, throwing an 85-yard pass against Arizonaâ€”it was the third-longest pass in school historyâ€”but the Red Raiders started with two losses. By the end of the season, Tolliver had set 16 school records and was awarded the Southwest Conference Sportsmanship Award by the league's officials. After four seasons with the Texas Tech Red Raiders, he set the school record for career passing yards (6,756), career pass attempts (1,008), career pass completions (493), career touchdown passes (38), season passing yards in 1988 (2,869), and single game passing yards (446) against Oklahoma State University in 1988.

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to France, {{he was offered}} a script written by Georges-Jean Arnaud, an expatriate living in South America who had written about his own experiences there. Clouzot found it easy to imagine {{the setting of the}} script and was very anxious to film Arnaud's story. He started writing the film, The Wages of Fear, with his brother, Jean Clouzot, who would collaborate with him on all his subsequent films under the name of JÃ©rÃ´me Geronimi. Production on The Wages of Fear lasted from 1951 to 1952. In order to gain as much independence as possible, Clouzot created his own production company called VÃ©ra Films, which he named after his wife. The sole female role in The Wages of Fear is played by VÃ©ra. Clouzot wrote the role specifically for his wife, as the character does not exist in the original novel. The Wages of Fear is about a South American town where a group of desperate men are offered money to drive trucks carrying nitroglycerin through rough terrain to put out an oil well fire. The Wages of Fear was the second most popular film in France in 1953 and was seen by nearly 7million spectators. It won awards for Best Film and Best Actor (for Charles Vanel) at the Cannes Film Festival. Clouzot's <b>next</b> <b>big</b> hit was Diabolique, whose screenplay he took away from director Alfred Hitchcock. Diabolique involves the story of a cruel headmaster who brutalizes his wife and his mistress. The two women murder him and dump his body in a swimming pool, but when the pool is drained, no corpse is found. In 1954, Diabolique won the Louis Delluc Prize and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best foreign film. In this early and mid-1950s period, with the films The Wages of Fear and Diabolique, Clouzot came to be fully embraced by international critics and audiences. Both films were screened and reviewed in America as well as in France, and were rated among the best thrillers of the decade. In 1955, Clouzot directed the documentary The Mystery of Picasso, about the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso. The film follows Picasso drawing or painting 15 different works, all of which were intentionally destroyed following the film's production. Clouzot and Picasso were old acquaintances, having met when Clouzot was 14. The Mystery of Picasso won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, but was a financial failure in France, being seen by only 37,000 filmgoers during its initial run in 1956. In 1984, the film was declared a national treasure by the government of France.|$|E
