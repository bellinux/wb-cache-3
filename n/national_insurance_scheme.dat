25|$|The {{government}} won a {{third term}} at the 1937 election, with 44 of 74 seats and 50.6 percent of the two-party preferred vote against a reunited Labor Party led by John Curtin. As the international situation darkened in the late 1930s, Lyons, a long-term pacifist, became increasingly despondent. Most politicians expected that he would soon be replaced by Menzies, who resigned from Cabinet in protest at the government's inaction on the <b>national</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tryon {{became a}} strong {{supporter}} of the idea that in time of war there should be a <b>national</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> for merchant vessels. He was concerned that in the event of war insurance rates for vessels against loss by enemy action would immediately become impossibly high, so that merchant ships would simply stop trading with Britain, even if the numbers being lost were relatively small. This would be disastrous for the country, so it would be far better for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.|$|E

2500|$|In Britain, {{sickness}} benefits were introduced by David Lloyd George, Winston Churchill and other [...] reformers {{as part of}} the radical changes to social security brought about by the National Insurance Act 1911. These Edwardian-era reforms were incorporated into the Welfare State after the Second World War - although until the early 1970s, the post-war <b>National</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> treated everyone who became eligible for benefits after losing their job in largely the same way, {{regardless of whether or not}} they were disabled.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, the new Labour Government {{began the}} process of implementing Beveridge's proposals that provided {{the basis of the}} modern Welfare State. Clement Attlee and the Labour Party defeated Winston Churchill's Conservative Party at the 1945 general election. Attlee announced he would introduce the Welfare State outlined in the 1942 Beveridge Report. This included the establishment of a National Health Service in 1948 with taxpayer funded medical treatment for all. A national system of benefits was also introduced to provide [...] "social security" [...] so that the population would be protected from the [...] "cradle to the grave". The new system was partly built upon the <b>National</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> set up by Liberal Prime Minister, David Lloyd George in 1911.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Saudi Healthcare System is universal, financed {{entirely from}} {{government}} revenue principally derived from oil, and is ‘free {{at the point}} of delivery’ (non-contributory). However, this system is unlikely to be sustainable in the medium to long term. This study investigates the feasibility and acceptability of healthcare financing reform by examining households’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a contributory <b>national</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b> Methods: Using the contingent valuation method, a pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 1187 heads of household in Jeddah province over a 5 -month period. Multi-stage sampling was employed to select the study sample. Using a double-bounded dichotomous choice with the follow-up elicitation method, respondents were asked to state their WTP for a hypothetical contributory <b>national</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b> Tobit regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with WTP and assess the construct validity of elicited WTP. Results: Over two-thirds (69. 6 %) indicated that they were willing to participate in and pay for a contributory <b>national</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b> The mean WTP was 50 Saudi Riyal (US$ 13. 33) per household member per month. Tobit regression analysis showed that household size, satisfaction with the quality of public healthcare services, perceptions about financing healthcare, education and income were the main determinants of WTP. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a theoretically valid WTP for a contributory <b>national</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> by Saudi people. The research shows that willingness to participate in and pay for a contributory <b>national</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> depends on participant characteristics. Identifying and understanding the main influencing factors associated with WTP are important to help facilitate establishing and implementing the <b>national</b> health <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b> The results could assist policy-makers to develop and set insurance premiums, thus providing an additional source of healthcare financing...|$|R
