40|$|<b>Nanotechnology</b> {{publications}} {{as one of}} {{the parameters}} of a country's level of <b>nanotechnology</b> (nanotech innovation), while <b>nanotechnology</b> innovations are considered the source of its competitive advantage. The country's competitiveness in the level of <b>nanotechnology</b> activity determine the total number of <b>nanotechnology</b> publications and the mean number of citations. In this paper, we have analyzed the scientific <b>nanotechnology</b> activity of the most active countries in this field (countries whose number of <b>nanotechnology</b> publications exceeds 1, 000 annually). We used data on <b>nanotechnology</b> publications collected from Web of Science - WoS database and published by Nano Statistics - Nano Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard.
