5000|$|The word [...] "catarrh" [...] {{was widely}} used in {{medicine}} since before the era of medical science, which explains why it has various senses and in older texts may be synonymous with, or vaguely indistinguishable from, common cold, <b>nasopharyngitis,</b> pharyngitis, rhinitis, or sinusitis.

50|$|Radiance is a double-blind, placebo {{controlled}} phase combined II/III {{clinical trial}} {{for the treatment of}} relapsing multiple sclerosis (NCT01628393). For the phase II trial, 258 patients, ages 18-55 with RMS (Mean Expanded Disability Status Scale of 2.9) were assigned either placebo, 0.5 mg or 1 mg of oral ozanimod followed by 1 week of dose escalation. Ozanimod significantly reduced MRI lesion activity in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis over a period of 24 weeks. Both doses of ozanimod reached anticipated range of 60-70% decreased lymphocyte count, and were well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with a previous phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The most common adverse effects as compared to the placebo were: <b>nasopharyngitis,</b> headache, and urinary-tract infections, with no serious infectious or cardiac adverse effects. With these results, both doses of ozanimod were taken forward into the 2-year long phase III trial and is completed but unpublished as of November 2016.|$|E

A total of 98 isolates (3. 9 per patient), 45 aerobes (1. 8 per patient) and 53 anaerobes (2. 1 per patient), were isolated in patients with purulent <b>nasopharyngitis.</b> Seventy-three isolates (2. 9 per patient), 47 aerobes (1. 9 per patient) and 26 anaerobes (1. 0 per patient) were found in the controls.

40|$|Background. Acute {{respiratory}} infections (ARI) are {{leaders in}} the structure of general diseases of the population. In Russia, each year about 70 thousand ARI cases occur per 100 thousand child population. The maximum frequency of acute respiratory infections is noted at the age from 6 months to 6 years. Among this group, the highest incidence of acute respiratory infections is observed for children of preschool age. Viral infections are leading among the causes of acute respiratory disease (90 %) and only a minor part of them consist of bacterial pathogens. Despite this, almost 25 – 85 % of pediatricians prescribe to their patients antibiotics for acute respiratory infections. The Aim. Analysis of the spectrum of antibacterial drugs used in acute <b>nasopharyngitis</b> in preschool children in an outpatient setting. Methods. The study was formed by a representative group in the amount of 1248 outpatients preschool children. The article presents the nosological forms of acute respiratory infections to study the spectrum of applied systemic antibiotics in acute <b>nasopharyngitis</b> in preschool children in an outpatient setting. Results. In the structure of ARI for the period 2009 – 2010, the incidence of acute <b>nasopharyngitis</b> dominates and is more than 60 %. During pharmacoepidemiological analysis the frequency of using systemic antibiotics in children with acute <b>nasopharyngitis</b> on an outpatient basis was established. It was found that antibiotic therapy was applied in 43 (2009) and 37 % (2010) ARI cases. Most often it were aminopenicillins, combined penicillins, macrolides, cephalosporins of the III-rd generation. Conclusion. Given the prevalence of acute <b>nasopharyngitis</b> among ARI nosological forms, it should be emphasized that most of them are uncomplicated, which may serve as important basis for the rational use of systemic antibiotics on empirical choice in the conditions of outpatient care. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{studies suggest}} that the {{concentration}} of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D &# 91; 25 (OH) D&# 93; in cord blood may show an inverse association with respiratory tract infections (RTI) during childhood. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the influence of 25 (OH) D concentrations in cord blood on infant RTI in a Korean birth cohort. Methods: The levels of 25 (OH) D in cord blood obtained from 525 Korean newborns in the prospective COhort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and allergic diseases were examined. The primary outcome variable of interest was the prevalence of RTI at 6 -month follow-up, as diagnosed by pediatricians and pediatric allergy and pulmonology specialists. RTI included acute <b>nasopharyngitis,</b> rhinosinusitis, otitis media, croup, tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Results: The median concentration of 25 (OH) D in cord blood was 32. 0 nmol&# 47;L (interquartile range, 21. 4 to 53. 2). One hundred and eighty neonates (34. 3 &# 37;) showed 25 (OH) D concentrations less than 25. 0 nmol&# 47;L, 292 (55. 6 &# 37;) showed 25 (OH) D concentrations of 25. 0 &# 38;amp&# 59;&# 35; 8211 &# 59; 74. 9 nmol&# 47;L, and 53 (10. 1 &# 37;) showed concentrations of ?# 247; 5. 0 nmol&# 47;L. Adjusting for the season of birth, multivitamin intake during pregnancy, and exposure to passive smoking during pregnancy, 25 (OH) D concentrations showed an inverse association with the risk of acquiring acute <b>nasopharyngitis</b> by 6 months of age (P for trend&# 61; 0. 0004). Conclusion: The results show that 89. 9 &# 37; of healthy newborns in Korea are born with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency (55. 6 &# 37; and 34. 3 &# 37;, respectively). Cord blood vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in healthy neonates is associated with an increased risk of acute <b>nasopharyngitis</b> by 6 months of age. More time spent outdoors and more intensified vitamin D supplementation for pregnant women may be needed to prevent the onset of acute <b>nasopharyngitis</b> in infants...|$|E
40|$|Nitrative and {{oxidative}} DNA damage {{plays an}} important role in inflammation-related carcinogenesis. To investigate the involvement of stem cells in Epstein-Barr virus infection-related nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we used double immunofluorescence staining to examine several cancer stem/progenitor cell markers (CD 44 v 6, CD 24, and ALDH 1 A 1) in NPC tissues and NPC cell lines. We also measured 8 -nitroguanine formation as an indicator of inflammation-related DNA lesions. The staining intensity of 8 -nitroguanine was significantly higher in cancer cells and inflammatory cells in the stroma of NPC tissues than in chronic <b>nasopharyngitis</b> tissues. Expression levels of CD 44 v 6 and ALDH 1 A 1 were significantly increased in cancer cells of primary NPC specimens in comparison to chronic <b>nasopharyngitis</b> tissues. Similarly, more intense staining of CD 44 v 6 and ALDH 1 A 1 was detected in an NPC cell line than in an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. In the case of CD 24 staining, there was no significant difference between NPC and chronic <b>nasopharyngitis</b> tissues. 8 -Nitroguanine was detected in both CD 44 v 6 - and ALDH 1 A 1 -positive stem cells in NPC tissues. In conclusion, CD 44 v 6 and ALDH 1 A 1 are candidate stem cell markers for NPC, and the increased formation of DNA lesions by inflammation may result in the mutation of stem cells, leading to tumor development in NPC...|$|E
