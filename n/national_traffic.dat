5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the <b>National</b> <b>Traffic</b> Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E

The {{complexity}} of <b>national</b> defense <b>traffic</b> system of systems (SoS) has been increasingly emerging, and the <b>national</b> defense <b>traffic</b> construction has {{entered into a}} new stage for exploring emergence of SoS capacity. It is of great significance for promoting the construction of <b>national</b> defense <b>traffic</b> to model the SoS using the SoS theory. The SoS construction theory and hierarchical division method were used in this paper, the concept connotation of <b>national</b> defense <b>traffic</b> SoS was defined, and the traits were analyzed. Meanwhile, the ROPI hierarchical model for <b>national</b> defense <b>traffic</b> SoS was constructed, and the concept abstract mode was established...|$|R

In the film To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, Miss Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) remarked while trying out a vintage yellow convertible, [...] "I feel like Miss Jayne Mansfield in this car!" [...] Noxeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes) replied [...] "Uh oh, Jayne Mansfield, not a good auto reference." [...] In Severance: Stories, the 2006 story book containing 62 postmortem monologues, each 240-words long, by Robert Olen Butler, a Pulitzer Award winning writer, Mansfield's death is included along with James Dean, John the Baptist, Maximilien Robespierre, Marie Antoinette, Cicero and others. The underride guard, a strong bar made of steel tubing fitted underneath the rear portion of a semi-trailer, is also known as a Mansfield bar, commemorating her accident that occurred before the <b>National</b> <b>Traffic</b> and Motor Vehicle Safety Act required underride guards on semi-trailers.|$|E

2500|$|Consumer {{protection}} activist Ralph Nader {{addressed the}} handling {{issues of the}} first-generation (1960–1963) Corvair in his 1965 book: Unsafe at Any Speed. GM had over 100 lawsuits pending in connection with crashes involving the Corvair, which subsequently became the initial material for Nader's investigations. The book highlighted crashes related to the Corvair's suspension and identified the Chevrolet suspension engineer who had fought management's decision to remove—for cost reasons—the front anti-sway bar installed on later models. Nader said during subsequent Congressional hearings, the Corvair is [...] "the leading candidate for the un-safest-car title". Subsequently, Corvair sales fell from 220,000 in 1965 to 109,880 in 1966. By 1968 production fell to 14,800.

2500|$|To {{complement}} the burst of activity and interest being generated in DX communications by {{the popularity of}} the International Relay Parties, the ARRL adopted a competitive operating format for events designed for non-international contacts. [...] The first ARRL All-Sections Sweepstakes Contest was started in 1930. [...] The Sweepstakes required a more complicated exchange of information for each two-way contact that was adapted from the message header structure used by the <b>National</b> <b>Traffic</b> System. [...] The competition was immediately popular, both with those operators active in the NTS who participated as an opportunity to gauge the merits of their station and operating skills, and among those for whom the competitive excitement of the event was the primary attraction.
