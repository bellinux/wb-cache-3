5|$|For {{his part}} in the battle, King was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 20 January 1944. He {{considered}} it a form of unit award, and later regretted <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> Whitehead for an American Distinguished Unit Citation, such as was awarded to D Company of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, for a similar action in the Battle of Long Tan in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E

25|$|An {{extension}} of Novardok's unconventional approach entailed {{the establishment of}} numerous branches of the yeshiva. The most elite students of the yeshiva would set out on foot to strange communities without money in their pockets, simultaneously abstaining from speech and <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> for a ride or even food. Upon reaching a town, they would enter the Beth Midrash, and without a word to anyone, study Torah.|$|E
25|$|Tutu {{expressed}} {{the view that}} Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were <b>not</b> <b>asking.</b> For Tutu, two major questions were being posed by African Christianity: how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage. He believed {{that there were many}} comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament.|$|E

25|$|By <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> {{about the}} horses, Confucius {{demonstrates}} that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius, as an exemplar of human excellence, serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of humanism.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} they got to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two {{youngest}} sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to climb into the boats that were waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them {{to get out of the}} boat and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> him to visit the ship, but forcing him. At this point he stopped and sat down.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers {{and other}} media criticized the actions taken by the crew {{and said that the}} pilots took too long to {{initiate}} an emergency descent; the initial NTSB report was especially critical of Cameron for <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> about the exact nature of the fire and not immediately initiating emergency descent when the fire was first reported. Cameron admitted in a press conference following the issuance of the NTSB report that he assumed the problem was a garbage bin fire, a common cause of lavatory fires when smoking was still allowed on flights.|$|E

25|$|Many media {{accounts}} {{have linked}} this story with Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress that involved Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the first Muslim {{elected to the}} US Congress. Ellison's desire to use a Qur'an at the ceremonial reenactment of his oath, while symbolically important, was never a judicial issue. The swearing-in was en masse and involved no texts whatsoever. Both of the main figures taking issue with Ellison, Dennis Prager and US Representative Virgil Goode of Virginia, made sure to clarify that they were <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> {{for him to be}} banned from serving if he insisted on using a Qur'an instead of a Bible at his reenactment photo-op. In this regard the Matten case is far more significant.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "Why do I sense, together with the current expansion, a shrinking of vision, an expansion of surface rather than depth, a failure of imagination?....Why is not social psychology more exciting, more human in the most usual sense of that term? To sum up, is this discipline perhaps on the wrong track?" [...] (Asch, p. x) Asch was worried that social psychologists were <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> the deeper questions that would help change and improve the world.|$|E
5000|$|Kennard was {{sentence}}d to seven years in prison, to be served in Parchman Penitentiary, the state's high-security facility. This sentence prevented his ever applying again to any of Mississippi's all-white colleges. Roberts was given five years' probation and freed. In 2005, when an investigation was re-opened into the case, Roberts testified under oath that Kennard was innocent: [...] "Kennard did <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> me to steal, Kennard did <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> me {{to break into the}} co-op, Kennard did <b>not</b> <b>ask</b> me to do anything illegal." ...|$|R

500|$|During the January 7 debate, Huntsman was {{attacked}} by Romney for serving as President Barack Obama's Ambassador to China. In response, at the debate the following day, Huntsman responded: [...] "I was criticized last night by Governor Romney for putting my country first, I just want to remind the people here in New Hampshire and throughout the United States that he criticized me while he was out raising money for serving my country in China, yes under a Democrat, like my two sons {{who are in the}} United States Navy.

These are difficult times, and we are <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> for anything elaborate. What is fitting and right is a memorial that can take its place among those commemorating the other great conflicts of the past century. On this 92nd anniversary of the armistice, it is time to move forward with honor, gratitude, and resolve." ...|$|E
500|$|Dworkin's {{short fiction}} and novels often {{incorporated}} elements from {{her life and}} themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator. Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in Ice and Fire as representations of Dworkin's own views. cf. Dworkin, however, wrote [...] "My fiction is not autobiography. I am not an exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> for forgiveness. I {{do not want to}} confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown {{so that it can be}} faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life.

He noted {{that the price of}} bread had doubled in the environs of the park. Evelyn also went out to Moorfields, which was turning into the main point of assembly for the homeless, and was horrified at the numbers of distressed people filling it, some under tents, others in makeshift shacks: [...] "Many [...] without a rag or any necessary utensils, bed or board... reduced to extremest misery and poverty." [...] Evelyn was impressed by the pride of these distressed Londoners, [...] "tho' ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> one pennie for relief." ...|$|E
500|$|In Lucha Libre {{there is}} a long-standing {{tradition}} of keeping the personal information of masked wrestlers private from the public, including wrestling promotions not revealing their real names and news outlets <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> for personal details in interviews. Because of this tradition the real name of the wrestler known under the ring names Rey Hechicero and Hechicero is not public knowledge, nor has the year of his birth been established, Hechicero himself has stated that he made his debut, on February 15, 2001, referring to it as [...] "Hechicero's" [...] birthday. Hechicero resides in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico {{but it has not}} been confirmed if this is also his birthplace. During interviews he revealed that he had been trained by a number of Monterrey local wrestlers both before making his debut and after such as Arcángel, Cachorrro Zapata, Chucho Villa, Garringo, Mario Segura, Pequeño Diamante and Katsuyori Shibata.|$|E
500|$|That August, Brownlee {{received}} a letter from MacLean reading in part [...] "We have been instructed to commence action against you for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan." [...] Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal Royal Commission on Banking and Currency, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson. [...] He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave. [...] She eventually relented and let him in; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded [...] "what about you?" [...] Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> you to refrain from your action, but I {{want to tell you that}} the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its money you are after, I haven't got it." ...|$|E
