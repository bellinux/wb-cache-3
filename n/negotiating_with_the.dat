Her coronation as queen of Hungary took place in St. Martin's Cathedral, Pressburg on 25 June 1741 after she had spent months honing the equestrian skills necessary for the ceremony and <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Diet.|$|E

The latter wanted the principality under direct Imperial rule with Michael acting as governor. The Wallachian voivode, {{on the other}} hand, wanted the title of Prince of Transylvania for himself and equally claimed the Partium region. Michael was, nevertheless, willing to acknowledge Habsburg overlordship.|$|E

5|$|By 1972 FANK was decimated, {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was rampant. The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million tons in 1969 to 493,000 tons in 1973. Popular {{support for the war}} against the North Vietnamese and the insurgents had completely evaporated. The Americans, <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese, had proposed an Indochina-wide cease fire as part of the final settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam. By that time, however, Hanoi could make no commitment on behalf of its Cambodian allies.|$|E
5|$|Oskar Schindler {{became one}} of the committee's contacts, {{smuggling}} letters and money into the Kraków ghetto on their behalf. During a visit by Schindler to Budapest in November 1943, they learned that he had been bribing Nazi officers to let him bring Jewish refugees into his factory in Poland, which he ran as a safe haven. This further encouraged the committee, after the invasion of Hungary, to try <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> SS.|$|E

The bank, which held many assets of the Oregon Common School Fund, failed during Hobbs' time there. Ben Olcott, who was the Secretary of State and a member of the State Land Board, was charged with protecting the Common School Fund, and was involved in <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> failing bank over the State's assets.

On 27 April, Tsakalotos was the made the coordinator of the Greek team <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> creditor's representatives over this new bailout plan. This move was largely seen as sidelining Yanis Varoufakis, the Minister of Finance, but the markets reacted positively.|$|E

5|$|While the Beatles were there, the Maharishi was <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Indian {{government}} {{to use some}} nearby parkland for an airstrip for a plane {{which he had been}} given; a deal which several thousand landless peasants objected to as they had been denied the use of the land for farming. The ashram was surrounded by barbed wire and the gates were kept locked and guarded. While the Maharishi kept the media away from his famous students, he himself gave interviews to the press.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Nasser {{returned}} to his role as an instructor at the Royal Military Academy. He sent emissaries to forge an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood in October 1948, but soon concluded that the religious agenda of the Brotherhood was not compatible with his nationalism. From then on, Nasser prevented the Brotherhood's influence over his cadres' activities without severing ties with the organization. Nasser was sent {{as a member of}} the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily occupy the Eilat region while <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Arabs in March.|$|E
5|$|As Finland was <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres paid {{attention}} to the Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was going to hold. The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain in the area of Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. Directly behind the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E

This action caused an internal revolt among Hesse's SPD Landtag members, resulting in Ypsilanti being cast out as leader and new elections being called.|$|R
5|$|The {{removal of}} the eastern threat {{and the rise of}} the Byzantines' {{confidence}} also opened up opportunities in the west, where the Bulgarian ruler Boris (r. 852–889) had been <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pope and Louis the German (r. 817–876) for a possible conversion of himself and his pagan people to Christianity. This expansion of Rome's ecclesiastic influence up to Constantinople's very doorstep could not be tolerated by the Byzantine government. In 864, the victorious eastern armies were transferred to Europe and invaded Bulgaria, in a demonstration of military might that convinced Boris to accept Byzantine missionaries instead. Boris was baptized, taking the name Michael in honor of the Byzantine emperor, thus beginning the Christianization of Bulgaria and initiating the nation's absorption into the Byzantine-influenced, Eastern Orthodox world.|$|E
5|$|Charles's only {{recourse}} was {{to return}} to negotiations, which were held at Newport on the Isle of Wight. On 5 December 1648, Parliament voted by 129 to 83 to continue <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> king, but Oliver Cromwell and the army opposed any further talks with someone they viewed as a bloody tyrant and were already taking action to consolidate their power. Hammond was replaced as Governor of the Isle of Wight on 27 November, {{and placed in the}} custody of the army the following day. In Pride's Purge on 6 and 7 December, the members of Parliament out of sympathy with the military were arrested or excluded by Colonel Thomas Pride, while others stayed away voluntarily. The remaining members formed the Rump Parliament. It was effectively a military coup.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mutineers, {{although}} {{this was not}} Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported to Congress that the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military option {{would be unlikely to}} succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on a bill that would grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E

5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E
5|$|Lihau {{traveled}} to the secessionist State of Katanga in November {{to negotiate with the}} rebellious province's leaders. He assisted in organising and subsequently took part in the Léopoldville Conference in January 1961 to discuss political compromise and reform. He also participated in the Tananarive Conference in March and the following Coquilhatville Conference in April on behalf of Iléo to try and bring about a reconciliation among the dissident factions in the Congo. As result of the latter conference, Iléo created a commission to prepare a new constitution for the Congo and appointed Lihau to chair it. Lihau {{played a key role in}} the drafting process from that point forward. In June he joined Cyrille Adoula and Jean Bolikango in <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> representatives of the Stanleyville government. Their meetings continued into July and resulted in the reconvening of Parliament and the Stanleyville government agreeing to disband. In January 1963 Lihau was hired to be professor and dean of the faculty of law at the University of Lovanium (later the National University of Zaire). He encouraged his students to adopt a constitutionalist approach to law.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{recruits}} The Lone Gunmen to {{help him}} break into a high security research facility where he thinks he {{may be able to}} find more information on how to save Scully. Meanwhile, Skinner tries to deal directly with The Smoking Man for Scully's life, who tells him he will get back to him. Inside the facility, Mulder discovers that Dr. Scanlon works alongside several clones of Kurt Crawford. The clones show him Scully's harvested ova and tell him they are trying to save the abducted women's lives, since they acted as their birth mothers. They also hope to subvert the colonization project as an inside job. Mulder takes Scully's ova and leaves, being pursued by the Gray-Haired Man as he escapes. He returns to the hospital to see Scully, who tells him that Penny has died but that she intends to fight the disease. Afterward, Mulder phones Skinner for letting him know Scully's doing ok and may return to work soon, as well as for thanking him for his advice about not <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Smoking Man, after which Skinner and the Smoking Man come to terms on their deal in seclusion.|$|E
