40|$|The {{expression}} and subcellular localization of neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> tumor suppressor was studied in keratinocytes induced to differentiate by increased Ca 2 + {{concentration of the}} culture medium. Differentiating keratinocytes became intensely immunoreactive for neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein, which was apparently associated with cellular fibrils. Double immunolabeling with antibodies to cytokeratin 14 and neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein suggested an association of intermediate type cytoskeleton and neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein. The presence of neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein in cell preparations treated with cytoskeletal buffer indicated a high affinity interaction between intermediate filaments and neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein. Further studies utilizing double immunolabelings revealed that the intense neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> tumor suppressor signal on intermediate filaments was temporally limited to the period in keratinocyte differentiation in which the formation of desmosomes takes place. Keratinocytes were also cultured from nine patients with <b>type</b> <b>1</b> neurofibromatosis and were studied with respect to cell morphology, and association of neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> protein with intermediate cytoskeleton. The results showed that keratinocytes cultured from patients with neurofibromatosis <b>type</b> <b>1</b> displayed a highly variable cell size and morphology compared to controls.

METHODS Blood flow in the multifidus muscles was measured intra-operatively using LSCI prior to insertion of the retractors, immediately after hemilaminectomy and removal of the retractors, and after 10 minutes of lavage of the surgical site. Plasma creatine kinase levels were measured preoperatively and 12 - 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS Muscular blood flow was significantly decreased following retraction and remained lower than initial values 10 minutes after lavage in all dogs. The decrease in blood flow was significantly greater with Gelpi retractors (n = 8) than with Grevel retractors (n = 10). No significant relation was found between the duration of retraction and postoperative changes in creatine kinase levels or blood flow. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Findings in this study demonstrate a drop in blood flow within the multifidus muscles using the dorsolateral approach regardless of <b>retractor</b> <b>type</b> used. Gelpi <b>retractors</b> seem to have greater influence on muscular blood flow than Grevel retractors. Further studies are warranted to confirm this second finding...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two major}} types of diabetes, <b>type</b> <b>1</b> and <b>type</b> 2 diabetes. Similarly {{characterized}} by hyperglycaemia and long term micro- and macrovascular complications, <b>type</b> <b>1</b> and <b>type</b> 2 diabetes have different underlying pathophysiologic processes. In Scandinavia, <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes is common; type 2 diabetes accounts for 85 % of all cases with diabetes. There is emerging evidence that <b>type</b> <b>1</b> and <b>type</b> 2 diabetes cluster in the same families. 10 % of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have autoantibodies against GAD 65 (GADabs). The presence of GADabs predicts the development of insulin deficiency in patients with type 2 diabetes (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, i. e. LADA). The aim of the thesis was to study whether genetic interaction exists between <b>type</b> <b>1</b> and <b>type</b> 2 diabetes. In a population-based study in Finland, the prevalence of families with both <b>type</b> <b>1</b> and <b>type</b> 2 diabetes (mixed <b>type</b> <b>1</b> /type 2 diabetes families, or mixed <b>type</b> <b>1</b> / 2) among type 2 diabetes families was 14 %. 5 % of type 2 diabetic probands had a first-degree relative with <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes. <b>Type</b> 2 diabetic patients from the mixed families had more often GADabs (18 % vs. 8 %; p< 0. 0001) and HLA DQB 1 * 0302 /X genotype (25 % vs. 12 %; p= 0. 005) {{associated with an increased}} risk for <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes than those from the common type 2 diabetes families. However, compared with adult onset <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetic patients (GADabs, 65 %), mixed <b>type</b> <b>1</b> / 2 patients had lower frequencies of GADabs (p< 0. 0001) and DQB 1 * 02 / 0302 genotype (4 % vs. 27 %, p< 0. 0001) conferring the highest risk for <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes. Despite similar age and lipid profile, <b>type</b> <b>1</b> / 2 patients had a more severe beta cell dysfunction, but less features of metabolic syndrome than the common type 2 diabetic patients. Sharing a risk HLA haplotype at the IDDM 1 locus with a <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetic family member could explain most of the genetic influence of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> on <b>type</b> 2 diabetes.

While constitutive expression of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae resulted in a significant decrease in motility and flagellin expression (P < 0. 0001), a loss of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbrial expression did not result in increased motility. Additionally, hypermotility and flagellar gene over- and underexpression were not observed to affect the expression of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae. Hence, it appeared that the relationship between <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbrial expression and motility is unidirectional, where the overexpression of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae dramatically affects motility and flagellum expression but not vice versa. Moreover, the constitutive expression of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae in UPEC cystitis isolate F 11 and the laboratory strain E. coli K- 12 MG 1655 also resulted in decreased motility, suggesting that this phenomenon is not specific to CFT 073 or UPEC in general. Lastly, by analyzing the repression of motility caused by constitutive <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbrial expression, it was concluded that the synthesis and presence of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> fimbriae at the bacterial surface is only partially responsible for the repression of motility, as evidenced by the partial restoration of motility in the CFT 073 fim L-ON ΔfimAICDFGH mutant.

Two models of G 6 Pase catalysis have been proposed to explain the observed heterogeneities. The translocase-catalytic unit model proposes that five GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> subgroups exist which correspond to defects in the G 6 Pase catalytic unit (1 a), a stabilizing protein (1 aSP), the glucose- 6 -P (1 b), phosphate/pyrophosphate (1 c), and glucose (1 d) translocases.

We have recently demonstrated that mutations in the G 6 Pase catalytic unit cause GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> a. To elucidate whether mutations in the G 6 Pase gene are responsible for other GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> subgroups, we characterized the G 6 Pase gene of GSD <b>type</b> <b>1</b> b, 1 c, and 1 aSP patients.

This implies {{that there is a}} high level of specific affinity for <b>type</b> <b>1</b> but not for type 3 to microtubules, since it has previously been determined that only 50 % of randomly associated particles would be associated with the edge. The high edge binding of reovirus <b>type</b> <b>1</b> is virtually independent of the origin of microtubule, or of whether microtubules or virus has been initially adhered to the support film. On the other hand, reovirus <b>type</b> <b>1</b> -specific antiserum reduced the edge binding or reovirus <b>type</b> <b>1</b> to 45 %, whereas type 3 specific antiserum caused no less (within the variability of the assay) of the edge binding of reovirus <b>type</b> <b>1</b> to microtubules (76 % edge bound). High edge binding of reovirus <b>type</b> <b>1</b> to microtubules is correlated with the presence of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> or sigma 1 polypeptide. This minor outer capsid polypeptide is encoded in the S 1 double-stranded RNA segment and is the viral hemagglutinin and neutralization antigen. Recombinant reovirus clones containing the S 1 double-stranded RNA segment of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> (80 and 802) show about 85 % edge binding, as compared to a value of 42 % for clones and the S <b>1</b> gene of <b>type</b> 3 (204. Electron microscopy of purified reovirus <b>types</b> <b>1</b> and 3 by negative staining reveals that <b>type</b> <b>1</b> and 802 capsomers are distinctly visualized, whereas those of type 3 and 204 appear diffuse. Thus, the greater in vitro binding of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> to microtubules may reflect an increased accessibility of certain of its outer capsomers, and thereby, sigma 1 polypeptides to microtubules. Examination of its outer sections of reovirus <b>type</b> <b>1</b> - and 3 -infected cells at 24 to 48 h postinfection at 31 degrees C showed that about eight times as many viral factoris in <b>type</b> <b>1</b> -infected cells exhibited an extensive association of virus particles with microtubules, as compared to viral factories of type 3 -infected cells. Thus, both in vivo and in vitro {{there appears to be a}} greater specificity for the association of reovirus <b>type</b> <b>1</b> particles with microtubules, as compared to reovirus type 3 particles...|$|R
40|$|Patients with fulminant <b>type</b> <b>1</b> {{diabetes}} {{almost completely}} lack C-peptide even {{soon after the}} onset of the disease, and the deficiency continues {{for the rest of their}} life. Thus, fulminant <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes could serve as a good model of nature to explore the physiological role of C-peptide. For example, patients with fulminant <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes have diabetic chronic complications more frequently than those with classical autoimmune <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes 5 years after the onset of diabetes, and the higher prevalence could be partly attributable to the complete lack of C-peptide in fulminant <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Interferon therapy {{can trigger}} {{induction}} of several autoimmune diseases, in-cluding <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes. To assess the clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes induced by interferon therapy, {{we conducted a}} nationwide cross-sectional survey. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS—Clinical characteristics, anti-islet autoantibodies, and HLA-DR typing were examined in 91 patients for whom <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes developed during or shortly after interferon therapy. RESULTS—Median age {{at the onset of}} <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes was 56 (interquartile range 48 – 63) years and mean 6 SD BMI was 20. 8 6 2. 7 kg/m 2. The time period from the initiation of interferon therapy to <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes onset in patients receiving pegylated interferon and ribavirin was significantly shorter than that in patients with nonpegylated interferon single therapy (P, 0. 05). Anti-islet autoantibodies were detected in 94. 5 % of patients at diabetes onset. <b>Type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes susceptibility HLA-DRs in the Japanese population, DR 4 and DR 9, were also associated with interferon treatment–related <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes. Furthermore, the prevalence of HLA-DR 13 was significantly higher in interferon treatment–related <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes than in healthy control sub-jects (odds ratio 3. 80 [95 %CI 2. 20 – 7. 55]; P, 0. 0001) and classical <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes (2. 15 [1. 17...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes costs {{represent}} a large burden to both patients {{and the health}} care system. However, few studies that examine the economic consequences of diabetes have distinguished between the two major forms, <b>type</b> <b>1</b> and <b>type</b> 2 diabetes, despite differences in underlying pathologies. Combining the two diseases implies {{that there is no}} difference between the costs of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> and <b>type</b> 2 diabetes to a patient. In this study, we examine the costs of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes, which is often overlooked due to the larger population of type 2 patients, and compare them to the estimated costs of diabetes reported in the literature. Using a nationally representative dataset, we estimate yearly and lifetime medical and indirect costs of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes by implementing a matching method to compare a patient with <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes to a similar individual without the disease. We find that each year <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes costs this country $ 14. 4 billion (11. 5 - 17. 3) in medical costs and lost income. In terms of lost income, <b>type</b> <b>1</b> patients incur a disproportionate share of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> and <b>type</b> 2 costs. Further, if the disease were eliminated by therapeutic intervention, an estimated $ 10. 6 billion (7. 2 - 14. 0) incurred by a new cohort and $ 422. 9 billion (327. 2 - 519. 4) incurred by the existing number of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetic patients over their lifetime would be avoided. We find that the costs attributed to <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes are disproportionately higher than the number of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> patients compared with type 2 patients, suggesting that combining the two diseases when estimating costs is not appropriate. This study and another recent contribution provides a necessary first step in estimating the substantial costs of <b>type</b> <b>1</b> diabetes on the U. S...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{approaches}} to pancreatic endocrine tumors associated with {{multiple endocrine neoplasia}} <b>type</b> <b>1</b> may differ greatly from those applied to sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors. Presurgical diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> is therefore crucial to plan a proper intervention. Of note, hyperparathyroidism/multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> should be surgically treated before pancreatic endocrine tumors/multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> resection, apart from insulinoma. Non-functioning pancreatic endocrine tumors/multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> > 1 cm have {{a high risk of}} malignancy and should be treated by a pancreatic resection associated with lymphadenectomy. The vast majority of patients with gastrinoma/multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> present with tumor lesions at the duodenum, so the surgery of choice is subtotal or total pancreatoduodenectomy followed by regional lymphadenectomy. The usual surgical treatment for insulinoma/multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> is distal pancreatectomy up to the mesenteric vein with or without spleen preservation, associated with enucleation of tumor lesions in the pancreatic head. Surgical procedures for glucagonomas, somatostatinomas, and vipomas/ multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> are similar to those applied to sporadic pancreatic endocrine tumors. Some of these surgical strategies for pancreatic endocrine tumors/multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> still remain controversial as to their proper extension and timing. Furthermore, surgical resection of single hepatic metastasis secondary to pancreatic endocrine tumors/multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> may be curative and even in multiple liver metastases surgical resection is possible. Hepatic trans-arterial chemo-embolization is usually associated with surgical resection. Liver transplantation may be needed for select cases. Finally, pre-surgical clinical and genetic diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> syndrome and localization of multiple endocrine neoplasia <b>type</b> <b>1</b> related tumors are crucial for determining the best surgical strategies in each individual case with pancreatic endocrine tumors...|$|R
