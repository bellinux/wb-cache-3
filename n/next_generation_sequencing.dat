25|$|Microsatellites were popularized in {{population}} genetics during the 1990s because as PCR became ubiquitous in laboratories researchers {{were able to}} design primers and amplify sets of microsatellites at low cost. Their uses are wide-ranging. A microsatellite with a neutral evolutionary history makes it applicable for measuring or inferring bottlenecks, local adaptation, the allelic fixation index (FST), population size, and gene flow. As <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> becomes more affordable the use of microsatellites has decreased, however they remain a crucial tool in the field.|$|E
25|$|Whole {{transcriptome}} {{shotgun sequencing}} (WTSS) {{is the latest}} in gene expression studies, using <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> (NGS) to quantify RNA in samples on a high throughput scale. As biology trends toward using RNA-seq over microarray analysis in evaluating the transcriptome, so does degradomics. The field adapts the approach to analyzing the presence and quantity of transcripts of proteases, their substrates, and their inhibitors. While developed microarrays remain a major workhorse in studying gene expression in degradomics, its limitations of cross hybridization and dynamic range issues suggest RNA-seq will take a larger role as costs decrease and analysis improves.|$|E
25|$|Mutation rate {{of human}} genome {{is a very}} {{important}} factor in calculating evolutionary time points. Researchers calculated the number of genetic variations between human and apes. Dividing that number by age of fossil of most recent common ancestor of humans and ape, researchers calculated the mutation rate. Recent studies using <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> technologies concluded a slow mutation rate which doesn't add up with human migration pattern time points and suggesting a new evolutionary time scale. 100,000 year old human fossils found in Israel have served to compound this new found uncertainty of the human migration timeline.|$|E

40|$|Mioadenilate defect is a frecuent {{cause of}} {{metabolic}} myopathy. We {{can find a}} variety of clinic features. Patients can be asymptomatic or they present differents degrees of muscular impairment, from early fatigability to sever miophaty. Miodanilate Deaminase diagnosis requires a pathological anaerobic exercise test, with no rise of ammonium and rise of lactate. This fact should make us think about this defect. Mioadnilate Deaminase defect can be originated by other muscular diseases. Diagnosis confirmation needs genetic studies. Most often Sanger sequence and prevalent mutations are the genetic technics used. Probably, <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>sequence</b> (NGS) could help us to discern between primary and secundary defects of enzyme. We report the caso of 28 years-old man with early fatigability and dystrophy sign who was diagnosed of Mioadenilate Deaminase. We supportted the diagnosis with anaerobic exercise test.

25|$|In CAPP-Seq, {{design of}} {{selector}} {{is a crucial}} step that identifies recurrent mutations in a particular cancer type using publicly available <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>sequencing</b> data. For inclusion in CAPP-seq selector, the recurrent mutations that are enriched in a population is described by an index- Recurrence Index (RI). RI {{is the number of}} mutations per kilobase of a given genomic locus of a patient carrying particular mutations. RI represents a patient level recurrence frequency estimated for somatic mutations and all mutations. Known and driver recurrent mutations in a population can be ranked based on the RI and therefore RI is used to design a selector. A six phase design strategy is employed to design selector.|$|E

These are computational techniques, and are in contrast to special experimental methods based on known population-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (see SNP genotyping). Due to the increasing abundance of NGS data, these techniques are becoming increasingly popular for performing SNP genotyping, {{with a wide variety of}} algorithms designed for specific experimental designs and applications. In addition to the usual application domain of SNP genotyping, these techniques have been successfully adapted to identify rare SNPs within a population, as well as detecting somatic SNVs within an individual using multiple tissue samples.|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{tests for}} Hardy–Weinberg {{equilibrium}} {{have been an}} important tool for detecting genotyping errors in the past, and remain important in the quality control of <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>sequence</b> data. In this paper, we analyze complete chromosomes of the 1000 genomes project by using exact test procedures for autosomal and X-chromosomal variants. We find {{that the rate of}} disequilibrium largely exceeds what might be expected by chance alone for all chromosomes. Observed disequilibrium is, in about 60 % of the cases, due to heterozygote excess. We suggest that most excess disequilibrium can be explained by sequencing problems, and hypothesize mechanisms that can explain exceptional heterozygosities. We report higher rates of disequilibrium for the MHC region on chromosome 6, regions flanking centromeres and p-arms of acrocentric chromosomes. We also detected long-range haplotypes and areas with incidental high disequilibrium. We report disequilibrium to be related to read depth, with variants having extreme read depths being more likely to be out of equilibrium. Disequilibrium rates were found to be 11 times higher in segmental duplications and simple tandem repeat regions. The variants with significant disequilibrium are seen to be concentrated in these areas. For <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>sequence</b> data, Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium seems to be a major indicator for copy number variation. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} species and gene identification studies {{rely on the}} use of <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>sequence</b> analysis of either single isolate or metagenomics samples. Several methods are available to perform taxonomic annotations and a previous metagenomics benchmark study has shown that a vast number of false positive species annotations are a problem unless thresholds or post-processing are applied to differentiate between correct and false annotations. MGmapper is a package to process raw <b>next</b> <b>generation</b> <b>sequence</b> data and perform reference based sequence assignment, followed by a post-processing analysis to produce reliable taxonomy annotation at species and strain level resolution. An in-vitro bacterial mock community sample comprised of 8 genuses, 11 species and 12 strains was previously used to benchmark metagenomics classification methods. After applying a post-processing filter, we obtained 100 % correct taxonomy assignments at species and genus level. A sensitivity and precision at 75 % was obtained for strain level annotations. A comparison between MGmapper and Kraken at species level, shows MGmapper assigns taxonomy at species level using 84. 8 % of the sequence reads, compared to 70. 5 % for Kraken and both methods identified all species with no false positives. Extensive read count statistics are provided in plain text and excel sheets for both rejected and accepted taxonomy annotations. The use of custom databases is possible for the command-line version of MGmapper, and the complete pipeline is freely available as a bitbucked package ([URL] A web-version ([URL] provides the basic functionality for analysis of small fastq datasets...|$|R
