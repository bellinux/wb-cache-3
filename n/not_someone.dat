5|$|To create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy {{explored}} {{the ideas of}} unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how these thoughts not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge. Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals {{at a certain point}} in their life, and that they stay that way regardless of what happens. This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> who lost their morality {{as a result of the}} job. Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character. Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.|$|E

25|$|Dink {{was baptized}} and married within the Armenian Apostolic Church, but was educated and {{sheltered}} at Armenian Protestant institutions and received {{his introduction to}} religion within the Protestant sphere. Dink {{was a member of}} the Armenian Evangelical Church of Gedikpaşa, Istanbul, as well as a member by birth in the Armenian Apostolic Church. He regarded both churches as part of his culture and said that he was <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> who dealt heavily with religious rituals. Keeping the duality to the end, his funeral service was held in the Apostolic Church, by Patriarch Mutafyan, with Protestant ministers delivering eulogies at the burial.|$|E
25|$|The island's main {{industries}} are fishing, fish farming and cattle farming. Tourism {{is also important}} to the island economy. The local cheese, Westray Wife, is an organic unpasturised cheese available in mild and mature varieties. It marries well with the local range of Westray chutneys (all Fairtrade) and bakery goods (including oatcakes). Fresh fish, seafood and lobster is available locally and is of a very high standard. The Westray Development Trust is well known for its renewable energy and recycling initiatives and plans to make the island self-sufficient in energy by 2012. A 900kW community-owned wind turbine was erected in October 2009, the third large-scale such project in Scotland. “When the community realised it was their turbine, <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> else’s, there was no objection,” stated Alasdair McVicar of Westray Renewable Energy.|$|E
25|$|Bland had {{established}} the League of the Empire, devoted to bringing all the units of Overseas Great Britain into touch, mainly by the observance of Empire day in schools, at Malacca. Upon its inauguration there a Chinese Malaccan Ong Kim Wee founded a fund {{to provide an}} annual prize on Empire Day, to be competed for by the English-speaking boys of Malacca. The $600 he gave to this, would produce about $40 a year {{to be used for}} the purchase of prizes that the elder boys could compete for. A newspaper reporting on that in September 19006, also noted that Bland, unlike the heads of government at the other two Settlements was <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> to be admired from a distance but had personal relationships with many of the local community who view him as their head.|$|E

25|$|Bernard Williams {{has argued}} that consequentialism is alienating because it {{requires}} moral agents to put too much distance between themselves and their own projects and commitments. Williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly impersonal view of all actions, since {{it is only the}} consequences, and not who produces them, that are said to matter. Williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents—since (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects and commitments in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. He argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it can matter whether or <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> is personally the author of a particular consequence. For example, that participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent's participation.|$|E
25|$|Marcion was a Church leader from Sinope (present-day Turkey), who preached in Rome around 150CE, but was {{expelled}} and {{started his own}} congregation, which spread throughout the Mediterranean. He rejected the Old Testament, and followed a limited Christian canon, which included only a redacted version of Luke, and ten edited letters of Paul. Some scholars do not consider {{him to be a}} gnostic, but his teachings clearly resemble some Gnostic teachings. He preached a radical difference between the God of the Old Testament, the Demiurge, and the highest God, who had sent Jesus to the earth to free mankind from the tyranny of the Jewish Law. Like the Gnostics, Marcion argued that Jesus was essentially a divine spirit appearing to men {{in the shape of a}} human form, and <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> in a true physical body. Marcion held that the heavenly Father (the father of Jesus Christ) was an utterly alien god; he had no part in making the world, nor any connection with it.|$|E
25|$|Radical expressivism {{evolved from}} the {{pedagogical}} ideals of moderate expressivism, and its primary difference lies in its focus on group, rather than individual, development and expression. For example, In 1966, Susan Sontag published {{a collection of essays}} in which she stresses the importance of Happenings, “a cross between art exhibit and theatrical performance,” in order to facilitate a sense of group identity, community, and engagement with audience through a shared, unique artistic experience. Radical expressivists Charles Deemer and William Lutz also suggest that English composition should be taught as and considered a sort of Happening. Deemer locates the problem with the composition course in its lack of subject content and asserts that writing demands inspiration that can be attained from teacher-induced Happenings, as “clear writing and clear thought follow only after clear experiences.” Lutz’ claims {{are similar to those of}} Deemer, noting the need for creative inspiration in the classroom, a typically stagnant environment in which he claims nothing creative can be taught; he argues for the employment of Happenings in the English classroom in order to “make the student respond directly to his own experience and <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> else’s.” Other such pedagogues include Marshall McLuhan, who presents the idea of using hot, engaging media when teaching rather than cold, sterile media in the classroom, and Geoffrey Sirc, who promotes an avant-garde approach to composition pedagogy by encouraging students’ exuberant, unpolished expressions in writing. Sirc can almost be considered a “post-social turn” theorist; his 1980s research claims that the traditional classroom space is confining and argues that the language of “Main Street” should be encouraged in student writing, attacking the idea of suitable “academic” writing presented by theorists like David Bartholomae. Furthermore, in his own English classroom, Sirc employs the study of rap music and its cultural and racial implications; he views rap music as “loaded with language, desire, style, and humanity” and imbued with poetry he describes as “blunt narratives of the human heart,” teaching students about truth, communication, and reality and effectively strengthening their writing. Thus, while retaining many of the ideals of individuality and uninhibited expression associated with Moderate Expressivism, the composition pedagogy of radical expressivism is distinguished by its focus on group reality and community experience, belief in the art and inspirational potential of the Happening, and view that popular media can potentially be used as a pedagogical tool.|$|E

500|$|Qureshi was {{initially}} scheduled {{to make her}} film debut with Billa II, a Tamil gangster-thriller, directed and produced by Chakri Toleti, after surviving an audition out of 700 candidates. Although cast as the female lead, when the film was delayed, Qureshi left the project to honour other work commitments. When asked whether she had any regrets, she said: [...] "I have no regrets. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't. I am <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> who sits and laments over things. I was approached for several other south films too, but the roles weren't what I was looking for".|$|E
500|$|... "Circle the Drain" [...] is a rant song where, lyrically, Perry {{is telling}} off a self-destructive drug-addicted ex-boyfriend. Its candid lyrics also discuss the strains his {{addiction}} put {{on both of}} them. In the track's chorus, she sings about how {{she wants to be}} his lover, <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> who has to take care of him, such as a maternal figure. She also sings about how he had ultimately lost large opportunities. Styled in the genres of disco-rock, and gothic rock tones, it is an up-tempo song that lasts for fourminutes and 32 seconds, and also has influences of techno. The track is composed in the key of E minor and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Perry's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5.|$|E

We'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look." [...] Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham's dresses would be modelled after 1770s fashion, which was [...] "the sort of dress that the character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then.

500|$|In 1899 Ravel {{composed}} {{his first}} piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: Pavane pour une infante défunte ("Pavane for a dead princess"). It was originally a solo piano work, {{commissioned by the}} Princesse de Polignac. In the same year he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics. Henri Gautier-Villars ("Willy") described the piece as [...] "a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School" [...] and called Ravel a [...] "mediocrely gifted debutant... who will perhaps become something if <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> in about ten years, if he works hard." [...] Another critic, Pierre Lalo, thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven. Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic.|$|E

In Hollywood, however, the intimate nature of the Tracy-Hepburn partnership was an open secret. Angela Lansbury, who worked with the pair on State of the Union, later said: [...] "We all knew, but nobody ever said anything. In those days it wasn't discussed." [...] Tracy was <b>not</b> <b>someone</b> to express his emotions, but friend Betsy Drake believed he [...] "was utterly dependent upon Hepburn." [...] Tracy's infidelity apparently continued, however, and he is reported to have had an affair with Gene Tierney during the making of Plymouth Adventure in 1952.|$|E

[...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew my top was, that once the initial fiasco had happened, there was the starter standing there saying, 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was jumping up and down." ...|$|E
