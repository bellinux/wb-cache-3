5000|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) is an {{endangered}} muriqui (woolly spider monkey) species endemic to Brazil. It is unusual among primates {{in that it}} shows egaliterian social relationships. [...] It {{is found in the}} Atlantic Forest region of the Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and Bahia. Muriquis are the largest species of New World monkeys. The <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> can grow up to 4.3 ft tall. It feeds mainly on leaves and twigs, but will also eat fruit. It often hangs upside-down by its prehensile tail while eating.|$|E
50|$|This {{ecoregion}} {{is poorly}} known. Recently, a new primate species was described, the Coimbra Filho's titi, and other primate, the <b>Northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> is endemic of Bahia interior forests ecoregion.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} in the Doce River basin.It runs past the Feliciano Miguel Abdala Private Natural Heritage Reserve, located on its left bank, {{home to one of}} the last wild populations of <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> woolly spider monkeys.|$|E
50|$|The Sossego Forest Biological Station (Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Estação Biológica da Mata do Sossego) is {{a private}} natural {{heritage}} reserve {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil.

50|$|There {{is a high}} {{incidence}} of rare species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians.Threatened species include <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus), Bahia tyrannulet (Phylloscartes beckeri) and cougar (Puma concolor).Bird species include the black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), ornate hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), mantled hawk (Pseudastur polionotus), solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius), cinnamon-vented piha (Lipaugus lanioides) and white-eared parakeet (Pyrrhura leucotis).|$|E
50|$|Feliciano Miguel Abdala Private Natural Heritage Reserve (Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Feliciano Miguel Abdala), {{formerly}} the Fazenda Montes Claros {{and then the}} Caratinga Biological Station, is a privately-owned sustainable use protected area {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil. It contains an example of Atlantic Forest biome. The reserve is home to rare buffy-headed marmosets and to one of the last wild populations of <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> woolly spider monkeys.|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} is to help {{preserve}} the critically endangered <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus), the largest primate in the Americas.It is estimated that between 700 and 1,000 Northern muriquis live in the Atlantic Forest remnants in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, with confirmed populations in just ten forest fragments in Minas Gerais.Other endangered species include the cougar (Puma concolor) and black-fronted titi (Callicebus nigrifrons).The plants Cariniana legalis and Dicksonia sellowiana are also endangered.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> {{has been}} argued to be {{important}} to understanding human evolution, since {{it is one of}} the few primates that has tolerant, nonhierarchial relationships among and between males and females, a feature shared with hunter-gatherer humans, but which contrasts with the ranked relationships of most other primates. Group aggression is also rare. [...] The success of males fathering offspring links to the maternal investment they gain from their mothers and coresident female kin. This provides support to the grandmother hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|Protected {{birds in}} the reserve include the red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha), white-necked hawk (Leucopternis lacernulatus), Atlantic black-breasted {{woodpecker}} (Celeus torquatus tinnunculus), rufous-brown solitaire (Cichlopsis leucogenys), purple-winged ground dove (Claravis godefrida), black-bellied thorntail (Discosura langsdorffi), Salvadori's antwren (Myrmotherula minor) and brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus).Protected mammals include the maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), Atlantic titi (Callicebus personatus), <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus), buffy-headed marmoset (Callithrix flaviceps), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and cougar (Puma concolor capricornensis).Other protected species include the black uruçu (Melipona capixaba) and pinthous mimic white (Moschoneura pinthous methymna).|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} classed as IUCN {{protected}} area category IV (habitat/species management area). It has {{the objective of}} conserving biological diversity in a private area. Preserve-Muriqui aims to guarantee survival of the <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> in its natural environment and to support research, while working with the inhabitants of neighbouring properties and providing jobs for local people. The reserve {{has been the subject}} of many scientific studies including 22 independent research projects and ten PhD theses. The reserve is open to eco-tourists, providing guided tours of the forest. Fees are used to help support the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Alto Cariri National Park {{was created}} by federal decree on 11 June 2010 with an {{approximate}} area of 19264 ha.It {{became part of the}} Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor, created in 2002.The park is classed as IUCN protected area category II (National Park).The objectives are to preserve the Alto Cariri mountain complex, ensure viable populations of endangered birds and animals, especially the <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) spider monkey, maintain and restore watersheds and waterways, support development of education and environmental interpretation, recreation in contact with nature, eco-tourism and scientific research.It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Mittermeier {{undertook}} {{one of the}} first studies of the critically endangered <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> woolly spider monkeys in what would become the Caratinga Biological Station.Mittermeier has been particularly interested in the discovery and description of species new to science. He has described a total of 14 new species (three turtles, four lemurs, an African monkey, and six Amazonian monkeys) and has eight species named in his honor (three frogs, a lizard, two lemurs, a monkey, and an ant). The most recent of these is Mittermeier’s saki, Pithecia mittermeieri, a monkey from the Brazilian Amazon. The lizard, Anolis williamsmittermeierorum, is named in honor of Mittermeier and American herpetologist Ernest E. Williams.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to a {{population}} of endangered <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) spider monkeys. It has been estimated that there were a million of these monkeys when the Europeans arrived, but they are now on the list of 25 most endangered primates in the world. There were about 60 spider monkeys on the reserve when it was established. As of 2006 there were less than 1,000 surviving individuals in the world, of whom 226 were living in the reserve. By 2011 the reserve had 320 individuals, the largest concentration in the world. About 362 species of vertebrate have been recorded, including 79 species of mammal, 204 species of birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians.The pit viper Lachesis muta and the Natterer's longwing butterfly (Heliconius nattereri) are considered endangered.|$|E

40|$|Assessments of {{the status}} of {{endangered}} species have focused on population sizes, often without knowledge of demographic and behavioral processes underlying population recovery. We analyzed demographic data from a 28 -year study of a critically endangered primate, the <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui,</b> to investigate possible changes in demographic rates as this population recovered from near extirpation. As the population increased from 60 to nearly 300 individuals, its growth rate declined due to increased mortality and male-biased birth sex ratios; the increased mortality was not uniform across ages and sexes, {{and there has been a}} recent increase in mortality of prime-aged males. If not for a concurrent increase in fertility rates, the population would have stabilized at 200 individuals instead of continuing to grow. The unexpected increase in fertility rates and in adult male mortality can be attributed to the muriquis ’ expansion of their habitat by spending more time on the ground. The demographic consequences of this behavioral shift must be incorporated into management tactics for this population and emphasize the importance of understanding demographic rates in the recovery of endangered species...|$|E
40|$|Demographic {{data are}} {{essential}} to assessments {{of the status of}} endangered species. However, establishing an integrated monitoring program to obtain useful data on contemporary and future population trends requires both the identification of priority areas and populations and realistic evaluations of the kinds of data that can be obtained under different monitoring regimes. We analyzed all known populations of a critically endangered primate, the muriqui (genus: Brachyteles) using population size, genetic uniqueness, geographic importance (including potential importance in corridor programs) and implementability scores to define monitoring priorities. Our analyses revealed nine priority populations for the <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (B. hypoxanthus) and nine for the southern muriqui (B. arachnoides). In addition, we employed knowledge of muriqui developmental and life history characteristics to define the minimum monitoring intensity needed to evaluate demographic trends along a continuum ranging from simple descriptive changes in population size to predictions of population changes derived from individual based life histories. Our study, stimulated by the Brazilian government's National Action Plan for the Conservation of Muriquis, is fundamental to meeting the conservation goals for this genus, and also provides a model for defining priorities and methods for the implementation of integrated demographic monitoring programs for other endangered and critically endangered species of primates...|$|E
40|$|The Caratinga Biological Station (CBS) is an {{important}} preserve of the Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest, defined as a national priority {{for the conservation of}} this highly fragmented biome and shelter to the largest existing population of the <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui,</b> the critically threatened largest monkey species of the Americas. Extensive research on the demography of this population has indicated favorable conditions for growth, pointing out the importance of promoting expansion of the locally available habitat. In the present study, rural establishments neighboring the CBS were involved in a participatory program for wildlife corridor restoration, by means of the application of a 'System for Weighted Environmental Impact Assessment of Rural Activities' (APOIA-NovoRural), which consists of 62 indicators integrated in five sustainability dimensions: i) Landscape ecology; ii) Environmental quality; iii) Socio-cultural values; iv) Economic values; and v) Management and administration. Results regarding the Landscape ecology indicators (those most related with fauna protection) attested to the adequate performance of productive activities in the studied establishments, while pointed out the need for improvements in natural habitats conservation. The Environmental Management Reports issued to the farmers included mapped recommendations for forest restoration and wildlife corridors implementation, favoring the connection of the main preserved area of CBS with the second largest forest fragment in the region...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} the genetic diversity of two <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus Primata, Atelidae) populations, the Feliciano Miguel Abdala population (FMA, n = 108) in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais (19 ° 44 ' S, 41 ° 49 ' W) and the Santa Maria de Jetibá population (SMJ, n = 18) in the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo (20 ° 01 ' S, 40 ° 44 ' W). Fecal DNA was isolated and PCR-RFLP analysis {{used to analyze}} 2160 bp of mitochondrial DNA, made up of an 820 bp segment of the gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (cox 2, EC 1. 9. 3. 1), an 880 bp segment of the gene cytochrome b (cytb, EC 1. 10. 2. 2) and 460 bp of the hypervariable segment of the mtDNA control region (HVRI). The cox 2 and cytb sequences were monomorphic within and between populations whereas the HVRI revealed three different population exclusive haplotypes, one unique to the SMJ population and two, present at similar frequencies, in the FMA population. Overall haplotype diversity (h = 0. 609) and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0. 181) were high but reduced within populations. The populations were genetically structured with a high fixation index (F ST = 0. 725), possibly due to historical subdivision. These findings have conservation implications because they {{seem to indicate that}} the populations are distinct management units...|$|E

The <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) is a critically endangered New World monkey and a flagship species {{for the conservation of}} the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Yet, like other neotropical primates, little is known about its population history and the genetic structure of remnant populations. We analyzed the mitochondrial DNA control region of 152 northern muriquis, or 17. 6 % of the 864 northern muriquis from 8 of the 12 known extant populations and found no evidence of phylogeographic partitions or past population shrinkage/ expansion. Bayesian and classic analyses show that this finding may be attributed to the joint contribution of female-biased dispersal, demographic stability, and a relatively large historic population size. Past population stability is consistent with a central Atlantic Forest Pleistocene refuge. In addition, the best scenario supported by an Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis, significant fixation indices (WST = 0. 49, WCT = 0. 24), and population-specific haplotypes, coupled with the extirpation of intermediate populations, are indicative of a recent geographic structuring of genetic diversity during the Holocene. Genetic diversity is higher in populations living in larger areas (. 2, 000 hectares), but it is remarkably low in the species overall (h = 0. 018). Three populations occurring in protected reserves and one fragmented population inhabiting private lands harbor 22 out of 23 haplotypes, most of which are population-exclusive, and therefore represent patch...|$|E
40|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) is {{endemic to}} Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, and it {{ranks among the}} most {{critically}} endangered primates in the world. Roughly 25 % of the species {{is found in the}} 957 ha forest at the Estação Biológica de Caratinga/RPPN-Feliciano Miguel Abdala, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The long-term research and conservation efforts at this site have received considerable attention, and public awareness and educational campaigns about northern muriquis have been highly effective. Nonetheless, very little about the human dimensions of these efforts have been explicitly described. In this paper, we focus on three distinct, but interconnected dimensions: i) the role of training Brazilian students on the research to build local capacity; ii) the multiple levels of interactions among researchers and different spheres of the local farming community, which have extended over time from the family that owns the farm on which the forest is situated, to the families that work on this farm, to the farmers who live and work in the surrounding community; and iii) the development of partnerships involving national and international nongovernmental organizations and the Brazilian government. We conclude by describing the synergist interactions between each of these human dimensions, which have contributed to both the research and conservation of northern muriquis at this site. We also consider the ways in which some of the specifics of this particular “case study” might be applicable to other species of primates elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|Levels of {{reproductive}} skew vary in wild primates living in multimale groups {{depending on the}} degree to which high-ranking males monopolize access to females. Still, the factors affecting paternity in egalitarian societies remain unexplored. We combine unique behavioral, life history, and genetic data to evaluate the distribution of paternity in the <b>northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> (Brachyteles hypoxanthus), a species known for its affiliative, nonhierarchical relationships. We genotyped 67 individuals (22 infants born over a 3 -y period, their 21 mothers, and all 24 possible sires) at 17 microsatellite marker loci and assigned paternity to all infants. None of the 13 fathers were close maternal relatives of females with which they sired infants, and the most successful male sired a much lower percentage of infants (18 %) than reported for the most successful males in other species. Our findings of inbreeding avoidance and low male reproductive skew are consistent with the muriqui's observed social and sexual behavior, but the long delay (≥ 2. 08 y) between the onset of male sexual behavior and the age at which males first sire young is unexpected. The allocation of paternity implicates individual male life histories and access to maternal kin as key factors influencing variation in paternal—and grandmaternal—fitness. The apparent importance of lifelong maternal investment in coresident sons resonates with other recent examinations of maternal influences on offspring reproduction. This importance also extends the implications of the “grandmother hypothesis” in human evolution to include the possible influence of mothers and other maternal kin on male reproductive success in patrilocal societies...|$|E
40|$|Muriquis, genus Brachyteles Spix, 1823, are {{the largest}} of the extant New World primates, and they are one of the three extant genera of the {{subfamily}} Atelinae along with Ateles (spider monkeys) and Lagothrix (wooly monkeys). The taxonomy of Brachyteles has constantly changed since its first description in the 19 th century. First treated as a monotypic genus, and after several modifications in the number of species, Brachyteles currently contains two species, B. arachnoides (Southern muriqui) and B. hypoxanthus (<b>Northern</b> <b>muriqui).</b> The morphological evidence for this taxonomic arrangement relies on two diagnostic characters: the occurrence of a black-pigmented face and the absence of the first digit (thumb) in Southern muriqui populations vs. mottled face and fully-developed thumb in <b>Northern</b> <b>muriqui</b> populations. In addition, the phylogenetic relationship between atelines is disputed: on the one hand, the molecular evidence suggests an (Ateles (Brachyteles + Lagothrix)) clade and, on the other, most morphological evidence supports a clade (Lagothrix (Ateles + Brachyteles)) based on the high degree of postcranial and locomotory resemblances between Ateles and Brachyteles. My aims here are: 1) to verify how many taxa at the species level group there are in Brachyteles, and 2) to estimate the phylogenetic relationships among Atelinae using morphological characters. To achieve these goals, I have performed a qualitative analysis of external morphological characters as {{the presence or absence of}} the thumb, pelage coloration, and face pigmentation to test sexual dimorphism or dichromatism and intrapopulational variation. I also performed linear and geometric morphometrics analyses to test sexual dimorphism and geographical variation in both size and shape of the skull. Finally, I carried out a morphological phylogeny using 74 discrete morphological characters, two ecological and one karyological. This analysis includes 11 species of extant and fossil atelids and the outgroup was composed of Sapajus nigritus and Callicebus personatus. The analysis of the pelage coloration reveals that there is no sexual dimorphism or dichromatism in Brachyteles; besides, the pelage presents a high degree of individual variation. The development of the thumb and the facial pigmentation do not exhibit uniformity; thus, they have no taxonomic meaning. Linear and geometric morphometrics failed on to discriminate between sexes and populations based on the size and shape of the skull. For these reasons, I consider Brachyteles as a monotypic genus with no subspecies. Lastly, the morphologic phylogenetic analysis shows that Brachyteles is more closely related to Lagothrix than to Ateles, suggesting that the postcranial similarities between muriquis and spider monkeys could be a plesiomorphic condition in Atelidae, and the arboreal quadrupedalism of Alouatta and Lagothrix evolved convergently in alouattines and atelines. Os muriquis ou monos-carvoeiros, gênero Brachyteles Spix, 1823, são os maiores primatas existentes do Novo Mundo, fazendo parte da subfamília Atelinae, juntamente com os gêneros Ateles (macaco-aranha) e Lagothrix (macaco-barrigudo). A taxonomia de Brachyteles tem sofrido constantes alterações desde sua primeira descrição no século XIX. Inicialmente foi tratado como um gênero monotípico, entretanto, após diversas alterações no número de espécies, atualmente considera-se composto por duas espécies, B. arachnoides (muriqui-do-sul) and B. hypoxanthus (muriqui-do-norte). O suporte para este arranjo taxonômico baseia-se em dois caracteres diagnósticos: a ocorrência de face com coloração preta e a ausência do primeiro dígito (polegar) nos muriquis-do-sul vs. face com manchas e polegar totalmente desenvolvido em populações de muriquis-do-norte. Adicionalmente, as relações filogenéticas entre os atelinos é contestada: por um lado, a evidência molecular sugere o clado formado por (Ateles (Brachyteles + Lagothrix)), por outro, a evidência morfológica suporta o clado (Lagothrix (Ateles + Brachyteles)), baseando-se na grande similaridade pós-craniana e locomotora. Desta forma, o meus objetivos neste trabalho são: 1) verificar quantos taxa do grupo da espécie existem em Brachyteles, e 2) estabelecer as relações filogenéticas entre os Atelinae utilizando caracteres morfológicos. Para isso, analisei qualitativamente os caracteres morfológicos externos, como a presença ou ausência de polegar, a coloração da pelagem, e a pigmentação facial, a fim de testar a ocorrência de dimorfismo sexual ou dicromatismo e a variação intraespecífica. Além disso, realizei análises morfométricas lineares e geométricas para testar o dimorfismo sexual e a variação geográfica do tamanho e forma do crânio. Por fim, realizei uma filogenia morfológica utilizando 74 caracteres morfológicos, dois ecológicos e um cariotípico. Estas análises incluíram 11 espécies de atelídeos viventes e fósseis e um grupo-externo composto por Sapajus nigritus e Callicebus personatus. A análise da coloração da pelagem revela que não há dimorfismo sexual ou dicromatismo em Brachyteles; além disso, a pelagem apresenta um alto grau de variação individual. O desenvolvimento do polegar e a pigmentação facial não apresentam uniformidade, assim, não tem relevância taxonômica. A morfometria linear e geométrica falharam em discriminar entre os sexos e as populações com base no tamanho e forma do crânio. Finalmente, as análises filogenéticas mostraram que Brachyteles está mais estreitamente relacionado com Lagothrix do que com Ateles, sugerindo que a similaridade pós-craninana entre os muriquis e os macacos-aranha poderia ser uma condição plesiomórfico dos atelídeos, e o quadrupedalismo arborícola de Alouatta e Lagothrix teria evoluído convergentemente em alouatíneos e atelíneos...|$|E
