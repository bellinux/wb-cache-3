Nelson, the show's head {{writer who}} also plays the {{character}} of the same name, said the staff initially felt strange making jokes at the expense of Rondo Hatton and his real-life illness; however, Nelson said, [...] "Then you realize it's {{the whole point of the}} movie: he's a guy with a big ugly face...And he is a terribly bad actor." [...] Paul Chaplin, another writer with the series, said of the actor's acromegaly: [...] "That fact opens up a large, irresolvable issue concerning the movie industry's use of this poor afflicted fellow; he was paid, after all, and movie work is <b>nice</b> <b>work.</b> Yet it can seem exploitative of misfortune." ...|$|E

Though Associated Press writer David Germain gave a negative review overall of Into the Blue, he wrote positively of Hurlbut's cinematography work, commenting: [...] "Shane Hurlbut's cinematography buoys the movie, but his lovely pictures of the actors swimming among jellyfish and shimmery aquatic vegetation cannot compensate for everything else." ...|$|E

[...] Gennoe went on to call the song the [...] "highlight" [...] and [...] "saving grace" [...] of Fantasy Ride. Nick Levine of Digital Spy said that [...] "the track itself is nearly as sexy as the promo clip", commenting [...] "Ciara purrs, and Timberlake, if you'll pardon the pun, more than rises to the occasion. All in all, 'Love Sex Magic' is pretty much spot on." [...] Lauren Carter of the Boston Herald said [...] "It’s not quite magic, but it grows on you." [...] Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Hooking up with Timberlake {{essentially}} guarantees a one-way ticket back to chart supremacy, so <b>nice</b> <b>work</b> there, Ciara."

By employing the fixed point theorem of cone expansion and compression, we will establish some existence results of positive solutions for (1), if the exponent α satisfies two cases: (i) α≥ 1; (ii)  0 <α< 1.|$|R

2500|$|The University of Birmingham {{continued}} {{as one of}} the main points of focus for the city's literary culture in the post-war era. The novelist and critic Anthony Burgess worked in the university's extramural department between 1946 and 1950. Of longer lasting influence on Birmingham literature were David Lodge and Malcolm Bradbury – the two leading late-20th century practitioners of the campus novel – who both joined the staff of the English Department in the early 1960s, collaborating on the 1963 satirical revue Between these Four Walls for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and becoming lifelong friends. Bradbury wrote his second novel Stepping Westward in the city but moved to the University of East Anglia in 1965, while Lodge remained in Birmingham, retiring in 1987 to concentrate on writing. Many of Lodge's novels are set in Rummidge, [...] "an imaginary city ... which occupies, for the purposes of fiction, the space where Birmingham is to be found on maps of the so-called real world". These include <b>Nice</b> <b>Work,</b> described by Arthur Marwick as [...] "the novel of life in Thatcherite Britain", and the Booker Prize shortlisted [...] Lodge's novels use parody and pastiche, formal experiments such as chapters composed entirely of newspaper clippings, and ironic allusions to other literary genres, to examine moral dilemmas and document changes in British society.|$|E

Jill wielded the gum-brush and fitted on the little flaps, as her fingers were skilful at this <b>nice</b> <b>work,</b> and Jack put each stamp in its proper place with great rustling of leaves and comparing of marks. Returning, after a brief absence, Mrs. Minot beheld the countenances of the workers adorned with gay stamps, giving them a very curious appearance.|$|E
