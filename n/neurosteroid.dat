50|$|Based on {{differences}} in activity and structure, <b>neurosteroids</b> {{can be categorized}} into several different groupings. The most important <b>neurosteroids</b> are bolded below.|$|R
25|$|Due to its <b>neurosteroid</b> actions, {{progesterone}} {{has been}} researched for the potential treatment {{of a number of}} central nervous system conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its activity as a steroid hormone, progesterone is a <b>neurosteroid.</b> Specifically, it is an antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor, a negative allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and, via its active metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Through potentiation of the GABAA receptor, progesterone can produce sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, euphoric, cognitive-, memory-, and motor-impairing, anticonvulsant, and even anesthetic effects via formation of sufficiently high concentrations of its <b>neurosteroid</b> metabolites.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone is a {{medication}} and naturally occurring steroid hormone. It is a progestogen and <b>neurosteroid</b> {{and is used}} mainly in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause, hypogonadism, and transgender women. Progesterone can be taken by mouth, in through the vagina, and by injection into muscle or fat, among other routes. A progesterone vaginal ring form used for birth control also exists {{in some areas of}} the world.|$|E
50|$|Certain other {{endogenous}} steroids, such as pregnenolone, progesterone, estradiol, and corticosterone {{are also}} <b>neurosteroids.</b> However, unlike those listed above, these <b>neurosteroids</b> do not modulate the GABAA or NMDA receptors, and instead affect various other cell surface receptors and non-genomic targets. Also, many endogenous steroids, including pregnenolone, progesterone, corticosterone, deoxycorticosterone, DHEA, and testosterone, are metabolized into (other) <b>neurosteroids,</b> effectively functioning as so-called proneurosteroids.|$|R
50|$|Some major known {{biological}} {{functions of}} <b>neurosteroids</b> include modulation of neural plasticity, learning and memory processes, behavior, and seizure susceptibility, {{as well as}} responses to stress, anxiety, and depression. <b>Neurosteroids</b> also appear {{to play an important}} role in various sexually-dimorphic behaviors and emotional responses.|$|R
40|$|Astrocytes are {{a target}} for steroid hormones and for steroids {{produced}} by the nervous system (<b>neurosteroids).</b> The effect of gonadal hormones and several <b>neurosteroids</b> {{in the formation of}} gliotic tissue has been assessed in adult male rats after a penetrating wound of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampal formation. The hormones testosterone, 17 β-estradiol and progesterone and the <b>neurosteroids</b> dehydroepiandrosterone, pregnenolone and pregnenolone sulfate resulted in a significant decrease in the accumulation of astrocytes in the proximity of the wound and in a decreased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in reactive astrocytes. Of all steroids tested, dehydroepiandrosterone was the most potent inhibitor of gliotic tissue formation. These findings suggest that <b>neurosteroids</b> and sex steroids may affect brain repair by down-regulating gliotic tissue. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
25|$|Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), {{also known}} as androstenolone, is an {{endogenous}} steroid hormone. It {{is one of the}} most abundant circulating steroids in humans, in whom it is produced in the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the brain, where it functions as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the androgen and estrogen sex steroids. However, DHEA also has a variety of potential biological effects in its own right, binding to an array of nuclear and cell surface receptors, and acting as a <b>neurosteroid</b> and neurotrophin.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{progesterone}} and its analogues {{have many}} medical applications, both to address acute situations and {{to address the}} long-term decline of natural progesterone levels. Because of the poor bioavailability of progesterone when taken by mouth, many synthetic progestins have been designed with improved bioavailability by mouth and have been used long before progesterone formulations became available. Uses of progesterone include hormone replacement therapy, prevention of preterm birth and miscarriage, fertility support, and treatment of gynecological conditions. Additional uses of progesterone may include treatment of hypertension (due to its antimineralocorticoid effects), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and benzodiazepine withdrawal (due to its <b>neurosteroid</b> effects).|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} notable drug {{interactions}} with progesterone. Certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline {{may increase the}} GABAA receptor-related central depressant effects of progesterone by enhancing its conversion into 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone via activation of 3α-HSD. Progesterone potentiates the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol. Notably, there is a case report of progesterone abuse alone with very high doses. 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, as well as inhibitors of 3α-HSD such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, inhibit the conversion of progesterone into its inhibitory <b>neurosteroid</b> metabolites, and for this reason, may {{have the potential to}} block or reduce its sedative effects.|$|E
40|$|The term <b>neurosteroids</b> {{applies to}} steroids that are {{synthesized}} in the nervous system, either de novo from cholesterol or from steroid hormone precursors. RIA {{was used to}} determine plasma and brain levels of the <b>neurosteroids</b> pregnenolone (PREG), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and their sulfate derivatives (PREG-S and DHEA-S) in male and female rats after administration of two typical stress hormones: corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). In all cases, the parameters measured were detectable in plasma and brain. PREG, PREG-S, and DHEA increased significantly in plasma and brain after CRH and ACTH administration in males and females.

50|$|Progesterone, {{which is}} the {{endogenous}} precursor to the inhibitory <b>neurosteroids</b> 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone, as well as, more distantly, THDOC, when administered exogenously, {{has been found to}} behave as a prodrug to these <b>neurosteroids,</b> with clinical signs of their action, such as sedation, readily evident in humans.|$|R
50|$|By {{blocking}} DHT production, finasteride reduces androgen {{activity in}} the scalp. In the prostate, inhibition of 5α-reductase reduces prostate volume, which improves BPH and reduces risk of prostate cancer. Inhibition of 5α-reductase also reduces epididymal weight, and decreases motility and normal morphology of spermatozoa in the epididymis. <b>Neurosteroids</b> like 3α-androstanediol and allopregnanolone activate the GABAA receptor; because finasteride prevents the formation of <b>neurosteroids,</b> it may contribute to a reduction of GABAA activity (see also neurosteroidogenesis inhibitor). Reduction of GABAA receptor activation by these <b>neurosteroids</b> has been implicated in depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction.|$|R
25|$|Progesterone is {{extensively}} {{converted into}} allopregnanolone (as well as pregnanolone) upon oral ingestion {{due to a}} large first-pass effect (>90% metabolism), and allopregnanolone has a relatively short elimination half-life in the circulation. For these reasons, there are dramatic and highly supraphysiological spikes in allopregnanolone concentrations followed by steep declines with each oral intake of progesterone. Hence, allopregnanolone levels fluctuate substantially (e.g., 15-fold) and in an unphysiological manner with oral progesterone during treatment. Moreover, consumption of food with oral progesterone increases its absorption by two-fold, which may further compound fluctuations in <b>neurosteroid</b> levels if food intake with progesterone is not consistent from dose to dose.|$|E
25|$|In mice, {{candidate}} {{genes for}} differentiating aggression {{between the sexes}} are the Sry (sex determining region Y) gene, located on the Y chromosome and the Sts (steroid sulfatase) gene. The Sts gene encodes the steroid sulfatase enzyme, which is pivotal in the regulation of <b>neurosteroid</b> biosynthesis. It is expressed in both sexes, is correlated with levels of aggression among male mice, and increases dramatically in females after parturition and during lactation, corresponding to the onset of maternal aggression. At least one study has found a possible epigenetic signature (i.e. decreased methylation at a specific CpG site on the promoter region) of the serotonin receptor 5-HT3a {{that is associated with}} maternal aggression among human subjects.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline {{has been}} found to {{directly}} act on the enzyme 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) and modulate its activity, thereby enhancing the conversion of 5α-dihydroprogesterone into the <b>neurosteroid</b> allopregnanolone and thus increasing the production of allopregnanolone in the brain. The same is true for certain other SSRIs including fluoxetine and paroxetine. However, a subsequent study failed to reproduce these findings, and a direct interaction of SSRIs with 3α-HSD is controversial. In any case, another study found that, at least in the case of fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine, these drugs normalized low allopregnanolone levels in socially isolated mice and at low doses that were inactive on serotonin reuptake (10- to 50-fold lower, specifically). On the basis of these results, SSRIs like fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were described as selective brain steroidogenic stimulants (SBSSs).|$|E

In addition, the distribution of estrogen, androgen, and progesterone nuclear receptors is documented in relation with the potential sites of production of <b>neurosteroids.</b> Interestingly, radial glial cells acting as neuronal progenitors, appear to be a potential source of <b>neurosteroids,</b> but also a target for centrally and/or peripherally produced steroids...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Although gonadal and adrenal steroids heavily impact sexual {{function}} {{at the level}} of the brain, the nervous system also produces its own steroids de novo that may regulate sexual behavior and reproduction. Current evidence points to important roles for <b>neurosteroids</b> in sexual and gender-typical behaviors, control of ovulation, and behaviors that strongly influence sexual interest and motivation like aggression, anxiety and depression. At the cellular level, <b>neurosteroids</b> act through stimulating rapid changes in excitability and direct activation of membrane receptors in neurons.

25|$|Progesterone is well-tolerated {{and many}} {{clinical}} {{studies have reported}} no side effects. Side effects of progesterone may include abdominal cramps, back pain, breast tenderness, constipation, nausea, dizziness, edema, vaginal bleeding, hypotension, fatigue, dysphoria, depression, and irritability. Side effects including drowsiness, sedation, sleepiness, fatigue, sluggishness, reduced , dizziness, lightheadedness, decreased mental acuity, confusion, and cognitive, memory, and/or motor impairment may occur with oral ingestion and/or at high doses of progesterone, and are due to progesterone's <b>neurosteroid</b> metabolites (namely allopregnanolone). The same may be true for side effects of progesterone including dysphoria, depression, anxiety, irritability, and decreased friendliness, and both the adverse cognitive/sedative and emotional side effects of progesterone may be reduced or avoided by parenteral routes of administration such as vaginal or intramuscular injection. Also, some medical professionals may advise patients to take progesterone before bed to avoid these side effects and/or to help with sleep.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone {{does not}} bind to the androgen, estrogen, and {{glucocorticoid}} receptors. As such, it is devoid of androgenic or antiandrogenic, estrogenic or antiestrogenic, and glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. Similarly to progesterone however, dydrogesterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and possesses antimineralocorticoid activity, but only weakly so. Due to its activity as a progestogen, dydrogesterone can produce antigonadotropic effects in animals. However, {{it does not}} suppress gonadotropin secretion or inhibit ovulation at typical clinical dosages in humans; dosages of dydrogesterone of 5 to 40mg/day fail to suppress ovulation (as assessed by urinary pregnanediol and laparotomy), and {{one study found that}} ovulation persisted even in women treated with a dosage as high as 400mg/day (assessed by visual inspection of the ovaries). The inability of dydrogesterone to prevent ovulation in humans is in contrast to all other marketed progestogens, including progesterone. Unlike progesterone, which forms sedative <b>neurosteroid</b> metabolites, dydrogesterone is not able to be metabolized in a similar way due to structural differences, and for this reason, is non-sedative.|$|E

40|$|Neurotransmitters and <b>neurosteroids</b> are {{compounds}} that regulate {{the functions of}} the brain. The neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5 -HT) play a role in several psychological conditions, including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety.

50|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{actions of}} benzodiazepines at the GABAA receptor {{are similar to}} those of <b>neurosteroids.</b> Neuroactive steroids are positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor, enhancing GABA function and in turn have effects on mood and other functions. Many benzodiazepines (diazepam, medazepam, estazolam, temazepam, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam) potently inhibit the enzymes involved in the metabolism of <b>neurosteroids.</b> The tetrahydroxazole ring that cloxazolam and oxazolam have decreases the inhibitory potency of benzodiazepines on <b>neurosteroids.</b> Thus there could be subtle differences between cloxazolam and other benzodiazepines. However, because the parent prodrugs of cloxazolam and oxazolam were tested rather than the active metabolites, this is purely speculative.|$|R
40|$|Kainate receptors {{belong to}} the family of {{glutamate}} receptors, which include NMDA, AMPA and δ receptors. Glutamate receptors are widely found in the brain and therefore they are very dynamically investigated, especially from view of pharmacology, because there is great potential for finding new and more specific modulators which could be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this work was to extend the knowledge about the influence of <b>neurosteroids</b> on homomeric kainate receptors (GluK 1, GluK 2, GluK 3) in which is the study of modulation by <b>neurosteroids</b> still at the beginning.

40|$|Background: <b>Neurosteroids</b> have various {{physiological}} and neuropsychopharmacological effects. In {{addition to the}} genomic effects of steroids, some <b>neurosteroids</b> modulate several neurotransmitter receptors and channels, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, c-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) receptors, and s 1 receptors, and voltage-gated Ca 2 + and K + channels. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the various effects of <b>neurosteroids</b> {{have not yet been}} sufficiently clarified. In the nervous system, inwardly rectifying K + (Kir) channels also play important roles in the control of resting membrane potential, cellular excitability and K + homeostasis. Among constitutively active Kir 2 channels in a major Kir subfamily, Kir 2. 3 channels are expressed predominantly in the forebrain, a brain area related to cognition, memory, emotion, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study examined the effects of various <b>neurosteroids</b> on Kir 2. 3 channels using the Xenopus oocyte expression assay. In oocytes injected with Kir 2. 3 mRNA, only pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS), among nine <b>neurosteroids</b> tested, reversibly potentiated Kir 2. 3 currents. The potentiation effect was concentration-dependent in the micromolar range, and the current-voltage relationship showed inward rectification.

40|$|The <b>neurosteroids</b> {{constitute}} {{a group of}} powerful hormones synthesized and acting in the central nervous system. They participate {{in a number of}} important central processes, such as memory and learning, mood and neuroprotection. Their effects emerge from rapid interactions with membrane bound receptors, such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, the gamma-amino-butyric acid receptor and the sigma 1 receptor. The mechanisms of action are separate from classical genomic interactions. The aims of this thesis were to identify and characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of nanomolar concentrations of <b>neurosteroids</b> at the NMDA receptor. The results show that the <b>neurosteroids</b> pregnenolone sulfate (PS) and pregnanolone sulfate 3 α 5 βS) differently modulate the NMDA receptor, changing the kinetics for the NMDA receptor antagonist ifenprodil, through unique and separate targets at the NR 2 B subunit. The effects that appear to be temperature independent were further confirmed in a calcium imagining functional assay. A second functional study demonstrated that PS and 3 α 5 βS affect glutamate-stimulated neurite outgrowth in NG 108 - 15 cells. Misuse of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) has powerful effects on emotional states. Since <b>neurosteroids</b> regulate processes involved in mood it can be hypothesised that AAS can interact with the action of <b>neurosteroids</b> in the brain. However, chronic administration of the AAS nandrolone decanoate did not alter the allosteric effects of PS or 3 α 5 βS at the NMDA receptor, but changed the affinity for PS, 3 α 5 βS and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate to the sigma 1 receptor. The results also showed that the <b>neurosteroids</b> displace 3 H-ifenprodil from the sigma 1 and 2 receptors without directly sharing the binding site for 3 H-ifenprodil at the sigma 1 receptor. The decreased affinity for the <b>neurosteroids</b> at the sigma 1 receptor may be involved in the depressive symptoms associated with AAS misuse.
