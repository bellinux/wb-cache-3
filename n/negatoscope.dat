40|$|Xeroradiography is {{a modern}} imaging method that can aid {{diagnosis}} of oral, dental and maxillofacial lesions, treatment planning and  follow-ups. It has been used since 1970 in medical field and has entered dentistry in 1980 after some modifications. In this technique, x-ray is used with no need to developing and fixing radiographs, <b>negatoscope</b> and dark rooms. A selenium sheet is used in this method that is constantly charged electrostatically. A special powder called toner is used for developing process. In {{order to have a}} permanent cliché, a photograph is made from the image. The image brightness and contrast is much better than conventional radiographs while the time of exposure and developing is less. While in medical fields it is used in extraoral imaging, in dentistry xeroradiography is used only in intraoral imaging...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} {{the design and}} evaluation of a gesture-controlled system for interactive manipulation of radiological images and 3 D models using the Kinect device. Several abstractions have been implemented and refactored to improve the system performance, making the application simpler, at an affordable cost. Additionally, specific gestures to change the visualization settings of 3 D models represented by layers were also successfully mod-eled. Further, we have conducted systematic and detailed usability testings with users to determine quantitative performance measures and qualitative analysis (usefulness, visual quality of the interface, ease of learning, ease of use, 3 D spatial perception, level of interactivity, mental and physical fatigue, effectiveness and satisfaction). The {{results show that the}} participants are able to perform the tasks of search, selection and manipulation of 2 D images (zoom in/out and translations) and 3 D models (zoom in/out and rotations), quickly and accurately, demonstrating the usefulness of the system as a possible effective and competitive alternative solution, to the traditional use of the <b>negatoscope...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Dental caries and {{periodontal}} disease {{are probably the}} most common oral chronic diseases in worldwide, and their prevalence is progressively increasing from day to day. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the relationship between caries and {{periodontal disease}}. Methods: In this cross sectional study, 237 panoramic radiographies of patients aged 10 to 65 years (110 males and 127 females) were selected utilizing convenience sampling. In order to measure the variables, a graduate caliper with 0 / 2 mm accuracy and <b>Negatoscope</b> with optimum light were used. Moreover, in order to diagnose the caries and minimize the errors, “calibration” method was selected. Results: There was no significant relationship between crown caries and mean of alveolar bone loss. (p= 0 / 19). As the age increased in patients, the mean of alveolar bone loss also increased and a significant association was detected between the severity of caries, alveolar bone loss and male gender. Conclusion: Generally, no relationship was observed between dental caries and periodontal disease in this study...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the {{near visual acuity}} of 40 dentists and its improvement by using different magnification devices. The acuity was tested with miniaturized E-optotype tests on a <b>negatoscope</b> under the following conditions: 1. natural visual acuity, 300 mm; 2. single lens loupe, 2 ×, 250 mm; 3. Galilean loupe, 2. 5 ×, 380 mm; and 4. Keplerian loupe, 4. 3 ×, 400 mm. In part 1, {{the influence of the}} magnification devices was investigated for all dentists. The Keplerian loupe obtained the highest visual acuity (4. 64), followed by the Galilean loupe (2. 43), the single lens loupe (1. 42), and natural visual acuity (1. 19). For part 2, the dentists were classified according to their age (<?? 40 years). The younger dentists' group achieved a significantly higher visual acuity with all magnification devices (p< 0. 001). For part 3, the dentists were grouped according to their natural visual acuity. The group with the higher natural visual acuity achieved significantly higher visual acuity with all magnification devices than did the group of dentists with the lower natural visual acuity (p< 0. 01). It can be concluded that near visual acuity varies highly between individuals and decreases during the lifetime. Independent of age or natural vision, visual acuity can be significantly improved by using magnification devices...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION : With the {{interest}} in anticipating access to the result of intraoral radiography, the radiographic processing is frequently neglected, compromising image quality. OBJECTIVE : The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of interrupting the fixation process on the radiographic contrast and base-plus-fog density (BPFD) in three brands of periapical films. MATERIAL AND METHOD : Ninety radiographs were taken of an aluminum stepwedge and a lead plate for each brand, and they were divided according to the time of initial immersion in the fixative in: control group (without interrupting the fixing), 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 seconds. During processing, films had the fixing stage stopped and were exposed to a <b>negatoscope</b> for 1 minute, then the fixation time of 10 minutes was completed. The radiographs were digitized and exported to Image Tool 3. 0. software. RESULT : Kodak(r) film showed no statistically significant differences between groups, while Agfa(r) film presented difference in BPFD compared with Group 5 seconds, and Dentix(r) film showed statistical difference in all groups in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION : Under the conditions studied, Kodak(r) film is not influenced by disruption of fixation as regards BPFD and image contrast, enabling early access to the results of radiographs, whereas Agfa(r) film requires at least 10 seconds of initial fixation, and Dentix(r) film obtains better results when the process of fixation is not interrupted...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was the {{validation}} of the visual image quality of electronic portal imaging devices (EPID) and con-ventional verification films {{from the point of view}} of the end-viewers of portal films, the radiotherapists. Material and Methods: The verification image was represented in two different forms, viz. an electronic portal image employ-ing Siemens Beamview Plus ® (on a computer monitor) and two different portal films using the conventional verification films CEA-TVS ® and DuPont CQL- 7 ® (on a <b>negatoscope).</b> A total of 270 image sets (simulation film and portal image) were evaluated by each radiotherapist, evaluation extending to 90 sets of each type of verification film. Each set was evaluated by three spe-cialists in radiotherapy examining subjective visual image quality whereby the following aspects served as evaluation criteria: contrast, artifacts, determination of actual radiation field edge position, anatomical structures and main structural feature for the determination of treatment field position. In addition, the anatomical structures employed for visual feature correlation between reference and portal films were classified according to their importance. Results: In general the electronic portal image was rated significantly “visible ” or better. Only the evaluation of artifacts showed an appreciable disadvantage for electronic portal imaging caused by physical artifacts due to radiographic technique and data processing aspects peculiar to the Siemens Beamview Plus 1. 1. ® and also caused by different image processing tools reducing physical artifacts and enhancing the visibility of anatomical structures and likewise of anatomical artifacts (e. g. intestinal gas). By calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient to detect a possible relationship between the different criteria of subjectiv...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the technical errors in periapical examinations performed by dental students. Methods: Patient record charts at the dental clinic of the dentistry course were analyzed. Of these, the charts that presented {{at least ten}} periapical intraoral radiographs {{were used in the}} study, therefore a total of 219 patient record charts were selected, totaling 2 821 radiographs. The radiographs were analyzed one by one, using an uniform light <b>negatoscope,</b> in a darkened room, by a professional radiologist, taking into consideration the following evaluation criteria: technically good and unsatisfactory radiographs. The technical errorswere classified as errors in radiographic technique and radiographic processing errors. The data on quality critera stipulated and obtainedin the evaluation were tabulated, intervals of confidence were used to infer the percentage that were suitable and unsuitable in the studied period, and were statistically analyzed using the chi-square test, at the level of significance of 5 %. Results: The results were: of the 2 821 radiographs analyzed, only 1 425 (50. 51 %) were technically good. of the 1 396 (49. 49 %) considered inadequat, 1 155 (82. 74 %) presented errors in radiographic technique, while 241 (17. 26 %) presented radiographic processing errors. The most frequently repeated error was image overlapping (32. 88 %), followed by the underexposure (25. 43 %), cut of the tooth (9. 31 %), chemicalcontamination problems (4. 51 %), cone cut (3. 15 %), other errors in radiographic technique (1. 86 %) and other radiographic processing errors (1. 43 %). Conclusion: The conclusion was that steps must be taken {{to improve the quality of}} radiographs obtained because, although they did not make it impossible to interpret the radiographs, this was made extremely difficult, and the depreciated the value of the achives of past clinical situations and cases...|$|E

40|$|A periodontite agressiva representa um tipo de doenÃa {{periodontal}} inflamatÃria que, embora rara, geralmente acomete indivÃduos em idade precoce e Ã caracterizada pela destruiÃÃo rÃpida e debilitante do periodonto de suporte. A patogÃnese desta doenÃa vincula-se a um fator etiolÃgico primÃrio, o biofilme dental e tambÃm Ã resposta inflamatÃria do hospedeiro susceptÃvel Ã agressÃo bacteriana. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o efeito do tratamento a curto prazo com etoricoxib como adjuvante Ã terapia de raspagem e alisamento radicular (RAR) sobre os nÃveis de PGE 2 e sobre os parÃmetros clÃnicos e radiogrÃficos em pacientes portadores de periodontite agressiva. Os pacientes foram randomicamente alocados para TESTE e CONTROLE (n= 10 em cada grupo) e submetidos ao tratamento com etoricoxib (120 mg/dia) ou placebo durante 7 dias. Profundidade de sondagem (PS), nÃvel de inserÃÃo clÃnica (NIC), recessÃo gengival (RG), Ãndice de placa visÃvel (IP), sangramento Ã sondagem (SS), mensuraÃÃo da distÃncia linear (DL) e anÃlise dos nÃveis de cinza (NC) foram registrados antes e um mÃs apÃs a instituiÃÃo das terapias. A anÃlise visual por vÃdeo e por negatoscÃpio bem como a anÃlise por subtraÃÃo radiogrÃfica digital foram feitas no inÃcio e ao final do perÃodo experimental. A dosagem de PGE 2 no fluido crevicular gengival (FCG) foi avaliada por radioimunoensaio no inÃcio, com 7 dias apÃs o inÃcio dos tratamentos e 30 dias apÃs a finalizaÃÃo dos mesmos. Ao final do perÃodo experimental, nÃo foram observadas diferenÃas estatisticamente significantes entre os grupos em relaÃÃo aos parÃmetros clÃnicos, embora ambos os grupos tenham apresentado melhora significativa em todas as variÃveis avaliadas. Houve um decrÃscimo no NIC de 5, 54 Â 0, 47 mm para 3, 59 Â 0, 53 mm no grupo TESTE e de 5, 92 Â 1, 10 para 3, 69 Â 0, 80 mm no grupo CONTROLE. Uma significativa reduÃÃo nos nÃveis de PGE 2 foi observada apÃs 7 dias de tratamento. A mensuraÃÃo da DL evidenciou diferenÃa entre os grupos. Em conclusÃo, etoricoxib nÃo foi capaz de promover benefÃcio adicional nos parÃmetros clÃnicos, contudo, promoveu reduÃÃo inicial nos nÃveis de PGE 2 e discreta melhora na condiÃÃo Ãssea. Aggressive periodontitis is {{an inflammatory}} type of periodontal disease which, although rare, generally affects individuals {{at an early}} age and is characterized by the rapid and debilitating destruction of the support periodontium. The pathogenesis of this pathology is related to primary etiologic factor, dental biofilm, associated to the immunoinflammatory response of susceptible host to this aggression. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the effect of short duration treatment with etoricoxib as adjuvant therapy to scaling and root planing (SRP) on prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels and the clinical and radiographic parameters in aggressive periodontitis. Patients were randomly allocated to TEST or CONTROL (N= 10 in each group) and submitted to SRP and treatment with 120 mg/day of etoricoxib or placebo during 7 days. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), visible plaque index (VPI), bleeding on probing (BOP), measurement of the linear distance (LD) and analysis of the gray levels (GL) were recorded before and one month after the therapies. The visual analysis from video and <b>negatoscope</b> and digital subtraction radiographic was made in beginning and in the final experimental period (30 days). The PGE 2 dosage in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was measured by radioimmunoassay at the beginning, and 7 and 30 days afterwards. No significant difference was observed between the groups in the clinical parameters at the end of the experimental period, although both groups presented significant improvement in all the variables examined. There was a decrease in CAL from 5. 54 Â 0. 47 mm to 3. 59 Â 0. 53 mm in the TEST group and from 5. 92 Â 1. 10 to 3. 69 Â 0. 80 mm in the CONTROL group. A significant reduction in PGE 2 was found after 7 days of treatment. The LD measurement was shown to differ between the groups. In conclusion, etoricoxib did not promote additional improvement in the clinical parameters, however it produced an initial reduction in the PGE 2 levels in the GCF, which could be related to the discrete improvement in the bone condition...|$|E
