40|$|Catch and {{research}} survey data from 1992 - 2005 on the roughhead grenadier stock in <b>NAFO</b> <b>Subareas</b> 2 and 3 are fitted to the eXtended Survivors Analysis (XSA) model. The model {{results indicated that}} the stock biomass has been increasing from 1996 to 2005. The biomass estimated for the beginning of 2005 was around 70. 000 tonnes, the highest in the time series. Fishing mortality has declined since 1999 and showed the lowest value in the time series in 2005. Over the last few years, there have been two years with very good recruitment at age 3, which may increase the exploitable biomass in the future. The assessment results showed that the current roughhead grenadier Subarea 2 and 3 stock status is healthy. While the analysis indicated that there was a clear retrospective pattern in the model estimates (i. e., fishing mortality being underestimated and total biomass overestimated), the sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to the model set up. Although the short time series available, in addition to the wide age composition of this species, the low fishing mortality level estimate by XSA and the lack of convergence in the retrospective analyses, the results showed that the XSA model adequately fitted the data and that the XSA estimated trends are similar to those observed by research surveys. Therefore, it could be concluded that this assessment model may be an appropriate tool {{to be used in the}} quantitative assessment of the roughhead grenadier stock in <b>NAFO</b> <b>Subareas</b> 2 and 3...|$|R

40|$|Three {{types of}} Sebastes mentella in the Irminger Sea and {{adjacent}} waters {{have been described}} {{and there is a}} strong controversy about whether these types are more than one stock. Preliminary genetic studies have shown the existence of three different groups, characterised by genetic differences. The biological or ecological significance of these between-group differences, however, has not been evaluated yet. In the present paper, we review the S. mentella life cycle in the area from published data. Spawning of S. mentella in the Irminger Sea takes place in a single area above Reykjanes Ridge. The larvae drift towards East Greenland and from there they are carried to West Greenland (<b>NAFO</b> <b>Subareas</b> 0 + 1). Afterwards, they return to East Greenland where the main nursery area has been identified. There is an evident migration of juvenile fish from the nursery area into the open Irminger Sea, where many different cohorts are involved in the spawning fraction of the population. We also compare these data of the ecology of the species with the genetic results and we conclude that the observed genetic differences can be derived from possible genetic drift, selection or mostly from temporal variation (age dependency) which has been reported in other species with as high longevity as S. mentella. We conclude that S. mentella in the Irminger Sea and adjacent waters comprises one single stock...|$|R

Biomass presents in all methods a general increased trend in the analysed period with its maximum level in the last years. With regard to fishing mortality estimates from different methods, it can be observed that the trends of the different estimations of F were very similar and that the actual level of F is the minimum of the period due to the increase of the biomass and the decrease of the caches in the last years.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the status of <b>NAFO</b> roughhead {{grenadier}} <b>Subarea</b> 2 and 3 stock. Different assessment methods have been applied based on the available data: XSA, ASPIC and a qualitative assessment based on survey and fishery information. The fit of the data to the XSA and ASPIC has been very poor mainly due to lack of contrast and conflicting information from the surveys data. Therefore the results are not considered representative of the stock situation. There are not available surveys indices covering the total distribution, in depth and area, of this stock. Biomass indices from the surveys with depth coverage till 1400 meters are considered as the best survey information available to monitor trends in resource status because they cover the depth distribution of roughhead grenadier fairly well. Surveys biomass indices present a general increasing trend in the period 1995 - 2004. In the period 2005 - 2012 all available indices show a clear downward trend except the Canadian Fall (2 J+ 3 K) index. In the most recent period (2013 - 2015) the information of the different indices is contradictory, the Canadian 2 J 3 K and the EU 3 L show an increase while EU-FC and EU 3 NO continue to decline.

40|$|An Extended Survivors Analysis {{was applied}} to the {{commercial}} catch at age data for Greenland Halibut in <b>NAFO</b> <b>Subarea</b> 2 and Divisions 3 KLMNO from 1975 - 2001 to assess the current status of the stock. The analysis was calibrated using Canadian and European Union research vessel survey data. Stock biomass at ages 5 and older is estimated to have increased during the late 1980 's and then declined rapidly during the period of high landings in the early 1990 's. Estimated fishing mortality has followed the trend in landings, increasing rapidly in the early 1990 's, remaining high as the stock was reduced to its historic lows and then declining to the low levels recorded during 1985 – 1990. The reduction in exploitation has resulted from both a decrease in the recorded landings and an increase in biomass following the better than average recruitment of the 1993 - 1995 year-classes. However, the assessment is considered to be very uncertain with respect to absolute estimates of stock size and it does not match the historic trends in the stock as illustrated by the longest survey series. The increasing trend in the late 1990 s is believed to be reflective of the stock trajectory during that period, however, the continued increasing trend since then is inconsistent with the trends in stock size from all other major sources. Given these concerns, the assessment in its present form therefore is considered unreliable for projecting future stock trends and potential catch levels. Dat...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the hydrographic variability within the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Scotian Shelf {{and the eastern}} Gulf of Maine, including the Bay of Fundy, during the decade 1991 – 2000. Comparisons are made with previous decadal means to place the 1990 s into a longer-term perspec-tive. The 1990 s decadal means of the near-surface salinity were the lowest ever recorded for the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Scotian Shelf and the Bay of Fundy. These low salinities were advected into these regions from the Labrador and Newfoundland Shelves and led to record or near record high vertical stratification in the upper layers of the water column. Also during the 1990 s, the decadal means of {{the temperature of the}} intermediate layer waters (approximately 30 – 150 m) were well below normal throughout the Gulf of St. Lawrence and over much of the Scotian Shelf. Similar low temperatures were first observed in the late 1980 s and were mainly caused by advection from the Labrador and Newfoundland Shelves, although local atmospheric cooling also contributed. In the deep channels and basins of <b>NAFO</b> <b>Subarea</b> 4, near-bottom decadal mean temperatures were high and linked to the persistence of Warm Slope Water along the shelf break. A notable exception occurred in 1998 when Labrador Slope Water moved southward along the continental slope as far as the Mid-dle Atlantic Bight, pushing the Warm Slope Water offshore. This much colder water subsequently penetrated onto the Scotian Shelf and into the Gulf of Maine resulting in the coldest conditions in the deep basins since the 1960 s...|$|E

Our results may indicated that the Canadian autumn survey have a clear year effect in the 1995 data for ages older than 6 and that this could be due to the lowest depth coverage of the survey in 1995 compared to 1996 - 2003. Therefore, shortening the Canadian autumn survey index to 1996 - 2003 the fit of the data improve and, consequently, we propose to eliminate the 1995 data of this survey in the assessment. The Canadian spring survey showed a big trend in the log q errors of ages 7 and 8, so it could be convenient to study the possibility of shortening the age range of this tuning indices to ages 1 to 6. The study also showed that the fit of the Spanish 3 NO survey is not very good for ages less than 5 years old, being the information given good for ages between 5 and 12 and, thus, it could be feasible to include this information in future assessments. The within, between surveys abundance correlations and the correlations between surveys and XSA abundance showed that surveys have many difficulties to track the ages 7, 8 and 9.
