5|$|Broadcast {{television}} in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest started on April 27, 1948, when KSTP-TV began broadcasting. Hubbard Broadcasting, which owns KSTP, is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> locally owned television company in Minnesota. There are 39 analog broadcast stations and 23 digital channels broadcast over Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|The Sheerness Times Guardian is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{newspaper}} {{serving the}} town and island at large, owned by the KM Group. The Sheppey Gazette recently closed after around 100 years of publication. It was owned by Northcliffe Media.|$|E
5|$|After the {{expiration}} of the trademark {{in the late}} 1990s, Burger King unsuccessfully tried to introduce the brand to the continent. After losing a lawsuit filed against it by Hungry Jack's ownership, the company ceded the territory to its franchisee. Hungry Jack's is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Burger King brand in Australia; Cowin's company Hungry Jack's PTY is the master franchise and thus is now responsible for oversight of the operations that country with Burger King only providing administrative and advertising support to ensure a common marketing scheme for {{the company and its}} products.|$|E

Bowerings Animal Feed Mill is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> industry still located at the docks. Being close to the M5 motorway and halfway between Bristol and Exeter, Bridgwater {{is also home to}} two major distribution centres, while retailer Argos has a regional distribution centre based at Huntworth. A new £100m Regional Agricultural Business Centre opened in 2007, following construction which began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1530, Mingyi Nyo's son 14-year-old Tabinshwehti succeeded him as king. Toungoo's {{stability}} {{continued to}} attract manpower {{from the surrounding}} regions, especially after 1533 when the Confederation sacked its erstwhile ally Prome. The tiny Toungoo was <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> ethnic Burman-led kingdom, and one surrounded by much larger kingdoms. Fortunately for Toungoo, the Confederation was distracted by internal leadership disputes, and Hanthawaddy, then the most powerful kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms, was weakly led. Tabinshwehti decided not {{to wait until the}} larger kingdoms' attention turned to him.|$|E
5|$|The Brighton Marine Palace and Pier, {{commonly}} known as Brighton Pier or the Palace Pier is a Grade II* listed pleasure pier in Brighton, England, located in the city centre opposite the Old Steine. Opening in 1899, {{it was the third}} pier to be constructed in Brighton after the Royal Suspension Chain Pier and the West Pier, but is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one still in operation. It is managed and operated by the Eclectic Bar Group.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals are <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Though the Meridian Star is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{newspaper}} {{printed in}} the city, {{there have been a}} few other historical newspapers. One such paper is the Memo Digest, a ten to twenty page publication published during the 1970s. The Digest focused on issues relevant to the African-American population of the region, gathering a circulation of about 5,000 people. Other newspapers in the city have included The Colored Messenger, The State, The Weekly Mercury, The Blade, Weekly Echo, Fair Play, Headlight, Meridian Morning Sun, Teacher and Preacher, and Clarion.|$|E
5|$|Azmy {{lost contact}} with the 89th Battalion during the night, due to the {{intensity}} of Israeli bombardment on Touscan. At morning on October 21 the Israelis attacked again, and the paratroopers managed to repulse the attack again, before falling back. By dusk the battalion had abandoned the Touscan strong point and managed to retreat northward. Azmy had the 81st and 89th Battalions pulled back to the Ismailia Stadium, where {{they were to be}} reconstituted. The Israelis also attacked Heneidac at dawn that day using armor and infantry with air and artillery support, and captured the position before noon. The paratrooper company there pulled back north and joined the rest of the 85th Battalion at Jebel Mariam, <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> defensive position occupied by the 182nd Paratrooper Brigade, and the last position on the Suez Canal before Ismailia.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Skagen's Skipper School {{was opened}} to train navigators for both fishing boats and {{merchant}} ships. It is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 {{students from the}} whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat. In 1955, the folkschool Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It has been extended several times over the years, most recently when a new wing was added in 2003. The private school Brovandeskolen, a so-called free school, opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach. A primary goal is active cooperation between pupils, teachers and parents.|$|E
5|$|The only {{single use}} cinema in Street was closed down and {{converted}} into a nightclub in the 1990s. Strode Theatre, linked to the Crispin School and Strode College complex, is <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> place to see films, exhibitions and live performances. It opened on 5 October 1963 with a performance by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In 1999 the theatre was expanded with a new foyer, bar and box office along with improved rehearsal space and stage access, {{at a cost of}} £750,000 by the Steel, Coleman Davis partnership who received an award for the design. The expansion was funded by the Arts Council England.|$|E

UConn completed their sixth undefeated season winning the 11th overall Championship (all-time record for both men's and women's college basketball) and 4th in a row (also a record for women's college basketball).

5|$|At de Launay's request, an {{additional}} force of 32 {{soldiers from the}} Swiss Salis-Samade regiment {{had been assigned to}} the Bastille on 7 July, adding to the existing 82 invalides pensioners who formed the regular garrison. De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone abutment that linked the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from that side of the fortress. The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation. The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was <b>now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was protecting a recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder. To make matters worse, the Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible to withstand a long siege.|$|E
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
