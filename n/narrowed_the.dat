5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Coulthard's second place <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> gap to Michael Schumacher in the Drivers' Championship to six points, while Häkkinen's win meant he closed to within two points of Coulthard. After the Grand Prix, McLaren were docked 10 points for a post-race technical infringement, resulting in Ferrari maintaining their lead in the Constructors' Championship with a four-point gap over McLaren, with seven races of the season remaining.|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{received}} the post-field goal kickoff, but again went three and out, punting {{the ball back}} to Virginia Tech.

5|$|Although Theodore {{appears to}} have assumed, and was {{addressed}} by, the imperial title almost immediately after the capture of Thessalonica, the date of his actual coronation is unknown. The French scholar Lucien Stiernon places it in the period between June 1227 and April 1228, but the Greek Apostolos D. Karpozilos rejects this, reasoning that Theodore had no obvious reason to delay his coronation for so long, and suggested that he was crowned in 1225, immediately after the council of Arta. Eleni Bees-Seferli on the other hand, based on the letters of Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227, while Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka has <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> date down to 29 May 1227.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> gender gap in life expectancy and now {{live longer than}} men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E
5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{received}} a 25-second penalty, which demoted him to third place and advanced Massa and Heidfeld to {{first and second}} positions. McLaren appealed the decision at the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) International Court of Appeal. Their case, however, was declared inadmissible, with the Court ruling that 25 second penalties cannot be challenged. The penalty prompted global press discussion, primarily from the United Kingdom and Italy, with several former drivers questioning the decision. Massa's retroactive victory, with Hamilton demoted to third, <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> gap in the Championship from six points to just two.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, The Post-Star {{reported}} that the Democrats had <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> field of potential candidates from over two dozen applicants down to six. The Democratic chairpersons met with all six candidates at a diner in Albany on February 1, and selected Scott Murphy of Glens Falls, president of the Upstate Venture Association of New York, as their candidate. Other confirmed candidates included Saratoga County Democratic Chairman Larry Bulman, former New York Rangers goaltender Mike Richter, Coxsackie Town Supervisor Alex Betke, and Tracey Brooks, failed candidate for the nomination for the 21st district election in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{second round}} opened at Hofstra's James M. Shuart Stadium with the Maryland–Syracuse match-up. Al Cavalieri filled {{in as the}} Orange goalkeeper for long-time starter John Galloway who was sick with the flu. Syracuse scored three {{unanswered}} goals {{in the first quarter}} before Maryland goalie Brian Phipps suffered an ACL tear. Terrapins midfielder Grant Catalino <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> deficit to 5–3 before halftime on an extra-man score. In the second half, Syracuse made defensive adjustments to shut down Maryland's behind-the-goal attack, and the Orange tallied three times in the span of 2:10 to pull away in the third quarter. Syracuse won, 11–6, and extended its postseason streak against Maryland to five.|$|E

5|$|At Shakur's {{sentencing}} {{hearing on}} April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33years in state prison (10 to 12 {{for the four}} counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster), to be served consecutively with her mandatory life sentence. However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the New Jersey Supreme Court had recently <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> application of the law. Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for contempt of court, concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise {{when he entered the}} courtroom. To become eligible for parole, Shakur would have had to serve a minimum of 25years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the planet}} is {{predicted}} to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere, the primary search {{is expected to be}} carried out using the Subaru Telescope, which has both an aperture large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams cooperatively expect the search to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 square degrees of sky near Orion, a swath of space, that in Batygin's opinion, could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square degrees of sky.|$|E
5|$|By May 1985, {{three months}} behind schedule, the review board <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> tenders {{down to two}} contenders in each group: IKL/HDW and Kockums for the submarine, Rockwell and Signaal for the combat system. The Walrus and Type 2400submarine designs were {{considered}} to be too expensive to manufacture because of inefficient building practices, while the combat data system tenders had been narrowed down by unjustified development risk in the Plessey and Krupp/Ferranti proposals, and the dual problems in the Sintra Alcatel tender of excessive power usage and incompatibility with the proposed American weapons system. On 9 May, the Australian cabinet approved the selections for the funded studies and decided that six submarines would be built, with the option for two more, all in Australia.|$|E

5|$|Despite taking {{victory in}} the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, Alonso was facing {{pressure}} heading into {{the second half of}} the season; he was forty-seven points behind Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship after scoring four points in the last two races. Alonso had been largely affected by safety car periods in Valencia and Silverstone despite his team having <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> performance gap on their championship rivals. However, Alonso remained upbeat about his title chances and said his team had more motivation to succeed despite his recent results. Hamilton, the defending race winner at the Hockenheimring, felt the race would give an indication on form for {{the second half of the}} year and believed McLaren should have a successful balance of their car in order to be competitive at the track.|$|E
5|$|Political party {{strength}} in Virginia has likewise been in flux. In the 2007 state elections, Democrats regained {{control of the}} State Senate, and <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> Republican majority in the House of Delegates to eight seats. Yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of Republican Bob McDonnell as Governor by a seventeen-point margin, {{the election of a}} Republican Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, as well as Republican gains of six seats in the House of Delegates. In 2011, the Republican caucus took over two-thirds (68–32) of the seats in the House of Delegates, and a majority of the Senate based on the Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling as the tie-breaker. Following the 2013 elections, Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected Governor by two percentage points, and Democrat Ralph Northam was elected Lieutenant Governor by double digits. Republicans, however, maintained their super-majority (68–32) in the House of Delegates. State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield.|$|E
5|$|Tarla Makaeff, {{who paid}} nearly $60,000 to Trump University in 2008, brought {{a class action}} lawsuit against Trump University on April 30, 2010, in U.S. District Court for Southern California. The suit, Makaeff v. Trump University, LLC, sought refunds for Makaeff and other former clients of Trump University, as well as punitive damages for breach of contract, fraud, negligent {{misrepresentation}} and bad faith. It did not originally name Donald Trump as a defendant, but did so in a later amended complaint. In February 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel denied recognition to the nationwide class the plaintiffs had requested and recognized the suit as class-action {{on the part of}} Trump University clients in three states – California, Florida, and New York – based on specific alleged violations of the consumer protection laws of those states. He also <b>narrowed</b> <b>the</b> case to five of the plaintiffs' original fourteen charges.|$|E
