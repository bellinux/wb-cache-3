25|$|The final part of {{the chain}} in getting the {{newspaper}} from printer to the reader are the news wholesalers and the newsagents. Newsagents sprang up in Cornwall in the 1850s, but still continued to buy direct from the publisher. This generally meant a long delivery time from publication dates to shelf date, particularly for the national newspapers. However, by the 1870s both independent and national chains of <b>news</b> <b>wholesaler</b> started to make inroads into Cornwall. Currently, there are just two news wholesalers in the County, who distribute all newspapers and magazines to all outlets, from the village Post Office to the hypermarket. They are Smiths News, who are based in Plymouth, but have sub-branches in Bodmin and Redruth, and DashNews, which distributes Cornwall & Devon Media titles as well as News International newspapers.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt at {{examining}} {{the extent to which}} indigenous news agencies in the third world are able to fracture the old order of information by providing alternative news. In other words, the thesis sets to examine whether indigenous third world <b>news</b> <b>wholesalers</b> could be viable alternatives to the international <b>news</b> <b>wholesalers</b> of the advanced industrialised capitalist countries as is hoped among NIIO advocates. The study focuses on the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) as a representation of such social institutions faced with the task of providing alternative window to the country's and indeed third world experience. For the purpose of providing a context for the analysis of social institutions such as the media we have drawn on primary and secondary material on the Nigerian society in which NAN operates. Similarly, primary and secondary material on NAN and other news agencies of the world have been used to assess the theoretical and empirical postulations advanced in the New International Information Order debate. In addition to foreign news content from NAN for instance, we have also excavated through the domestic news content so as to address the domestic dimension of the NIIO debate. In this regard the thesis has combined textual study with the sociological study of news production as a social process, as part of the method of analysis. The conclusions we arrived at are that far from fracturing the old order of information third world news agencies like NAN actually consolidate that old order in various ways. First, by relying on the same international news agencies for a larger part of their foreign news content, and secondly, by employing routine practices and assumptions that select certain news types, news locations, news actors and setting etc, and others, for inclusion into the news bulletin and, thirdly, by tending to focus towards more profitable services like the financial data (FD), as opposed to the non-profitable general news. These limitations more than their ownership by home governments or dearth of facilities, constrained such agencies like NAN in providing alternative news. It is for these that they disseminate a news product reflecting a skewed version of reality in so many ways that in the final count consolidate the prevailing order nationally and internationally, rather than providing a fundamental alternative...|$|R

By following the chronological development of a story, this article demonstrates how framing determined in agency planning processes influences the stories told to audiences by broadcasters. It is hypothesised that news agency economic priorities drive international event coverage planning; that news-coverage "frames" influence the news delivered to agency clients and the stories told to audiences by broadcasters; and that wealthy broadcasters {{are more likely to}} localise their coverage of international events, while smaller broadcasters relay to their audiences strictly the stories told by agencies. The case of the Mururoa nuclear testing and Tahiti independence rioting ill 1995 are used to demonstrate that the reproduction of news frames manufactured by news agencies may be expected among broadcasters worldwide, diminishing the possibility of multiple interpretations of global events...|$|R
50|$|The American News Company had {{its roots}} in two New York City {{newspaper}} and periodical wholesaling firms: Sinclair Tousey's company on Nassau St., and the firm Dexter, Hamilton & Co. at 22 Ann St. These were the two largest <b>news</b> and periodical <b>wholesalers</b> in New York City {{at the time of}} their merger on Feb. 1, 1864, when American News Company was formed. The seven original partners were Sinclair Tousey, John E. Tousey, Harry Dexter, George Dexter, John Hamilton, Patrick Farrelly, and Solomon W. Johnson. These partners formed the core of the company's management up until the death of the last surviving partner, Solomon Johnson, in 1913. Sinclair Tousey was the company's first president, followed after his death by Harry Dexter, who was succeeded by Solomon Johnson.|$|R
