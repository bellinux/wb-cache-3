25|$|Suppose a {{researcher}} flips a coin ten times and assumes a null {{hypothesis that the}} coin is fair. The test statistic is the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> and is two-tailed. Suppose the researcher observes alternating heads and tails with every flip (HTHTHTHTHT). This yields a test statistic of 5 and a p-value of 1 (completely unexceptional), as that is the expected <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{understand}} the effect of sub-concussive blows, a collegiate football team was monitored {{during the course of}} single football season with a helmet telemetry system and pre-season and post-season neurocognitive testing. Also a selected group of players had their helmets tested {{at the conclusion of the}} season for force attenuation properties. Relationships between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> impacts and changes in neurocognitive test scores and the helmet 2 ̆ 7 s force attenuation properties were evaluated. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> impacts (cumulative <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> impacts, average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> impacts per practice, and average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> impacts per session) was found to be statistically different between linemen and skill players except in the metric <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> impacts per game. The location <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> impacts was also statistically different between the positions but no different was noted for the metrics of magnitude. For neurocognitive tests there were no differences between the pre-season and post-season scores with and without the consideration of position. Changes in neurocognitive test scores similarly did not correlate with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> impacts sustained throughout the season. Finally, the used helmets were compared to new helmets of the same year and model. The used helmets were found to better attenuate force than their new counterparts. Furthermore, the force attenuation abilities of the used helmets did not correlate with the cumulative <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> impacts. While sub-concussive head impacts are still of serious concern they do not appear to have any direct correlation to neurocognitive test scores during the season or helmet attenuation function. ...|$|R

25|$|Head hunting, a male activity, {{would involve}} {{separating}} men from their women before, {{during and after}} coming back from an expedition.

25|$|Suppose a {{researcher}} flips a coin some arbitrary {{number of times}} (n) and assumes a null hypothesis that the coin is fair. The test statistic is the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> and is a two-tailed test. Suppose the researcher observes heads for each flip, yielding a test statistic of n and a p-value of 2/2n. If the coin was flipped only 5 times, the p-value would be 2/32 = 0.0625, which is not significant at the 0.05 level. But if the coin was flipped 10 times, the p-value would be 2/1024 ≈ 0.002, which is significant at the 0.05 level.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the initial}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads,</b> the monster's {{capacity}} to regenerate lost heads varies {{with time and}} author. The first mention of this ability of the Hydra occurs with Euripides, where the monster grew back a pair of heads for each one severed by Heracles. Palaephatus, Ovid and Diodorus Siculus concur with Euripides, while Servius has the Hydra grow back three heads each time; the Suda does not give a number. Depictions of the monster dating to c. 500 BCE show it with a double tail as well as multiple heads, suggesting the same regenerative ability at work, but no literary accounts have this feature.|$|E

25|$|The Requiem Mass held on 8 April 2005 {{was said}} to have set world records both for {{attendance}} and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> of state present at a funeral. (See: List of Dignitaries.) It was the single largest gathering of heads of state in history, surpassing the funerals of Winston Churchill (1965) and Josip Broz Tito (1980). Four kings, five queens, at least 70 presidents and prime ministers, and more than 14 leaders of other religions attended alongside the faithful. It is likely to have been the largest single pilgrimage of Christianity ever with numbers estimated in excess of four million mourners gathering in and around Vatican City. Between 250,000 and 300,000 watched the event from within the Vatican's walls.|$|E
25|$|We {{can view}} Ω {{as a measure}} of our lack of {{knowledge}} about a system. As an illustration of this idea, consider a set of 100 coins, each of which is either heads up or tails up. The macrostates are specified by the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> and tails, whereas the microstates are specified by the facings of each individual coin. For the macrostates of 100 heads or 100 tails, there is exactly one possible configuration, so our knowledge of the system is complete. At the opposite extreme, the macrostate which gives us the least knowledge about the system consists of 50 heads and 50 tails in any order, for which there are 100,891,344,545,564,193,334,812,497,256 (100 choose 50) ≈ 1029 possible microstates.|$|E
25|$|The oldest extant Hydra {{narrative}} {{appears in}} Hesiod's Theogony, while the oldest {{images of the}} monster are found {{on a pair of}} bronze fibulae dating to c. 700 BCE. In both these sources, the main motifs of the Hydra myth are already present: a multi-headed serpent that is slain by Heracles and Iolaus. While the fibulae portray a six-headed Hydra, its <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> was first fixed in writing by Alcaeus (c. 600 BCE), who gave it nine heads. Simonides, writing a century later, increased the number to fifty, while Euripides, Virgil and others did not bother to give an exact figure. Heraclitus the paradoxographer rationalized the myth by suggesting that the Hydra would have been a single-headed snake accompanied by its offspring.|$|E

40|$|The {{aggregation}} {{properties of}} single-chain surfactants bearing one (H 1), two (H 2), and three (H 3) trimethylammonium head {{groups have been}} studied by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Growth of aggregates was observed to decrease dramatically {{with an increase in}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> groups in the surfactants. The micelles grow progressively smaller with every increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> groups <b>of</b> the surfactants. Aggregation number (N) continuously decreases and the fractional charge (α) gradually increases with the increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> groups. The semiminor axis (a) and semimajor axis (b=c) of the micelle decrease strongly with the increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>head</b> groups. In the case of H 1, dramatic micellar growth is observed on addition of salts such as KBr and sodium salicylate, but this type of micellar growth is not observed in the cases of H 2 and H 3 when the above salts are added to their micellar solutions. Aggregation <b>number</b> and size <b>of</b> the micelles remain almost the same, even after addition of KBr at a concentration as high as 100 mM. This observation with multiheaded cationic surfactants is unusual. Clearly, the charge density at the <b>head</b> group level <b>of</b> surfactants markedly influences their micellar aggregation properties...|$|R

25|$|The gross {{capacity}} of older HDDs is calculated {{as the product}} of the number of cylinders per recording zone, the number of bytes per sector (most commonly 512), and the count of zones of the drive. Some modern SATA drives also report cylinder-head-sector (CHS) capacities, but these are not physical parameters because the reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces. The C/H/S scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing (LBA), a simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by an integer index, which starts at LBA 0 for the first block and increments thereafter. When using the C/H/S method to describe modern large drives, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> is often set to 64, although a typical hard disk drive, , has between one and four platters.|$|E
25|$|Common intuition {{suggests}} that if a fair coin is tossed many times, then roughly half {{of the time it}} will turn up heads, and the other half it will turn up tails. Furthermore, the more often the coin is tossed, the more likely it should be that the ratio of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> to the number of tails will approach unity. Modern probability theory provides a formal version of this intuitive idea, known as the law of large numbers. This law is remarkable because it is not assumed in the foundations of probability theory, but instead emerges from these foundations as a theorem. Since it links theoretically derived probabilities to their actual frequency of occurrence in the real world, the law of large numbers is considered as a pillar in the history of statistical theory and has had widespread influence.|$|E
500|$|Ganesha {{has been}} {{represented}} {{with the head}} of an elephant since the early stages of his appearance in Indian art. [...] Puranic myths provide many explanations for how he got his elephant head. One of his popular forms, Heramba-Ganapati, has five elephant heads, and other less-common variations in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> are known. While some texts say that Ganesha was born with an elephant head, he acquires the head later in most stories. The most recurrent motif in these stories is that Ganesha was created by Parvati using clay to protect her and Shiva beheaded him when Ganesha came between Shiva and Parvati. Shiva then replaced Ganesha's original head with that of an elephant. [...] Details of the battle and where the replacement head came from varying from source to source. Another story says that Ganesha was created directly by Shiva's laughter. Because Shiva considered Ganesha too alluring, he gave him the head of an elephant and a protruding belly.|$|E
