25|$|In 1982, the IWC finally {{voted in}} favor of a {{moratorium}} on commercial whaling to go into force in 1986 (25–7–5). Japan objected to the moratorium and continued whaling (Under the ICRW an objecting nation is exempted from the disputed regulations. Japan also continued to hunt sperm whales despite a 1981 IWC zero catch quota.). The United States would {{play a significant role in}} Japan's acceptance of a global moratorium on commercial whaling due to its domestic laws. In particular the 1971 Pelly Amendment to the US Fishermen's Protection Act gives the US President legal authority to prohibit importation of fish products from any <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> diminishing the effectiveness of fisheries conservation programs.

He launched a program called Opportunity NYC which is the nation's first-ever conditional cash transfer pilot program designed to help New Yorkers break the cycle of poverty in the city.

25|$|Bremmer uses 'pivot state' to {{describe}} a <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> able to build profitable relationships with multiple other major powers without becoming overly reliant on any one of them. This ability to hedge allows a pivot state to avoid capture—in terms of security or economy—at {{the hands of a}} single country. In his book, Every Nation for Itself: Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World (New York: Portfolio, 2012), Bremmer explains how, in a volatile G-Zero world, the ability to pivot will take on increased importance. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum are shadow states that are frozen within the influence of a single power. The United States' neighbors illustrate the terms very well. With significant trade ties with both the United States and Asia and formal security ties with NATO, Canada is a good example of a pivot state that is hedged against a slowdown in or conflict with any single major power. Mexico, on the other hand, is a shadow state due to its overwhelming reliance on the US economy.|$|E

He is now {{also a member of}} the publication's Editorial Advisory Board, as well as the main contributor to its website and editor of its blog. In October 2004, he accepted the Jack London Literary Prize from The Occidental Quarterly, using the award ceremony as an occasion to argue for the need for a [...] "white ethnostate" [...] to maintain high racial birthrates. In his acceptance speech, he stated, [...] "The best way to preserve ethnic interests is to defend an ethnostatea <b>nation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> explicitly intended to preserve the ethnic interests of its citizens." [...] According to MacDonald, one of the functions of such a state would be to exclude non-European immigrants who are attracted to the state by its wealth and prosperity. At the conclusion of his speech, he remarked:The alternative faced by Europeans throughout the Western world is to place themselves in a position of enormous vulnerability in which their destinies will be determined by other peoples, many of whom hold deep historically conditioned hatreds toward them. Europeans' promotion of their own displacement is the ultimate foolishnessan historical mistake of catastrophic proportions.|$|E
