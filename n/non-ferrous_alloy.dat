50|$|Time Capsule I {{was made}} of a <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>alloy</b> called Cupaloy, created {{especially}} for this project. Designed to resist corrosion for 5,000 years, the alloy {{was made of}} 99.4% copper, 0.5% chromium, and 0.1% silver. Westinghouse claims that Cupaloy has the same strength as steel, yet will resist most corrosion over thousands of years because it becomes an anode in electrolytic reactions, receiving deposits instead of wasting away like most iron-bearing metals. Time Capsule II was made of a stainless steel metal called Kromarc, supplied by U.S. Steel. Westinghouse Research Laboratories determined, with extensive chemical testing, that this new super-stainless steel alloy would resist corrosion, much like the alloy used for Time Capsule I. Invented by Frederick Charles Hull,> Kromarc 55 stainless steel is composed of 52.60% iron, 21.24% nickel, 15.43% chromium, 8.20% manganese, 2.15% molybdenum, 0.22% silicon, 0.05% carbon, 0.013% phosphorus, and 0.012% sulfur.|$|E

The main objective of the work is the selection of the optimum combination of materials depending on changes in loading conditions.

The histograms of non-ferrous materials wear and the total wear of the friction pair are presented.

In order to seek the best testing method of resin sand high temperature compressive strength, a self-developed instrument was used to carry out experiments, and the sample shape and size were designed and studied.

The high temperature compressive strengths of phenol-formaldehyde resin coated sand, furan resin self-setting sand, and TEA resin sand were each tested.

Standard foundry equipment that included universal strength machine, permeability meter, hardness tester, shatter index machine and quick moisture teller in the foundry workshop and laboratory of Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited, Nigeria were used as the research equipment. The foundry properties measured were the moisture content, green and dry compressive strength, permeability and shatter index of sand moulds bonded with varied combinations of the composite materials.

40|$|Spray forming is a {{competitive}} low-cost alternative to ingot metallurgy for manufacturing ferrous and <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>alloy</b> shapes. It produces materials with a reduced number of processing steps, while maintaining materials properties, {{with the possibility}} of near-net-shape manufacturing. However, there are several hurdles to large-scale commercial adoption of spray forming: 1) ensuring strip is consistently flat, 2) eliminating porosity, particularly at the deposit/substrate interface, and 3) improving material yield. Through this program, a new strip/sheet casting process, termed spray rolling, has been developed, which is an innovative manufacturing technique to produce aluminum net-shape products. Spray rolling combines the benefits of twin-roll casting and conventional spray forming, showing a promising potential to overcome the above hurdles associated with spray forming. Spray rolling requires less energy and generates less scrap than conventional processes and, consequently, enables the development of materials with lower environmental impacts in both processing and final products. Spray Rolling was developed as a collaborative project between the University of California-Davis, the Colorado School of Mines, the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, and an industry team. The following objectives of this project were achieved: (1) Demonstration of the feasibility of the spray rolling process at the bench-scale level and evaluation of the materials properties of spray rolled aluminum strip alloys; and (2) Demonstration of 2 X scalability of the process and documentation of technical hurdles to further scale up and initiate technology transfer to industry for eventual commercialization of the process...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demands of economical, reliable and durable hydraulic and pneumatic systems, {{it is necessary}} to minimize the material damage from cavitation erosion (CE) when systems are handling cavitating and corrosive fluids. Cavitation erosion is a nausea for many engineering components, such as ship propellers & rudders, turbine, diesel engine, cylinder liner, pump impeller vanes, control valves, hydraulic turbines, bearings, pipes, ultrasonic cleaners and mechanical heart valves, which are exposed to the high-speed flowing or vibratory fluids. This paper reviews the rationale behind the application of laser surface modification for achieving CE resistant surfaces of fluid handling components. The problem of CE may be tackled by enhancing the surface properties of the base materials (ferrous and <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>alloys)</b> with various laser surface modification techniques including laser transformation hardening (LTH), laser surface melting (LSM), laser surface alloying (LSA), laser cladding (LC), laser dispersion (LD) and laser plasma hybrid spraying (LPHS).
