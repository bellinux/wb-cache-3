5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being <b>negatively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> high hyena populations.|$|E
5|$|The pied currawong's {{impact on}} smaller birds that are {{vulnerable}} to nest predation is controversial: several {{studies have suggested that}} the species has become a serious problem, but the truth of this widely held perception was queried in a 2001 review of the published literature on their foraging habits by Bayly and Blumstein of Macquarie University, who observed that common introduced birds were more affected than native birds. However, predation by pied currawongs has been a factor in the decline of Gould's petrel at a colony on Cabbage Tree Island, near Port Stephens in New South Wales; currawongs have been reported preying on adult seabirds. Their removal from the islands halted a decline of the threatened petrels. Furthermore, a University of New England study published in 2006 reported that the breeding success rates for the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis) and scarlet robin (Petroica boodang) on the New England Tablelands were improved after nests were protected and currawongs culled, and some yellow robins even re-colonised an area where they had become locally extinct. The presence of pied currawongs in Sydney gardens is <b>negatively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> the presence of silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis).|$|E

40|$|Speech {{recognition}} errors {{have been}} shown to <b>negatively</b> <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> user satisfaction in evaluations of task-oriented spoken dialogue systems. In the domain of tutorial dialogue systems, however, where the primary evaluation metric is student learning, there has been little investigation of whether speech recognition errors also <b>negatively</b> <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> learning. In this paper we examine correlations between student learning and automatic speech recognition performance, in a corpus of dialogues collected with an intelligent tutoring spoken dialogue system. We examine numerous quantitative measures of speech recognition error, including rejection versus misrecognition errors, word versus sentence-level errors, and transcription versus semantic errors. Our results show that although many of our students experience problems with speech recognition, none of our measures <b>negatively</b> <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> student learning. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether an overall student disengagement label and six different labels of disengagement type are predictive {{of learning in}} a spoken dialog computer tutoring corpus. Our results show first that although students' percentage of overall disengaged turns <b>negatively</b> <b>correlates</b> <b>with</b> the amount they learn, the individual types of disengagement <b>correlate</b> differently <b>with</b> learning: some <b>negatively</b> <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> learning, while others don't <b>correlate</b> <b>with</b> learning at all. Second, we show that these relationships change somewhat depending on student prerequisite knowledge level. Third, we show that using multiple disengagement types to predict learning improves predictive power. Overall, our results suggest that although adapting to disengagement should improve learning, maximizing learning requires different system interventions depending on disengagement type. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

For example, some oak fungal endophytes are positively correlated with the levels of damage from leaf miners (Cameraria spp.), although <b>negatively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> number of larvae present due to a reduction of oviposition on infected plants, which partially mitigates the higher damage rate. This continuum between mutualism and pathogenicity of endophytic fungi has major implications for plant fitness depending on the species of partners available in a given environment; mutualist status is conditional in a way similar to pollination and can shift {{from one to the}} other just as frequently.|$|E
25|$|A {{large scale}} survey of {{residents}} of Great Britain found that average levels {{of all the}} Big Five, including conscientiousness, vary across regional districts in England, Wales and Scotland. High levels of conscientiousness were found throughout much of Southern England, scattered areas of the Midlands, {{and most of the}} Scottish Highlands. Low levels of conscientiousness were observed in London, Wales, and parts of the North of England. Higher mean levels of regional conscientiousness were positively correlated with voting for the Conservative Party, and <b>negatively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> voting for the Labour Party, in the 2005 and 2010 elections, and also correlated with a higher proportion of married residents, with higher life expectancy for men and women, fewer long-term health problems, and with lower rates of mortality from stroke, cancer, and heart disease. Higher regional conscientiousness was also correlated with lower median annual income in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dialogue}} between transhumanism and faith was a one-day conference {{held at the}} University of Toronto in 2004. Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor {{a relationship with the}} divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and anomie. Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment. Following this dialogue, William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist of religion, conducted a pilot study, published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, suggesting that religious attitudes were <b>negatively</b> <b>correlated</b> <b>with</b> acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.|$|E
