In this paper, a framework of the <b>NC</b> <b>lathing</b> dynamic simulation system is presented and the machining process simulation is developed based on the solid modeling method with ACIS geometric engine and 3 D graphic display. The tool swept volume is designed and Boolean difference of the cutter swept volume with the raw stock in the system is calculated. The user or trainee can practice all operations, procedures and skills in complete safety, while maintaining {{a high degree of}} realism...|$|E
