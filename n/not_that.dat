5|$|Ain't {{has several}} antecedents in English, {{corresponding}} to {{the various forms of}} to be not and to have <b>not</b> <b>that</b> ain't contracts.

5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> it would not bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{makes it}} a federal crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner.

5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were <b>not</b> <b>that</b> {{of the party}} of Lincoln, but those of the Gilded Age. The feud continued on and off through 1911, {{a year in which}} there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E

5|$|At the Boels Rental Hills Classic Van Dijk {{was part}} of front group that {{consisted}} of six riders which fell apart into {{a group of three}} riders. With an uphill finish, Van Dijk lost the sprint from Johansson (Orica-AIS) and finished second ahead of Amy Pieters (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk won the mountain classification of the race. In June, Van Dijk started as the main favourite at the Dutch National Time Trial Championships, but did not win her fourth time trial title. She finished second, with a margin of only 0.02 seconds, behind Annemiek van Vleuten (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk was disappointed and responded that she was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> good as in 2013 without having a real explanation for it.|$|E
5|$|During May {{we had a}} weird game at Bristol v. Gloucester. We scored 200 for 1 wicket. W. G. {{then went}} on and took 5 wickets, {{and we were all}} out for 300.

5|$|Ecgbert {{was the son}} of Eata, who was {{descended from}} the founder of the kingdom of Bernicia. His brother Eadberht was king of Northumbria from 737 to 758. Ecgbert went to Rome with another brother, and was ordained deacon while still there. Ecgbert has been claimed to have been a student of Bede, who much later visited with Ecgbert in 733 at York, but this {{statement}} may simply mean that Ecgbert was a student of Bede's writings, and <b>not</b> <b>that</b> he was formally taught by him.|$|E

5|$|Faramir first {{encountered}} the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien and recognized {{them to be}} the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions including Boromir, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir, since he knew, although Frodo at that point did <b>not,</b> <b>that</b> Boromir was already dead. One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the Anduin river after seeing a boat there. It contained the dead body of his brother, {{who had been killed}} by Orcs after Frodo left the group.|$|E
5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was <b>not,</b> <b>that</b> Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E

5|$|Johansson has {{supported}} various charitable organizations, including Aid Still Required, Cancer Research UK, Stand Up To Cancer, Too Many Women (which works against breast cancer), and USA Harvest, which provides food {{for people in}} need. In 2005, Johansson became a Global Ambassador for the aid and development agency Oxfam. In 2007, Johansson took part in social advocacy {{as part of the}} anti-poverty campaign ONE, which was organized by U2 lead singer Bono. In March 2008, a UK-based bidder paid £20,000 on an eBay auction to benefit Oxfam, winning a hair and makeup treatment, a pair of tickets, and a chauffeured trip to accompany Johansson on a 20-minute date to the world premiere of He's Just <b>Not</b> <b>That</b> Into You.|$|E
5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive.
