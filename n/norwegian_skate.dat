50|$|Dipturus nidarosiensis, {{commonly}} known as the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>skate</b> or black skate, is a species of skate found in the Norwegian Sea, North Sea and the Bay of Biscay. It is occasionally encountered off the western coast of Ireland, and historically has been found near Rockall and in the Norwegian Deep, though recent surveys have not identified the species there. It inhabits waters from 200m to over 1000m in depth. In 2010, researchers reported the species in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time.|$|E
50|$|The marine fish found off Mauritania's coast are an {{important}} resource for commercial, subsistence and sport fishing, estimates put the potential catch at between 400,000 and 700,000 tons. The rich waters off the Mauritanian coast are host {{to a variety of}} species more familiar in more northerly temperate waters such as European seabass, European hake, <b>Norwegian</b> <b>skate</b> and Gilt-head bream, as well as species more typical of warmer waters including whale shark, Atlantic bluefin tuna, Atlantic sailfish, tarpon and Atlantic blue marlin 56 species of freshwater fish have been reported from Mauritania of which 50 have been confirmed as occurring.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFourteen {{specimens}} of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>skate,</b> Dipturus nidarosiensis (Rajiformes, Rajidae), were caught off the Sardinian coasts (Central Western Mediterranean Sea) in 2005 - 2008 between 600 and 1420 m of depth. Their identification {{has been confirmed}} by the sequencing of three regions of the mtDNA (16 SrDNA, control region and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) and comparison of the obtained sequences with that of three species of Dipturus (D. batis, D. oxyrinchus and D. nidarosiensis) from the Mediterranean Sea and the adjacent North-eastern Atlantic Ocean. A simple PCR-RFLP assay has been developed for an easy, reliable and robust identification of these skate species. A morphological comparison of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>skate</b> with congeneric species is given {{in order to help}} future identifications. This is the first record ofD. nidarosiensis in the Mediterranean Sea; the possibility of recent or ancient but unnoticed occurrence of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>skate</b> in the region is discusse...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{confirms}} {{the presence of}} the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>skate</b> Dipturus nidarosiensis (Storm, 1881) in the Mediterranean Sea, by means of morphological traits and molecular markers providing the first record of this species in the Alboran Sea. Cannas et al. (2010) reported D. nidarosiensis {{for the first time in}} the Mediterranean from specimens captured in the central western basin, but Ebert & Stehmann (2013) and Stehmann et al. (2015) considered these records "likely refer to the smaller morphotype, Dipturus sp. ", a species not yet described. Eight specimens of the Dipturus genus (Rajiformes: Rajidae) were caught off the Alboran Island (western Mediterranean) in 2012, 2013 and 2016, between 620 and 819 m depth. These specimens showed morphometric diagnostic features corresponding to those of Norwegian skates from the Northeast Atlantic and the central western Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, the Alboran individuals were genetically compared to Northeast Atlantic specimens available in GenBank by means of two mitochondrial DNA fragments: cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb). Analyses showed that the Northeast Atlantic <b>Norwegian</b> <b>skate</b> specimens and the Alboran Sea ones were genetically similar and shared haplotypes, corroborating the identification of the Alboran individuals as Dipturus nidarosiensis. However, they were different from other Dipturus species distributed throughout the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. Our results confirm the occurrence of this deep-sea large skate species in the Mediterranean, although the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species does not consider it possible (Stehmann et al., 2015) Versión del edito...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three Dipturus nidarosiensis (Collett, 1880) (Elasmobranchii: Rajidae) were {{collected}} off {{the coasts of}} Sardinia between 550 m and 1688 m of depth in 2005 - 2011. A first description of some biological aspects as the vertical distribution, the reproduction and the diet of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>skate</b> from the Central Western Mediterranean is provided. Females attained a greater length than males, they mature at larger sizes and were found mature always at depths of 550 - 600 m {{in the same area}} of the Southern coast of Sardinia. The diet of D. nidarosiensis was based almost entirely on decapod crustaceans and completed by bony fish...|$|E
