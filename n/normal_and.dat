5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than <b>normal,</b> <b>and</b> more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is <b>normal,</b> <b>and</b> increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E

At room temperature DST discriminates between <b>normals</b> <b>and</b> patients with an accuracy of 77 %. On maximum vasodilatation no significant differences can be found in DBP <b>and</b> DBF between <b>normals</b> <b>and</b> patients. However, DBF was significantly different between male and females both in <b>normals</b> <b>and</b> in patients. During gradual cooling a decrease in DBF (a closing phenomenon) was observed both in <b>normals</b> <b>and</b> patients. In contrast DBP did not show a substantial pressure drop. Calculating digit to brachial systolic pressure indexes (DBI) a slight significant increase can be found during cold provocation both in <b>normals</b> <b>and</b> in patients. Only the DBI of digit IV during cold provocation showed a significant differ-ence between <b>normals</b> <b>and</b> patients which resulted in an accuracy of 83 %...|$|R

5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite <b>normal,</b> <b>and</b> will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
