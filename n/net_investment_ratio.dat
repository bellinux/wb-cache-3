Four—fifths of this decline was due to the increased ratio of depreciation to GNP and only one—fifth to the decreased ratio of gross investment to GNP. The increased ratio of depreciation to GNP was in turn due in equal amounts to the higher ratio of capital to GNP and to the higher rate of depreciation. Nearly half of the higher depreciation rate was due to the increased rate of depreciation of equipment and nearly half to the increased share of equip-ment in the capital stock...|$|E
40|$|Processing alfalfa {{for export}} is of {{significant}} interest to areas like Millard County, the largest hay-producing county in Utah. In {{the past year}} there have ix been significant reductions {{in the price of}} hay as a result of increased supplies in the central and western United States. This thesis analyzes the benefits and costs of processing alfalfa into cubes and recompressed bales in order to enter the export market. Costs of production were estimated through the use of enterprise budgets first for the farmer to establish the costs and returns for raising the hay, and secondly for cubing and recompressing the alfalfa at different levels of production and different prices based on those levels of production. The cash flows from these different enterprises were then analyzed using benefit cost <b>ratios,</b> <b>net</b> benefit <b>investment</b> <b>ratios,</b> and internal rates of return. The general conclusion reached is that it is feasible to process alfalfa for export. Profits are sensitive to the price spread between raw and finished products more so than to production efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper in this journal Knapp (1977) {{examines}} the relation-ship between {{education and the}} intensity and time span of postschool human investment. By utilizing the Mincer (1974) specification of the human capital earnings function, and a technique developed in Knapp and Hansen (1976), Knapp estimates that the initial <b>investment</b> <b>ratio</b> upon entering the labor market, ko, is lower for those with more educa-tion. Further, {{he argues that the}} period of positive <b>net</b> <b>investment,</b> T, is longer for those with more schooling. The purpose of this note is to show that the use of an alternative estimating procedure indicates that the <b>investment</b> <b>ratio</b> is higher for those with more education. This result is found to hold when we use coefficient estimates from Knapp's own data and when we employ data from the one-in-one-hundred file of the 1970 Census. In addition, estimates of T obtained from the Census data indicate that the <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> span is shorter, rather than longer, for those groups with more education. Knapp uses the following specification of the human capital model suggested by Mincer (1974, p. 91), where the proportion of potential earnings invested in postschool training declines linearly from some initial fraction, ko, to zero after T years of positive <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> (such that k, = ko(l- tiT)) : (1) In Y, = fA-ko(l +ko 12) ]+ r.

40|$|In the {{literature}} of comprehensive national accounts, national <b>net</b> <b>investments</b> are used to indicate dynamic welfare improvement in an economy.

In the present paper, I compare these two approaches and prove that they coincide with each other only if the future commodity flows to the sector can be attributed to current stock of capital assets in the sector alone.

40|$|The {{theory of}} welfare {{accounting}} shows that comprehensive measures of <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> {{can be used}} to test whether an economy is following unsustainable paths of consumption.

Calculating augmented <b>net</b> <b>investment</b> for the world’s top twenty oil producers, we show that the difference with standard non-augmented measures can be large and may even revert some established conclusions regarding sustainability: prospects are more favorable than previously thought in oil-exporting countries endowed with large reserves like Angola, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. In oil-importing economies, future consumption possibilities are limited by the lack of expected rental incomes from future resource exports...|$|R

Evidence from a {{balanced}} panel of 18 industries between 1967 and 1987 reveals a negative non-linear relationship. The negative relation occurs at levels of unionization between 0 and approximately 50 %, with a plateau above this level.
