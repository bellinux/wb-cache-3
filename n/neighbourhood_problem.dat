40|$|For a given finite {{class of}} finite graphs H, a graph G {{is called a}} {{realization}} of H if the neighbourhood of its any vertex induces the subgraph isomorphic to a graph of H. We consider the following problem known as the Generalized <b>Neighbourhood</b> <b>Problem</b> (GNP) : given a finite class of finite graphs H, does there exist a non-empty graph G that is a realization of H? In fact, there are two modifications of that problem, namely the finite (the existence of a finite realization is required) and infinite one (the realization is required to be infinite). In this paper we show that GNP and its modifications for all finite classes H of finite graphs are reduced to the same problems with an additional restriction on H. Namely, the orders of any two graphs of H are equal and every graph of H has exactly s dominating vertices. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, in Russia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Young {{people in}} {{disadvantaged}} neighbourhoods {{are often the}} focus of concerns about anti-social behaviour (ASB). There is inconsistent {{evidence to support the}} hypothesis that perceptions of ASB (PASB) are associated with poor health. We ask whether perceptions of young people's ASB are associated with poor health; and whether health, demographic and (psycho) social characteristics can help explain why PASB varies within disadvantaged neighbourhoods (Glasgow, UK). Methods Regression analysis of survey data exploring associations between perceiving teenagers hanging around to be a serious <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>problem</b> and SF- 12 v 2 mental and physical health scores (higher = better), including adjustment for demographic characteristics. Further analysis explored associations with self-reported measures of health service use, psychosocial characteristics of homes and neighbourhoods and social contacts. Results 6008 adults participated (50 % response) and 22 % (n = 1, 332) said teenagers were a serious <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>problem</b> (the most frequently reported local problem). Demographic characteristics associated with perceiving serious teenager problems included regular health service use, age (inverse relationship), financial problems and living with children. Lower SF- 12 v 2 physical health scores were associated with perceiving teenager problems after adjustment for demographic variables (OR 0. 98; 95 %CI 0. 97, 0. 99; p = p = 0. 103). Further analysis suggested that perceiving teenager problems was more strongly associated with a number of self-reported psychosocial factors: e. g. lacking social support, Conclusions Given the evidence we found of weak and small associations between PASB and health, we caution against assuming that tackling concern about teenagers' ASB will lead to substantial public health gains in disadvantaged areas. Although the findings do not present a compelling case for making PASB a public health priority, it is still important to address concerns about young people's ASB. Reasons for doing so may include improving social cohesion, reducing fear and isolation, and improving the general quality of people's lives - particularly in neighbourhoods burdened by multiple disadvantages. Future research should evaluate interventions that attempt to reduce PASB in disadvantaged areas. Findings from this study could help inform the targeting of such interventions. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{associations}} of perceptions of neighbourhood cohesion and <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>problems</b> and objectively measured neighbourhood deprivation {{with the use of}} neighbourhood resources by older adults with and without lower limb osteoarthritis (LLOA), and to assess whether these relationships are stronger in older persons with LLOA than in those without the condition. Data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study were used. American College of Rheumatology classification criteria were used to diagnose clinical LLOA (knee and/or hip osteoarthritis). Use of neighbourhood resources was assessed using the Home and Community Environment instrument. Participants were asked about their perceptions of neighbourhood cohesion and <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>problems.</b> Objective <b>neighbourhood</b> deprivation was assessed using the Index of Multiple Deprivation score based on 2010 census data. Of the 401 participants (71 - 80  years), 74 (18. 5  %) had LLOA. The neighbourhood measures were not significantly associated with use of resources in the full sample. A trend for a negative association between use of public transport and perceived <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>problems</b> was observed in participants with LLOA (OR =  0. 77, 99  % CI =  0. 53 - 1. 12), whereas a trend for a positive association between perceived <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>problems</b> and use of public transport was found in participants without LLOA (OR =  1. 18, 99  % CI =  1. 00 - 1. 39).

In {{order to be able}} to study various seemingly independent degeneracy phenomena from a unifying viewpoint a so-called degeneracy graph (DG for short) is defined, and its properties analysed. Cycling of the simplex method for LP is analysed and a method to construct cycling examples of arbitrary size is proposed. The <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>problem</b> is solved by a new approach to determine a minimal N-tree (N for neighbour), and an efficient method to determine all vertices of a convex polytope is described. A new version of the simplex method is indicated that does not need Phase 1, should be faster than commercial codes and automatically contains an anticycling device. For a degenerate optimal solution of an LP-problem, sensitivity analysis as well as shadow price determination and interpretation are tackled by using a special class of DG's, the so-called optimum DG's.

40|$|Because of {{aggravating}} antisocial behaviour (ASB) or the <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>problem</b> in housing, {{many western}} governments have given ASB control a central {{place in their}} policy agendas. However, tackling ASB often involves {{a great deal of}} politics. Although ASB and controlling it have attracted much scholarly attention, the focus has almost always been placed on social housing. It is unclear whether this problem does not exist in other types of housing or if it is simply ignored. Drawing on a study of private housing developments in Hong Kong, this article examines the extent and seriousness of ASB as a problem in private housing. It shows that the problem does raise wide concerns among residents, and that many residents complain about noise nuisances and littering in their living places. On the other hand, most residents feel that the efforts of housing management agents in countering the problem are in vain or inadequate. In fact, when reacting to ASB, housing managers inevitably face a number of issues that originate from the joint appointment of managers by all homeowners and the lack of enforcement powers. In particular, controlling some neighbourhood nuisances is difficult and costly. This article concludes with an agenda for empirical research to explain the proliferation of ASB from the transaction-cost perspective...|$|E
40|$|Time {{synchronization}} {{between the}} sensor nodes to reduce {{end to end}} delay for critical and real time data monitoring {{can be achieved by}} cautiously monitoring the mobility of the mobile sink node in underwater wireless sensor networks. The proposed Alive-in-Range (AR-MAC) medium access control protocol monitors delay sensitive, critical and real time data. The idea evolves as a reduction in duty cycle, precise time scheduling of active/sleep cycles of the sensors, monitoring the mobility of the sink node along-with the selection of appropriate queues and schedulers can reduce the end to end delay enhancing other performance metrics too. The algorithms effective path determination and optimum throughput path determination are proposed. It is assumed that the sensors are properly anchored to limit their movement due to waves within the permissible limits to follow these algorithms. This paper attempts to utilize electromagnetic waves at resonance frequency of 2. 4 GHz for underwater communication. The results verify that the implementation of Alive-in-Range MAC protocol has reduced the average end to end delay significantly making it appropriate for critical and real time data monitoring. This work proves the suitability of electromagnetic waves as an effective alternative for underwater wireless communication. The main objective is to mitigate sink <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>problem,</b> distance constrained mobile sink problem and to reduce the average end to end delay by implementing Alive-in-Range (AR-MAC) medium access control protocol in underwater sensor networks and to draw the attention of researchers in this area...|$|E

We then draw on qualitative interviews to illuminate how such problems impact on family life. Our data indicate that the Norwegian housing model works well for a majority of immigrants, while a minority faces severe obstacles.

Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained from a survey on health related behaviour. Subjects were 2009 current and former smokers, aged 20 – 46, living in deprived neighbourhoods in Rotterdam, the second largest city in the Netherlands. Three groups of smokers were formed according to the stages of change-definitions of the Transtheoretical Model: smokers not planning to quit (precontemplators), smokers planning to quit (contemplators/preparators) and former smokers (actors/maintainers).

40|$|Even though {{physical}} inactivity {{is known to}} be detrimental for health, many adults remain inactive. Physical inactivity is particularly prevalent in deprived areas. It remains unclear to what extent physical activity is related to neighbourhood characteristics like neighbourhood safety. Moreover, there is scarce evidence on whether and how physical activity in deprived areas can be promoted by area-based initiatives that aim to improve the living conditions in deprived areas. The first objective of this thesis was to explore to what extent neighbourhood safety was associated with leisure-time physical activity among adults. The second objective of this thesis was to explore to what extent and how a Dutch area-based initiative called the District Approach was associated with changes in neighbourhood safety and leisure-time physical activity in 40 deprived target areas. This thesis provides evidence to suggest that safe neighbourhoods may promote leisure-time cycling and sports among adults. Good neighbourhood safety may also promote leisure-time walking, but only in deprived areas. In deprived areas, area-based initiatives like the Dutch District Approach appear to be able to promote leisure-time physical activity among adults. More specifically, they seem to promote leisure-time walking by making parks and trails less frightening, more convenient, and more relaxing.
