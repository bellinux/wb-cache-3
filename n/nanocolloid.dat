50|$|To {{perform a}} {{sentinel}} lymph node biopsy, the physician performs a lymphoscintigraphy, wherein a low-activity radioactive substance is injected near the tumor. The injected substance, filtered sulfur colloid, is tagged with the radionuclide technetium-99m. The injection protocols differ by doctor {{but the most}} common is a 500 μCi dose divided among 5 tuberculin syringes with 1/2 inch, 24 gauge needles. In the UK 20 megabecquerels of <b>nanocolloid</b> is recommended. The sulphur colloid is slightly acidic and causes minor stinging. A gentle massage of the injection sites spreads the sulphur colloid, relieving the pain and speeding up the lymph uptake. Scintigraphic imaging is usually started within 5 minutes of injection and the node appears from 5 min to 1 hour. This is usually done several hours before the actual biopsy. About 15 minutes before the biopsy the physician injects a blue dye in the same manner. Then, during the biopsy, the physician visually inspects the lymph nodes for staining and uses a gamma probe or a Geiger counter to assess which lymph nodes have taken up the radionuclide. One or several nodes may take up the dye and radioactive tracer, and these nodes are designated the sentinel lymph nodes. The surgeon then removes these lymph nodes and sends them to a pathologist for rapid examination under a microscope {{to look for the}} presence of cancer.|$|E

To study the former two points, we isolated a fraction of natural organic matter, which we refer to as organic <b>nanocolloids,</b> from a drinking water source using a dialysis membrane with a MWCO of 2000 g/mol. We measured the physico-chemical properties of these <b>nanocolloids</b> and four high-quality UF membranes and performed short-time filtration measurements. The organic <b>nanocolloids</b> had a relatively higher molecular mass compared to typical NOM and an effective diffusion coefficient of similar to 3. 20 x 10 (- 6) cm(2) /s. Under the same filtration conditions, the organic <b>nanocolloids</b> were shown to have different transport and theoretical surface interaction characteristics through regenerated cellulose (RC) than through polyethersulfone (PES) membranes. These differences made minimal difference in the filtration figures-of-merit - these were the observed total organic carbon (TOC) rejection and solution flux decline - when the two materials were in membranes with MWCO smaller than the <b>nanocolloids,</b> but not when the membranes' MWCO was on the same order as that of the <b>nanocolloids.</b> The RC had greater flux but rejected significantly less TOC and experienced more percentage flux decline over time. even though it theoretically would have less favorable interaction potentials with the organic <b>nanocolloids.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

For temperature tests in glycerol the clear evidence for the almost coupled exponent S equals 1 was obtained.

The biodistributions of the <b>nanocolloids</b> can be traced through NIR in vivo imaging in a non-invasive manner. In the present study the biodistributions of two types of PLGA <b>nanocolloids</b> were compared, nanocapsules with an oily core loaded with carbocyanine dyes and solid nanoparticles with the fluorescent dye covalently linked. The <b>nanocolloids</b> were produced by nanoprecipitation; all were of injectable sizes, showed monodispersity and negative zeta potentials. The biodistributions of DiD dye loaded nanocapsules with an oily core and solid nanoparticles conjugated to the dye DY- 700 were injected in mice, and followed over 24 hours through NIR imaging, before organs were collected and imaged. Bone marrow was also collected. Solid nanoparticles were also made with a polymer covalently linked to rhodamine. After 24 hours the organs were collected for further ex vivo analysis by confocal microscopy. The <b>nanocolloids</b> seemed to accumulate mainly in the liver, spleen and the intestine. The accumulation developed differently, and the PEGylated nanocarriers showed indications of longer circulation times, and lower accumulation in the liver. The oily core nanocapsules showed fluorescence accumulation in the bones, which was not seen with the solid nanocapsules. This was confirmed by quantification of fluorescence in collected bone marrow. This, together with accumulation in the intestine and fluorescence lifetime investigations suggested that DiD loaded nanocapsules release some dye. In line with this <b>nanocolloids</b> with the fluorescent dye covalently linked did not accumulate in the bone marrow, and to a small degree in the intestine.

Mineralogical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses.

The estimated average hydrodynamic diameter of nanoparticles was nearly twice the ideal 100 [*]nm range, apparently due to irregular particle shapes and partial aggregation. Nanoparticles were also found attached to surfaces of macrocolloids, forming macro-nano aggregates and obscuring some of their physical and chemical characteristics. However, <b>nanocolloids</b> exhibited greater surface reactivity, likely due to their smaller size, poor crystallinity, and morphological shape distortions.

Methods: Fourteen consecutive patients with 15 lesions underwent microbubble-enhanced SLN localization with placement of an I- 125 seed after the standard SLN localization (<b>nanocolloid).</b> We placed an I- 125 seed within or near the SLN following its identification using intradermally injected microbubbles. The SLN was excised guided by <b>nanocolloid</b> and the SLN containing the I- 125 seed was searched for. All technical modifications are described and standardized outcomes measured. Results: Twelve (80 %) microbubble procedures with I- 125 seed placements were technically successful. In three cases no microbubble-enhancing lymph node could be detected. Intraoperatively, we found nine I- 125 seeds within 0. 5 cm of the <b>nanocolloid</b> confirmed SLN. One I- 125 seed was found next to a non-SLN and two I- 125 seeds were not near any lymph node.

40|$|Dielectrophoretic <b>nanocolloid</b> assay is a {{promising}} technique for sensitive molecular detection and identification, as target molecule hybridization onto the probe-functionalized nanocolloids can change their surface conductance and consequently their dielectrophoretic crossover frequencies. Thus, instead {{of relying on}} surface charge density increase after hybridization, as in many capacitive and field effect transistor impedance sensing techniques, the current assay utilizes the much larger surface conductance (and dielectrophoresis crossover frequency) changes to effect sensitive detection. Herein, we present a Poisson–Boltzmann theory for surfaces with finite-size molecular probes that include the surface probe conformation, their contribution to surface charge with a proper delineation of the slip and Stern planes.

We evaluated the effect of an increase in particle concentration on preoperative and intraoperative sentinel node depiction. METHODS: Enrolled in the study were 50 consecutive patients with prostate cancer. The first 25 patients (group A) received <b>nanocolloid</b> with standard labelling (0. 4 ml (99 m) Tc per 0. 1 mg <b>nanocolloid).</b> The last 25 patients (group B) received <b>nanocolloid</b> with a reduced labelling dilution volume (0. 4 ml (99 m) Tc per 0. 2 mg <b>nanocolloid).</b> The aimed injected volume and dosage were the same for both groups (225 MBq in 0. 4 ml). Intratumoral tracer injection was followed by planar lymphoscintigraphy (15 min and 2 h), SPECT/CT and laparoscopic sentinel lymphadenectomy. Lymph node visualization was evaluated using a four-point scoring system (0 nonvisualization to 3 intense visualization) and count quantification on the 2 -h anterior lymphoscintigram. In addition to the gamma ray detection probe, a portable gamma camera was used for intraoperative sentinel node visualization. RESULTS: Preoperative visualization in group A was 88 % (mean 2. 0 sentinel nodes per patient) versus 100 % in group B (mean 2. 6 sentinel nodes per patient). Visualization scores (p= 0. 008), total counts (p= 0. 001) and maximum counts per pixel (p= 0. 034) in the sentinel nodes were significantly better in group B. This also led to more efficient intraoperative detection of the sentinel nodes with the portable gamma camera (84 % in group A versus 100 % in group B).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the cytotoxicity of commercial silver, gold, and copper nanocolloids towards two established cell lines (NIH/ 3 T 3 and GMK) and primary chick embryo cell culture (CECC), using routine colorimetric assays: MTT, NRU, and LDH, which enable a preliminary evaluation of the mechanism of cytotoxic effect of the tested substances. The MTT assay evaluates the activity of mitochondria, NRU assay reveals the damage to lysosomes, while LDH assay shows injuries to the cytoplasmic membrane. The NRU assay proved to be non-applicable to the tested nanocolloids, most probably due to the interaction of nanoparticles with neutral red dye, which affected the colorimetric reaction. The MTT assay was more sensitive than LDH because the intercellular effect of a substance occurs before permanent damage to the cytoplasmic membrane.

The results {{are discussed in the}} context of a hierarchical aquatic colloidal nanostructure, and the implications for contemporary studies of the role of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in sustaining the transport of colloidal iron in upland catchments...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{universal}} labyrinthine patterns observed in <b>nanocolloids</b> originated from electric-field-induced phase separation. For <b>nanocolloids</b> consisting of magnetic particles (magnetic fluids), the labyrinthine pattern {{as the result}} of the co-existence of two phases is found to be stable against perturbation by an additional magnetic field. The relaxation back to the globally disordered pattern after the magnetic field is removed clearly shows evolution of "undulation" thus demonstrates that superimposing magnetic and electric fields can easily manipulate the patterns resulted from the phase separation, indicating that a magnetic fluid has an advantage in exploring the dynamics of defects that has applications in many fields.

40|$|The {{hydrogenation}} of the alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes cinnamaldehyde (trans- 3 -phenyl- 2 -propenal), citral (3, 7 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadienal) {{and leaf}} aldehyde (trans- 2 -hexenal) was investigated with metal colloids as quasi homogeneous catalysts in organic solvents. Using polyvinylpyrrolidone-stabilized Ag- 0 and Co- 0 nanoclusters, the carbonyl compounds were chemoselectively hydrogenated {{to the desired}} allylic alcohol fragrances. Particularly the Ag- 0 nanosols emerged as a worthwhile alternative for Pt or Ru based catalysts. Amides proved to be excellent solvents for the synthesis {{as well as for}} the application of the metal <b>nanocolloids</b> in the hydrogenation of alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes. In the challenging hydrogenation of citral, a selectivity exceeding 70 % towards the doubly unsaturated alcohol isomers (geraniol and nerol) was attained at 90 % conversion using Ag- 0 <b>nanocolloids</b> dispersed in N,N-dimethylacetamide. Reactions were performed under mild conditions (2. 0 MPa H- 2, 323 K) at a molar citral/silver ratio of 200 / 1. The addition of Lewis acid cations, such as Fe 3 + or Zn 2 + resulted in a further improvement of the catalytic activity and chemoselectivity. Finally, by application of membrane filtrations, an efficient separation of the metallic <b>nanocolloids</b> from the reaction mixtures was realized. In the recycling of the metal nanosols, the metal catalysts' nanodispersion and performance were satisfactorily preserve...|$|R
