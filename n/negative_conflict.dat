40|$|Guided by the {{emotional}} security hypothesis and the cognitive-contextual framework, {{the present study}} investigated whether the associations between <b>negative</b> parental <b>conflict</b> resolution styles and children’s internalizing and externalizing problems were mediated by children’s appraisals of threat and self-blame and their emotion regulation. Participants were 192 Swiss two-parent families with children aged 9 to 12 years (M = 10. 62, SD = 0. 41). Structural equation modeling was used to test the empirical validity of the theoretical model. Results indicated that children’s maladaptive emotion regulation mediated the association between <b>negative</b> parental <b>conflict</b> resolution styles and children’s internalizing as well as externalizing problems. Whereas perceived threat was related only to children’s internalizing problems, self-blame did not mediate the links between <b>negative</b> parental <b>conflict</b> resolution styles and children’s adjustment.

Although the impact of parenting, specifically coercive parenting, {{and the influence of}} deviant peers are well-documented risk factors for child maladaptive behavior, less understood is how parents' satisfaction in their couple relationship influences family functioning and child outcomes. This study examined <b>negative</b> family <b>conflict</b> as an underlying mediating variable in the association between couple satisfaction and adolescents' future outcomes in a sample of 241 couples and their adolescent children (127 males and 114 females). Adolescents were an average age of 16 to 17 at the initial time point and they participated in follow-up one year later. Structural equation modeling on longitudinal data showed that the model fit the data well and that higher couple satisfaction was related to better future outcomes (defined as lower levels of future antisocial behavior). Higher couple satisfaction was also associated with lower levels of <b>negative</b> family <b>conflict</b> which predicted lower levels of adolescent future antisocial behavior (ASB). For all adolescents, findings also demonstrated that <b>negative</b> family <b>conflict</b> completely mediated the relationship between couple relationship satisfaction and adolescents' future ASB. Sex differences were found in these relationships when males and females were examined separately, especially related to couple dissatisfaction, which was directly predictive of male future ASB but not female future ASB. This study supports existing research demonstrating that adolescents in families with poor couple satisfaction are {{more likely to engage in}} ASB than those whose parents reported higher levels of couple satisfaction. Furthermore, these findings highlight the mediating role of <b>negative</b> family <b>conflict</b> in the association between couple satisfaction and adolescents' future ASB.

Conflict management behavior is studied through observed behavior and categorized by experts. Two conflict management behavior categories are differentiated: positive and <b>negative</b> <b>conflict</b> manage-ment behavior. A laboratory experiment was carried out comparing 12 groups of 4 members each, working over two communication media (6 groups FTF and 6 groups over CMC). Groups performed three types of tasks (idea-generation tasks, intellective tasks, and mixed-motive tasks) during weekly sessions over a 2 -month period. Results obtained for the idea-generation task show that <b>negative</b> <b>conflict</b> management is significantly higher in CMC than in FTF. For the groups working on intellective tasks, positive conflict management is signifi-cantly higher in FTF than in CMC. Conversely, <b>negative</b> <b>conflict</b> management is signifi-cantly higher in CMC than in FTF. No significant differences appear in positive or in nega-tive conflict management on the mixed-motive task. The effect of time on conflict management behaviors in both communication media, and for intellective tasks, does not follow the hypothesized direction.

However, there is an inadequate understanding of where attribution bias comes from, and who is {{more likely to engage in}} attribution bias. This study proposes projection, a psychological defense mechanism, as a viable explanation and predictor of attribution bias. Projection is a cognitive distortion that results in negative evaluations of others and high levels of negative emotional arousal, and may lead people to act destructively in conflicts. Five hundred and nine undergraduate students (n = 509) responded to a survey questionnaire. Results found support for the study???s hypothesis. Projection was positively related to attribution bias, negative emotions, and unskillful conflict strategies. In addition, of the four hypothesized variables used to predict attribution bias, projection emerged as the strongest predictor.

40|$|Conflict in marital {{relationships}} affects couple {{intimacy and}} satisfaction impacting on the couple system, the family system and wider social systems. <b>Negative</b> <b>conflict</b> {{is associated with}} breakdown in intimacy, marital dissatisfaction, and is seen to be a prominent cause of marital failure. As conflict is a process, it has the possibility of change and development over time, including moving towards a process whereby disagreements can be worked out with mutually acceptable solutions. Theoretical frameworks for conflict and marital counselling were reviewed and the systems-interactionist theory and a systemic-based counselling approach chosen {{for the purposes of}} this study. It was hypothesised that a systemic-based counselling approach would lower the levels of conflict occurring within a marital relationship. The principal objective of this study was to provide a more rigorous investigation than previous studies of client perceptions of the effectiveness of a systems-based counselling approach for marital counselling. Three case studies were conducted, with embedded units of analysis, within the context of a therapeutic process which drew on current theories of systemic counselling. Conflict was measured and operationalised as overt behavioural conflict, communication of negative affect, frequency of disagreements, intensity of disagreements, desire to change the other partner, the desire for change, and evidence of, and frequency of, positive conflict. As the study was based on the client's perceptions of change, multi-methods of selfreports were employed. As none of the known measurements met the needs of this study, a questionnaire known as the QCR was devised specifically for the pre- and posttests. The QCR was designed to measure: any increase or decrease in positive conflict; changes to both the intensity and frequency in negative conflict; and perceptions of the desire for change. The effectiveness of the counselling approach was measured by comparing the results of the pre-and post-tests with the continual self-reports and the self-reports at the long term follow-up interviews. An analysis of the self-reports focus on: the desire for change; the effectiveness of a systems based counselling approach in lowering negative conflict; and the usefulness of the QCR and other tools as measures. The systems-based-counselling approach, proved from the clients' perspective, to be: highly effective in case one; mostly effective in case two; and ineffective in case three as one partner aborted the counselling process. The systems-based-counselling approach had variable success in decreasing the intensity of <b>negative</b> <b>conflict</b> but was mostly successful in decreasing the frequency of <b>negative</b> <b>conflict.</b> This approach was not largely successful in reporting an increase in the frequency of positive conflict. The study revealed evidence of a relationship between commitment to the marital relationship and <b>negative</b> <b>conflict.</b> It also adds to the debate about the appropriateness of a systems-based counselling approach in violent relationships. In judging the clients' perceptions of the effectiveness of the systems-based counselling approach multi-measurements employed including the lengthy recording of the therapeutic sessions.

However, previous research has rarely examined the extent to which child symptomatology and family environment are associated with social skills and adaptability in children. Furthermore, no studies have looked at these associations longitudinally in preschool children with behavior problems, for whom social functioning may be especially important. The current study examined the relationship of five predictors (child oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), child attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), marital conflict strategies, parental depression, and parental warmth) with social skills and adaptability measured in preschoolers with behavior problems at age 3. The relationship was assessed concurrently, as it changed over time (controlling for initial starting point), and at age 6. One hundred sixty three children, mainly of European American and Puerto-Rican descent, were included. At age 3, ADHD, ODD, and maternal depression were associated with fewer social skills and lower adaptability. Paternal warmth and maternal positive conflict strategies were associated with higher social skills. Greater paternal positive conflict strategies were associated with greater improvement in social skills and adaptability from age 3 to 6. Paternal depression and paternal <b>negative</b> <b>conflict</b> strategies were associated with less improvement in adaptability. Paternal warmth was associated with greater improvement in social skills. At age 6, greater paternal positive conflict strategies were associated with higher social skills and adaptability.

This study set out to test Gottman 2 ̆ 7 s concepts of EC and emotion dismissing (ED) and their relationships with marital satisfaction and marital conflict. In addition, this study explored the relationships between marital conflict and marital satisfaction.

However, the ability {{to determine the}}se relationships is not always as clear. According to Weary and Edwards (1996) causal uncertainty (CU) {{is the result of}} an individual perceiving themselves as someone who {{may not be able to}} accurately determine the cause and effect nature of events. Research conducted by Boucher and Jacobson (2012) found that individuals with greater CU viewed their interactions with a stranger more negatively than those with low CU. The purpose of the present work was to determine if the negative perceptions also occurred in more established intimate relationships. To determine the impact of CU on intimate relationships 51 romantic dyads and 46 friendship dyads were brought into the laboratory. Participants were first separated from their partner and asked to fill out a battery of questionnaires. Individuals were then asked to perform a video-recorded problem solving task with their partner. Results demonstrated that CU was associated with more <b>negative</b> <b>conflict</b> coping strategies. Additionally, these <b>negative</b> <b>conflict</b> coping strategies mediated the relationship between CU and romantic relationship satisfaction. However, similar mediation models were not statistically significant for friendship dyads, which suggests that the impact of CU on romantic conflict situations may be more impactful.

The DMP proposes the existence of two types of passion: harmonious and obsessive, which can be differentiated {{in terms of how}} the representation of the passionate activity has been internalized into one's identity. Harmonious passion originates from an autonomous internalization of the activity into one's identity and promotes a mindful and open form of activity engagement. Such engagement is hypothesized to lead to repeated positive affective experiences in the activity that spills over in one's life in general that, in turn, facilitates sustainable psychological well-being while preventing the experience of <b>negative</b> affect, psychological <b>conflict,</b> and ill-being. Conversely, obsessive passion emanates from a controlled internalization and is hypothesized to minimize the experience of positive affect and psychological well-being and to even facilitate <b>negative</b> affect, <b>conflict</b> with other life activities, and psychological ill-being.
