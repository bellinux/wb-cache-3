5|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the {{apparent}} differences between morphological and molecularly defined trees, a combined analysis was undertaken which confirmed superorder Liliiflorae as monophyletic, provided that a few modifications were undertaken. These included the removal of two tribes of Melanthiaceae (Melanthiales) and the inclusion of three additional families (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae and Velloziaceae) from other superorders. This newly and more narrowly redefined Lilianae/Liliiflorae contained three orders, Aparagales, Liliales and Dioscoreales (which now included the stemonoids). This analysis also allowed {{for the establishment of}} a single synapomorphy, although this time by the presence of an inferior ovary. Significantly, the authors noted that it was <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>the</b> authors of angiosperm classifications had been exasperated by the Lilianae.|$|E
25|$|The Western U.S. is {{the largest}} region of the country, {{covering}} {{more than half the}} land area of the United States. It is also the most geographically diverse, incorporating geographic regions such as the temperate rainforests of the Northwest, the highest mountain ranges (including the Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada, the Great Plains, and all of the desert areas located in the United States (the Mojave, Sonoran, Great Basin, and Chihuahua deserts). Given this expansive and diverse geography it is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>the</b> region is difficult to specifically define. Sensing a possible shift in the popular understanding of the West as a region in the early 1990s, historian Walter Nugent conducted a survey of three groups of professionals with ties to the region: a large group of Western historians (187 respondents), and two smaller groups, 25 journalists and publishers and 39 Western authors. A majority of the historian respondents placed the eastern boundary of the West east of the Census definition out on {{the eastern edge of the}} Great Plains or on the Mississippi River. The survey respondents as a whole showed just how little agreement there was on the boundaries of the West.|$|E
500|$|... "Let It Down" [...] was {{released}} on All Things Must Pass in November 1970, sequenced between the two minimalist, Band-influenced tracks [...] "Behind That Locked Door" [...] and [...] "Run of the Mill". Writing in 1977 of the acclaim afforded the album on release, author Nicholas Schaffner described All Things Must Pass as the [...] "crowning glory" [...] of Harrison and Spector's respective careers, and concluded: [...] "Spector was at last working with a talent comparable with his own. The producer's cosmic sound proved a perfect complement to the artist's cosmic vision." [...] Author Robert Rodriguez groups [...] "Let It Down" [...] with other Beatles-era compositions such as [...] "All Things Must Pass", [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] and [...] "Wah-Wah", as the [...] "essential components" [...] of an album that was [...] "revelatory, helping the public understand that, with a talent this big alongside two acknowledged geniuses , <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>the</b> group could not remain intact". In his album review for the NME, Alan Smith noted [...] "Let It Down"'s [...] "big fuzzy" [...] introduction against its verses' [...] "quiet acid float" [...] and admired the [...] "romantic delicacy and perception" [...] of Harrison's lyrics. [...] "No matter {{the quality of the}} music," [...] Smith added, [...] "his words never let him down." ...|$|E

500|$|However, Daniel House, {{who owned}} C/Z Records, disputed these {{perceptions}} in 1994. House stated {{that there was}} [...] "...no more (heroin) here [...] than anyplace else"; he stated that the [...] "heroin {{is not a big}} part of the [...] culture", and that [...] "marijuana and alcohol...are far more prevalent". Jeff Gilbert, one of the editors of Guitar World magazine, stated in 1994 that the media association of the Seattle grunge scene with heroin was [...] "really overblown"; instead, he says that Seattle musicians were [...] "...all a bunch of potheads." [...] Gil Troy's history of America in the 1990s states that in the Seattle grunge scene, the [...] "...drug of choice switched from upscale cocaine [...] to blue-collar marijuana." [...] Rolling Stone magazine reported that members of Seattle's grunge scene were [...] "coffee-crazed" [...] by day on espresso and [...] "...by night, they quaff oceans of beer – jolted by Java and looped with liquor, <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>the</b> [...] music sounds like it does." [...] "Some [...] scene veterans maintain that MDA", a drug related to Ecstasy, [...] "was a vital contributor to grunge", because it gave users a [...] "body high" [...] (in contrast to marijuana's [...] "head high") that made them appreciate [...] "bass-heavy grooves". Pat Long's [...] History of the NME states that scene members involved with the Sub Pop label would have multi-day MDMA parties in the woods, which shows that what Long calls Ecstasy's [...] "warm glow" [...] had an impact even in the wet, grey and isolated Pacific Northwest region.|$|E
500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said that Smile leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them... {{but a lot of people}} just don't like it." [...] Carl Wilson reflected on the period: [...] "To get that album [...] out, someone would have needed willingness and perseverance to corral all of us. Everybody was so loaded on pot and hash all of the time that it's <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>the</b> project didn't get done." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most famously, {{the train}} was {{depicted}} in Natsume Sōseki's 1906 novel, Botchan: [...] "I found the train station soon enough and bought myself a ticket.
