Torres had a four-year relationship with Filipino actor Aga Muhlach, now married to Charlene Gonzalez, a Miss Universe 1994 top six finalist. Torres and Muhlach first met {{on the set of}} her first Philippine movie, Basta't Kasama Kita (As Long As I'm With You). In 1995, she also did the dance movie Hataw <b>Na!</b> (<b>Start</b> Dancing!) with fellow Puerto Rican and Filipino O.P.M artist Gary Valenciano. In 1998, she starred with Action Star/Game show host Cesar Montano In a comedy/action film Type Kita Walang Kokontra! (You are My Type, Nobody Can Meddle!). Torres also became part of the musical variety show ASAP when it first aired in 1994 as a host for 5 years and as she came in and out of town in 1997-1998. In 2007, she visited the Philippines but could not perform due to schedule conflicts.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) solar cells with {{different}} sodiumdoping of the CIGS absorber and varying Al 2 O 3 rear surface passivationlayer thickness have been manufactured and electrically characterised. Baseline samples and samples without passivation were used asreferences for the passivated samples. For the passivated samplesbetween 1 and 7 nm of Al 2 O 3 were deposited by ALD. The electricalcharacterisation included current-voltage (IV, JV), quantum efficiency (QE, EQE), capacitance-voltage (CV) and temperature dependent currentvoltage (IVT, JVT) measurements. The {{results show that}} it is indeed possible to use a tunnel current toconstruct an electrical contact, but that the electrical contact isvery sensitive to sodium doping. The samples with post-depositiontreatment and without <b>Na</b> <b>start</b> to block the tunnel current when thepassivation layer reaches a thickness of about 2 nm, while no blocking of the tunnel current could be observed for the samples with Na pre-deposition. The samples with pre-deposition treatment showed acontinued increase in efficiency {{all the way to}} a passivation layerthickness of about 7 nm. When trying to construct samples with eventhicker passivation layer the CIGS started to peel off. For thisreason the optimal thickness for the pre-deposition treated samplescould not be found. The samples with the highest efficiency was thesamples with pre-deposition treatment and thick passivation layer. Those samples showed an increase of 3 percent (absolute) compared tothe unpassivated sample with the same deposition treatment and 1. 6 percent higher efficiency compared to the baseline sample. Concluding that tunnelling passivation layer is comparable to the passivationlayer with point contact methods...|$|E

40|$|The effects {{induced by}} Na {{deposited}} on furnace grown graphene on SiC(0001) and after subsequent annealing are investigated using LEEM, mu-LEED, mu-PES and XPEEM. Intercalation in between carbon layers {{and at the}} interface is observed to occur both on the 1 ML and 2 ML areas directly after Na deposition. Annealing at a temperature around 100 degrees C is found to strongly promote Na intercalation. Exposure to the electron beam or the focused synchrotron radiation in the LEEM/XPEEM is also found to promote the intercalation, which is confirmed to begin at domain boundaries between the 1 ML and 2 ML areas, and also as stripe/streak-like features on the 1 ML areas. The XPEEM data show Na adsorption {{on the surface and}} intercalation at the interface to be quite non-uniform.

5000|$|Revivalist artists or {{bands are}} {{performers}} who {{are inspired by}} an entire genre of music and dedicate themselves to curating and recreating the genre and introducing it to younger audiences who have not experienced that music first hand. Unlike tribute bands and cover bands who rely primarily on audiences seeking a nostalgic experience, revivalist bands usually seek new young audiences for whom the music is fresh and has no nostalgic value. For example, Sha <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>started</b> in 1969 as {{a celebration of the}} doo-wop music of the 1950s, a genre of music that was not initially fashionable during the hippie counter-culture era. The Blues Brothers started in 1978 as a living salute to the blues, soul and R&B music of the 1950s and 1960s that was not in vogue by the late 1970s. The Blues Brothers' creed was that they were [...] "on a mission from God" [...] as evangelists for blues and soul music.

40|$|AbstractGovernment {{accounting}} (GA) and National accounts (NA) are two {{reporting systems}} that, although aiming different purposes, are linked – public administrations’ financial {{information for the}} latter {{is provided by the}} former. Therefore, the alignment between the two systems is an issue for the reliability of the public sector aggregates finally obtained by the National Accounts. In the EU context, this is a critical issue, inasmuch as these aggregates are the reference for monitoring the fiscal policy underlying the Euro currency. However, while reporting in NA is accrual-based and harmonised under the European System of Regional and National Accounts, the GA each country still has its own reporting system, often mixing cash basis in budgetary reporting with accrual basis in financial reporting, hence requiring accounting basis adjustments when translating data from GA into <b>NA.</b> <b>Starting</b> by conceptually analysing the accounting basis differences between GA and NA and the adjustments to be made when translating data from the former into the latter, this paper uses evidence from three southern European countries – Portugal, Spain and Italy, representing the southern Continental European accounting perspective, with cash-based budgetary reporting, and where budgetary deficits have been particularly significant in the latest years – to show how diversity and materiality of these adjustments may question the reliability of the budgetary deficits finally reported in NA. The main findings point to the need for standardised procedures to convert cash-based (GA) into accrual-based (NA) data as a crucial step, preventing accounting manipulation, thus increasing reliability of informative outputs for both micro and macro purposes...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine in preterm infants al risk for severe chronic lung disease (1) the quality of general movements (GMs) and (2) the effect of dexamethasone treatment on spontaneous motor activity. Study design: In 15 very low birth weight infants the quality of GMs was assessed Gum repeated videotape recordings. Recordings were made at weekly intervals during the preterm period until term age and thereafter three times until the twentieth postterm week. All infants required devamethasone therapy and additional recordings were made a few hours before and 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days after dexamethasone was started. The relationship among movement quality, brain ultrasonographic abnormalities, and long-term outcome was explored. Acute effects of dexamethasone on motor activity were examined. Results: After dexamethasone therapy <b>nas</b> <b>started,</b> a significant transient reduction of the quantity of most spontaneous movements (p < 0, 05) and a reduction of speed and amplitude of GMs was found (p < 0. 05). A significant relationship was found between the severity of brain ultrasonographic abnormalities and the extent to which developmental trajectories of GMs were abnormal (p < 0. 001). The development of cerebral palsy was related to the presence of cramped-synchronized movements near term (p < 0. 02) and to the absence of fidgety movements at the age of 3 months after term (p < 0. 05), Conclusion: In preterm infants with severe chronic lung disease and brain lesions, dexamethasone treatment leads to an acute reduction in motility and changes in the speed and amplitude of GMs. Until more is known, about long-term neurologic sequelae, a cautious use of systemic dexamethasone therapy in preterm infants is recommended...|$|R
