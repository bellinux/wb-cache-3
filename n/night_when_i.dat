500|$|At age 30 (the {{minimum age}} {{required}} {{to hold the}} office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history, and one of only 18 senators who took office before reaching the age of 31. But the accident left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: [...] "I liked to [...] at <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{thought there was a}} better chance of finding a fight ... I had not known I was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me." [...] To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 1½ hours each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career. [...] In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work, and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last. [...] A single father for five years, he left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called. [...] In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident.|$|E
500|$|They were on {{the road}} again three days later when they faced Ipswich Town at Portman Road. Argyle came away with all three points {{courtesy}} of goals from Wright-Phillips and Mason on what was a special night for Paul Mariner. [...] "It was pretty special and I was a little choked up," [...] he said. [...] "It was a special <b>night.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> moved to the States 20 years ago, I didn't think it would come to fruition but it was a tremendous reception from the fans, and I can't thank them enough. Bringing Plymouth Argyle here in my present role was a special occasion." [...] Former manager Ian Holloway returned to Home Park {{for the first time since}} his departure in November 2007 in the club's next game, and he left happy as Blackpool side claimed all three points after a 2–0 victory, with Charlie Adam at the heart of their attacking threat. Argyle played out an entertaining 0–0 draw at home with Barnsley three days later, but it did little to help in their battle against relegation, still five points away from safety. They produced another rousing away performance against Doncaster Rovers to earn a 2–1 win, coming from behind with second-half goals from Mason, and an injury time header from Wright-Phillips. In order to stay up, Argyle knew that they had to make the most of their remaining home games, but they went down 2–0 on 5 April to an efficient Middlesbrough side, which left them four points adrift with four games left. A solitary goal from Watford's Heidar Helguson dealt Argyle's survival hopes an almost fatal blow at Vicarage Road, but vice-captain Karl Duguid remained upbeat about their chances of defeating the league leaders in their next game. [...] "We'll be upbeat, and we'll go for the win against Newcastle next Monday." ...|$|E
2500|$|The brazen {{quality of}} Turner's screen roles was {{reflected}} in her public life. With her deep voice, Turner was often compared to a young Lauren Bacall. When the two met, Turner reportedly introduced herself by saying, [...] "Hi, I'm the young you."

2500|$|In 1988, DeVille {{relocated}} from New York to New Orleans, {{where he}} found a spiritual home. [...] "I was stunned", {{he said in a}} 1993 interview. [...] "I had the feeling that I was going back home. It was very strange... I live in the French Quarter, two streets away from Bourbon Street; at <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> go to bed, I hear the boogie that comes from the streets, and in the morning, when I wake up, I hear the blues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally titled [...] "State of Matrimony", {{the song}} Till Death Do Us Part" [...] {{talks about the}} violent {{dissolution}} of Madonna's marriage. It was described as [...] "an anxious jumpy ballad that describes a marriage wracked with drinking, violent quarrels and a possessive, self-hating husband". The next song, [...] "Promise to Try" [...] talks {{about the death of}} Madonna's mother. In one part of the song, she specifically asks [...] "Does she hear my voice in the <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> call?". Later, an adult seems to admonish a child with the lines, [...] "Little girl, don't you forget her face/Don't let memory play games with your mind/She's a faded smile frozen in time".|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, Warner Bros. {{chose to}} produce, seeing {{similarities}} in the concept with Batman Begins. Arthur Conan Doyle's estate had some involvement in sorting out legal issues, although the stories are {{in the public domain}} in the United States. Neil Marshall was set to direct, but Guy Ritchie signed on to direct in June 2008. When a child at boarding school, Ritchie and other pupils listened to the Holmes stories through dormitory loudspeakers. [...] "Holmes used to talk me to sleep every <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was seven years old," [...] he said. Therefore, his image of Holmes differed from the films. He wanted to make his film more [...] "authentic" [...] to Doyle, explaining, [...] "There's quite a lot of intense action sequences in the stories, [...] sometimes that hasn't been reflected in the movies." [...] Holmes' [...] "brilliance will [...] into the action", and the film will show that his [...] "intellect was as much of a curse as it was a blessing". Ritchie sought to make Sherlock Holmes a [...] "very contemporary film as far as the tone and texture", because it has been [...] "a relatively long time since there's been a film version that people embraced".|$|E

2500|$|Although not {{initially}} receiving public and commercial praise until {{years after its}} release, the album is widely revered by critics, musicians, audiences. Serving as an inspiration for other artists, Afrodisiac has been credited {{as one of a}} precursors to the PBR subgenre. In a 2014 music and fashion conversation with NPR, singer and model Solange discussed the album, saying [...] "Brandy is really the foundation of a lot of this very innovative, progressive, experimental R Brandy really influenced a lot of that. Frank Ocean will say it. Miguel will say it." [...] Barbadian singer Rihanna revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that her 2007 multi-platinum album, Good Girl Gone Bad, was primarily influenced by Afrodisiac. In the interview she stated, [...] "Brandy's album really helped to inspire, because that album I listen to all day, all <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was in the studio [...] I really admired that every song was a great song." [...] Rock musician John Frusciante, viruoso guitarist of the popular rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, mentioned that Norwood and the album were the “main inspiration” behind the guitar work on the Red Hot Chili Pepper’s 2006 Grammy winning album, Stadium Arcadium. In 2008, singer Beyoncé Knowles chose the album cut [...] "Focus" [...] for her personal music playlist on iTunes, citing her love of the lyrics, and Brandy's voice and vocal arrangements. Hip-Hop producer Hit-Boy has often lauded the album as an influence on his work via his social media outlets.
