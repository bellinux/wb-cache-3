50|$|In {{order to}} avoid double taxation, <b>non-taxation</b> or the {{distortion}} of competition, an EU member state may, in accordance with Article 9(3)(a) of Council Directive 77/388 ("the Sixth VAT Directive"), include {{within the scope of}} its national VAT any telecommunications services used within its territory but billed outside the EU VAT area. When opting to do so, it must also exempt from its national VAT any roaming services supplied by home networks within its territory but used outside the EU VAT area. The inclusion of telecommunications within the scope of Article 9 was requested by the United Kingdom, which subsequently enacted the change under Article 19 of the Value Added Tax (Place of Supply of Services) Order 1992. Consequently, when an EU member state makes this VAT exemption, roaming on networks in the Åland Islands, Gibraltar, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, the Canary Islands, Ceuta, Melilla and French overseas departments is subject to the price caps with no VAT applied, because these countries and territories are within the EEA but outside the EU VAT area.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the possibility}} of double <b>non-taxation</b> of hybrid instruments in cross border transactions where the country of the investor has implemented the indirect credit method for mitigation or elimination of double taxation. From an isolated perspective a double <b>non-taxation</b> cannot be obtained because typically no taxes are paid in the foreign country due to the classification as debt and therefore even {{in the case of}} a classification as a dividend in the country of the investor no indirect credit can be given to the taxpayer. Using this as a starting point this paper investigates the impact of asymmetric tax treatment of hybrid instruments on the indirect credit method and the potentials for minimizing the tax burden or even {{the possibility of}} obtaining a double <b>non-taxation.</b> On this basis the paper develops a formula that identifies the optimal investment strategy based on given tax rates. Special interest is given to the limitations and possible barriers to hybrid transactions.

The BEPS Action Plan, adopted by the OECD in July 2013, sets an ambitious time table for the various items, which are supposed to be achieved either by September 2014 or at the latest by December 2015.

40|$|A {{tax holiday}} is a time-limited {{exemption}} from taxation {{and one of the}} most commonly employed tax incentives in developing countries. The main objective behind tax holidays is to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), as this is believed to stimulate economic growth and development. An {{exemption from taxation}} under a tax holiday could encourage investors to invest in developing countries. However, this requires the benefit under the tax holiday to actually accrue to the investor and not be consumed by taxation in the investor’s residence country. The subject of this article is the interrelation between tax holidays offered by developing countries and rules in industrialized countries for the taxation of income earned by controlled foreign companies (CFCs). Most countries recognize each company as a separate legal entity (distinct from its shareholders) and as a separate taxpayer. Hence, profits derived by a non-resident company would usually not be taxed to its resident shareholders until profits are remitted as dividends or shares are realized at a gain. This is often described as ‘deferral of domestic tax’, and involves a saving in terms of postponed taxation. If the parent company is resident in a country that does not tax dividends or share gains resulting from foreign subsidiaries (e. g., under participation exemption rules or tax sparing credit) the investors would receive the full benefit of the tax holiday. This would lead to double <b>non-taxation</b> of the tax holiday income.

40|$|More {{than three-quarters}} of the United States ' {{tangible}} capital stock represents structures. Despite their relatively low rates of depreciation, structures {{account for more than}} half of all gross fixed investment in most years. Tax policies potentially have a major impact on both the level and composition of investment in structures. This point is ex-plicitly recognized in most discussions of the effects of capital income taxation. Two aspects of the taxation of structures—the relative burden placed on structures as opposed to equipment investment and the <b>non-taxation</b> of owner-occupied housing under the income tax—have at-tracted substantial attention in recent years. This paper explores these two aspects of the taxation of structure investments. The Treasury (1984), in its recent tax reform proposal, pointed to the extra tax burdens placed on structures relative to equipment as a major defect of the current accelerated cost recovery system. The 1985 Economic Report of the President echoes this sentiment, concluding that, "The effective tax rate [...] . is lower for equipment than for struc-tures.

40|$|The current {{tax treaty}} network was {{developed}} in the 1920 s and 1930 s in order to prevent double residence/source taxation. This kind of double taxation rarely exists any more because most countries have adopted either an exemption system or a foreign tax credit regime in their domestic (non‐treaty) law, which effectively prevents residence/source double taxation {{even in the absence of}} a treaty. Instead, as Tsilly Dagan has pointed out, the current treaties serve mostly to transfer revenue from the source country to the residence country. This suggests that treaties may be unnecessary because exemption from withholding taxes by source countries can be done unilaterally. However, in the era of globalization (post 1980), the treaties have developed two new functions, both of which apply primarily to individual taxpayers: First, to prevent double <b>non‐taxation</b> by ensuring that withholding taxes are collected if there is no assurance of taxation by the residence country. Second, to enforce residence based taxation of individuals by having source countries provide information to residence countries about income derived by their residents in the source country.

40|$|Many {{economists and}} legal {{scholars}} {{claim that the}} traditional conceptual and policy framework for international taxation is defunct. The examples they offer most often to support such claims are failures of residence- or source-based taxation to achieve a variety of normative objectives. This article {{suggests that there is}} a very different way of seeing why international taxation has become intellectually controversial. The key problem is not that the globalization of economic activities makes the traditional policy tools outdated; instead, it is that scholars and policymakers have more frequent occasions to disagree about the normative goals of international taxation. Thus most current controversies are actually about the articulation of ends and not the adequacy of means. To illustrate this perspective, this article offers a minimalist account of the meanings of the concepts of source and residence. The account, I argue, successfully deflects most skeptical arguments about residence and source, and shows that the purported inadequacy of the two concepts are consequences, not causes, of inadequate normative criteria for the design of international income taxation.

The Difference‑in‑Differences Method was carried out to predict the taxpayers’ behavior. The model shows that the agreements work well as a preventive tool.

40|$|In {{intra-group}} finance {{hybrid instruments}} allow for tailor-made form of finance. Hence hybrid finance {{is often used}} for international tax planning in multinational groups. Due {{to a lack of}} international tax harmonization or tax coordination qualification conflict can arise. A specific hybrid instrument is classified as debt in one country, and as equity in the other country. This may lead to double taxation. In the reverse case, double <b>non-taxation</b> can arise. Against this legal background one might expect that cross-border hybrid intra-group finance is advantageous in comparison to classical debt finance in case of double-non-taxation while it can be expected to be disadvantageous in the case of double taxation of the yield. Previous studies do not include qualification conflicts. Thus the question arises how qualification conflicts are affecting an intra-group finance decision. We examine effects of such qualification conflicts, resulting from the use of cross-border, intra-group hybrid finance, on the tax-advantageousness as compared to classical debt finance. The analysis is based on a binomial simulation model including economic and legal uncertainty. We show that the results of our analysis under uncertainty vary significantly when compared to the more obvious results under economic and legal certainty.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} any housing policy which {{attempts}} to redistribute expenditure on housing by {{working within the}} confines of the public sector must be extremely limited and is unlikely to be effective. It examines both the potential for and distributional implications of providing additional resources for expenditure on housing in Australia by going beyond the existing framework of government expenditure and withdrawing the implicit subsidies which accrue to owner-occupiers through the <b>non-taxation</b> of their imputed income. It is shown that the distributional implications of taxing imputed income from owner-occupied housing depend on the interaction of house value, equity and income over the life-cycle of the owner-occupier and that a failure to take all of these factors into account could result in a policy of imputed income taxation having unintended distributional effects within the owner-occupied sector. However, since the survey data analysed shows that the subsidy to owner-occupiers which resulted from not taxing this income outweighted explicit public authority expenditure on housing at the time of the survey by a margin of more than 500 %, it is argued that the revenue gained from the introduction of such a policy would be more than adequate to offset these effects and to ensure that housing resources were redistributed in an equitable manner. ...|$|E
