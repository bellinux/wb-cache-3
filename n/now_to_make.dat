500|$|It {{was assumed}} in the Times article, and by other commentators, that if Hailsham (or Home) was a {{candidate}} {{he would have}} to renounce his peerage. This had been made possible for the first time by recent legislation. The last British Prime Minister to sit in the House of Lords was The 3rd Marquess of Salisbury in 1902. By 1923, having to choose between Baldwin and Lord Curzon, George V decided that [...] "the requirements of the present times" [...] obliged him to appoint a Prime Minister from the Commons. His private secretary recorded that the King [...] "believed he would not be fulfilling his trust were he <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his selection of Prime Minister from the House of Lords". Similarly, after the resignation of Neville Chamberlain in 1940 there were two likely successors, Churchill and Halifax, but the latter ruled himself out for the premiership on the grounds that his membership of the House of Lords disqualified him. In 1963, therefore, it was well established that the Prime Minister should {{be a member of the}} House of Commons. On 10 October Hailsham announced his intention to renounce his viscountcy.|$|E
