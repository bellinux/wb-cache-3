500|$|The Ring production, filmed for {{television}} in 1980, initially provoked controversy, but was celebrated after its final performance in 1980 with a 45-minute standing ovation. Chéreau disliked grand opera, but said: [...] "After Bayreuth, I felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> a theatrical project of some breadth... I have never put on little things.

Biffle argued that he, Burton, or Stewart were [...] "capable of winning it". Johnson, who already had eighteen previous wins in the Chase, observed that [...] "those 10 races in the Chase is its own world. The people act and react differently under pressure, {{and for the last}} four years we have done a great job in that environment." [...] Hamlin commented, [...] "Reliability is the only thing we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on.</b> It's taken us out of the last three Chases, not being reliable. You have to have it to be the champion." [...] Ray Evernham also opined on Hamlin, [...] "I think Denny knows that he has the talent to win the championship.

Following the inspection, Westa stated, [...] "Overall, their assessment painted a picture of some things we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> in the areas of training and discipline". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its nuclear certification. Said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists about the 5th's failure in the inspection, [...] "It makes you wonder what's going on elsewhere, like the nuclear weapons stationed at bases overseas, and at Barksdale Air Force Base and Whiteman Air Force Base." [...] Minot passed the follow-up inspection on 15 August 2008.|$|E

I hope everyone in Tuvalu is proud of me." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] In November, Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. [...] In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. [...] Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork.

[...] Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, [...] "We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible {{when it comes to the}} NFL. We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> to improve your status." [...] Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. I will come back."

5000|$|Poe was {{expected}} to succeed veteran Kelly Gregg at the defensive tackle position in Kansas City's 3-4 defense, although head coach Crennel acknowledged that [...] "it's {{going to take a}} while for Poe to get adjusted." [...] On the eve of training camp, July 26, 2012, Poe agreed to terms with the Chiefs, signing a four-year deal with a fifth-year team option. Per team policy, financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it was reported to be worth about $11 million. Competing with Anthony Toribio and Jerrell Powe for the starting nose tackle spot left void by Gregg, Poe disappointed in training camp. [...] "He <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> technique, he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> understanding the system, he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> get the calls correct all the time.
