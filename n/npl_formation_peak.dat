40|$|International audienceDiurnal {{simulations}} {{and sensitivity}} studies {{were made with}} a moist column model at the Mars Phoenix lander site (68 °N) for the summer solstice (solar day 30) and for a later date (sol 99), when the LIDAR on board Phoenix detected fog, dust, ice clouds and even snowfall from cloud. The sol 30 simulation reproduces the observed repetitive diurnal 2 m temperature cycle quite well, displaying a well-mixed boundary layer up to 4 km {{in the afternoon and}} a strong surface inversion to 500 m each night. Weak frost <b>formation</b> <b>peaks</b> at midnight and a very thin radiation fog appears during the coldest hour. The near-surface water vapour pressure is underestimated during daytime but is close to the thermal and electrical conductivity probe observations during the night. The Prandtl slope wind mechanism produces veering winds in the model as observed by the ‘telltale' device while coupled dust evolution implies well-mixed dust to 4 km throughout the sol as observed by the LIDAR. The colder diurnal conditions around sol 99 are also simulated rather well. In these, the morning fog grows up to 800 m height and a water ice cloud forms at 4 km height at about 0300 local time, as observed. The cloud marks the radiatively cooled top of the moist residual boundary layer. Strong ground frost <b>formation</b> <b>peaks</b> in the evening, having a visible impact on the temperatures.

40|$|Abstract. The {{strengthening}} of Al−Cu−Mg(−Li) alloys subjected to high pressure torsion (HPT) deformation with strain reversals was studied by microhardness (Hv) tests and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). It {{was found that the}} strengthening is lower for both cyclic HPT (c-HPT) and single reversal HPT (sr-HPT) as compared to monotonic HPT (m-HPT). The DSC results demonstrate that |HPT influences S phase precipitation. With increasing strain, the maximum heat flow (height of the S peak) and the heat content of S <b>formation</b> <b>peaks</b> increases. There is a larger S heat content reaction in the periphery of HPT processed disks compared with those in the centre. Strain reversal also has a significant influence on the S precipitation. The strengthening during HPT deformation is discussed in terms of the density of statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocations...|$|R

When the oxygen coverage was large, a new CO 2 <b>formation</b> <b>peak</b> appeared around 400 K. The activation energy was 30 kcal/mol.

40|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{have been}} reached {{over the last}} few years concerning high-redshift galaxies: (1) The excess of faint blue galaxies is due to dwarf galaxies. (2) Star <b>formation</b> <b>peaks</b> at redshifts z ~ 1 - 2. (3) It appears to occur piecemeal in any given galaxy and there is no evidence for starbursting throughout a large ~ 10 kpc galaxy. (4) There is significant and sharp diminution in the number of L* spiral galaxies at redshifts 1 <z< 2 and elliptical galaxies at redshifts 2. 5 <z< 4. (5) It is increasingly more difficult to hide large high-redshift galaxies in universes with larger volumes per unit redshift, i. e., open or lambda models, which have lower deceleration parameters.
