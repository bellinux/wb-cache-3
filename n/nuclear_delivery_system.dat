5000|$|During Gates's tenure, two missile elements—the ICBM and the submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missile (SLBM) -- joined the manned bomber {{to form a}} [...] "triad" [...] of strategic <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems.</b> Also during this period, there occurred movement toward greater emphasis on counterforce targeting a potential enemy's military installations and forces. Not only was the United States developing or beginning to deploy a variety of missile systems during this period-Atlas, Titan, Minuteman, and Polaris-but so was the Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of these {{technical}} changes, the idea of flexible response ossified, while mutually assured destruction (MAD) became the primary strategic concept of the era. McNamara became a major proponent of MAD, and used it as a reason to cancel other <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems,</b> like the B-1 Lancer bomber. In testimony before Congress he stated that [...] "The strategic missile forces for 1967-71 will provide more force than is required for 'Assured Destruction' ... a new advanced strategic aircraft does not at this time appear justified." ...|$|R
50|$|Orbital {{bombardment}} is the act {{of attacking}} targets on a planet, moon or other astronomical object from orbit around the object, rather than from an aircraft, or a platform beyond orbit.

5000|$|The Supersonic Low Altitude Missile or SLAM (also {{known as}} the [...] "Flying Crowbar") was a U.S. Air Force nuclear weapons project {{conceived}} around 1955, and cancelled in 1964. SLAMs were conceived of as unmanned nuclear-powered ramjets capable of delivering thermonuclear warheads deep into enemy territory. The development of ICBMs in the 1950s rendered the concept of SLAMs obsolete. Advances in defensive ground radar also made the stratagem of low-altitude evasion ineffective. Although it never proceeded beyond the initial design and testing phase before being declared obsolete, the design contained several radical innovations as a <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is a blurry {{line between}} Special Reconnaissance units that never {{directly}} attack a target {{with their own}} weapons, instead directing air and missile strikes onto a target, and Direct Action, where the soldiers will physically attack the target with their own resources, and possibly with other support. Some special operations forces have doctrine {{that allowed them to}} attack targets of opportunity; Soviet Spetsnaz, while on SR during a war, were expected to attack any tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems,</b> such as surface-to-surface missiles, that they encountered.|$|R

50|$|In February 1946 the Red Fleet {{was renamed}} the Soviet Navy (Советский Военно-Морской Флот, Sovyetsky Voyenno-Morskoy Flot), {{literally}} the Soviet Military Maritime Fleet. After the war, the Soviets {{concluded that they}} needed a navy that could disrupt supply lines, and display a small naval presence to the developing world. As the natural resources the Soviet Union needed were available on the Eurasian land mass, it did not need a navy to protect a large commercial fleet, as the western navies were configured to do. Later, countering seaborne <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> became another significant objective of the navy, and an impetus for expansion.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first {{systematic}} treatment {{of the role of}} scientists in the highest levels of decision and policy making in the British government. Its focus is on the crucial defence sector during the period {{from the end of the}} Second World War and up to the 1960 s. It shows the strong influence of a number of career government scientists in the formulation of Britain's post-war defence policy and their crucial role in the making of two particular decisions, focusing on nuclear delivery systems. The thesis offers a number of correctives to the standard image which is prevalent in the bulk of the literature and offers a set of arguments that extend and re-enforce recent trends in the historiography, both of 20 th century Britain and the history of science. It argues that the key scientists in relation to government were not external to the system, expert academics who enter government to offer their, usually critical, point of view (as in the case of the famous Sir Solly Zuckerman), but career scientific civil servants, nursed in the workings of Whitehall and the machinations of government and with broad experience in running large R&D projects. It analyses in detail the careers of the two most important among them, namely Sir Frederick Brundrett and Sir William Cook, placing them in the wider context of government science. It also argues, contrary to the view that post-war defence policy was driven mainly by inter-service rivalries, that the Defence Research Policy Committee of the Ministry of Defence became an important new element in the bureaucratic game in the 1950 s. On the one hand, it shows that its chairman and Chief Scientific Adviser to the Minister, Sir Frederick Brundrett, was much more influential than has been recognised in the 1957 Defence White Paper and its focus on R&D, nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. On the other hand, Sir William Cook, the 'father of the British H-bomb', was able to exert significant and at times decisive influence in the decisions to acquire the Polaris <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> from the United States and to jump start its indigenous improvement programme, the Chevaline.

About 6 years before the first successful test launch of the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Soviet Union's R-7 in 1957, up until this time strategic bombers were not but one of the three strategic <b>nuclear</b> triad <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> of the modern era but the sole intercontinental <b>nuclear</b> weapon <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> capable of reaching the USA from the Soviet Union and vice versa.|$|R

50|$|The OTR-23 Oka (OTP-23 «Ока»; {{named after}} Oka River) was a mobile theatre {{ballistic}} missile (оперативно-тактический ракетный комплекс) deployed by the Soviet Union {{near the end}} of the Cold War to replace the obsolete SS-1C 'Scud B'. It carried the GRAU index 9K714 and was assigned the NATO reporting name SS-23 Spider. The introduction of the Oka significantly strengthened Soviet theatre nuclear capabilities as its range and accuracy allowed it not only to strike hardened NATO targets such as airfields, <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems,</b> and command centers, but moving targets as well. It also had a fast reaction time, being able to fire in approximately five minutes, and was nearly impossible to intercept, thereby allowing it to penetrate defenses.|$|R
50|$|Proponents of MAD {{as part of}} U.S. and USSR {{strategic}} doctrine {{believed that}} nuclear war could best be prevented if neither side could expect to survive a full-scale nuclear exchange as a functioning state. Since {{the credibility of the}} threat is critical to such assurance, each side had to invest substantial capital in their nuclear arsenals even if they were not intended for use. In addition, neither side could be expected or allowed to adequately defend itself against the other's nuclear missiles. This led both to the hardening and diversification of <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> (such as <b>nuclear</b> missile silos, ballistic missile submarines, and nuclear bombers kept at fail-safe points) and to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.|$|R

25|$|Israel {{is known}} to have {{developed}} nuclear weapons. Israel does not officially acknowledge its nuclear weapons program. It is thought Israel possesses between one hundred and four hundred nuclear warheads. It is believed that Jericho intercontinental ballistic missiles are capable of delivering nuclear warheads with a superior degree of accuracy and a range of 11,500km. Israeli F-15I and F-16 fighter-bomber aircraft also have been cited as possible <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> (these aircraft types are nuclear capable in the US Air Force). The U.S. Air Force F-15E has tactical nuclear weapon (B61 and B83 bombs) capability. It has been asserted that Dolphin-class submarines have been adapted to carry Popeye Turbo Submarine-launched cruise missiles with nuclear warheads, so as to give Israel a second strike capacity.|$|R

50|$|According to {{an audit}} by the Brookings Institution, between 1940 and 1996, the U.S. spent $ in present-day terms {{on nuclear weapons}} programs. 57 percent of which was spent on {{building}} <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>delivery</b> <b>systems.</b> 6.3 percent of the total, $ in present-day terms, was spent on environmental remediation and nuclear waste management, for example cleaning up the Hanford site, and 7 percent of the total, $ was spent on making nuclear weapons themselves.|$|R
