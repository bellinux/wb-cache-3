25|$|Following the Fukushima I accidents, the International Energy Agency halved its {{estimate}} of additional <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> {{to be built}} by 2035.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} 1974 to 1976, Manitoba Hydro was still {{studying}} nuclear power, but it concluded that all hydraulic resources {{should be developed}} first before construction of any nuclear facility. Although two research nuclear reactors existed at the Pinawa AECL research facility, no <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> has ever been constructed in Manitoba.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom {{started to}} develop a <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> in the 1950s, with Calder Hall being {{connected}} to the grid on 27 August 1956. Though the production of weapons-grade plutonium was the main reason behind this power station, other civil stations followed, and 26% of the nation's electricity was generated from nuclear power at its peak in 1997.|$|E
50|$|The {{province}} of Ontario dominates Canada's nuclear power industry, containing {{most of the}} country's <b>nuclear</b> power <b>generating</b> <b>capacity.</b> Ontario has 16 operating reactors providing about 50% of the province’s electricity, plus two reactors undergoing refurbishment. New Brunswick also has one reactor. Overall, nuclear power provides about 15% of Canada's electricity. The industry employs about 21,000 people directly and 10,000 indirectly.|$|R
40|$|The Fukushima Daiichi {{accident}} of March 2011 has re-ignited {{the debate about}} the role of nuclear power in the future global energy mix. More than one and a half years after the accident, a somewhat clearer picture is emerging - different countries responded with different nuclear policies, e. g., one size does not fit all. While several countries confirmed or decided to phase-out the use of the technology or to cancel their plans of adding nuclear power to their future electricity generating mix, the majority of countries with operating nuclear power plants or plans to eventually start national nuclear power programmes continue with the implementation of their pre-Fukushima nuclear strategies albeit at a somewhat slower pace. Projections of future nuclear capacity expansion for the year 2030 show a likely shift of global <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacities</b> by about a decade but no significant retraction of national nuclear power programmes globally...|$|R
25|$|Transmission capacity: {{transmission}} capacity {{may be more}} expensive than for <b>nuclear</b> and coal <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> due to lower load factors. Transmission capacity will generally be sized to projected peak output, but average capacity for wind will be significantly lower, raising cost per unit of energy actually transmitted. However transmission costs are a low fraction of total energy costs.|$|R
25|$|Japan's 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, which {{occurred}} in a reactor design from the 1960s, prompted a rethink of nuclear safety and nuclear energy policy in many countries. Germany decided to close all its reactors by 2022, and Italy has banned nuclear power. Following Fukushima, in 2011 the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> to be built by 2035.|$|E
25|$|Bhabha {{announced}} {{that there would}} be 8,000 MW of nuclear power in the country by 1980. As the years progressed, these predictions were to increase. By 1962, the prediction was that nuclear energy would generate 20,000–25,000 MW by 1987, and by 1969, the AEC predicted that by 2000 there would be 43,500 MW of <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity.</b> All of this was before a single unit of nuclear electricity was produced in the country. Reality was quite different. Installed capacity in 1979–80 was about 600 MW, about 950 MW in 1987, and 2720 MW in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, four aging {{reactors}} in the USA were permanently closed {{before their}} licenses expired {{because of high}} maintenance and repair costs {{at a time when}} natural gas prices have fallen: San Onofre 2 and 3 in California, Crystal River 3 in Florida, and Kewaunee in Wisconsin. The state of Vermont is trying to close Vermont Yankee, in Vernon. New York State is seeking to close Indian Point in Buchanan, 30 miles from New York City. Loss of <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> is expected to be offset by the five new nuclear reactors currently under construction, with a proposed combined capacity of more than 5,000 MW.|$|E
50|$|Demographic {{trends and}} {{intensified}} industrialization have caused electric power demand {{to grow by}} 8 percent per year. The government’s goal of 53,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2010 is to be reached by bringing on line new gas-fired plants financed by independent power producers, including those with foreign investment backing, and by adding hydroelectric and <b>nuclear</b> power <b>generating</b> <b>capacity.</b> It has also been estimated that Iran {{has the potential to}} produce at least 6,150 MWh of electricity by Wave power from its coastline on Persian Gulf alone. Iran is also experimenting with electricity generation from organic wastes and plans to build power plants using sewage and organic waste of domestic and industrial origin as fuel. Another area in which there is ongoing research is assessment of Iran's tidal power potential. With about 300 clear sunny days a year and an average of 2,200 kilowatt-hour solar radiation per square meter, Iran has a great potential to tap solar energy.|$|R
40|$|Increases {{in world}} {{population}} and per capita energy demand {{over the next}} few decades are expected to cause a substantial rise in world energy use. In 2006, the International Energy Agency predicted under current policies that energy demands in 2030 would increase by over 50 percent, and world electricity demand would increase by 200 percent over the same period (International Energy Agency, 2006). Nuclear energy is likely {{to play an important role}} in satisfying such rising energy needs. Moreover, as concerns grow over carbon-based energy’s effect on global warming and as countries look to fulfill their electricity needs through alternative sources, we might be at the forefront of the renaissance of nuclear energy markets. The U. S. Department of Energy estimates the world commercial <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> gross <b>capacity</b> could increase by 35 percent in 2015 and by 70 percent in 2030 (U. S. Department of Energy, 2006). Until the end of the 1970 s, nuclear reactors provided less than 5 percent of the world’s electricity. Today they provide 16 percent of a much higher level of world electric production. They contribute about 2, 600 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) each year to satisfy electricity needs, as much as from all sources of electricity worldwide in 196...|$|R
50|$|Base load {{coal and}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> plants {{generate}} the greater portion of electricity in Maryland. Coal-fired plants producing 39.3% of the state's electric generation in 2008 with <b>nuclear</b> plants <b>generating</b> 13.8%, {{oil and gas}} plants 41.2%, and hydroelectric plants and other renewables providing the remainder. In a 2010 report the PSC reported that 70% of the electric <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> in the state came from plants that were over thirty years old. , the Supreme Court of the United States is reviewing whether Maryland is allowed to subsidize new power plants.|$|R

5000|$|Hope Creek <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Generating</b> Station is {{a thermal}} {{nuclear power plant}} located in Lower Alloways Creek Township, in Salem County, New Jersey, United States, on the same site as the two-unit Salem Nuclear Power Plant. The plant is owned and {{operated}} by PSEG Nuclear LLC. It has one unit (one reactor), a boiling water reactor (BWR) manufactured by GE. [...] The complex was designed for two units, but the second unit was cancelled in 1981. It has a <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> of 1,268 MWe. The plant came online on July 25, 1986, licensed to operate until 2026. In 2009, PSEG applied for a 20-year license renewal, which it received in 2011. With its combined output of 3,572 megawatts, the Salem-Hope Creek complex is the largest <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> facility in the Eastern United States and the second largest nationwide.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{above-ground}} {{dry storage}} has been used. Ontario Power Generation {{is in the}} process of constructing a Dry Storage Cask storage facility on its Darlington site, which will be similar in many respects to existing facilities at Pickering <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Generating</b> Station and Bruce <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Generating</b> Station. NB Power's Point Lepreau <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Generating</b> Station and Hydro-Québec's Gentilly <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Generating</b> Station also both operate dry storage facilities.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano {{said the}} Japanese nuclear {{disaster}} [...] "caused deep public anxiety {{throughout the world}} and damaged confidence in nuclear power". Many countries have advised their nationals to leave Tokyo, citing the risk associated with the nuclear plants' ongoing accident. It is reported that it make take years or decades to completely clean up the area. Nonetheless, estimates of radioactivity leakage into the Pacific Ocean remain modest with National Geographic reporting the leakage of approximately 0.3 Tbq per month of both 137Cs and 134Cs. 0.3 TBq is equal to 1/40th of the natural radiation in one km3 of seawater and 1/50000000000th of the total natural radioactivity in the oceans. Following the Fukushima I accidents, The Economist reported that the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> to be built by 2035.|$|E
2500|$|China – ZSR {{reported}} on 14 March that During a News Conference of the Annual Meeting of National People's Congress of China, the Deputy Chief of Environmental Protection Authority of China, Mr Lijun Zhang had said: [...] "We {{are concerned about}} the damage of the Nuclear Facility of Japan, concerned about the further development of this issue, we will learn from it, and will take it into account when we make strategic planning for the nuclear energy development in the future. However, our decision on development of more nuclear power plants and current arrangement on nuclear energy development will not be changed." [...] On 16 March, China froze nuclear plant approvals. On 28 March, the Chinese government revised nuclear power targets, which would likely result [...] "in a reduction of about 10 gigawatts in <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> from the 90 gigawatts previously expected to be built by 2020." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2011 {{the nuclear}} {{accidents}} at Japan's Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and shutdowns at other nuclear facilities raised questions among some commentators {{over the future}} of the renaissance. Platts has reported that [...] "the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world". In 2011 Siemens exited the nuclear power sector following the Fukushima disaster and subsequent changes to German energy policy, and supported the German government's planned energy transition to renewable energy technologies. China, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, Malaysia, Thailand, United Kingdom, Italy and the Philippines have reviewed their nuclear power programs. Indonesia and Vietnam still plan to build nuclear power plants. Countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Portugal, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Norway remain opposed to nuclear power. Following the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional <b>nuclear</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> built by 2035.|$|E
