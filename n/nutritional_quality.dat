25|$|Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene {{implanted}} {{into its}} genome {{that allows the}} plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosates.

With {{the increasing use of}} herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides.

25|$|The {{secondary}} chemicals {{produced by}} endophytic fungi when {{associated with their}} host plants can be very harmful to mammals including livestock and humans, causing more than 600 million dollars in losses due to dead livestock every year. For example, the ergot alkaloids produced by Claviceps spp. have been dangerous contaminants of rye crops for centuries. When not lethal, defense chemicals produced by fungal endophytes may lead to lower productivity in cows and other livestock feeding on infected forage. Reduced <b>nutritional</b> <b>quality</b> of infected plant tissue also lowers the performance of farm animals, compounding the effect of reduced feed uptake when provided with infected plant matter. Reduced frequency of pregnancy and birth has also been reported in cattle and horses fed with infected forage. Consequently, the dairy and meat-production industries must endure substantial economic losses.|$|E

[...] Some rodents are considered keystone species and ecosystem engineers {{in their respective}} habitats. In the Great Plains of North America, the burrowing activities of prairie dogs play important roles in soil aeration and nutrient redistribution, raising the organic content of the soil and increasing the absorption of water. They maintain these grassland habitats, and some large herbivores such as bison and pronghorn prefer to graze near prairie dog colonies due to the increased <b>nutritional</b> <b>quality</b> of forage.|$|E

2500|$|A central {{question}} in the trophic dynamic literature {{is the nature of}} control and regulation over resources and production. Ecologists use simplified one trophic position food chain models (producer, carnivore, decomposer). Using these models, ecologists have tested various types of ecological control mechanisms. For example, herbivores generally have an abundance of vegetative resources, which meant that their populations were largely controlled or regulated by predators. This is known as the top-down hypothesis or 'green-world' hypothesis. Alternatively to the top-down hypothesis, not all plant material is edible and the <b>nutritional</b> <b>quality</b> or antiherbivore defenses of plants (structural and chemical) suggests a bottom-up form of regulation or control. Recent studies have concluded that both [...] "top-down" [...] and [...] "bottom-up" [...] forces can influence community structure and the strength of the influence is environmentally context dependent. These complex multitrophic interactions involve more than two trophic levels in a food web.|$|E
2500|$|Studies are {{inconclusive}} as {{to whether}} SNAP has a direct effect on the <b>nutritional</b> <b>quality</b> of food choices made by participants. Unlike other federal programs that provide food subsidies, i.e. the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), SNAP does not have nutritional standards for purchases. Critics of the program suggest that this lack of structure represents a missed opportunity for public health advancement and cost containment. [...] In April, 2013, the USDA research body, the Economic Research Service (ERS), published a study that examined diet quality in SNAP participants compared to low-income nonparticipants. [...] The study revealed a difference in diet quality between SNAP participants and low-income nonparticipants, finding that SNAP participants score slightly lower on the [...] (HEI) than nonparticipants. The study also concluded that SNAP {{increases the likelihood that}} participants will consume whole fruit by 23 percentage points.

2500|$|Ingram soon {{realized}} that the word burger evoked connotations of circus performances at livestock markets and greasy pieces of meat eaten in the poorest districts {{of the city in}} the collective mind of the American public. He tried to change those connotations from White Castle's earliest days. At the same time, he became known to some as the Henry Ford of the hamburger, while inventing a restaurant concept he called the [...] "White Castle System", which helped the hamburger achieve fame. Between 1923 and 1931, the [...] "White Castle System" [...] established almost a hundred restaurants in cities throughout the Midwestern United States. In order to raise awareness among White Castle employees, a newsletter entitled [...] "The hot hamburger" [...] was circulated throughout the company, which challenged the employees to improve the sale of the burgers with a simple idea: to be able to prepare burgers rapidly so anyone could purchase and eat them anytime and anywhere. Instead of waiting for half an hour to be served at a traditional restaurant, the White Castle System provided rapid service and a menu centered around the hamburger. At the time, the hamburger was typically served with coffee. Upton Sinclair's The Jungle had already caused public outrage over the safety of processed meat, so by the 1920s, the general public had come to expect a clean and hygienic hamburger. In addition to offering clean and safe food, White Castle offered regularity and standardization, ensuring that each patty was served in the same manner in each restaurant. At the time, this was an entirely novel idea that would revolutionize the sale of food itself with a style that would {{come to be known as}} fast food. During its early years, White Castle emphasized providing quality coffee, and collaborated with universities to publish studies on the <b>nutritional</b> <b>quality</b> of their hamburgers.|$|E

40|$|Our {{demand for}} more and better food {{continues}} to increase. Improved <b>nutritional</b> <b>qualities</b> as well as removal of antinutritional traits are both needed. Various approaches {{have been used to}} add <b>nutritional</b> <b>qualities</b> to food crops. We focus here on reducing the level of endogenous, an-tinutritional factors in existing crops (1). Antinutritional substances range from lethal toxins to compounds that disrupt digestion and nutrient absorption (2). In the course of crop domestication, levels of antinutri-ents were reduced by selection and/or breeding, although some of such substances remain in the general food source. In addition, wild germplasm, which can be useful as a source of novel traits such as path-ogen resistance, may also be complicated by co-occurrence of antinutri-tional compounds that need to be removed.
