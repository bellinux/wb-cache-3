5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. Transferring the person to a higher level of nursing care, such as an intensive care unit, is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube</b> permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} end-of-life care, Brady died of restrictive {{pulmonary disease}} in Ashworth Hospital on 15 May 2017. On 21 September 2017, the inquest {{found that he}} {{died of natural causes}} and his hunger strike had not been a contributory factor. Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube,</b> although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not a cause for concern. Brady was cremated on 25 October 2017 and his ashes were disposed of at sea.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} with soap, drinking clean water, proper disposal of human waste, and breastfeeding babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube.</b> Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{a medical}} device {{that can be}} used for a number of purposes. The process of {{inserting}} them however can be complicated. Nurses must therefore use an evidence based approach to confirm the correct position of <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> and there are three main techniques described in the literature to do so. To date, one group of authors has published the majority of the studies on these techniques. This paper reviews their work. <br /...|$|R
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube,</b> which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube,</b> may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube</b> feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
40|$|This is the {{protocol}} {{for a review}} {{and there is no}} abstract. The objectives are as follows: Our objective is to determine if there is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of pH testing (the intervention under scrutiny) for verification of correct placement of <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> in adults and children. To this end, we will attempt to answer the following questions: 1. In adults and children, is pH testing an effective and safe method for determining whether <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> are correctly positioned in the stomach before feeding (or delivery of any fluid) begins? 2. What evidence is there about the risk of adverse events in the case of incorrect placement? For this review, pH testing is defined as: litmus paper, pH indicator test strips, pH meters. These will be tested against other methods used for detecting placement of <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes,</b> including visual examination of aspirate, auscultation with insufflation of air, detection of air bubbles in a bowl of water, X-ray, ultrasonography, endoscopy, enzyme analysis of aspirate, capnography, and other methods that do not rely on measurement of pH...|$|R
50|$|The <b>nasogastric</b> (NG) <b>tube</b> {{is meant}} to convey liquid food to the stomach. Thus, its tip must rest in the stomach. When {{inserted}} incorrectly, the tip may rest in the respiratory system instead of the stomach; in this case, the liquid food will enter the lungs, resulting in pneumonia and can, in rare cases, lead to death. The incorrect insertion of fine <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> which are stiffened with wires {{has been associated with}} the puncture of the lungs and pneumothorax; however this is a rarer complication.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are often}} used in the {{intensive}} care unit (ICU) to provide nutrition to critically ill patients while their medical conditions are addressed. There is moderate evidence for use of feeding tubes in the ICU, especially if requiring mechanical ventilation for more than three days.|$|R
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of gastroenteritis in {{both children and}} adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required {{if there is a}} decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube</b> can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube,</b> but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E
25|$|A small {{flexible}} tube (<b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube)</b> may be inserted {{through the nose}} into the stomach to help decompress the dilated bowel.

40|$|In this partly {{retrospective}} {{and partly}} prospective study, we examined 200 patients with suspected caustic ingestion. No steroids {{were administered to}} the patients involved.

Of these patients, two developed esophageal strictures, but subsequent dilatation was successful. No stricture formation was observed {{in the group of}} patients with noncircular lesions. We feel that this low percentage of stricture formation is due to the use of <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes.</b> Since neither the presence nor the severity of esophageal burns is predictable, an endoscopy should be performed in all suspected cases.

25|$|Initially, gastric {{decontamination}} of {{the patient}} is achieved by administering, either orally or via a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube,</b> activated charcoal pre-mixed with water, which adsorbs the drug in the gastrointestinal tract (most useful if given within 2 hours of drug ingestion).

Blood sugar levels should be re-checked on two hour intervals.|$|E
25|$|Except in {{the most}} severe cases, ischemic colitis is treated with {{supportive}} care. IV fluids are given to treat dehydration, and the patient is placed on bowel rest (meaning nothing to eat or drink) until the symptoms resolve.

50|$|Common {{equipment}} in an {{intensive care unit}} includes mechanical ventilation to assist breathing through an endotracheal tube or a tracheotomy; hemofiltration equipment for acute renal failure; monitoring equipment; intravenous lines for drug infusions fluids or total parenteral nutrition, <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes,</b> suction pumps, drains and catheters; and {{a wide array of}} drugs including inotropes, sedatives, broad spectrum antibiotics and analgesics.|$|R
50|$|Only smaller {{diameter}} (12 Fr {{or less in}} adults) <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are appropriate}} for long-term feeding, {{so as to avoid}} irritation and erosion of the nasal mucosa.

25|$|A Sengstaken-Blakemore tube is an oro or <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube</b> used {{occasionally}} {{in the management}} of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to bleeding from esophageal varices which are distended veins in the esophageal wall, usually as a result of cirrhosis.

25|$|Patients {{may have}} {{particular}} problems, such as dysphagia, {{which can cause}} swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube</b> may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|If {{the person}} cannot swallow at all, an esophageal stent may be {{inserted}} {{to keep the}} esophagus open; stents may also assist in occluding fistulas.

The latter two are especially important if the patient tends to aspirate food or saliva into the airways, predisposing for aspiration pneumonia.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review: This article {{reviews the}} {{thoracic}} complications from malpositioned blindly inserted <b>nasogastric</b> feeding <b>tubes</b> in mechanically ventilated patients {{in intensive care}} and the methods to check the position and promote safe placement of the feeding tubes. Recent findings: Malpositioned feeding tubes {{are not included in}} risk management databases. The reported incidence is 1 - 3 % and more than half occur in mechanically ventilated patients. Eighty three mechanically ventilated patients were reported with malpositioned <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> and 66 % of them developed serious thoracic complications. Pneumothoraces accounted for 80 % of thoracic complications that were evenly distributed between tubes with and without stylet. Repeated misplacements appear to increase the risk. Non-radiological confirmation of the position of the tube has suboptimal performance. Protocols to place feeding tubes and new technology are promising candidates. Summary: Malpositioned <b>nasogastric</b> feeding <b>tubes</b> are underreported and associated with serious thoracic complications in mechanically ventilated patients. We need more data to answer whether we can afford to prevent them...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Concomitant {{treatment}} {{in addition to}} intervention may influence the primary outcome, especially in complex interventions such as surgical trials. Evidence-based standards for perioperative care after distal pancreatectomy, however, have been rarely defined. This study's objective was therefore to identify and analyse the current basis of evidence for perioperative management in distal pancreatectomy. Methods A standardised questionnaire was sent to 23 European centres recruiting patients for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on open distal pancreatectomy that would compare suture versus stapler closure of the pancreatic remnant (DISPACT trial, ISRCTN 18452029). Perioperative strategies (e. g., bowel preparation, pain management, administration of antibiotics, abdominal incision, drainages, <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes,</b> somatostatin, mobilisation and feeding regimens) were assessed. Moreover, a systematic literature search in the Medline database was performed and retrieved meta-analyses and RCTs were reviewed. Results All 23 centres returned the questionnaire. Consensus for thoracic epidural catheters (TECs), pain treatment and transverse incisions was found, as well as strong consensus for the placement of intra-abdominal drainages and perioperative single-shot antibiotics. Also, there was consensus that bowel preparation, somatostatin application, postoperative <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> and intravenous feeding might not be beneficial. The literature search identified 16 meta-analyses and 19 RCTs demonstrating that bowel preparation, somatostatin therapy and <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> can be omitted. Early mobilisation, feeding and TECs seem to be beneficial for patients. The value of drainages remains unclear. Conclusion Most perioperative standards within the centres participating in the DISPACT trial are in accordance with current available evidence. The need for drainages requires further investigation.

25|$|Immediately {{following}} the surgery, {{the patient is}} placed in an intensive care unit for monitoring, normally {{for a period of}} a few days. The patient is put on a ventilator to assist breathing. Nutritional needs are generally met via total parenteral nutrition, although in some cases a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube</b> is sufficient for feeding. Chest tubes are put in so that excess fluids may be removed. Because the patient is confined to bed, a urinary catheter is used. IV lines are used in the neck and arm for monitoring and giving medications.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} versus {{risks of}} placing a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube</b> {{in those with}} upper GI bleeding are not determined. Endoscopy within 24hours is recommended. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin before endocopy can decrease the amount {{of blood in the}} stomach and thus improve the operators view. Early endoscopy decreases hospital time and the amount of blood transfusions needed. Proton pump inhibitors, if they have not been started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72hours.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{is usually}} treated with intravenous fluids, pain medication, and sometimes antibiotics. Typically no eating or drinking is allowed and a tube may be placed into the stomach. A procedure {{known as an}} endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be done to open the pancreatic duct if blocked. In those with gallstones the gallbladder is often also removed. In chronic pancreatitis, {{in addition to the}} above, temporary feeding through a <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tube</b> may be used to provide adequate nutrition. Long-term dietary changes and pancreatic enzyme replacement may be required. And occasionally surgery is done to remove parts of the pancreas.|$|E

They are also used to secure <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> or CPAP masks to the patient's face. Hydrocolloid dressings are used for pressure ulcers (also known as bed sores). They {{are used in the}} treatment of eczema, to seal steroid ointment underneath and to provide a barrier against scratching.|$|R
50|$|KUB is {{typically}} used to investigate gastrointestinal {{conditions such as}} a bowel obstruction and gallstones, and can detect the presence of kidney stones. The KUB {{is often used to}} diagnose constipation as stool can be seen readily. The KUB is also used to assess positioning of indwelling devices such as ureteric stents and <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes.</b> KUB is also done as a scout film for other procedures such as barium enemas.|$|R
40|$|Postoperative Ileus (POI) is a frequent, {{frustrating}} occurrence {{for patients}} and surgeons after abdominal surgery. Despite significant research investigating {{how to reduce}} this multi-factorial phenomenon, a single strategy has not been shown to reduce POI’s significant effects on length of stay (LOS) and hospital costs. Perhaps the most significant cause of POI {{is the use of}} narcotics for analgesia. Strategies that target inflammation and pain reduction such as NSAID use, epidural analgesia, and laparoscopic techniques will reduce POI but are accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in opioid use. Pharmacologic means of stimulating gut motility have not shown a positive effect, and the routine use of <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes</b> only increases morbidity. Recent multi-site phase III trials with alvimopan, a peripherally acting mu-antagonist, have shown significant reductions in POI and LOS by 12 and 16 hours, respectively, by blunting the effects of narcotics on gut motility while sparing centrally mediated analgesia. Use of alvimopan, along with a multi-modal postoperative treatment plan involving early ambulation, feeding, and avoiding <b>nasogastric</b> <b>tubes,</b> will likely be the crux of POI treatment and prevention...|$|R
