For oriented strandboard (OSB), high boron loadings led to lower internal bond strength and lower thickness swelling. Water absorption results were variable but no deleterious effect of treatment was noted. For medium density fiberboard (MDF), the highest loadings led to reduced internal bond strength. Thickness swelling decreased with increasing boron level, but not significantly. As with OSB, water absorption results varied. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} analysis indicated that A.areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common mycelium, A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>wood</b> wasp, while A.laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in <b>North</b> <b>American</b> nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|R

40|$|Although in Russia, forest {{resources}} are abundant and Russian wood have large market potential, <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>wood</b> {{has been replaced}} Russian forest products in the Japanese market. Fundamental problems of the Japanese-Russian logs trade are supply instability, and failure to sort by species and grading. The use of Russian lumber in construction is now quite limited and most logs are sawed into small sectional lumber and are used for non-structural components. Sawmills processing Russian Logs have taken measures to expand market of Russian wood products, such as producing value added lumber, direct dealing with consumers and establishing joint venture companies in Russia. To enlarge the use of Russian wood in Japan, improving the condition of exporting logs from Russia and the processing techniques of Russian logs is needed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} how evolutionary convergence within shared environments shapes some features of bird song while leaving others unaffected, using as an example the songs of 51 <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>wood</b> warblers (Parulinae). I combined published information on breeding habitats and evolutionary relationships to show that the structure of warbler songs is correlated with habitat, whereas the structure of the notes that comprise the songs is relatively unaffected by habitat and more closely related to phylogenetic history. The results confirm known relationships between bird song and habitat, including correlations between song frequency and the type and density of canopy foliage, and between the number and arrangement of notes in the song and foliage density and moisture. More importantly, the results suggest that individual notes and whole songs are to some extent functionally independent, because the configuration of notes shows more evidence of evolutionary constraint than does the way notes are assembled into songs...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} as a keynote address at the conference on Forest Sustainability - Beyond 2000 held in May 2000 in Thunder Bay, Canada. The conference brought together forest sector leaders and professionals from across Canada. This paper {{is an extension of}} earlier work on the sustainability <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>wood</b> supplies (Nilsson et al., 2000). The present paper examines the efficiency of the current established criteria and indicators for sustainable development of the forest sector. The current system of criteria and indicators concentrates on the management aspects instead of the objectives setting. The current system is too complicated to be implemented and neglects the fact that sustainability cannot be achieved by a top-down approach but only by the people working on the ground at the local level. This paper presents a number of guidelines on the necessary steps to be taken in order to move towards A Forest Sector for Sustainable Development. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>wood</b> decking market mostly {{relies on}} easily treatable Southern yellow pine (SYP), {{which is being}} {{impregnated}} with micronized copper (MC) wood preservatives since 2006. These formulations are composed of copper (Cu) carbonate particles (CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2), with sizes ranging from 1 nm to 250 μm, according to manufacturers. MC-treated SYP wood is protected against decay by solubilized Cu 2 + ions and unreacted CuCO 3 ·Cu(OH) 2 particles that successively release Cu 2 + ions (reservoir effect). The wood species used for the European wood decking market differ from the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> SYP. One {{of the most common}} species is Norway spruce wood, which is poorly treatable i. e. refractory due to the anatomical properties, like pore size and structure, and chemical composition, like pit membrane components or presence of wood extractives. Therefore, MC formulations may not suitable for refractory wood species common in the European market, despite their good performance in SYP. We evaluated the penetration effectiveness of MC azole (MCA) in easily treatable Scots pine and in refractory Norway spruce wood. We assessed the effectiveness against the Cu-tolerant wood-destroying fungus Rhodonia placenta. Our findings show that MCA cannot easily penetrate refractory wood species and could not confirm the presence of a reservoir effect...|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{and radio}} {{frequency}} kilns: reducing the air pressure {{to attempt to}} speed up the drying process. A variety of these vacuum technologies exist, varying primarily in the method heat is introduced into the wood charge. Hot water platten vacuum kilns use aluminum heating plates with the water circulating within as the heat source, and typically operate at significantly reduced absolute pressure. Discontinuous and SSV (super-heated steam) use atmosphere pressure to introduce heat into the kiln charge. The entire kiln charge comes up to full atmospheric pressure, the air in the chamber is then heated and finally a vacuum is pulled as the charge cools. SSV run at partial-atmospheres, typically around 1/3 of full atmospheric pressure, in a hybrid of vacuum and conventional kiln technology (SSV kilns are significantly more popular in Europe where the locally harvested wood is easier to dry than the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>woods.</b> RF/V (radio frequency + vacuum) kilns use microwave radiation to heat the kiln charge, and typically have the highest operating cost due to the heat of vaporization being provided by electricity rather than local fossil fuel or waste wood sources.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Lakland {{introduced}} the Korean (Indonesian since 2008) made Skyline Series. Developed {{with the help}} of importer-exporter Westheimer Corp., the midrange Skyline Series is constructed using <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>wood</b> and features the same overall design as the US basses (excluding the graphite reinforcement on the 4-string necks, all necks being half-sawn instead of quarter-sawn, acrylic nuts instead of bone, no left-hand models, no alder body wood option, and in far fewer colors) but is cut, finished, and assembled overseas. Once the instrument arrives in Chicago, the company's builders work to install its electronics and make sure the frets are leveled within specification of Lakland's US models. Lakland currently uses the PLEK setup and leveling system. The Skyline 44-02 and 55-02 models originally contained the USA Bartolini MM\J pickups and NTMB preamp, the same system that was in the USA 4-94 and 55-94 basses. Currently all of those models (4-94, 55-94, 44-02, 55-02) contain the Lakland-Hanson LH3 system. The Skyline 44-01 and 55-01 models contain the Korean Bartolini MK1 pickups and preamp. The Osborn, Scheff, and Jones signature models previously featured Hipshot-licensed tuners and Lakland-Hanson custom pickups. (Previously Lakland used Aero or Lindy Fralin pickups.) ...|$|R

40|$|Typical <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>wood</b> frame {{houses have}} trusses that are toe-nailed {{to the wall}} top-plates. In order to develop models of roof {{failures}} for such structures, considering the effects of wind speed, direction and duration for a storm, {{as well as the}} structural details, knowledge of the load sharing and how it is altered by the nail slip at each of the connections is required. The objective of the current paper is to quantify the changes in load sharing during nail/connection slip. This is achieved by simplifying the roof structure to the essential components of a beam, which bends elastically in the direction normal to the trusses, and real, toe-nailed connections. Test results for a single "roof stiffness" and truss spacing show that significant load sharing is not observed until permanent displacements (i. e., damage) to a connection occur. Dynamic load tests, with the same time-varying load applied to each connection, have shown that the load sharing increases with the damage accumulation to each of the connections and changes continuously. Ultimately, this information will be used in the development of analytical models that are able to consider storm duration effects on the performance and failure of wood-frame houses in extreme winds...|$|R
40|$|Throughout South Asia biomass is {{commonly}} used as a fuel source for cooking and heating homes. The smoke from domestic use of these fuels {{is expected to be}} a major source of atmospheric particulate matter in the region and needs to be characterized for input in regional source apportionment models and global climate models. Biomass fuel samples including coconut leaves, rice straw, jackfruit branches, dried cowdung patties, and biomass briquettes manufactured from compressed biomass material were obtained from Bangladesh. The fuel samples were burned in a wood stove to collect and characterize the particulate matter emissions. The bulk chemical composition including total organic and elemental carbon, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and chloride ions, and bulk elements such as potassium and sodium did not show conclusive differences among the biomass samples tested. Unique features, however, exist in the detailed organic characterization of the combustion smoke from the different sources. The organic compound fingerprints of the particulate matter are shown to be distinct from one another and distinct from <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>wood</b> fuels. Fecal stanols including 5 b-stigmastanol, coprostanol, and cholestanol are found to be good molecular markers for the combustion of cowdung. Additionally, the patterns of methoxyphenols and plant sterols provide a unique signature for each biomass sample and are conducive as source apportionment tracers...|$|R
