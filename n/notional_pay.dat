50|$|Korenchevsky's {{report as}} Secretary(1 June 1954) to the society's four-man {{executive}} committee (chaired by Sir Charles Dodds FRS) {{showed that the}} BSRA had a <b>notional</b> 40 members <b>paying</b> an annual fee of 10s (equivalent to £12 in 2014) and assets of approximately £680 (equivalent to ~£15,800). By October 1954 this risen to 58, including possibly the BSRA's first foreign member (Professor J. Musso Fournier of Motevideo, Uruguay). A new Executive was elected for 1955 which included Professor Peter Medawar, who was to win a Nobel Prize shortly thereafter. The society restricted its interests to biological gerontology in contrast to both the IAG and the American geological Society. This {{was very much in}} accord with Korenchevsky's vision of how the organisation would operate and was to have significant consequences for the future development of the organisation.|$|R
40|$|Aims Whilst the CArdiac REsynchronization in Heart Failure (CARE-HF) {{trial has}} shown that cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) leads to reduced morbidity and mortality, the cost-effectiveness of this therapy remains uncertain. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and incremental cost per life year gained of CRT plus medical therapy compared to medical therapy alone. Methods and results This prospective analysis based on intention to treat data from all patients enrolled in the CARE-HF trial at 82 clinical centres in 12 European countries. A total of 813 patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and cardiac dyssynchrony were randomized to CRT plus medical therapy (n= 409) vs. medical therapy alone (n= 404). During a mean follow-up of 29. 4 months CRT was associated with increased costs (€ 4316, 95 % CI: 1327 – 7485), survival (0. 10 years, 95 % CI: ? 0. 01 – 0. 21), and QALYs (0. 22, 95 % CI: 0. 13 – 0. 32). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was € 19 ? 319 per QALY gained (95 % CI: 5482 – 45 ? 402) and € 43 ? 596 per life-year gained (95 % CI: ? 146 ? 236 – 223 ? 849). These results were sensitive to the costs of the device, procedure, and hospitalization. Conclusion Treatment with CRT appears cost-effective at the <b>notional</b> willingness to <b>pay</b> threshold of € 29 400 (£ 20 ? 000) per QALY gained...|$|R
40|$|Objectives  To {{assess the}} {{cost-effectiveness}} of outpatient (at home) cervical ripening with isosorbide mononitrate (IMN) prior to induction of labour. Design  Economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomised placebo controlled trial (the IMOP trial). Setting  Large UK maternity hospital. Population  A total of 350 nulliparous {{women with a}} singleton pregnancy, cephalic presentation ≥ 37 weeks gestation, requiring cervical ripening prior to induction of labour. Interventions  Isosorbide mononitrate (n = 177) or placebo (n = 173) self-administered vaginally at home at 48, 32 and 16 hours prior to the scheduled time of admission for induction. Results  Mean health service costs between the period of randomisation and discharge for mother and infant were £ 1254. 86 in the IMN group and £ 1242. 88 in the placebo group, generating a mean cost difference of £ 11. 98 (bootstrap mean cost difference £ 12. 86; 95 %CI: −£ 106. 79, £ 129. 39) that {{was not statistically significant}} (P = 0. 842). The incremental cost per hour prevented from hospital admission to delivery was £ 7. 53. At the <b>notional</b> willingness to <b>pay</b> threshold of £ 100 per hour prevented from hospital admission to delivery, the probability that IMN is cost-effective was estimated at 0. 67. This translated into a mean net monetary benefit of £ 98. 13 for each woman given IMN. Conclusions  Although the probability that IMN is cost-effective approaches 0. 7 at seemingly low willingness to pay thresholds for an hour prevented from hospital admission to delivery, our results should be viewed {{in the light of the}} clinical findings from the IMOP trial. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of NDC public pension scheme in few European countries, such as Latvia, Sweden, Italy, and Poland, {{in the nineties}} was motivated, among other things, by the need (i) to ensure the long term financial sustainability of the public pension system by linking pension returns to economic growth; (ii) to reduce the existing distortions in the labor market, due to the existing strong incentives to retire early, (iii) to increase the intergenerational equity of the system, jeopardized by the different returns across generations; and (iv) to reduce the systematic political interference with public pension systems under aging through the {{introduction of}} a sequence of automatic adjustments in the system that do not require government intervention. After more than ten years from their introduction, these systems have performed reasonably well on these accounts. However, some degree of political involvement with the working of the pension systems has continued (f. e., in Italy), and new concerns have emerged. In particular, the combination of a pension system, which strongly bases the benefit calculation on previous contributions (and on thus labor market status), and the existence in some countries of a dual labor market, with young workers being held on the margin of the regular labor market for many years, create a new, potentially strong challenge to these systems. Our simulations of the future pension benefits for the current generation of young workers with a discontinuous working history in Italy and Sweden suggest that the replacement rates will be low, unless the retirement age is significantly increased. This effect may end up jeopardizing the political sustainability of these NDC systems in the future, unless important labor market reforms are introduced. We discuss the effects on the future generation of retirees in Italy and Sweden of a current labor market reform: {{the introduction of a}} unique labor market contract, aimed at reducing the dualism between temporary and permanent workers. <b>notional</b> defined contribution, <b>pay</b> as you go, labor market dualism and pensions...|$|R
