25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 2000–01 season, Bristol Rovers {{had been}} the only team in the Football League never to have played in the first or the fourth levels of the league. This record ended when the team were relegated to Division 3 for the 2001–02 season. Holloway {{resigned}} at the halfway point of the season, and Garry Thompson took over {{for the rest of the}} campaign, but was unable to prevent relegation. Gerry Francis returned to the club and oversaw a good start that saw them top the division at the end of August; results soon faded however, and it became clear that Rovers were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the division at the first attempt. Francis resigned due to personal issues in December with the side in 20th place, leading to Garry Thompson being reinstated as manager. Despite masterminding a cup upset against Premier League opponents Derby County, Rovers' League form remained poor, and the club hit its lowest ebb, finishing second bottom of the whole League and only surviving due to a truly awful season by bottom-placed Halifax Town.|$|E

The coroner {{determined}} that Jonathan died first, meaning that Paul's brother inherited everything. The brother ignored Paul's wishes regarding Sarria. [...] "I would have gotten one of the houses", Sarria claimed, [...] "but he only gave me a little money and one ring. He claimed that was all Paul wanted me to have. He was so evil. He said afterwards, 'If you expect anything else, you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Koubek {{defended his}} work from criticisms {{that it was}} boxlike, sterile, repetitive, and dull. [...] "Good {{architecture}} ... has to fit {{the fabric of the}} city and be functional inside and make economic sense. The most wonderful building in the world is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> built if it will not make money." [...] Others defended his work as well. Oliver T. Carr, chairman of the giant real estate developer CarrAmerica, said, [...] "He was good. He was different from so many architects of that time. His buildings had clean architectural lines, and yet they were functional and practical and offered good work space. For that period of time, he was a perfect fit." ...|$|E
500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You {{can do whatever you}} put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E

Jim Durrell, the mayor of Ottawa at the time, but later part of the Senators' front office, said, [...] "It's not that the area isn't a big enough market to support a professional hockey team, it's just that we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it." [...] National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) head Alan Eagleson was quoted as saying, [...] "Local fans are being led through the petunia patch if Bruce Firestone thinks he can land an NHL expansion franchise for Ottawa this century, {{well into the next}} or ever." [...] Despite the naysayers, 11,000 fans sent in $25 non-refundable pledges toward season-tickets by November 1990.|$|E

Nine months after the crash, he told New York Daily News reporter Michael Iachetta, [...] "Songs are in my head like they always are. And they're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for {{some of the things that}} have happened." [...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E
500|$|From Autumn to Ashes {{formed on}} Long Island in 2000 with Francis Mark (drums, vocals), Steve Salvio (guitar) and Benjamin Perri (vocals) — Perri {{provided}} screaming vocals, while Mark sung clean vocals.

And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

She then released a single and video covering of Sam Smith's [...] "Writing's on the Wall" [...] and another single and video covering, Skylar Grey's [...] "Coming Home (Part II)". In April, Evancho sang the national anthem at the Pittsburgh Pirates' 2016 opening home game. She also released an original pop song by Peter Zizzo, [...] "Apocalypse". Billboard wrote that she [...] "has found a brand-new sound. The 16-year-old singer ... is taking a step outside the classical world that made her famous"; but Evancho told Billboard: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of my classical voice, because that's my roots, that's what I love the most." [...] She also released a video of the song and performed it on the Today show and Live! with Kelly and Michael. A reviewer for The New Yorker, however, found the track [...] "cloying", writing that Evancho [...] "sounds unremarkable outside her genre." ...|$|E
500|$|The American {{release of}} Modern Life Is Rubbish {{features}} an altered track listing. Blur's American label SBK Records preferred the group's original demo of [...] "Chemical World", and included {{it on the}} album instead of the Stephen Street-produced version. According to Select magazine, this [...] "defeated the object of recording a heavy rock song in the first place". SBK inserted [...] "Popscene" [...] between [...] "Turn It Up" [...] and [...] "Resigned"; Blur had refused to include [...] "Popscene" [...] on the British version of Modern Life, disappointed by the tepid response it received when it was released as a single. [...] "We thought, If you didn’t fucking want {{it in the first}} place," [...] Coxon told Select, [...] "you’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it now".

500|$|Rouass was {{acquainted with}} the series, having viewed the first two series and [...] "dipped {{in and out of}} it." [...] She also stated that Maya is only a {{background}} character throughout the series, meaning her role is limited, and does not play a spy or becoming [...] "part of this mafia or that mafia." [...] Due to her limited appearance, the actress was available to perform other projects, including The Sarah Jane Adventures and Conan the Barbarian, as well as spending the free time with her daughter. Rouass does not participate in any stunt work, but does appear in [...] "a lot of passionate scenes." [...] Having gotten used to filming sex scenes in Footballers' Wives, Rouass noticed that while humour was involved in Footballers' Wives, Spooks was more passionate and very choreographed. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Rouass recalled one of the scenes; [...] "there's one scene where we get together in the kitchen and the director was like, 'Come on, let's be honest, you haven't seen each other for years, you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all romantic, you're going to shag her on the table.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The network had {{initially}} planned to place Star Trek in the 7:30pm Monday-night time slot freed up by The Man from U.N.C.L.E. completing its run. Instead, the enraged George Schlatter forced the network to insert Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In into the slot, and Roddenberry's series {{was moved to}} 10:00pm on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of Star Trek, although he continued to be credited as executive producer. Roddenberry cooperated with Stephen Edward Poe, writing as Stephen Whitfield, on the 1968 nonfiction book The Making of Star Trek for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: [...] "I had to get some money somewhere. I'm sure <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it from the profits of Star Trek." [...] Herbert Solow and Robert H. Justman observed that Whitfield never regretted his 50-50 deal with Roddenberry, since it gave him [...] "the opportunity {{to become the first}} chronicler of television's successful unsuccessful series." [...] Whitfield had previously been the national advertising and promotion director for model makers Aluminum Model Toys, better known as [...] "AMT", which then held the Star Trek license, and moved to run Lincoln Enterprises, Roddenberry's company set up to sell the series' merchandise.|$|E
500|$|On June 6, 1988, Donald Wildmon, {{head of the}} American Family Association (AFA), {{alleged that}} [...] "The Littlest Tramp" [...] {{depicted}} cocaine use, instigating a media frenzy.

[...] Bakshi responded, [...] "You could pick a still out of Lady and the Tramp and get the same impression. Fritz the Cat wasn't pornography. It was social commentary. This all smacks of burning books and the Third Reich. It smacks of McCarthyism. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into who sniffs what. This is lunacy!" [...] On CBS's order, Klein removed the sequence from the master broadcast footage. Wildmon claimed that the edits were [...] "a de facto admission that, indeed, Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine". Despite receiving an award from Action for Children's Television, favorable reviews, and a ranking in Time magazine's [...] "Best of '87" [...] feature, Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures was canceled by CBS following the controversy.|$|E
500|$|Due to the NHL lockout, Kariya was professionally {{inactive}} for the 2004–05 season, {{using the}} time to recover from several nagging injuries. He incorrectly predicted that the dispute would last [...] "a year-and-a-half [...] two years," [...] as the players and owners agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in July 2005. With NHL play set to resume for the 2005–06 season, Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in August 2005. Entertaining offers from 10 different teams, Kariya signed a two-year, $9 million contract with the Nashville Predators on August 5, 2005, making him the highest-paid player in team history. Four days later, he was officially introduced {{as a member of}} the Predators at a news conference. Predators General Manager David Poile heralded the acquisition as [...] "unquestionably the biggest signing in [...] club's history." [...] He ultimately chose the Predators for their style of play emphasizing skating and speed. Following the lockout, the NHL adopted several rule changes meant to benefit fast and skilled players such as Kariya. He was one of many NHL players who had publicly spoken out regarding the League's failed attempts in the past to reduce obstruction. During an earlier League-sponsored conference call with the media, Kariya criticized league rules, stating, [...] "As an offensive player, I'm going through the neutral zone, and I have a player tugging me the whole way. If I don't go down, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a call because they are not going to make the call." [...] Having come off the worst statistical season of his career in 2003–04, Kariya was admittedly looking to have a bounce-back season.|$|E

Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> past episode thirteen.

[...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Alberta's women, {{especially}} those of the UFA-affiliated United Farm Women of Alberta, were active in the province's moral reform movement.

[...] In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats, demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to the women that if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their votes to re-elect them, [...] "which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature." [...] Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum. [...] On September 17, 1915, he told UFA President James Speakman that he had given instructions for the preparation of a statute [...] "placing men and women in Alberta on the basis of absolute equality so far as Provincial matters are concerned." [...] True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections.
