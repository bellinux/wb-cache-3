40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that, in a restricted world of just two countries and two commodities, any feasible <b>non-distorting</b> international transfer can {{be replaced by a}} pair of individually distorting but collectively <b>non-distorting</b> equivalent import duties. In recent years it has sometimes been suggested that equivalence persists in broader contexts and there have been two attempts to provide interesting sufficient conditions for equivalence. Our purpose is three-fold. We first note that the sufficient conditions so far provided relate to the equilibrium values of endogenous variables (like prices) rather than to the given values of exogenous variables (like endowments, technologies and preferences) and that conditions of the former kind may be difficult to empirically justify. It is then shown, by means of a robust example with conditions imposed on exogenous variables only, that equivalence cannot be relied upon when there are more than two countries, even when the countries have no extraordinary features. Finally, we emphasize some of the difficulties in implementing equivalent tariffs even when they do exist. 15 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first case}} of NSRED was {{reported}} in 1955, {{but over the next}} thirty-six years, only nine more reports were made of this syndrome. Seven of these reports were single-case studies and the other two instances were seen during objective sleep studies, all done by psychiatrists and doctors. [...] Schenck and Mahowald were the first to a major study on this disorder. They started their study of NSRED in 1985 and continued until 1993 with several cases among a total of 38 other various sleep-related disorders. Many of the cases they observed had symptoms that overlapped with those of NES, but this study was the first to discover that NSRED was different from NES in the fact that those suffering from NSRED were either partially or completely unaware of their actions at night while those with NES were aware. [...] Schenck and Mahowald also discovered that none of the patients had any eating instability before their problems at night while sleeping. In their 1993 report, they summarized the major findings with the idea that women encompass at least two thirds of the patients and that the majority of these patients had become overweight. They also discovered that while the patients’ night-eating normally started during early adulthood, this wasn’t always the case as it started as early as childhood to as late as middle adulthood. These patients not only had NSRED, but many of them had also been suffering from other nighttime behaviors such as sleep terrors for several years. [...] This revolutionized the way people saw NSRED.With the technological age growing and more people becoming obese, Schenck and Mahowald’s discovery of NSRED causing a large weight increase helped doctors more easily identify this disorder. As seen in Table 1 below, almost half of Schenck and Mahowald’s patients were significantly obese. According to body mass index’s criteria, no patient was emaciated. Schenck and Mahowald said, “virtually all patients had accurate <b>non-distorted</b> appraisals of their body size, shape, and weight. Furthermore, unlike the patients in Stunkard's series, none of our patients had problematic eating in the evening between dinner and bedtime; sleep onset insomnia was not present; and sleep latency was usually brief, apart from several patients with RLS.” [...] After realizing what was wrong with them, many of Schenck and Mahowald’s patients with NSRED restricted their day eating and over exercised. This table summary identifies the first initial findings concerning NSRED, and it shows how NSRED is a random malady that affects many different types of people in individual ways.|$|E
