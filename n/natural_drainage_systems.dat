5000|$|King County, Washington, US, has two {{plans to}} help improve CSO impacts on the environment: CSO Long-term Control Plan and the Integrated Plan Alternative. The Integrated Plan {{presents}} management of both runoff and sewage overflow, while the Long-term Control Plan focuses on decreasing sewage overflow. At various locations, King County monitors and assesses the water quality at CSO outfall locations. Between 1979 and 2012 King County working with the City of Seattle {{has been able to}} decrease CSO by about 1.5 billion gallons.The Integrated Plan Alternative is implemented by Seattle Public Utilities and expected to be completed by 2025. [...] The purpose of the plan is to reduce pollutants entering the water. It has suggested three methods: (1) increasing the number of streets that are swept; (2) build a water quality facility in South Park to remove pollutants; and (3) maintaining existing rain gardens and/or <b>natural</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems.</b> The CSO Long-term Control Plan is to be completed by 2030. There are four main strategies in the plan to decrease CSO impact on the environment: (1) underground storage tanks/tunnel; (2) Wet Weather treatment stations; (3) Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI); and (4) repairing/replacing existing outfalls/pipes. Underground storage tanks/tunnels are being built in North Beach, Magnolia, West Seattle, and Rainer Valley. Wet Weather treatment stations are being built in Elliot West and Henderson/MLK. GSI are being built at Barton, Highland Park, and South Green Park. At Salmon Bay (Ballard) and Leschi (Lake Washington) old outfalls and pipes are being replaced or repaired. The underground storage tank in Magnolia will be able to hold 1.5 million gallon during CSO events, which will eventually flow to the CSO treatment center in Smith Cove. The architecture of the facility was structured to collect and filter runoff by creating a rain garden. It helps clean water and provides habitat for wildlife such as birds, bees, and butterflies.|$|E

30|$|In {{common with}} most {{developing}} countries experiencing high food insecurity levels, the Malawi government intensified its irrigation development plans {{especially in the}} Lower Shire Valley region where surface water resources are in abundance. All the developed irrigation systems in the region depend on <b>natural</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> to manage both the salinity and water table problems. However, despite notable successes of the continued irrigation development in the region, information {{on the performance of}} these irrigation schemes, with more emphasis on preventing irrigation-induced soil salinization, is still not very clear. Reversing the effects of salinization can be very expensive; hence constant soil and irrigation water salinity monitoring is very important. Such analyses assist in diagnosing the soil salinization problem before the problem gets out of hand and taking steps to manage such problems. In addition, the information on changes of irrigation water and soil salinity level with time is necessary when recommending changes in the cropping system to match with both the irrigation water and soil salinity levels. This study was therefore conducted to assess the level of irrigation-induced soil salinization at a communally managed irrigation scheme in the Lower Shire Valley region of Malawi to recommend if there was a need to change or maintain the cropping system at the scheme.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Floods {{constitute}} the major disaster affecting {{many countries in}} the world year after year. They are inevitable natural phenomena occurring {{from time to time in}} all rivers and <b>natural</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems,</b> which not only damage lives, natural resources and environment, but also cause tremendous losses in the economy and health sectors. In this study an attempt has been made to develop an integrated methodology for flood mapping using satellite images, Geographic Information System (GIS) and Hydrodynamic modeling for the September 2003 flood incidence in Puri District, Orissa in India. Analysis from RADARSAT data by visual interpretation and digital interpretation portrays quite a reliable and stable inundation extent. A comparative analysis of the inundation extent was done and calculated in the flood ravaged area. Comparison of flood inundation maps has been made between the MIKE 11 model output and the degrees of flooding which was detected by RADARSAT imagery. Based on the DN values of the RADARSAT imageries a model was developed to generate the condition to determine the flood pixel values and non-flood pixel values by using the ERDAS Imagery itself and ultimately, categorised into three as Deep, Moderate and Shallow floods. It is hoped that the use of GIS will provide supplementary data in Hydrology for such analysis and will lead to easier and better interpretation and understanding of flood phenomena and characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Stormwater {{quality and}} {{quantity}} were investigated in urbanized catchments in the Pipers Creek watershed in North Seattle in order to characterize existing rates and processes of stormwater runoff in areas of moderate-density residential development. Hydrologic monitoring and water-quality sampling during storm events were performed {{as part of this}} project from fall 2002 through spring 2004. Results of the sampling program indicate that concentrations of total and dissolved metals, total suspended solids, nutrients, total petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, herbicides, and E. coli and fecal coliform bacteria present in the runoff from these areas are significant, especially because they represent {{only a fraction of the}} total pollutant loading experienced by the receiving stream. Detailed analysis of heavy metal concentrations, total suspended solids concentrations, and concentrations of solids in the clay and silt size ranges has allowed for better understanding of how solids and metals interact in an urban stormwater environment. This research highlights the importance of mitigating the impacts that urban development has had on the runoff from these catchments, given the regional goal of improved instream aquatic conditions for native biota, particularly salmon. This research is part of the City of Seattle's <b>Natural</b> <b>Drainage</b> <b>Systems</b> project, which has been responsible for several stormwater management projects already constructed within the Pipers Creek watershed. As additional projects are implemented in the coming years, results from this research will allow for a comparison of pre- and post-improvement stormwater runoff conditions. This should document the effectiveness of these various stormwater management techniques on alleviating the effects of urbanization, both in the catchments themselves and on downstream natural systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Population {{growth in}} urban and sub-urban areas imposes {{increasing}} pressure on stream ecosystems. The "Urban Stream Syndrome" explains the observed negative trends in stream conditions associated with increasingly urbanized watersheds. Urban planners are challenged with addressing increased {{growth and development}} while also protecting critical areas such as streams and rivers that provide many services to urban dwellers as well as crucial habitat to fish and wildlife. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify which patterns and characteristics of urban development play a role in stream health and might be managed by local planners. Available data for an index of macroinvertebrate communities, the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (BIBI), were used to assess stream health in twenty-two moderately-urbanized drainage basins (13 to 15 percent impervious area) in the Puget Sound lowlands. Land cover patterns in the basin and the riparian area (100 m) were calculated using Fragstats v 4 and correlated with stream BIBI score and the metrics that comprise the score. I assess the correlations between infrastructure intensity (road density, number of road crossings, and number of stormwater outfalls) and these response variables. The selected landscape metrics did not explain the variability in the BIBI score. The values in this study may have been within the natural range of variation of the BIBI, and possibly the index only provides a coarse level of information about stream condition. Urban patch density was positively correlated to intolerant taxa richness. Number of road crossings and number of stormwater outfalls were negatively related to intolerant richness. No metrics were related to riparian land cover composition or configuration. These findings show that more dispersed urban land are associated with less disturbance in macroinvertebrate assemblages, as well as fewer road crossings and fewer stormwater outfalls. Planners interested in maintaining stream biological integrity should focus on maintaining patchier development patterns, improving road/stream crossings, and shifting from traditional stormwater infrastructure to more <b>natural</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|E
