5|$|A {{letter from}} Julius II to Henry VII dated 6 July 1504, remarks {{that the king}} had chosen the pope's {{cardinal}}-nephew Galeotto della Rovere as cardinal protector; the letter does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> Castellesi. della Rovere's selection was likely arranged by Gigli. Castellesi was compensated by being promoted to the wealthier See of Bath and Wells. Castellesi lost favour with the king and fled Rome until the death of Julius II.|$|E
5|$|Al-Tabari's account does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; {{focusing}} on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account is certainly based {{on the story of}} Zenobia, it is probably conflated with the story of a semi-legendary nomadic Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba' fortress was probably Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.|$|E

5|$|In 1525, the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés passed {{within a}} few {{kilometres}} of the ruins of Tikal but did <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> them in his letters.

5|$|In {{the early}} medieval period, {{large-scale}} conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and {{large numbers of}} converts are recorded {{within a year of}} the mission's arrival in Kent. By 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A late medieval tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler Thomas Elmham, gives the date of the king's conversion as Whit Sunday, or 2June 597; {{there is no reason to}} doubt this date, but there is no other evidence for it. A letter of Gregory's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598 mentions the number of converts made, but does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> any baptism of the king in 597, although it is clear that by 601 he had been converted. The royal baptism probably took place at Canterbury but Bede does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> the location.|$|E

Tacitus does <b>not</b> <b>mention</b> who controlled {{other areas of the}} province.|$|E

5|$|On December 19, 2006, a {{large white}} plume of {{condensing}} steam was observed, leading some media people to assume {{there had been a}} small eruption.
