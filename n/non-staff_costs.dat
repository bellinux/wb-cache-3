40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{costs of}} medical {{research}} are a concern. Clinical Trials Units (CTUs) need {{to better understand}} variations in the costs of their activities. METHODS: Representatives of ten CTUs and two grant-awarding bodies pooled their experiences in discussions over 1. 5 years. Five of the CTUs provided estimates of, and written justification for, costs associated with CTU activities required to implement an identical protocol. The protocol described a 5. 5 -year, nonpharmacological randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at 20 centres. Direct and indirect costs, the number of full time equivalents (FTEs) and the FTEs attracting overheads were compared and qualitative methods (unstructured interviews and thematic analysis) were used to interpret the results. Four {{members of the group}} (funding-body representatives or award panel members) reviewed the justification statements for transparency and information content. Separately, 163 activities common to trials were assigned to roles used by nine CTUs; the consistency of role delineation was assessed by Cohen's κ. RESULTS: Median full economic cost of CTU activities was £ 769, 637 (range: £ 661, 112 to £ 1, 383, 323). Indirect costs varied considerably, accounting for between 15 % and 59 % (median 35 %) of the full economic cost of the grant. Excluding one CTU, which used external statisticians, the total number of FTEs ranged from 2. 0 to 3. 0; total FTEs attracting overheads ranged from 0. 3 to 2. 0. Variation in directly incurred staff costs depended on whether CTUs: supported particular roles from core funding rather than grants; opted not to cost certain activities into the grant; assigned clerical or data management tasks to research or administrative staff; employed extensive on-site monitoring strategies (also the main source of variation in <b>non-staff</b> <b>costs).</b> Funders preferred written justifications of costs that described both FTEs and indicative tasks for funded roles, with itemised <b>non-staff</b> <b>costs.</b> Consistency in role delineation was fair (κ[*]=[*] 0. 21 - 0. 40) for statisticians/data managers and poor for other roles (κ[*]<[*] 0. 20). CONCLUSIONS: Some variation in costs is due to factors outside the control of CTUs such as access to core funding and levels of indirect costs levied by host institutions. Research is needed on strategies to control costs appropriately, especially the implementation of risk-based monitoring strategies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Many {{communities}} {{are in the}} process of developing or implementing CSO/SSO Control Plans. An important aspect of this process is the identification of the staffing and associated cost of the various types of controls that will eventually make up the Control Plan. Historically, the development of these Plans have directly considered the capital costs of the various control options and have given the operations and maintenance costs associated with the various types of controls only qualitative consideration. Without quantitative consideration of both the capital costs and the operations and maintenance costs a total low cost Control Plan will not be achieved. This paper provides a quantitative process to include both staff and <b>non-staff</b> <b>costs</b> of operations and maintenance associated with the following five common CSO/SSO controls: in-system storage; vortex with disinfection; screening with disinfection; retention treatment basin; and, tunnel. The paper also provides guidance on the staffing of these control facilities and can be used by communities that have already implemented control plans to benchmark operations and maintenance staffing and costs associated with those facilities...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a more {{streamlined}} review process than previous Programme Development Groups (PDG). Nevertheless, members of the PDG were able to provide expert analysis and input covering a wide spectrum of the work of the Marine, Coastal and Hydrocarbons Programme (MCHP). The PDG considered the Terms of Reference and determined the following: • The PDG welcomes the close links between the commissioned and co-funded research and the core (SB funded) science programme, which is focused on the objectives outlined in the BGS 2005 - 10 Programme. Careful planning is required to ensure that the Programme maintains flexibility to respond to external factors, but maintains a broad focus on the underlying scientific objectives. • The excellent links with the oil industry and DTI demonstrate a programme aligned to the needs of industry and government, and the plan to develop a new focus on the mature areas of the North Sea is welcomed. The increasing presence of new, smaller oil companies active in the UK will require different approaches to generate aligned funding. Future hydrocarbon research will require careful analysis of funding opportunities. • The development of operations to support a new generation of detailed marine and coastal mapping and modelling based on collaboration with other research institutes, and the collection and interpretation of multibeam data is supported. This approach is directly in line with the policy to improve understanding of the marine environment in terms of ecosystems and Government policy on marine monitoring. Data already collected clearly shows the potential for new scientific discoveries and a step-change in our understanding of marine geology. • The PDG endorses the integrated approach to the marine and coastal zone component of the programme. It is recognised that co-funded and commissioned research in the coastal area is less than in the marine and hydrocarbons areas. The number of experienced, high quality coastal geoscientists within BGS is very small and this is a factor in future development of the BGS coastal geoscience profile. Consideration should be given to establishing a distinctive, well-funded sub-programme to focus on coastal processes, particularly addressing erosion, sea level rise, and climate change to complement and strengthen the existing programme. • There is significant progress on developing a strategy for surveying the ‘white ribbon’ and a new national sea-bed-mapping programme based on multibeam data. Closer links with other marine organisations, such as CEFAS and UKHO are being developed and the participation in joint cruises (e. g. DTI SEAs, JNCC SAC research) is welcomed. The case for an integrated approach to marine mapping is strong, but continual effort and support will be required to raise funding for a successful national mapping programme. • The development of Lithoframe 3 D modelling in the coastal and offshore areas is still immature. The PDG supports the completion of the current series of offshore regional reports as a precursor to the development of basinwide and national 3 D models. BGS is in a unique position to develop such models on a national scale. Detailed models, for example, in estuaries and within the shallow section below the sea-bed should be encouraged. • Advances in marine geology and geophysics are frequently technologically led, and it is important to maintain and develop state-of-the art equipment and capability. The marine operations capability has a world-recognised position in shallow coring and management of major operations. The development of multibeam acquisition and interpretation skills is crucial to the programme, but there are also opportunities to develop expertise in additional geophysical techniques such as marine LIDAR, AUV technologies and improved shallow-water high-resolution seismic methods. • Collaboration with other organisations is vital and development of data-sharing models with key organisations (such as UKHO, CEFAS and JNCC) should be further developed to maintain access to comprehensive data sources. BGS participation in PILOT initiatives (such as DEAL) and MDIP (Marine Data Information Partnership) is encouraged. • MCHP should continue to develop links with universities, and the PDG welcomes the increasing number of joint-PhD and MSc students within a wide range of universities. Opportunities to develop closer links with universities through joint research bids to NERC and other funding bodies, and through marine pooling initiatives in Scotland are encouraged. • MCHP has an excellent track record of international collaboration through EU projects, collaborative projects with other geological surveys, and commissioned research within the hydrocarbons sector. • The PDG feels strongly that the SB funding for the MCHP is insufficient given the size and strategic importance of the UKCS and coastal zone. The staff have an excellent track record of attracting external funding to enhance the scientific programme but higher baseline funding is needed, particularly to cover operational survey (<b>non-staff)</b> <b>costs.</b> It is not the place of this PDG to argue for a switch of resources within BGS, however, the PDG actively encourages the Programme to seek additional funding from NERC through the FAB process, as well as from external sources. There are a multitude of players in the marine environment and BGS has a key role to play in co-ordinating activities...|$|E
40|$|School funding {{per pupil}} {{increased}} substantially between 1999 - 00 and 2012 - 13 in England. It also became more varied across schools {{with higher levels}} of funds targeted at more deprived schools. Real-terms increases in funding per pupil were much larger for the most deprived group of primary and secondary schools (83 % and 93 %, respectively) as compared with the least deprived primary and secondary schools (56 % and 59 %). In this paper, we decompose these increases in funding per pupil into the amount explained by quantities of different types of staff per pupil, their price and changes in <b>non-staffing</b> <b>costs.</b> We find that some of these increases in funding per pupil translated into larger numbers of teachers per pupil and a higher real-terms cost per teacher (about 20 - 30 % of the increase in funding per pupil). However, a much larger portion of the increases in funding can be accounted for by higher levels and increased variation in the use of teaching assistants (largely lower skilled staff), other non-teaching staff and non-staff inputs (such as learning resources, professional services and energy). Furthermore, there is also evidence to suggest that differences in expenditure between the most and least deprived schools are smaller than differences in funding, with more deprived secondary schools running slightly larger surpluses. Increased use of non-teaching staff was partly an intended policy shift by policymakers at the time. However, we argue that the scale of the changes in inputs are more likely to reflect rigidities, the flexibility of contracts and uncertainty over future funding allocations...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{treatment}} {{is the most}} common form of healthcare intervention and represents the highest <b>non-staff</b> revenue <b>cost</b> in the UK National Health Service (NHS). The annual drugs bill in the UK equates to just about 10 % of NHS expenditure (McKee, 2012). Demand for NHS healthcare is effectively infinite (Lodge and Bamford, 2008); there are constant efforts to increase capacity and operational budgets are constrained. One area where hospital pharmacies are looking for cost saving and better services is through improving their Supply Chain Management (SCM) (AT Kearney, 2009). However, they have not only to manage the forward components of the logistics process to minimise waste and maximise patient wellbeing, but to manage the reverse components as well (Jamali et al., 2010). Success in this area can be realised through the application of a Lean Philosophy which focuses on eliminating waste by defining value (Brandao, 2009) ...|$|R
