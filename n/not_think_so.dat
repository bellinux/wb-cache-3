5|$|Yuri, {{also known}} as , has a {{determined}} personality but is secretly very sensitive and protective. She invites Otonashi to join the SSS, an organization she founded and leads which fights against God. She is smart and decisive when making operations and decisions. She carries a silver Beretta 92. Not only is she skilled with a gun, but she is also capable in close range hand-to-hand combat, which is shown when she fends off Angel's hand sonic with a combat knife. She vowed to fight against God after her three younger siblings were murdered by burglars looking for valuables and never forgave herself for failing to prevent their deaths. She is an effective leader, but does <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> She regrets even fighting with Kanade later in the story, because she feels {{she could have been}} great friends with her. She disappears after the graduation ceremony.|$|E

However, half of participants opined the royal house was too expensive, whilst 42% did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions an extramarital affair may incur {{unexpected}} financial costs. In Australia, for example, {{affairs of}} two or more years duration can be deemed a de facto relationship, exposing the married cheater to financial claims in the Family Court on their superannuation savings, income and property. A de facto relationship may exist even when the partners do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> It is the Court that will define when it began and ended, based on the evidence.

25|$|Peter May took a well-deserved holiday {{with his}} fiancée, though the press did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> and Colin Cowdrey {{led the team}} against the weak Victorian team. He lost the toss {{and was forced to}} field in the 109°F/43°C heat and limited the fast bowlers Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman and Peter Loader to two over spells. Victoria did quite well and reached 270/5 in the day. A 21-year-old Bill Lawry opened the batting and made a slow 24 until he was bowled by Ted Dexter, the footballer Neil Crompton hit 73, Lindsay Hassett's nephew John Shaw 94 and Jack Potter 47. Trueman took 5/42 to dismiss Crompton and Shaw and {{returned}} in the morning to wrap up the innings for 286. The MCC responded poorly with 31/4, but Colin Cowdrey stroked 84 and Willie Watson 141 in a stand of 169. Watson looked much like his old self and batted with the tail, especially John Mortimore (32) and they finished on 313, the paceman Colin Guest taking 3/39. Victoria struggled in their second innings as Tyson (3/40) and Loader (3/29) found their form. Only Crompton (64) passed 22 and they were all out for 180. The MCC players were helped when the temperature dropped to 89°F/32°C half-way through the day. While knocking off the 156/1 to win Arthur Milton received a nasty ball on his glove which re-fractured his broken finger and he retired hurt for 35. Peter Richardson made 65 and 120 was added before the first wicket fell. Raman Subba Row and Ted Dexter both made 21 not out and the MCC won by 9 wickets.|$|E
500|$|One critic {{said that}} Benedict Arnold was a [...] "mean mercenary, who, having adopted {{a cause for}} the sake of plunder, quits it when convicted of that charge." [...] In turning him down for an East India Company posting, George Johnstone wrote, [...] "Although I am {{satisfied}} with the purity of your conduct, the generality do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> While this is the case, no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{selected}} a spontaneous {{joke about the}} South Pole made by an audience member, Khush Klare, as the [...] "undoubted highlight", having raised the loudest cheer from the audience. Klare, the son of Indian parents who migrated to Britain in the 1960s, had suggested collecting money for Griffin to be deported to the South Pole, as [...] "it's a colourless landscape that will suit you fine". Klare said that while he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> at first, in retrospect he thought that Question Time was the right platform for Griffin.|$|E

500|$|A {{hearing was}} held before Ashbrook's {{committee}} on January 13. [...] Originally, the bill called for mintage of 100,000 silver dollars in commemoration of McKinley, {{but at the}} hearing, Butler requested that they be gold instead, stating, [...] "if you will recall the fact, McKinley was elected in 1896 mainly {{on the question of}} the gold standard." [...] The gold dollar had not been struck as a circulating coin since 1889. [...] Asked a question from New York Congressman James W. Husted as to whether a gold dollar would be too small to be a souvenir, Butler responded, [...] "No; I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> I think, on the other hand, a silver dollar might be too large. I think we can dispose of gold dollars very much easier. Mr. Husted, and you know gold dollars are rather scarce just now." [...] Ashbrook agreed, and stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Arnold then {{applied to}} {{accompany}} General Carleton, {{who was going}} to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. [...] Other attempts failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next few years, and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. [...] His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism. [...] One particularly harsh critic said that Arnold was a [...] "mean mercenary, who, having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder, quits it when convicted of that charge." [...] In turning him down for an East India Company posting, George Johnstone wrote, [...] "Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct, the generality do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> [...] While this is the case, no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{relation}} to the stringency of the tests, they appear to adopt Judicial Commissioner Phang's view that since the concept of [...] "likelihood" [...] entails the lower standard of [...] "possibility" [...] as opposed to [...] "probability", {{the gap between the}} real likelihood and reasonable suspicion tests has been narrowed significantly. Regarding the perspective of the inquiry, as both tests are premised on an objective basis, Leo and Chen also appear to agree with the position that the court personifies the reasonable man, as stated in Gough and endorsed in Tang Kin Hwa. In addition, although the reasonable suspicion test is commonly thought to be applied {{from the perspective of the}} public, it may not actually reflect the public view accurately. With selective reporting and word-of-mouth discussions which sensationalize events, members of the public may still consider that there was a possibility of bias even though a reasonable member of the public who was apprised of all the relevant facts would <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On May 1, 1989, {{real estate}} magnate Donald Trump {{called for the}} return of the death penalty when he took out full-page {{advertisements}} in all four of the city's major newspapers. Trump said he wanted the criminals of every age who were accused of beating and raping a jogger in Central Park 12 days earlier to be afraid. The advertisement, which cost an estimated $85,000, said, in part, [...] "Mayor Koch has stated that hate and rancor should be removed from our hearts. I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer ... Yes, Mayor Koch, I want to hate these murderers and I always will. ... How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed misfits? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS!" [...] In a 1989 interview with CNN, Trump said to Larry King: [...] "The problem with our society is the victim has absolutely no rights and the criminal has unbelievable rights" [...] and that [...] "maybe hate is what we need if we're gonna get something done." ...|$|E

2500|$|At this time, Rouvas {{became more}} reclusive and guarded about his {{personal}} life. When he was called for military service in 1994 {{he asked for a}} delay, since his service would coincide with the release of Aima, Dakrya & Idrotas; the request was denied, although other artists had been able to delay their service for career reasons. Although it was initially thought that Rouvas did not want to leave the spotlight when his career was growing, he claimed his reluctance to serve was due to agoraphobia. His claims were met with astonishment; media outlets remarked that agoraphobia was an odd condition for an entertainer, and critics accused him of draft dodging. The singer was taken to the Penteli psychiatric hospital for an evaluation, and it was widely reported that he had attempted suicide. After his release Rouvas fulfilled his military service under psychiatric care; he was required to remove his earring and cut his long hair, which is featured in the video for [...] "Aima, Dakrya & Idrotas". During his service, he was pestered by paparazzi. Psinakis accused Rouvas' psychiatrist of pouring psychotropic drugs into Rouvas' alcoholic beverages because of a previous quarrel. The singer discussed his military service in a wide-ranging interview with Nico Mastorakis. When asked if he was suicidal Rouvas said he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> but he was so drugged {{at the time of the}} emergency call that he did not recall the exact events; he confirmed that he tried to desert by climbing under a Jeep and attaching himself to its undercarriage.|$|E
60|$|A {{railway station}} is an admirable place, {{although}} Ruskin {{did not think}} so; he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> because he himself was even more modern than the railway station.
