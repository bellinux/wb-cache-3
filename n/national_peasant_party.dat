5000|$|He {{became a}} member of the {{parliament}} of Hungary in 1945, and one of the leaders of the left-wing <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party.</b> He withdrew from public life in 1947 as the communist takeover of government was approaching. He was a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from 1945 to 1949. He directed and edited the review [...] from 1946 to 1949.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, he {{was elected}} to the Romanian Senate as a Constanţa County Senator on a <b>National</b> <b>Peasants</b> <b>Party</b> ticket, but {{resigned}} in 1998 and in 2000 {{he was elected}} once again, this time in Bistriţa-Năsăud County as a member of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). In 2003, he resigned from PSD and joined the Greater Romania Party, running for the Senate in Suceava County in 2004.|$|R
50|$|He {{subsequently}} {{worked as}} a journalist, first writing a fashionable social column at Gazeta de seară, then working as a proofreader at Adevărul Literar Brucan met Aurel Alicu, {{a leader of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> Youth, with whom he started in 1937 a weekly called Dacia Nouă, having writers from both the traditional parties (National Liberal and <b>National</b> <b>Peasants</b> <b>Party)</b> and from left-wing circles (Miron Constantinescu, Corneliu Mănescu, Roman Moldovan and Victor Iliu). The newspaper was published for a year, until the Octavian Goga government shut it down.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{his return}} to Romania, Irimescu, an independent, was {{appointed}} director of the Gas and Electricity Works of Bucharest. In August 1932, he was named Minister of the Air Forces in the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod <b>National</b> <b>Peasants</b> <b>Party</b> cabinet, {{with the expectation that}} he would upgrade and modernize his branch of the military. Additionally, he served as interim Minister of War for a week in August-September 1937, in Gheorghe Tătărescus National Liberal Party cabinet.|$|R
5000|$|Iván Boldizsár {{successfully}} {{made his way}} to the new, pro-Soviet, [...] "leftist" [...] elite, thanks to his pre-war work and connections. He became a member of the National Assembly in 1945, as a delegate of the left-wing, agrarian <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party</b> and he cooperated well with the Communist Party. He was the member of the Hungarian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference and allegedly he was an informant for the Soviets.|$|E
50|$|The Communist Party {{presented}} an alternative plan, through which King Michael, {{who was the}} commander-in-chief, would order the weapons to be turned against Nazi Germany and Antonescu would be summoned to the palace, ordered to sign an armistice with the Allies and, if he refused, be arrested on the spot. After this, a coalition government of the National Democratic Bloc (the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party,</b> the National Liberal Party, the Social Democratic Party and the Romanian Communist Party) would take power.|$|E
50|$|On 1 December 1938, {{he became}} a member of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary. In 1945 he joined the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party</b> (Nemzeti Parasztpárt) and was elected to their {{executive}} committee. In 1947 he resigned from the party and left Hungary in November 1948. From then on he lived in exile. After arriving in Switzerland, in the summer of 1949 he earned his living in various companies as a labourer. In the further course of his emigration, József Molnár worked for several years as a political commentator at Radio Free Europe. He went on to New York and back again to Europe.|$|E
5000|$|This {{election}} {{marked the}} onset of 40 years of undisguised Communist rule in Hungary. Nonetheless, the government formed after the election was still nominally a coalition. The Smallholders received the Ministries of Trade and Religion and Education {{in addition to the}} premiership, and the <b>National</b> <b>Peasants</b> <b>Party</b> receiving Agriculture and Construction. After the election, the Front's local committees dissolved themselves, and with them the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> and Independent Smallholder local organs, although no law or ordinance was ever passed abolishing them. [...] At this time, Dobi joined the Communists.|$|R
50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Romania in July 1932. The Chamber of Deputies was elected on 17 July, whilst the Senate was elected in three stages on 20, 24 and 26 July. The result was {{a victory for the}} National Peasants' Party-German Party alliance, which won 274 of the 387 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 104 of the 113 seats in the Senate elected through universal male vote. Of the 274 Chamber seats, 265 were taken by the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant's</b> <b>Party</b> and nine by the German Party.|$|R
25|$|The {{actions taken}} against Pătrășcanu and others {{signaled}} {{the start of}} a wave of arrests and prison sentences, including that of his wife, {{as well as those of}} Harry Brauner, Lena Constante, Petre Pandrea (who was Pătrășcanu's brother-in-law), Herant Torosian, Mocsony Stârcea, Calmanovici, Victoria Sârbu (who had been Ștefan Foriș's lover), and Alexandru Ștefănescu. In preparation for the trial, the Securitate organized violent interrogations of political detainees (among others, the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party's</b> Corneliu Coposu and the Liberal politician Bebe Brătianu) or suspects (Gheorghe Tătărescu, who testified against Pătrășcanu and was the target of a sharp rebuke from the latter).|$|R
50|$|The National Liberal Party largely {{served as}} a {{political}} vehicle for {{the interests of the}} powerful Brătianu family. After the National Liberal Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu died in 1927, the Brătianus were unable to agree upon a successor, which caused the National Liberals to fall into decline. In the 1928 elections, the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party</b> under Iuliu Maniu won a resounding victory, taking 78% of the vote. As the chief of the Regency Council that governed for King Michael, Prince Nicolae was known to be friendly with the National Liberals, thus the new prime minister was determined to dispose of the regency council by bringing back Carol.|$|E
50|$|Anton Crihan {{served as}} Member of Sfatul Ţării (1917-1918), the Parliament of Romania, and the Government of Romania. After World War I and the Communist {{revolution}} in Russia, Dr. Crihan, {{was among the}} handful of campaigners who succeeded in annexing most of Bessarabia to Romania. He became politically active in Romania, which was then governed by a constitutional monarchy. Trained as an economist, he served on the Central Committee of the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party,</b> was elected to several terms in Parliament and was appointed Agriculture Minister. After the Soviet occupation of Romania, Crihan fled on foot to Yugoslavia and arrived in the United States in 1949. After the Soviet takeover, Dr. Crihan went into hiding and then fled on foot. He made his way across Europe spending time in Paris to complete a PhD in Economics at the Sorbonne. He finally arrived in the United States in 1949, where he delivered lectures and wrote articles and books championing the reunification of Moldavia and Romania. Moldavia, now known as Moldova, gained independence when the Soviet Union disintegrated in late 1991.|$|E
50|$|With World War II still {{raging in}} 1944 various factions {{competing}} for current and postwar Hungarian political power sought {{to decide how}} to treat ethnic Germans. Opinions were divided, with the Hungarian Communist Party and its ally, the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party,</b> calling for the expulsion of all Germans, whereas the major democratic party, the Smallholder Party, favored only deporting former Volksbund and Waffen SS members. In May 1944, the Government announced that there was no Swabian question but only a question of German fascists. They then resolved to deport former Waffen SS soldiers and confiscate the lands {{of the members of the}} Volksbund. Shortly thereafter, however, they did ask authorization from Moscow to deport 200,000 to 250,000 ethnic Germans to the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. As this figure clearly was much greater than the number of Volksbund adherents, the issue really became one of eliminating an unwanted ethnic group rather than one of eliminating only German fascists. The German population in Hungary, however, was never subject to the same brutal persecution and excesses as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, or the former Yugoslavia.|$|E
50|$|In June 1943, at a {{time when}} troops were {{suffering}} major defeats on the Eastern Front, the PCdR proposed that all parties form a Blocul Național Democrat ("National Democratic Bloc"), in order to arrange for Romania to withdraw from its alliance with Nazi Germany. The ensuing talks were prolonged by various factors, most notably by the opposition of <b>National</b> <b>Peasants</b> <b>Party</b> leader Iuliu Maniu, who, alarmed by Soviet successes, was trying to reach a satisfactory compromise with the Western Allies (and, together with the National Liberals leader Dinu Brătianu, continued to back negotiations initiated by Antonescu and Barbu Știrbey with the United States and the United Kingdom).|$|R
50|$|In {{line with}} the Denazification process taking place in European {{countries}} formerly ruled by pro-Nazi regimes, the post-war government took steps to cleanse the police and safety services. Under pressure of the Soviets in the Ceasefire Commission, Nicolae Penescu (minister of the interior in the Sănătescu government) and Nicolae Rădescu had to kick out from the two services many agents who had been loyal to the Antonescu dictatorship. These actions were approved by the <b>National</b> <b>Peasants</b> <b>Party</b> and the <b>National</b> Liberal Party, thinking that this would ensure a more favourable view of Romania from Moscow. Mihail Fărcășanu was a strong adversary of these actions.|$|R
50|$|Viaţa Basarabiei, founded as the {{literary}} voice of Bessarabian regionalism, was first printed in January 1932. Its first issue included a foreword by Halippa, {{in which the}} latter, previously {{a key figure in}} the 1918 union with Romania and activist of the National Moldavian Party, outlined and pledged to follow a set of political and cultural ideals. The name adopted by Halippas publication was homonymous with that of two other press organs: a newspaper published in 1907; and a daily of the <b>National</b> <b>Peasants</b> <b>Party,</b> published from 1930 to 1944. The name was also equivalent in translation to those of non-Romanian Bessarabian papers: the Russian-language Besarabskaya Zhizn (published around 1917) and the Yiddish Dos Besaraber Lebn (1918-1940).|$|R
5000|$|On 1 November, in a {{radio address}} to the Hungarian people, Nagy {{formally}} declared Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact as well as Hungary's stance of neutrality. Because it held office only ten days, the National Government had little chance to clarify its policies in detail. However, newspaper editorials at the time stressed that Hungary should be a neutral, multi-party social democracy. Many political prisoners were released, most notably Cardinal József Mindszenty. Political parties that were previously banned, such as the Independent Smallholders and the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party</b> (under the name [...] "Petőfi Party"), reappeared to join the coalition.During this time, in 1,170 communities across Hungary there were 348 cases in which revolutionary councils and protesters dismissed employees of the local administrative councils, 312 cases in which they sacked the persons in charge, and 215 cases in which they burned the local administrative files and records. In addition, in 681 communities demonstrators damaged symbols of Soviet authority such as red stars, Stalin or Lenin statues; 393 in which they damaged Soviet war memorials, and 122 communities in which book burnings took place.|$|E
5000|$|The election, by {{secret ballot}} and without census or fraud, is {{reckoned}} {{as the first}} relatively democratic election ever held in Hungary, and was certainly {{the closest thing to}} an honest election held in the country until 1990. It was also one of only two remotely free elections ever held in what would become the Soviet bloc (the other being the 1946 elections in Czechoslovakia. One author states it was [...] "generally fair, but not entirely free", as only [...] "democratic" [...] parties were allowed to compete, meaning most of the pre-war right-wing parties were excluded, as well as those parties that did not participate in the Hungarian National Independence Front, a wartime anti-fascist alliance. [...] Only the leaders of the dissolved rightist parties, SS volunteers and those interned or being prosecuted by the people's courts were barred from voting. The liberal electoral law was also supported by the Communists, who were not bothered by the failure of their proposal to field a single list of candidates {{on the part of the}} Communist-Social Democrat coalition parties, which would have ensured a majority for left-wing parties: intoxicated by their recruitment successes and misjudging the effect of the land reform on their appeal, they expected an [...] "enthralling victory" [...] (József Révai predicted winning as much as 70%). To their bitter disappointment, the result was nearly the opposite: the Independent Smallholders Party, winning the contest in all 16 districts, won 57% of the vote, the Social Democrats won slightly above and the Communists slightly below 17%, and the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party</b> just 7% (the rest going to the Citizen Democrats' Party and the new Hungarian Radical Party of Oszkár Jászi's followers).|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} {{member of the}} camarilla was Carol's mistress Magda Lupescu, whose political advice Carol greatly valued. The [...] "Red Queen," [...] as Lupescu was known to the Romanian people on {{the account of the}} color of her hair, was the most hated woman in 1930s Romania, a woman whom ordinary Romanians saw {{in the words of the}} British historian Rebecca Haynes as [...] "the embodiment of evil". Carol's ex-wife Princess Helen was widely viewed as a wronged woman, while Lupescu was seen as the femme fatale who had stolen Carol away from the loving arms of Helen. Lupescu had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, but because her father was a Jew, she was widely viewed as Jewish. Lupescu’s personality antagonized many Romanians, as she was arrogant, manipulative and extremely greedy with an insatiable taste for buying the most expensive French clothing, cosmetics and jewellery. At a time when many Romanians were suffering from the economic effects of the Great Depression, Carol’s habit of indulging Lupescu’s expensive tastes caused much resentment. Further adding to Lupescu’s immense unpopularity was her habit of exploiting her connections to the Crown to engage in dubious financial transactions that usually involved the transfer of large sums of public money into her own pocket. The contemporary view that Carol was a mere puppet of Lupescu is incorrect, however, and Lupescu's influence on political decision-making was much exaggerated at the time. Lupescu was primarily interested in enriching herself to support her extravagant lifestyle and had no real interest in politics beyond protecting her ability to engage in corruption. Unlike Carol, Lupescu took no interest in social policy or foreign affairs and was such a self-absorbed narcissist that she was unaware of just how unpopular she was with ordinary people. Carol, by contrast, was keenly interested in affairs of the state, and though he never sought to deny his relationship with Lupescu, he was careful not to display her too much in public, as he knew that this would risk making him unpopular. [...] Carol sought to play off the three major political forces in his country against each other (the National Liberals, the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party</b> and the Iron Guard) with the ultimate aim of making himself master of Romanian politics and disposing of all the political parties in Romania. Carol had no intention of permitting the Iron Guard ever to come to power, but insofar as it was a disruptive force that weakened both the National Liberals and the National Peasants, Carol welcomed its rise in the early 1930s and sought to use it for his own ends. On 30 December 1933, the Iron Guard assassinated the National Liberal Prime Minister Ion G. Duca, which led to the first of several bans placed on its political activities. The assassination of Duca, Romania's first political murder since 1862, shocked Carol, who saw the willingness of Codreanu to order the assassination of a prime minister as a sign that he was getting out of control and that he would not play the role Carol hoped for as a disruptive force threatening the National Liberals and National Peasant alike. In 1934, when Codreanu was brought to trial for ordering Duca's assassination, he used as his defense his belief that the entire Francophile elite in Romania was completely corrupt, and Duca, as a member of it, was just another corrupt National Liberal politician who deserved to die. The jury acquitted Codreanu, an act that worried Carol as it showed that Codreanu's revolutionary message was winning popular approval. In the spring of 1934, after Codreanu was acquitted, Carol, together with the Bucharest police prefect Gavrilă Marinescu and Magda Lupescu, was involved in a half-hearted plot to kill Codreanu by poisoning his coffee. The effort was abandoned before being attempted. Until 1935, Carol was a leading contributor to the [...] "Friends of the Legion," [...] a group that collected contributions to the Iron Guard. Carol only stopped contributing after Codreanu started calling Lupescu a [...] "Jewish whore" [...] (see below). In 1935, he set up a paramilitary youth organization known as Straja Țării to help counter the influence of the Iron Guard.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, Muravschi {{founded the}} <b>National</b> Christian Democratic <b>Peasants</b> <b>Party</b> of Moldova and was {{president}} of that party until 2002. It subsequently merged into the Liberal Party and then the Our Moldova Alliance in 2003.|$|R
25|$|He was {{eventually}} sentenced {{to ten years}} of hard labor. According to historian Ilarion Țiu, the trial and verdict were received with general apathy, and the only political faction believed to have organized a public rally in connection with it was the outlawed Romanian Communist Party, some of whose members gathered {{in front of the}} tribunal to express support for the conviction. The movement itself grew disorganized, and provincial bodies of the Legion came to exercise control over the center, which had been weakened by the arrests. While the political establishment's main branches welcomed the news of Codreanu's sentencing, the Iron Guard organized a retaliation attack targeting the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party's</b> Virgil Madgearu, who had become known for expressing his opposition to the movement's extremism (Madgearu managed to escape the violence unharmed).|$|R
50|$|In July 2012, former Prime Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu {{formed the}} Centre-Right Civic Initiative (ICCD).

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to reframe the {{political}} ideas Dimitrie Gusti has been expressed alongside two decades of the interwar period, through the conservative political doctrine. Dimitrie Gusti did not relate his political perspective to the conservative label. Still, his political commitments and ideas, as these have been summed up in 1932 - 1933, when he was Ministry of Public Education in a Government led by <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party,</b> allow seeing him amongst the leading personalities who has resumed the prewar conservatism in Romania. My arguments revolve around this latter thesis...|$|E
40|$|The Ploughmen Front {{represented}} {{the strongest and}} the oldest “comrade ” of the Communist Party from Romania, with {{a major role in}} the countryside communization. In general, the studies dedicated to Romania communization focused on institutionalization of the regime, liquidation of democratic order, repression, anticommunist resistance and less on the transformations undergone by the Romanian countryside. The only important issue was the agriculture collectivization. Our project takes into consideration a new approach, which is the research of the way communism became popular in the rural areas, which meant 80 % of the Romanian population, how the popularity of the historical parties was dislocated, especially the <b>National</b> <b>Peasant</b> <b>Party,</b> in these areas. The issue is extremely complex and that is why our intercession will focus on a case study: the role of procommunist propaganda organized by the Ploughmen’s Front, the main “comrade ” of the communists in communization of the rural area between 1944 and 1953...|$|E
2500|$|Late in 1949, he {{was tried}} in Cluj {{and sentenced to}} two years' imprisonment, which was {{reportedly}} a lighter sentence than expected. During the procedures, Tonegaru ridiculed the charges brought against him, addressing to his judge Zeno Barbu a promise that [...] "in the future [...] will strive to avoid the country's mountainous areas and will do most of his traveling in the fields." [...] Tonegaru and his co-defendants were chained and taken to Aiud prison, a facility housing much of Romania's former political and social elite.

2500|$|This {{amendment}} {{brought about}} the legalisation of homosexual activity in private, but continued to criminalise it in certain circumstances.

50|$|The {{political}} activity of Ungureanu after the premiersphip was intensive.
