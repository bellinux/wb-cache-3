40|$|The parity {{modulation}} of {{the ground}} state of a superconducting island is {{a direct consequence of}} the presence of the Cooper pair condensate preferring an even number of charge carriers. The addition energy of an odd, unpaired quasiparticle equals to the superconducting gap, Δ, suppressing single electron hopping in the low temperature limit. Controlling the quasiparticle occupation is of fundamental importance for superconducting qubits as single electron tunneling results in decoherence. In particular, topological quantum computation relies on the parity control and readout of Majorana bound states. Here we present parity modulation for the first time of a <b>niobium</b> titanite <b>nitride</b> (NbTiN) Cooper-pair transistor coupled to aluminium (Al) leads. We show that this circuit is compatible with the magnetic field requirement in the range of 100 mT of inducing topological superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled nanowires.

In this article we make an experimental comparison between the uniformity of NbTiN thin films produced by two DC magnetron sputtering systems with vastly different target sizes: the Nordiko 2000 equipped with a circular 100 mm diameter target, and the Evatec LLS 801 with a rectangular target of 127 mm x 444. 5 mm. In addition to the films deposited staticly in both systems, we have also deposited films in the LLS 801 while shuttling the substrate {{in front of the}} target, with the aim of further enhancing the uniformity. Among these three setups, the LLS 801 system with substrate shuttling has yielded the highest uniformity in film thickness (+/- 2 %), effective resistivity (decreasing by 5 % from center to edge), and superconducting critical temperature (T_c = 15. 0 K - 15. 3 K) over a 100 mm diameter wafer. However, the shuttling appears to increase the resistivity by almost a factor of 2 compared to static deposition. Surface SEM inspections suggest that the shuttling could have induced a different mode of microstructural film growth.
