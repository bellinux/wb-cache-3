40|$|Abstract. The 2005 dengue {{outbreak}} in Singapore cumulated in> 14, 000 cases and 27 reported dengue deaths. We fit the single-phase Richards model to weekly dengue <b>notification</b> <b>numbers</b> {{to detect the}} turning point for the outbreak, which enables us to study the impact of intervention measures relating to the turning point. The results indicate that turning point had most likely occurred in late August or early September, before large-scale intervention measures were implemented. The “initial ” reproduction number for the outbreak {{is estimated to be}} ~ 1. 89 – 2. 23 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 15 – 3. 00). One of the lessons learned from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak is that multiple phases of outbreak were observed in some affected countries when efforts to intensify intervention or to sustain vigilance were compromised. Intensive and continuing efforts in the implementation of control measures are essential in reducing further dengue occurrences during any resurgence of dengue...|$|R
40|$|Dengue {{occurred}} sporadically in Bangladesh from 1964 until a large {{epidemic in}} 2000 established the virus. We trace dengue {{from the time}} it was first identified in Bangladesh and identify factors favourable to future dengue haemorrhagic fever epidemics. The epidemic in 2000 was likely due to introduction of a dengue virus strain from a nearby endemic country, probably Thailand. Cessation of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) spraying, climatic, socio-demographic, and lifestyle factors also contributed to epidemic transmission. The largest number of cases was notified in 2002 and since then reported outbreaks have generally declined, although with increased notifications in alternate years. The apparent decline might be partially due to public awareness with consequent reduction in mosquito breeding and increased prevalence of immunity. However, passive hospital-based surveillance has changed with mandatory serological confirmation now required for case reporting. Further, a large number of cases remain undetected because only patients with severe dengue require hospitalisation. Thus, the reduction in <b>notification</b> <b>numbers</b> may be an artefact of the surveillance system. Indeed, population-based serological survey indicates that dengue transmission continues to be common. In the future, the absence of active interventions, unplanned urbanisation, environmental deterioration, increasing population mobility, and economic factors will heighten dengue risk. Projected increases in temperature and rainfall may exacerbate this...|$|R

We investigated the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii, the Q fever agent, in a Queensland sample population. Notification data (N = 6425) from 1984 - 2008 were collated, identifying high risk areas of Q fever exposure. Of these 177 {{were recorded in}} children. Serum samples were collected from Queensland and screened using both an immunoflourescence assay at 1 : 10 dilution and a commercially available ELISA kit. Results were collated based on age, geographical location and sex. From 1988 Queensland samples screened, 103 were identified as Q fever IgG-positive, giving a seroprevalence of 5. 2 % (95 % CI 4. 3 - 6. 2 %). Seroprevalence in the rural/remote population was 5. 3 % (95 % CI 4. 6 - 6. 6 %), and the metropolitan Brisbane population, which is considered not at risk, was 5. 0 % (95 % CI 3. 7 - 6. 7 %). Sixty-three seropositive males and 40 females were identified, along {{with an increase in}} seropositivity with increasing age. The seropositivity of children was 1. 3 % (95 % CI 0. 7 - 2. 3 %) from 844 samples.

We have previously shown seroprevalence in Queensland metropolitan regions is approaching that of rural areas. This {{study investigated the}} presence of nucleic acid from Coxiella burnetii, the agent responsible for Q fever, {{in a number of}} animal and environmental samples collected throughout Queensland, to identify potential sources of human infection. Samples were collected from 129 geographical locations and included urine, faeces and whole blood from 22 different animal species; 45 ticks were removed from two species, canines and possums; 151 soil samples; 72 atmospheric dust samples collected from two locations and 50 dust swabs collected from domestic vacuum cleaners. PCR testing was performed targeting the IS 1111 and COM 1 genes for the specific detection of C. burnetii DNA. There were 85 detections from 1318 animal samples, giving a detection rate for each sample type ranging from 2. 1 to 6. 8 %. Equine samples produced a detection rate of 11. 9 %, whilst feline and canine samples showed detection rates of 7. 8 % and 5. 2 %, respectively. Native animals had varying detection rates: pooled urines from flying foxes had 7. 8 %, whilst koalas had 5. 1 %, and 6. 7 % of ticks screened were positive. The soil and dust samples showed the presence of C. burnetii DNA ranging from 2. 0 to 6. 9 %, respectively. These data show that specimens from a variety of animal species and the general environment provide a number of potential sources for C. burnetii infections of humans living in Queensland. These previously unrecognized sources may account for the high seroprevalence rates seen in putative low-risk communities, including Q fever patients with no direct animal contact and those subjects living in a low-risk urban environment.

Some common STIs, including genital herpes and genital warts, are not notifiable. Responsibility {{for the control}} and management of STIs extends broadly and includes general practitioners and other primary health care providers. Public health management of sexually transmissible infections is largely conducted by publicly funded sexual health clinics, rather than population health units. Queensland Health’s AIDS Medical Unit, based in Brisbane, and Queensland’s Syphilis Register, based in Cairns and Brisbane, also perform vital roles in managing specific STIs. The Register provides support, education and data collection services for providers engaged in syphilis treatment and contact tracing.

Main outcome measures: Age group-specific rotavirus <b>notification</b> trends; <b>number</b> of rotavirus tests performed and the proportion positive. Results: In the less than 2 years age group, rotavirus notifications declined by 53 % (2007) and 65 % (2008); the number of laboratory tests performed declined by 3 % (2007) and 15 % (2008); and the proportion of tests positive declined by 45 % (2007) and 43 % (2008) compared with data collected before introduction of the vaccination program. An indirect effect of infant vaccination was seen: notifications and the proportion of tests positive for rotavirus declined in older age groups as well. Conclusions: The publicly funded rotavirus vaccination program in Queensland is having an early impact, direct and indirect, on rotavirus disease as assessed using routinely collected data.

40|$|Sources {{warn the}} global HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{will not be}} halted without significant reductions in Intimate partner violence (IPV). South African women have been hardest hit by the HIV-IPV link, suffering deleterious health outcomes as sequelae of significant barriers to HIV care. Extant literature focuses on HIV prevention, {{and there is a}} paucity of effective methods for mitigating IPV-related barriers among women living with HIV. This study was a Phase II trial testing the effectiveness and safety of the HIV IPV Risk and Safety (HIRS) protocol administered to women experiencing IPV and testing HIV+ during mobile HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT). Research questions compared experiences between a Standard of Care and an Experimental group with two dosage levels. All participants (N= 255) were black South African females residing in Gauteng province and aged about 33 years (M= 33). Two psychometric instruments were created for this study: the Danger Indicator and the HIRS scale with the latter having good reliability (Cronbach alpha. 882) but both needing refinement in validity. The protocol was shown to be effective in mitigating violence upon partner notification of serostatus (X 2 (1) = 7. 83, p=. 005) and promoting linkage to care, with participants aged 33 - 43 years trending towards significant (X 2 (1) = 3. 57, p=. 059). The protocol was found to be feasible to implement, having impressive retention, brevity in administration, and high usage of safety strategies with minimal risks resulting from participation. Satisfaction was confirmed through positive participant ratings and safety through both non-significant group differences on the HIRS scale (t(1, 237) = - 1. 09; p=. 278) and the perceived benefits of study participation far outweighing harms. Women receiving the protocol displayed notable self-determination towards self-protection and suffered significantly less re-assault upon partner <b>notification.</b> The <b>number</b> of participants utilizing certain safety strategies suggests this brief intervention was effective in galvanizing South African women to reclaim power and act towards the betterment of their health.

40|$|After {{more than}} a decade of {{steadily}} declining <b>notifications,</b> the <b>number</b> of reported cholera cases has recently increased in Vietnam. We conducted a matched case-control study to investigate transmission of cholera during an outbreak in Ben Tre, southern Vietnam, and to explore the associated risk factors. Sixty of 71 diarrheal patients confirmed to be infected with cholera by culture and diagnosed between May 9 and August 3, 2010 in Ben Tre were consecutively recruited as case-patients. Case-patients were matched 1 : 4 to controls by commune, sex, and 5 -year age group. Risk factors for cholera were examined by multivariable conditional logistic regression. In addition, environmental samples from villages containing case-patients were taken to identify contamination of food and water sources. The regression indicated that drinking iced tea (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 8. 40, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 84 - 39. 25), not always boiling drinking water (aOR = 2. 62, 95 % CI: 1. 03 - 6. 67), having the main source of water for use being close to a toilet (aOR = 4. 36, 95 % CI: 1. 37 - 13. 88), living with people who had acute diarrhea (aOR = 13. 72, 95 % CI: 2. 77 - 67. 97), and little or no education (aOR = 4. 89, 95 % CI: 1. 18 - 20. 19) were significantly associated with increased risk of cholera. In contrast, drinking stored rainwater (aOR = 0. 17, 95 % CI: 0. 04 - 0. 63), eating cooked seafood (aOR = 0. 27, 95 % CI: 0. 10 - 0. 73), and eating steamed vegetables (aOR = 0. 22, 95 % CI: 0. 07 - 0. 70) were protective against cholera. Vibrio cholerae O 1 Ogawa carrying ctxA was found in two of twenty-five river water samples and one of six wastewater samples. The magnitude of the cholera outbreak in Ben Tre was lower than in other similar settings. This investigation identified several risk factors and underscored the importance of continued responses targeting cholera prevention in southern Vietnam. The association between drinking iced tea and cholera and the spread of V. cholerae O 1, altered El Tor strains warrant further research. These findings might be affected by a number of limitations due to the inability to capture asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections, the possible underreporting of personal unhygienic behaviors, and the purposive selection of environmental samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{permanent}} growth of air traffic volume, being a main contributor to economic growth, is reaching {{the limits of}} what current Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems are capable to handle. Fundamental changes in ATM operations are required {{to cope with the}} expected increase in the next decades. On one hand, the bottleneck of centralized control of air space operations has been identified as a core limitation, and the two large development programmes for the future ATM systems, which are underway in Europe and North America, SESAR and NextGen, both envision a much stronger inclusion of all ATM stakeholders, from the airport operators to the individual pilot, into decision making processes, thus decentralizing ATM coordination effort. A fundamental requirement and key enabler of this relocation and sharing of control is the availability of all information necessary for making subsystem-level decisions that enhance the flow in the ATM supersystem, i. e., the decentralized availability of static and dynamic ATM data. The traditional ATM information distribution systems on the other hand are currently undergoing a paradigm change as well, being mainly determined by a transition from paper-based, product-oriented to data-based, concept-oriented operations. The development of the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model version 5 (AIXM 5) has pioneered this movement, enabling the Aeronautical Information domain to be the first of the ATM data domains to implement the paradigm shift. The integration of the Aeronautical Information domain with the various other ATM data domains is supported by the definition of a superordinate model system of constitutive information concepts, in which basic concepts such as space and time, are modeled in a generic, yet ATM-specific way. Such models of aeronautical spatiality and temporal dependency of aeronautical processes are presented and discussed in this thesis as AIXM 5 concepts. Both these topics, the required reorganization of information distribution systems and the explicit modeling of ATM data domain information including generic models for basic information aspects, are in the scope of the SWIM concept: the approach to System Wide Information Management in the future ATM system envisioned in SESAR and NextGen. SWIM defines a high-level distributed system model for information exchange between ATM stakeholder subsystems acting as Providers or Users of information. Among the specified SWIM core communication services is publish/subscribe, a communication paradigm closely related to event-based interaction models, in which Providers can publish event notifications, and a notification service component, which inherently decouples the communicating parties, is solely responsible for mediating the notifications to affected Users who have previously expressed interest in some sort of event notifications by registering a subscription with the service. While various subscription and event models have been proposed in the literature and have been implemented in publish/subscribe systems, none exists that provides the means to subscribe to, and efficiently disseminate, event notifiations based on spatial and temporal aspects. In this thesis, such a subscription model for spatial and temporal aspects of event notifications for publish/subscribe systems is presented. It is derived from an initial analysis of the specific requirements of the Aeronautical Information domain with respect to spatial data and the implications from Aeronautical Information processes for a model of temporal data, and is intended to provide SWIM Users with the means to subscribe to notifications for events affecting the trajectory of a (planned or currently conducted) flight. The subscription model is based on two basic types of filters, of which subscriptions are composed and which are used in the notification service nodes for routing decisions: spatial filters and interval filters. These filter types are formally introduced, and required operations (notification matching and filter relationships) are defined. The `` 2. 5 -dimensional'' aeronautical spatial model requires the adjustment of algorithms from the field of Computational Geometry to work with geometries, in which different interpolation methods for lines are used, accounting for different types of flight paths common in air navigation, namely loxodrome (rhumb line) and orthodrome (great circle track) routes. Past research in distributed content-based publish/subscribe systems has yielded advanced routing algorithms that exploit equality and inclusion relations of subscriptions to reduce filter handling overhead in the distributed nodes of the notification service. In the given context though, these traditional approaches are uneffective due to lack of appropriate subscription relationships because the 4 D trajectories of two different flights never assume the same spacetime nor is one trajectory's spacetime covered by another trajectory's one. Nevertheless, their spacetime may be close enough such that the flights are affected by the same events, in which case the respective subscriptions could be united, thus reducing filter handling overhead throughout the distributed nodes of the system. The main challenge of such an approach of merging similar subscriptions is to decide if filters are ``similar enough'' to be merged. The problem of (imperfectly) merging filters is based on a trade-off between filtering quality and filter numbers, and a formal approach to describing filter similarity and filtering quality is required to sensibly balance this trade-off. Such a formal discussion is presented in this thesis, and heuristical algorithms are proposed that integrate with merging-based routing algorithms. The proposed approaches are based on quantitatively estimating the reduction of filtering quality involved in creating a filter merger. This merger quality estimation takes into account simple filter metrics (size and distance) defined for this purpose, and returns the estimation as numeric value. By defining a merger quality threshold value, the trade-off of reduction (of the number of filters) against precision (filtering quality) can be easily adjusted as required by the application by means of a single numeric value. The proposed size-based and distance-based approaches to merger quality estimation were evaluated in filter merging experiments, and the results show that an approach based on normalized filter distance outperforms the others with respect to achieved filtering quality. Furthermore, the impact of other factors such as filter and notification size, distance and distribution characteristics (clustered or uniformly distributed) as well as filter and <b>notification</b> <b>numbers</b> was examined, and it is found that higher filter and notification density in the filter space, which is the representation of similar interests of Users and event hotspots, generally allows for better filtering quality when applying imperfect filter merging. Algorithms for the filter handling operations of a broker node in a distributed publish/subscribe system are presented that employ filter merging aiming to increase system scalability by reducing routing table size and filter forwarding overhead at the cost of unnecessarily forwarded notifications that result from the reduction of filtering quality. The scalability benefits of the approach are evaluated, firstly, by formally describing the effects of the presented filter handling scheme and investigating the propagation of the effects throughout the broker network, and secondly, in experiments using realistic flight subscriptions derived by extrapolating real historic flight data. The analysis of the results shows that very specific conditions have to be met for the overall approach to reduce subscription forwarding overhead more than increase notification forwarding overhead compared to a simple routing approach. Nevertheless, statements are derived on the conditions for filter and notification characteristics that must be met for the approaches to be effective...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} descriptive overview of {{issues related to}} trade and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, as observed during {{the implementation of the}} SPS Agreement. It aims to provide background information on activities in the WTO's SPS Committee during the period 1995 - 2001, determine the participation of different country groups, and help to identify issues that might warrant further investigation in the context of analysis on the trade and economic effects of SPS measures. Attendance at regular meetings of the SPS Committee has varied from 44 to 70 different delegations. Most OECD countries have always been represented. Yet, half to two-thirds of all WTO members, including a large number of developing country members, have not participated in the discussions at SPS Committee meetings. Indeed, 47 WTO members, including 43 developing countries, did not have a representative at any of the 12 meetings for which information on attendance is available. During regular meetings of the SPS Committee, a total of 105 specific trade concerns have been discussed. Raising an issue makes it possible for countries to attract attention to a particular concern, which might help to avoid disputes between trading partners or potential future trade problems. Of all the specific issues, 27 related to food safety, 38 to animal health, 37 to plant health, and 3 to other SPS issues. Specific trade concerns have been expressed about SPS measures in all 30 OECD countries, and in 18 non-OECD countries, including 15 developing countries. Conversely, 29 OECD countries and 38 non-OECD countries, including 35 developing countries, have raised issues or supported complaints about SPS practices of other WTO members. Fruits, vegetables, and flowers and livestock and livestock products were the product groups most often subject to concerns. In almost a third of all cases, at least a partial solution to the specific trade concern raised was subsequently reported to the SPS Committee. Yet, there might be a number of other concerns that have been resolved through technical exchanges between the affected parties, without this outcome being reported back to the WTO. Even though the transparency disciplines of the SPS Agreement are obligatory for WTO membership, not all countries have so far complied concerning the provision of information on national notification authorities and SPS enquiry points. All OECD countries have reported an enquiry point to the WTO since 1995 and designated notification authorities since 1997, but a significant number of developing countries had not provided this information by the end of 2001. Nevertheless, the number of countries submitting SPS <b>notifications</b> and the <b>number</b> of notified SPS measures increased considerably between 1995 and the end of 2001. All 30 OECD members and 49 non-OECD countries have submitted notifications, with {{more than two-thirds of the}} more than 2400 notified SPS measures being reported by OECD countries. More than half of the notified measures were intended to ensure food safety. Up to the end of 2001, there had been nineteen disputes concerning alleged violations of the SPS Agreement. Of these, two had been resolved following consultations, seven had led to the establishment of panels (which in four cases led to the subsequent resolution of the dispute), and ten were still pending. OECD countries have been prominently involved in these SPS disputes. In 16 of the 19 cases, both the country raising an issue and the country concerned were OECD- 30 members. In two cases, a developing country invoked dispute settlement procedures against import practices in an OECD country, and in one case developing countries were both the complaining party and the party complained about. Some observers have noted that there seem to be a number of cases where either the substantive obligations of the SPS Agreement or bilateral exchanges in its institutional framework have contributed to regulatory reform. These policy changes might have come about anyway as a result of findings by regulatory scientists that import protocols could be designed in ways to reduce risks to acceptable levels. But the framework of SPS disciplines might have provided assurance that other countries would review their rules and procedures according to the same principles. ...|$|R
