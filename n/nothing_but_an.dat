As regards these {{there is no doubt}} that Tetzel did, according to what he considered his authoritative instructions, proclaim as Christian doctrine that <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>an</b> offering of money was required to gain the indulgence for the dead, without there being any question of contrition or confession.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} the nineteenth century was the Law Lord. In 1856, it was deemed necessary to add a legally qualified peer to the House of Lords: the Lords exercised, and still exercise, certain judicial functions, but did not necessarily include a sufficient number of peers well-versed in law. So that the number of hereditary peers would not be further increased, Victoria made Sir James Parke, a baron of the Exchequer, a life peer as Baron Wensleydale. The Lords refused to admit him, deeming that <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>an</b> Act of Parliament could change the fundamental hereditary characteristic of the Lords. Bills were later introduced to permit the creation of life peerages, but these failed. Only in 1876, twenty years after the Wensleydale case, was the Appellate Jurisdiction Act passed, authorising the appointment of two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (commonly called Law Lords) to sit in the House of Lords as barons. They were to hold the rank of baron for life, but sit in the Lords only until retiring from judicial office. In 1887, they were permitted to continue to sit in the Lords for life; the number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was also increased by further enactments.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to much theatre of the time, The Importance of Being Earnests light plot does not tackle serious {{social and political}} issues, something of which contemporary reviewers were wary. Though unsure of Wilde's seriousness as a dramatist, they recognised the play's cleverness, humour and popularity with audiences. George Bernard Shaw, for example, reviewed the play in the Saturday Review, arguing that comedy should touch as well as amuse, [...] "I go to the theatre to be moved to laughter." [...] Later in a letter he said, the play, though [...] "extremely funny", was Wilde's [...] "first really heartless [...] ". In The World, William Archer wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but {{found it to be}} empty of meaning, [...] "What can a poor critic do with a play which raises no principle, whether of art or morals, creates its own canons and conventions, and is <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>an</b> absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality?" ...|$|E

All we see is dirt, muck, dung, and horse-play—nothing else. Liebknecht belongs in the madhouse and Rosa Luxemburg in the zoological gardens.” [...] Weber was at the same time critical of the Versailles Treaty which he believed unjustly assigned [...] "war guilt" [...] to Germany when it came to World War I. [...] Weber believed that many countries were guilty of starting World War I, not just Germany. [...] In making this case, Weber argued that “In {{the case of}} this war there is one, and only one power that desired it under all circumstances through its own will and, according to their political goals required: Russia. [...] …It never crossed [...] mind that a German invasion of Belgium [...] was <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>an</b> innocent act {{on the part of the}} Germans." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{spoliation}} of Bavaria led to entreaties {{from the}} Elector's wife, Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, {{for him to}} divest himself of the French alliance. Although the Elector wavered somewhat in his allegiance to Louis XIV, his resolve to continue fighting against Leopold I and the Grand Alliance was stiffened when news arrived that Tallard's reinforcements– some 35,000 men– would soon be in Bavaria. Marlborough now intensified the policy of devastating the Elector's territory. On 16 July the Duke wrote to his friend Heinsius, the Grand Pensionary of Holland, [...] "We are advancing {{into the heart of}} Bavaria to destroy the country and oblige the Elector {{one way or the other}} to a compliance". The policy compelled the Elector to send 8,000 troops from Augsburg to defend his own property, reserving only a fraction of his army to join the French under Marsin and Tallard. But although Marlborough thought it a necessary strategy to secure success, it was of doubtful morality. The Duke himself confessed his reservations to his wife, Sarah, [...] "This is so uneasy to my nature that <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>an</b> absolute necessity would have obliged me to consent to it. For these poor people suffer only for their master's ambition." [...] Accounts differ as to the actual amounts of damage done. De La Colonie thought that reports of the devastation were perhaps exaggerated for propaganda purposes; yet Christian Davies serving with Hay's Dragoons wrote, [...] "The allies sent parties on every hand to ravage the country... We spared nothing, killing, burning or otherwise destroying whatever we could not carry off." [...] To Historian David Chandler, Marlborough must bear the full responsibility for the destruction, for although he undoubtedly found it hard to stomach it was taken under Baden's, and the Emperor's protests.|$|E

2500|$|Zeno's paradoxes are {{a set of}} {{philosophical}} problems generally {{thought to have been}} devised by Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea (ca. 490–430 BC) to support Parmenides' doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief in plurality and change is mistaken, and in particular that motion is <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>an</b> illusion. [...] It is usually assumed, based on Plato's Parmenides (128a–d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these paradoxes because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view. [...] Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes [...] "is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one." [...] (Parmenides 128d). [...] Plato has Socrates claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point (Parmenides 128a–b).|$|E
2500|$|It is however also unclear {{exactly what}} form this liberty took. Jules Toutain {{is of the}} opinion that this is a {{designation}} for a particular type of municipium - free cities where the Roman governor did {{not have the right to}} control the municipal magistrates. There is however no evidence that Dougga enjoyed exceptional legal privileges of the type associated with certain free cities such as Aphrodisias in Asia Minor. Paul Veyne has thus suggested that Dougga’s libertas is <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>an</b> expression of the concept of liberty without any legal meaning; obtaining the status of a municipium had freed the city of its subjugation and enabled it to adorn itself with the ornamenta libertatis. The city’s liberty was celebrated just as its dignity was extolled; Emperor Probus is conservator libertatis et dignitatis (the preserver of liberty and dignity). Jacques Gascou, in line with Paul Veyne’s interpretation, describes the situation thus: “Liberum, in Thugga’s title, is a term [...] with which the city, which had waited a long time for the status of a municipium, is happy to flatter itself”.|$|E

2500|$|On August 12, 2008, Colbert {{once again}} apologized to his latest comedic target even though local {{reaction}} to the insult was fairly mild. Referring to a line from his satirical song, Colbert said that not all the dogs run away from Canton, South Dakota but [...] "some stay and develop a drinking problem."

A Time magazine writer commented that, unlike previous celebrities' nudes that represented the women's rebellion against repressed society and [...] "trying to tear down" [...] barriers, Kardashian's exhibition was [...] "just provocation and bluster, repeated images that seem to offer us some sort of truth or insight but are really just self serving.
