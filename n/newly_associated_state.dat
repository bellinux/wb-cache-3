Technology-oriented as well as policy-oriented research is considered. The focus is directed on urban issues, including the transport between an agglomeration and its surroundings. EURFORUM's SRA relies on the conviction that holistic and interdisciplinary research is the most adequate approach {{to solve the problems}} identified in the area of urban transport. Additionally, special attention is paid to urban mobility changes in <b>newly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>States</b> (EU- 12). The overall objectives of EURFORUM are to better structure and to better coordinate European research on urban mobility for passengers and goods, by involving all relevant urban mobility stakeholders in the discussion...|$|R

However, there is no universally accepted definition and neither standard measurement for globalization nor social dimension of globalization. Many {{attempts have been made}} to measure globalization. Authors introduce single indices – economic and social globalization index and index for progress in reducing income inequality as fuzzy membership functions. Authors analyse the dependence of the new indices. Authors create clusters of similar EU countries in the view of these two indices with the help of fuzzy c‑cluster analysis. The result is two clusters of states – original EU countries, <b>newly</b> <b>associated</b> and four <b>states</b> – Greece, Portugal, Slovenia a Malta turned out as not decided...|$|R
40|$|To newly {{identify}} loci for age at natural menopause, {{we carried}} out a meta-analysis of 22 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 38, 968 women of European descent, with replication in up to 14, 435 women. In addition to four known loci, we identified 13 loci <b>newly</b> <b>associated</b> with age at natural menopause (at P < 5 × 10 (- 8)). Candidate genes located at these <b>newly</b> <b>associated</b> loci include genes implicated in DNA repair (EXO 1, HELQ, UIMC 1, FAM 175 A, FANCI, TLK 1, POLG and PRIM 1) and immune function (IL 11, NLRP 11 and PRRC 2 A (also known as BAT 2)). Gene-set enrichment pathway analyses using the full GWAS data set identified exoDNase, NF-κB signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction as biological processes related to timing of menopause...|$|R

When analysing the relatively small populations of <b>associated</b> <b>states</b> that are formed by weak interactions (i. e. those interactions that are comparable to thermal energies), it is common practice to characterise the <b>associated</b> <b>state</b> by a parameter that is measured when this state is highly occupied. The accuracy of this method, however, has not yet been determined. Results: Using as a model the vancomycin group of antibiotics, either forming dimers or binding to cell wall precursors, we have investigated the dependence of the limiting (i. e. fully associated) chemical shifts of two protons on the equilibrium constants for the formation of the fully <b>associated</b> <b>states.</b> The chemical shift shows a large variation with the equilibrium constant for the formation of the fully <b>associated</b> <b>state.</b> Conclusions: The results demonstrate, in two systems, that a parameter representing a fully <b>associated</b> <b>state</b> (chemical shift) varies greatly with the equilibrium constant for the formation of that <b>associated</b> <b>state.</b> The results have implications for two-state analyses of populations of protein fragments in which a parameter representing the fully <b>associated</b> <b>state</b> is taken to be independent of the equilibrium constant for its formation. Using two-state analysis to determine the population of <b>associated</b> <b>states</b> of protein fragments could result in an underestimation of the population of these <b>associated</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
