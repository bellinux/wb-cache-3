A <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> coefficient means that as the water moderator heats up, molecules move farther apart (water expands and eventually boils) and neutrons {{are less likely to}} be slowed by collisions to energies favorable for inducing fission in the fuel. Because of these negative feedback mechanisms, most LWRs will naturally tend to decrease their rate of fissioning in response to additional heat produced within the reactor core. If enough heat is produced that water boils inside the core, fissions in that vicinity will drastically decrease.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{negative}} affective {{response to}} daily life stressors, which previous work suggest {{is a fundamental}} depression endophenotype, may be moderated by positive emotions. It was investigated whether positive affect (PA) buffers <b>negative</b> affect (NA) <b>reactivity</b> in response to stress and whether PA moderates the genetic predisposition to <b>negative</b> affect <b>reactivity.</b> METHOD: A total of 279 twin pairs participated in a momentary assessment study with the experience sampling method, collecting appraisals of stress and affect {{in the flow of}} daily life. Lifetime diagnoses of depression were obtained. RESULTS: There was a significant interaction between stress appraisal of event (STRESS) and PA in the association with NA. The interaction between proband PA, proband STRESS and co-twin lifetime depression showed that higher PA reduced the interaction between proband STRESS and co-twin lifetime depression.

50|$|Minimum {{shutdown}} margin can {{be calculated}} {{in the same way}} as shutdown margin, except that the <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> of the most reactive control rod and non-scramable rods is ignored. This definition allows the reactor to be designed so that it remains safely shut down even if that most reactive control rod becomes stuck out of the core.|$|E
50|$|To control {{large amounts}} of excess fuel {{reactivity}} without control rods, burnable poisons are loaded into the core. Burnable poisons are materials that have a high neutron absorption cross section that are converted into materials of relatively low absorption cross section {{as the result of}} neutron absorption. Due to the burn-up of the poison material, the <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> of the burnable poison decreases over core life. Ideally, these poisons should decrease their <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> at the same rate that the fuel's excess positive reactivity is depleted. Fixed burnable poisons are generally used in the form of compounds of boron or gadolinium that are shaped into separate lattice pins or plates, or introduced as additives to the fuel. Since they can usually be distributed more uniformly than control rods, these poisons are less disruptive to the core's power distribution. Fixed burnable poisons may also be discretely loaded in specific locations in the core in order to shape or control flux profiles to prevent excessive flux and power peaking near certain regions of the reactor. Current practice however is to use fixed non-burnable poisons in this service.|$|E
50|$|A non-burnable poison is {{one that}} {{maintains}} a constant <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> worth {{over the life of}} the core. While no neutron poison is strictly non-burnable, certain materials can be treated as non-burnable poisons under certain conditions. One example is hafnium. The removal (by absorption of neutrons) of one isotope of hafnium leads to the production of another neutron absorber, and continues through a chain of five absorbers. This absorption chain results in a long-lived burnable poison which approximates non-burnable characteristics.|$|E

40|$|Introduction A {{recent study}} by Potter et al. (in submission) {{reported}} that many chronic pain sufferers experience a spontaneous mental image of their pain, and that these individuals also {{report higher levels of}} anxiety and depression. However, {{little is known about the}} nature of pain-related mental imagery or the role it might have in chronic pain problems. Research Aims This project aimed to replicate these findings with a larger sample, and to discover more about the characteristics of pain-related mental imagery. It also aimed to explore the possible function of mental imagery in inducing physiological arousal and <b>negative</b> emotional <b>reactivity.</b> Methodology The research consisted of two discrete studies. In the first study, questionnaire measures of mental imagery, pain self-report, depression, anxiety, and use of imagery in everyday life were obtained from a naturalistic sample of chronic pain sufferers (N= 105). The second study interviewed fourteen participants who reported experiencing pain-related mental imagery. These participants were also asked to intentionally generate their image and subjective measures of physiological and emotional reactivity were recorded. Results A significant proportion (40 %) of participants reported experiencing pain-related mental imagery. Those who did also reported significantly higher levels of depression, though a trend towards higher levels of anxiety was not statistically significant. Mental images were predominately reported to be distressing, to occur frequently (at least every day), to interfere with daily living, to be longstanding (on average of three years duration), and to be largely stable over time. The majority of participants who were asked to intentionally self-generate their image during interview reported increases in physiological arousal and <b>negative</b> emotional <b>reactivity.</b> Discussion Experiencing a mental image of pain is a common phenomenon among chronic pain sufferers. Furthermore, the images experienced are long-standing, stable, and appear to be linked with physiological and <b>negative</b> emotional <b>reactivity.</b> It therefore seems possible that these images have a role in psychological adjustment to chronic pain for some sufferers and may contribute to long-term distress and disability. These findings suggest that a greater understanding of pain-related mental imagery may contribute to the psychological assessment and treatment of chronic pain sufferers.

40|$|This report {{presents}} FY 13 {{activities for}} the analysis of D 2 O cooled tight-pitch High-Conversion PWRs (HCPWRs) with U-Pu and Th-U fueled cores aiming at break-even or near breeder conditions while retaining the <b>negative</b> void <b>reactivity.</b> The analyses are carried out from several aspects which could not be covered in FY 12 activities. SCALE 6. 1 code system is utilized, and a series of simple 3 D fuel pin-cell models are developed in order to perform Monte Carlo based criticality and burnup calculations. The performance of U-Pu fueled cores with axial and internal blankets is analyzed in terms of their impact on the relative fissile Pu mass balance, initial Pu enrichment, and void coefficient. In FY 12, Pu conversion performances of D 2 O-cooled HCPWRs fueled with MOX were evaluated with small sized axial/internal DU blankets (approximately 4 cm of axial length) in order to ensure the <b>negative</b> void <b>reactivity,</b> which evidently limits the conversion performance of HCPWRs. In this fiscal year report, the axial sizes of DU blankets are extended up to 30 cm in order to evaluate the amount of DU necessary to reach break-even and/or breeding conditions. Several attempts are made in order to attain the milestone of the HCPWR designs (i. e., break-even condition and <b>negative</b> void <b>reactivity)</b> by modeling of HCPWRs under different conditions such as boiling of D 2 O coolant, MOX with different 235 U enrichment, and different target burnups. A similar set of analyses are performed for Th-U fueled cores. Several promising characteristics of 233 U over other fissile like 239 Pu and 235 U, most notably its higher fission neutrons per absorption in thermal and epithermal ranges combined with lower ___ in the fast range than 239 Pu allows Th-U cores to be taller than MOX ones. Such an advantage results in 4 % higher relative fissile mass balance than that of U-Pu fueled cores while retaining the <b>negative</b> void <b>reactivity</b> until the target burnup of 51 GWd/t. Several other distinctions between U-Pu and Th-U fueled cores are identified by evaluating the sensitivity coefficients of keff, mass balance, and void coefficient. The effect of advanced iron alloy cladding (i. e., FeCrAl) on the performance of Pu conversion in MOX fueled cores is studied instead of using standard stainless-steel cladding. Variations in clad thickness and coolant-to-fuel volume ratio are also exercised. The use of FeCrAl instead of SS as a cladding alloy reduces the required Pu enrichment and improves the Pu conversion rate primarily due to the absence of nickel in the cladding alloy that results in the reduction of the neutron absorption. Also the difference in void coefficients between SS and FeCrAl alloys is nearly 500 pcm over the entire burnup range. The report also shows sensitivity and uncertainty analyses in order to characterize D 2 O cooled HCPWRs from different aspects. The uncertainties of integral parameters (keff and void coefficient) for selected reactor cores are evaluated at different burnup points in order to find similarities and trends respect to D 2 O-HCPWR...|$|R

If the reactor is to operate {{for a long period}} of time, fuel in excess of that needed for exact criticality must be added when the reactor is fueled. The positive reactivity due to the excess fuel must be balanced with <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> from neutron-absorbing material.

Since tritium has a half-life of 12.3 years, normally this decay does not significantly affect reactor operations because the rate of decay of tritium is so slow. However, if tritium is produced in a reactor and then allowed to remain in the reactor during a prolonged shutdown of several months, a sufficient amount of tritium may decay to helium-3 to add a significant amount of <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity.</b> Any helium-3 produced in the reactor during a shutdown period will be removed during subsequent operation by a neutron-proton reaction.|$|E

To date, no studies have prospectively examined changes in Stress-Sensitivity and Reward Experience following antidepressant treatment. The sample included 83 depressed patients and 22 healthy controls. A randomized controlled trial was carried out with patients receiving either imipramine or placebo for 6 weeks. At baseline and 6 weeks, patients and controls participated in an Experience Sampling procedure, prospectively measuring ecologically valid daily life appraisals of activities and mood states. The course of depression was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Multilevel linear regression analyses showed that patients had higher negative and lower positive appraisals of activities than controls. In addition, patients showed increased Stress-Sensitivity (<b>negative</b> affect <b>reactivity</b> to negatively appraised activities). Treatment with imipramine decreased Stress-Sensitivity and increased Reward Experience (positive affect reactivity to positively appraised activities).

However, increase in Reward Experience, but not decrease in Stress-Sensitivity, discriminated between patients who responded and those who did not, independent of changes in the process of activity appraisal itself.

50|$|While {{criticality}} at fast energies may {{be achieved}} with uranium enriched to 5.5 weight percent Uranium-235, fast reactor designs have often been proposed with enrichments {{in the range of}} 20 percent for a variety of reasons, including core lifetime: If a fast reactor were loaded with the minimal critical mass, then the reactor would become subcritical after the first fission had occurred. Rather, an excess of fuel is inserted with reactivity control mechanisms, such that the reactivity control is inserted fully at the beginning of life to bring the reactor from supercritical to critical; as the fuel is depleted, the reactivity control is withdrawn to mitigate the <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> feedback from fuel depletion and fission product poisons. In a fast breeder reactor, the above applies, though the reactivity from fuel depletion is also compensated by the breeding of either Uranium-233 or Plutonium-239 and 241 from Thorium 232 or Uranium 238, respectively.|$|E

The breeder reactors seem to have a similar trend with the renewable energies as a sustainable energy source.

The present study intends to find the feasible region of design parameters for light or heavy water cooled reactors using thorium and uranium fuels which fulfill the required design characteristics such as breeding, <b>negative</b> void <b>reactivity</b> coefficient, comparable burn up with standard PWR, homogeneous core and large pin gap. The basic reactor design parameters of investigated systems are basically based on the water coolant reactor technology.

A breeding condition is feasible for all investigated cases which are mainly require very tight lattice pitch for light water coolant cases and relatively larger lattice pitch for heavy water coolant. Regarding a negative void coefficient, only Th- 233 U fuel system for both water coolants obtains a negative void coefficient in the breeding regions.

50|$|Soluble poisons, {{also called}} {{chemical}} shim, produce a spatially uniform neutron absorption when dissolved {{in the water}} coolant. The most common soluble poison in commercial pressurized water reactors (PWR) is boric acid, which {{is often referred to}} as soluble boron. The boric acid in the coolant decreases the thermal utilization factor, causing a decrease in reactivity. By varying the concentration of boric acid in the coolant, a process referred to as boration and dilution, the reactivity of the core can be easily varied. If the boron concentration is increased, the coolant/moderator absorbs more neutrons, adding <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity.</b> If the boron concentration is reduced (dilution), positive reactivity is added. The changing of boron concentration in a PWR is a slow process and is used primarily to compensate for fuel burnout or poison buildup. The variation in boron concentration allows control rod use to be minimized, which results in a flatter flux profile over the core than can be produced by rod insertion. The flatter flux profile occurs because there are no regions of depressed flux like those that would be produced in the vicinity of inserted control rods. This system is not in widespread use because the chemicals make the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient less negative. All commercial PWR types operating in the US (Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and Babcock & Wilcox) employ soluble boron to control excess reactivity. US Navy reactors and Boiling Water Reactors do not.|$|E
50|$|Burn-up {{compensation}} is achieved automatically by the LEMs, achieving 80% of the nominal {{power at the}} end-of-life of the fuel cartridge. The LEM is a thermometer-like device actuated by the volume expansion of the Li6. This “liquid control rod” can keep the reactor power almost constant throughout the design life.Partial load operation is possible by adjusting the primary coolant flow rate. Reactor power will be in proportional with the primary coolant flow rate due to LEMs reactivity feedback. The LRM is composed of an envelope divided by a frozen seal into two chambers. The lower chamber, within the active core, has a 95% enriched Li6 reservoir, while the upper chamber is a vacuum prior to reactor startup.Reactor startup can be done automatically if the primary coolant temperature reaches its standby temperature. Coolant heating {{can be achieved by}} heat release from the primary pump circulation. Then the frozen seal of the LRM will melt at the hot standby temperature (approximately 780 °C), and Li6 is released slowly from lower level (active core level) to the upper level to achieve a positive reactivity increase.It will take 7(11) hours to complete startup. The LIMs assure sufficient <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> feedback in unprotected transients. The LRMs enable an automated reactor startup by detecting the hot standby temperature of the primary coolant. All these systems use Li6 and are actuated by highly reliable physical properties (volume expansion of Li6 for LEM, and frozen seal melting for LIM and LRM). A configuration with Quick LEMs requires 3+(1) LEMs of smaller size than a configuration with Slow LEMs requiring 24 LEMs.The RAPID-L is equipped with 28 LEMs, 16 LIMs and 16 LRMs in the design concept. Two of the 16 LRM are reserves or dummies. It is a very redundant system. Failure of some of these devices would result in only a slight temperature deviation of the coolant. In case that most of the LEMs fail, the burn-up compensation by the LEMs could be impossible, and the reactor would shut down.|$|E

40|$|CEA Cadarache/DEN/DER/SPRC. The resource-renewable {{boiling water}} reactor (RBWR) is an {{innovative}} {{boiling water reactor}} that has the capability to breed or to burn transuranium elements (TRUs). Core characteristics of the RBWR of the TRU burner type were evaluated by two different core analysis methods. The RBWR core features an axially heterogeneous configuration, which consists of an internal blanket region between two seed regions, to achieve the TRU multi-recycling capability while maintaining a <b>negative</b> void <b>reactivity</b> coefficient. Axial power distribution of the TRU burner core {{tends to be more}} heterogeneous because the isotopic composition ratio of fertile TRUs to fissile TRUs becomes larger in the TRU burner-type core than in the breeder-Type core and the seed regions need to be axially shorter than that of the breeder-Type core. Thus core analysis of the TRU burner-type core is more challenging. A conventional diffusion calculation using nuclear constants prepared by two-dimensional lattice calculations was performed by Hitachi, while the calculation using nuclear constants prepared by three-dimensional calculations and axial discontinuity factors was performed by the University of Michigan to provide a more sophisticated treatment of the axial heterogeneity. Both calculations predicted similar axial power distributions except in the region near the boundary between fuel and plenum. Both calculations also predicted <b>negative</b> void <b>reactivity</b> coefficients throughout the operating cycle. Safety analysis was performed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the all-pump trip accident, which was identified as the limiting accident for the RBWR design. The analysis showed the peak cladding temperature remains below the safety limit. Detailed fuel cycle analysis by University of California, Berkeley, showed that per electrical power generated, the RBWR is capable of incinerating TRUs at about twice the rate at which they are produced in typical pressurized water reactors...|$|R

MethodData from 1, 147 families in an Australian population-based longitudinal study were used to examine: (1) temporal relationships between <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> in early adolescence (13 – 14 years) and depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood (19 – 20 years); (2) the moderating role of parent-reported warmth in early adolescence (13 – 14 years); and (3) the moderating role of child gender. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to test the hypothesis that parental warmth would moderate the relationship between early adolescent <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> and depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood. ResultsAfter accounting for previous depressive symptoms at age 13 – 14 years, <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> was positively associated with later depressive symptoms. By contrast, parental warmth at 13 – 14 years was negatively associated with later depressive symptoms for females but not males. Parental warmth did not moderate the association between early adolescent <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> and subsequent depressive symptoms. ConclusionsThis study was the first to use prospective data to assess the protective effects of early adolescent parental warmth on the association between negative reactive temperaments and early adult depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that parental warmth for negatively reactive children provides only concurrent protection against subsequent depressive risk. This study did not examine parent–child transactional models, which may, in future longitudinal research, improve understanding of how trajectories of parent–child goodness-of-fit contribute to depressive symptoms...|$|E

The correct simulation of such event implies the minimization of the so called ‘‘numeric boron self-shielding effect’’ or the over-estimation of the inserted <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> caused by the adoption of relatively large numerical meshes. In fact, because during the first phases of the injection, a very high concentrated boron solution is introduced in a small volume of the moderator tank, non-conservative reactivity estimation can be calculated if a ‘‘numeric boron dilution’’ is resulting by the adoption of large thermal-hydraulic and neutronic meshes. A methodology based on Monte Carlo transport code MCNP 5 has been developed in order to predict power and reactivity excursions, representing a boron distribution in the moderator with different spatial resolutions. In such a way, it was possible to investigate the <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> over-estimation due to the ‘‘boron self-shielding effect’’. This investigation is generally not possible by system codes used for safety analysis. The methodology was extended also to benchmark the EBSS <b>negative</b> <b>reactivity</b> insertion evaluated by the reference system code RELAP- 3 D/NESTLE. Final results were used {{for the development of the}} Chapter 15 of the Final Safety Analysis Report of Atucha- 2 NPP, demonstrating the conservative predictions of the reference system code employed for the safety evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Detailed safety {{analyses}} {{have been}} performed for the 20 MW D{sub 2 }O moderated research reactor (NBSR) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The time-dependent analysis of the primary system is determined with a RELAP 5 transient analysis model that includes the reactor vessel, the pump, heat exchanger, fuel element geometry, and flow channels for both the six inner and twenty-four outer fuel elements. A post-processing of the simulation results has been conducted to evaluate minimum critical heat flux ratio (CHFR) using the Sudo-Kaminaga correlation. Evaluations are performed for the following accidents: (1) the control rod withdrawal startup accident and (2) the maximum reactivity insertion accident. In both cases the RELAP 5 results indicate that there is adequate margin to CHF and no damage to the fuel will occur because of sufficient coolant flow through the fuel channels and the <b>negative</b> scram <b>reactivity</b> insertion...|$|R
40|$|Widows scoring {{lower on}} the trait of {{neuroticism}} (N; i. e., <b>negative</b> emotional <b>reactivity)</b> tend to score higher on measures of well-being than high-N widows. This study examined if low-N widows employ adaptive cognitive processes (e. g., positive information processing biases) to mediate the association between personality and well-being. Reports of widowed women 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of their marriage, measured in 2002 / 2003 by the Marital Aggrandizement Scale (MAS; O 2 ̆ 7 Rourke & Cappeliez, 2002), were compared to {{their perceptions of their}} marriage at that time, as recalled three years later, as well as at present (N = 47). It was predicted that low-N widows would have higher MAS responses than high-N widows, and that this difference would increase over time. There was no interaction between neuroticism and time on MAS scores. Scores of high- and low-N widows on measures of psychiatric distress and life satisfaction were different at baseline and demonstrated lesser disparity at Time 2...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{carried out}} on thorium-based fuels indicates that these fuels {{can be considered as}} economic alternatives with improved physical properties and proliferation resistance issues. In the current study, neutronic assessment of UO 2 in comparison with two (Th- 233 U) O 2, and (Th- 235 U) O 2 thorium-based fuel loads in a heavy water research reactor has been proposed. The obtained computational data showed both thorium-based fuels caused less <b>negative</b> temperature <b>reactivity</b> coefficients for the modeled research reactor in comparison with UO 2 fuel loading. By contrast, 233 U-containing thorium-based fuel and 235 U-containing thorium-based fuel loadings in the thermal core did not drastically reduce the effective delayed neutron fractions and delayed neutron fractions compared to UO 2 fuel. A provided higher conversion factor and lower transuranic production in the research core fed by the thorium-based fuels make the fuel favorable in achieving higher cycle length and less dangerous and costly nuclear disposals...|$|R
