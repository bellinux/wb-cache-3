40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} {{emissions are}} produced when a hammer or vibrodriver {{are used to}} introduce sheet-piling elements and steel beams. An expert system reported on here {{makes it possible to}} predict the expected amplitudes of vibration during pile-driving. It estimates the accelerations, velocities and displacements at the surface of the ground and in buildings (foundation, upper storey, ceilings), and compares them with permissible reference values laid down in standards (e. g. DIN 4150, Parts 2 and 3). The reference values provide information on whether considerable annoyance is caused to people living nearby and whether damage is caused to buildings. If the permissible values are exceeded, then the permissible values for equipment for driving in (e. g. permissible energy) and the permissible minimum distance between the emission point and the immission point will be calculated. The system can also produce a <b>noise</b> <b>chart.</b> In addition to the vibrations calculated by the expert system, this dissertation also shows a way to calculate the upper limits for the stresses in buildings and for the vertical vibrations of ceilings during the introduction of sheet pile elements by a hammer. It thus takes account of previous knowledge about the velocity of vibrations at the foundation in the time and frequency domain. The estimated stresses can be used to predict the damage that may be caused to buildings. (orig.)

40|$|The {{occupational}} noise exposure problem is getting serious {{and the workers}} have low self-efficacy in using the hearing protectors during the working period. In this paper, it reveals a prototyping model, namely, Intelligent Hearing Protection Device (IHPD) as a new hearing technology to cope with current problems. This device could measure the noise level in the workplace, detect the regularity of worker in the usage of IHPD and indicate the high noise area. Meanwhile, the IHPD is required {{to connect with the}} Dosiwatch and the Integrated Noise Exposure Software (INES) to improve its functionalities. The Dosiwatch is an electronic device to display the noise level and indicate the risky area, where it helps the workers to perceive the risk of noise in a workplace. The INES receives the noise data wirelessly, plots the instantaneous <b>noise</b> <b>charts</b> and supervises the regularity of workers in using the IHPD. By the way, the technical procedure development and the typical function of electronic gadgets are significant in this invention. A prototyping model was developed to ensure the technical procedure development meets the conceptual design of IHPD, dosiwatch and INES...|$|R

50|$|The {{tipping bucket}} rain gauge {{consists}} of a funnel that collects and channels the precipitation into a small seesaw-like container. After a pre-set amount of precipitation falls, the lever tips, dumping the collected water and sending an electrical signal. An old-style recording device may consist of a pen mounted on an arm attached to a geared wheel that moves once with each signal sent from the collector. In this design, the wheel turns the pen arm moves either up or down leaving a trace on the graph {{and at the same time}} making a loud click. Each jump of the arm is sometimes referred to as a 'click' in reference to the <b>noise.</b> The <b>chart</b> is measured in 10-minute periods (vertical lines) and 0.4 mm (0.015 in) (horizontal lines) and rotates once every 24 hours and is powered by a clockwork motor that must be manually wound.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the inlet and outlet angles of the centrifugal fan without scroll casing were investigated in relating to the characteristics of aerodynamics and noise. The following results are obtained. The inlet angle of the impeller, which is estimated by the radial inflow condition, gives the extremely low angle for the inflow condition. The cause is that the leakage flow from the clearance between the front shroud and the bell mouth is very large and has the tangential component of velocity. And we proposed the new charts of the performance on the fan noise. They clearly indicate {{the effect of the}} inlet and outlet angles of the impeller to the performance of the fan <b>noise.</b> From the <b>charts,</b> the optimal design parameters and the sensitivity of them to the fan noise can be easily obtained...|$|R
40|$|A {{means of}} {{estimating}} the noise {{generated by a}} helicopter main rotor using information which is generally available during the preliminary design phase of aircraft development is presented. The method utilizes design charts and tables which do not require an understanding of acoustical theory or computational procedures in order to predict the perceived noise level, a weighted sound pressure level, or C weighted sound pressure level of a single hovering rotor. A method for estimating the effective perceived noise level in forward flight is also included. In order to give the designer {{an assessment of the}} relative rotor performance, which may be traded off against <b>noise,</b> an additional <b>chart</b> for estimating the percent of available rotor thrust which must be expended in lifting the rotor and drive system, is included as well as approach for comparing the subjective acceptability of various rotors once the absolute sound pressure levels are predicted...|$|R
