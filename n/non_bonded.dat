The marine brown alga under study was grown in two different environmental conditions; in natural seawater (P. tetrastromatica (c)) and in seawater suplemented with 50 ppm of cadmium (P. tetrastromatica (t)) for a three-week period in the laboratory. The second derivative, IR specrum in the mid-infrared region (4000 – 400 cm− 1) was used for discriminating and identifying various functional groups present in P. tetrastromatica (c). On exposure to Cd, P. tetrastromatica (t) accumulated 412 ppm of Cd and showed perturbation in the band structure in the mid-IR absorption region. Variation in spectral features of the IR bands of P. tetrastromatica (untreated and treated) suggests that cadmium ions bind to hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl and phosphoryl functionalities. This was attributable to the presence of the following specifi c bands. A band at 3666 cm− 1 in untreated P. tetrastromatica (c) while a band at 3560 cm− 1 in Cd-treated P. tetrastromatica (t) due to <b>non</b> <b>bonded</b> and bonded O-H respectively.

The gas flow ratio, deposition temperature and microwave power have been varied in order to study their effect on {{the properties of the}} films, which were characterized by Rutherford back-scattering spectrometry, elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and ellipsometry. All samples show N/Si ratios near or above the stoichiometric value (N/Si= 1. 33). The hydrogen content determined from ERDA measurements is significantly higher than the amount detected by infrared spectroscopy, evidencing the presence of <b>non</b> <b>bonded</b> H. As the N 2 /SiH 4 gas flow ratio is increased (by decreasing the SiH 4 partial pressure), the Si content decreases and the N-H concentration increases, while the N content remains constant, resulting in an increase of the N/Si ratio. The decrease of the Si content causes a decrease of the refractive index and the density of the film, while the growth ratio also decreases due to the limiting factor of the SiH 4 partial pressure. The infrared Si-N stretching band shifts to higher wavenumbers as the N-H concentration increases. The increase of deposition temperature promotes the release of H, resulting in a higher incorporation of N and Si into the film and a decrease of the N/Si ratio. The effect of increasing the microwave power is analogous to increasing the N 2 /SiH 4 ratio, due to the increase in the proportion of nitrogen activated species. 1...|$|E

C- 2 also displayed significantly (p< 0. 05) higher activity in 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and deoxyribose degradation assays. All compounds, except C- 4 and C- 6 significantly inhibited Fe (II) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) induced thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) production in rat’s brain, liver and kidney preparations with highest activity observed for C- 2. The highest C- 2 activity was attributed to the presence of non-bonded nitrogen interactions which were absent in C- 1 and blocked with butoxycarbonyl (BOC group) in C- 3. The same structural activity analogy was extended to organosulfur compounds and it was observed that compound with non-bonding nitrogen interactions, i. e.

In this work X-Ray single crystal diffraction has been used to study the structure of epsomite at 298 K, 175 K and 102 K, respectively, in order to 1) describe the structure of epsomite at low temperature 2) systematically describe changes that occur in the epsomite structure at low temperature considering polyhedral geometries (bond distances, bond angles) and hydrogen bonds variations 3) justify with structural evidences the observed changes that occur in this structure with changing temperatures.

(1) The anomeric effect, 1290 Gals. /mole. (2) An acetoxymethyl group on carbon 5 enhances the anomeric effect by 220 call,/mole. (3) The skew interaction between two acetoxy groups, O/O-H/H, is 540 cals,/mole. (4) The diaxial interaction between an acetoxy group and a hydrogen atom, H:O-H:H, is 180 cals. /mole. (5) The diaxial interaction between two acetoxy groups, O:O-H:H, is 2020 cals/mole. These interaction energies are all related to the interaction term H/O-H/H, that is the skew interaction between an acetoxy group and a hydrogen atom relative to the same inter action between two hydrogen atoms. The above values for the interaction energies are based on the assumption that the value of H/O-H/H is negligibly small. This type of assumption has been made by all previous workers in the field of conformational analysis and is required for a comparison of the values presently obtained with those values of similar interactions reported in the literature. The acetylated amono-sugars with an acetamido group on carbon. 2 or 3 were found to undergo anomalous anomerization reactions, These results could be due to the formation of stable oxazolinium or oxazinium ions in the anomerization media. The relative stabilities of the transition states in the anomerization of the acetylated aldopyranoses were examined in a number of different ways. It was concluded that the results would best be rationalized on the basis of a bimolecular mechanism. Conformational analyses of the transition states indicated that the activated complexes of the aldopentopyranose tetraacetates may assume a half-chair form. However, a deformed chair seemed more plausible for the transition states of the al dohexopyranose pentaacetates. The reason for this difference between the pentoses and hexoses is discussed. The reaction of the base-catalyzed anomerization of the D-glucopyranose pentaacetates was investigated.

Abstract ASSESSMENT OF THE ROLE THAT SECOND MOLARS PLAY IN BITE-OPENING DURING ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT IN ADOLESCENTS: A RETROSPECTIVE, CEPHALOMETRIC STUDY DEGREE DATE: DECEMBER 6, 2013 Christopher B. Trockel, D. D. S. COLLEGE OF DENTAL MEDICINE NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY Thesis Directed By: Shiva Khatami D. D. S., Ph. D, Committee Chair Mark Hall, D. D. S., Committee Member Abraham Lifshitz, Committee Member Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the role that second molars play in increasing the facial vertical dimension by comparing vertical changes experienced in growing patients, who had their second molars incorporated into the orthodontic appliance, with those that did not. The study investigated associations between the vertical changes experienced through treatment and the initial vertical classification of the patients (normo-, hypo-, and hyperdivergent). Background: Many studies have investigated the changes in the vertical dimensions that occur in orthodontic treatment. It has been shown that almost all orthodontic appliances produce extrusion whether desired or not. In theory, this extrusion may lead to an increase of the skeletal vertical dimension. Conventional wisdom says that second molars {{play a significant role in}} vertical control during treatment. Therefore, some practitioners advocate viii incorporating the second molars as soon as possible in treatment to help open the bite. It is also thought that it may be wise to not incorporate the second molars during treatment at all in cases with an open bite tendency. Methods: Eighty de-identified pre-treatment cephalometric radiographs (40 with second molars bonded and 40 without second molars bonded) from growing patients treated at the orthodontic clinic at Nova Southeastern University were analyzed and compared to their post-treatment analogs. Twelve linear and angular measurements were made (overbite, maxillary molar to palatal plane, mandibular molar to mandibular plane, upper anterior dentoalveolar height, lower anterior dentoalveolar height, upper anterior facial height, lower anterior facial height, total posterior facial height, lower posterior facial height, UAFH/LAFH ratio, mandibular plane angle, and Y-axis). Results: The results indicated that the vertical dimension was not significantly altered based solely on whether or not the second molars were incorporated into the orthodontic appliance. Changes experienced by both groups (bonded and <b>non</b> <b>bonded)</b> and all three subgroups (hypo-, normo-, and hyperdivergent) were consistent with what would be expected for growth alone. Conclusion: Bonding second molars in a growing population during orthodontic treatment does not significantly affect the vertical dimension, regardless of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s initial skeletal vertical classification...|$|E

The aim of this work is devoted to study the inhibition characteristics of these compounds for acid corrosion of C 38 steel using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Data obtained from EIS show a frequency distribution and therefore a modeling element with frequency dispersion behaviour, a constant phase element (CPE) has been used. The experimental results obtained revealed that these compounds inhibited the steel corrosion in acid solution and the protection efficiency increased with increasing inhibitors concentration. The difference in their inhibitive action can be explained {{on the basis of}} the number of oxygen atoms present in the polyether ring which contribute to the chemisorption strength through the donor acceptor <b>bond</b> between the <b>non</b> <b>bonding</b> electron pair and the vacant orbital of metal surface. Adsorption of n -MCTH was found to follow the Langmuir's adsorption isotherm. The thermodynamic functions of adsorption process were calculated and the interpretation of the results is given. These results are complemented with quantum chemical study in order to provide an explanation of the differences between the probed inhibitors. Correlation between the inhibition efficiency and the structure of these compounds are presented...|$|R
