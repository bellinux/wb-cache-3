40|$|Magnetic field {{monitoring}} with <b>NMR</b> <b>probes</b> {{has recently}} been introduced {{as a means of}} measuring the actual spatiotemporal magnetic field evolution during individual MR scans. Receive-only <b>NMR</b> <b>probes</b> as used thus far for this purpose impose significant practical limitations due to radiofrequency (RF) interference with the actual MR experiment. In this work these limitations are overcome with a transmit/receive (T/R) monitoring system based on RF-shielded <b>NMR</b> <b>probes.</b> The proposed system is largely autonomous and protected against RF contamination. As a consequence the field probes can be positioned freely and permit monitoring imaging procedures of arbitrary geometry and angulation. The T/R approach is also exploited to simplify probe manufacturing and remove constraints on material choices. Probe miniaturization permits monitoring imaging scans with nominal resolutions on the order of 400 microm. The added capabilities of the new probes and system are demonstrated by first in vivo results, obtained with monitored gradient-echo and spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) scans.

40|$|In this thesis, {{multiplex}} NMR methodology is described, {{which has}} the potential to significantly increase the throughput of NMR measurements. This novel methodology has possible applications in areas where large numbers of samples need to be analyzed. Multiple-coil NMR probes have been constructed to analyze multiple samples simultaneously using parallel detecting microcoils that were incorporated into a single RF circuit. Linear field gradients generated either by offsetting Z 1 shim from its optimal value or by pulsed field gradient coils were used to differentiate signals from different coils. Both one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR experiments have been carried out. Spectral analysis strategy, rapid selective excitation and chemical shift imaging methods have been developed to obtain well-resolved sub-spectra of samples in different NMR coils. Issues of quantitation, resolution, limit of detection and solvent suppression capabilities of the multiplex NMR probes were also investigated. In order to further improve the throughput of NMR analysis, the possibility of realizing automated multiple-sample NMR detection using the multiplex <b>NMR</b> <b>probe</b> is also studied.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry (MS) {{are two of}} the best analytical approaches for identifying and quantifying small molecule metabolites. However, only a few hundred out of thousands of endogenous human metabolites are typically detected due to a range of issues, such as limitations in sensitivity, resolution, reproducibility and throughput, and complexity of the biological samples. Thus, to tackle these limitations, this dissertation work presents a combination of approaches, such as microcoil <b>NMR</b> <b>probe</b> instrumentation, sample preparation and NMR/MS experimental/hyphenation techniques with liquid chromatography (LC). Specifically, the work is focused on instrumental designs, and their practical applications focused on simplifying the analytical study by reducing the complexity of the metabolic samples.
