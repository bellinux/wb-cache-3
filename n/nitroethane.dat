40|$|Abstract: An {{integrated}} Feynman path integral-free energy perturbation and umbrella sampling (PI-FEP/UM) {{method has}} been used to investigate the kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) in the proton transfer reaction between <b>nitroethane</b> and acetate ion in water. In the present study, both nuclear and electronic quantum effects are explicitly treated for the reacting system. The nuclear quantum effects are represented by bisection sampling centroid path integral simulations, while the potential energy surface is described by a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potential. The accuracy essential for computing KIEs is achieved by a FEP technique that transforms the mass of a light isotope into a heavy one, which is equivalent to the perturbation of the coordinates for the path integral quasiparticle in the bisection sampling scheme. The PI-FEP/UM method is applied to the proton abstraction of <b>nitroethane</b> by acetate ion in water through molecular dynamics simulations. The rule of the geometric mean and the Swain–Schaad exponents for various isotopic substitutions at the primary and secondary sites have been examined. The computed total deuterium KIEs are in accord with experiments. It is found that the mixed isotopic Swain–Schaad exponents are very close to the semiclassical limits, suggesting that tunneling effects do not significantly affect this property for the reaction between <b>nitroethane</b> and acetate ion in aqueous solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of <b>nitroethane</b> with NO {{in the presence}} of O₂ has been investigated over Cu-MFI. For short periods on-line, conversion is complete above 250 °C with CO₂ and N₂ as the products. However, at temperatures below 330 °C accumulation of deposits leads to deactivation with the appearance of isocyanates and CO. FTIR gas analysis confirms the formation of toxic methyl isocyanate (CH₃NCO), with yields approaching 25 % along with smaller amounts of isocyanic acid (HNCO). Nitromethane reacts similarly but deactivation to give HNCO alone is an order of magnitude slower. Emergence of HNCO is accompanied by significant amounts of HCN and NH₃. <b>Nitroethane</b> reacts in O₂ alone {{in a manner similar to}} that in NO/O₂ but with less than half the initial N₂ yield. Deactivation is faster and small amounts of HCN and NH₃ appear concurrently with CH₃NCO and HNCO. In the <b>nitroethane</b> system, HNCO, HCN, and NH₃ arise from decomposition of deposited material as demonstrated by the temperature–programmed decomposition in helium. The main reaction pathway with the two nitrocompounds appears to be rearrangement followed by dehydration to the corresponding isocyanate and hydrolysis to amine (or ammonia), with the latter steps proceeding on Brønsted acid sites. Nitrogen is then formed by reaction with NO/O₂ on the transition metal as in the ammonia-selective catalytic reaction which is fast over Cu-MFI. A parallel route to N₂ involves {{reaction of}} NO₂ with deposited material but this can occur only as long as the catalyst retains activity for the oxidation of NO. Otherwise deactivation ensues with appearance of isocyanate. Selective catalytic reduction of NO using ethane over Cu-MFI in excess O₂ yields some NO₂ in which case the various reactions involving <b>nitroethane</b> would be sufficiently fast for it to be an intermediate in this system. 8 page(s...|$|E
