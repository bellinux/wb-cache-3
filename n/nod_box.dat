40|$|Induction of nod {{genes in}} Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium species is {{dependent}} on the presence of plant-produced flavonoids, the NodD protein, and the cis-acting <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> promoter sequence. Although the nodD (nodD 1) gene in Rhizobium species is constitutively expressed, nodD 1 expression in Bradyrhizobium japonicum is inducible by isoflavones {{in a manner similar to}} that of the nodYABC operon. A consensus <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> sequence is found 5 ' of the nodYABC operon, whereas a presumptive, nod box-like sequence is found 5 ' of the nodD 1 gene. As an initial step toward examining the nodD 1 promoter, the transcriptional start sites of the nodD 1 and nodYABC operons were determined and found to be 44 and 28 bp, respectively, downstream of their respective <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> sequences. A series of deletions of the nodD 1 promoter were constructed and fused to the lacZ gene. Analysis of the activity of these deletions clearly showed that the divergent <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> sequence was essential for nodD 1 induction by isoflavones or soybean seed extract. The induction of nodD 1 expression requires NodD 1, as tested in B. japonicum and in a heterologous system, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. On the basis of these data, we analyzed the published <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> sequences and propose a new consensus sequence composed of paired 9 -bp repeats. Analysis of the nodD 1 <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> and synthetic constructs of the nocYABC <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> indicate that at least two 9 -bp repeats are required for NodD 1 -mediated induction. Furthermore, insertions between the paired repeats of the nodYABC <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> suggest that orientation of the repeats on opposite faces of the DNA helix is essential for maximum nod gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Rhizobium leguminosarum NodD binds to the <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> of the {{inducible}} nod gene nodA as a V-shaped tetramer {{and bends}} the <b>nod</b> <b>box.</b> In this work, {{we show that}} the nod gene inducer naringenin decreased gel mobility of <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> DNA–NodD complexes by sharpening the NodD-induced DNA bend, which correlated with nodA transcription activation. NodD can induce different DNA bends when {{the distance between the}} two half-sites of the <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> was modified, which severely affected NodD-mediated transcriptional control. One or two base pairs were deleted from, or inserted into, the two half-sites of the <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> of nodA. Circular permutation assays showed that such distance modulations allowed NodD to induce relaxed or sharpened DNA bending. In the case of 1 bp deletion, where the DNA bends were more relaxed than in the wild type, nodA transcription was repressed both in the absence and in the presence of inducer naringenin. In the cases of 1 and 2 bp insertion, where the DNA bends were much sharper than in wild type in the absence or presence of the inducer naringenin, nodA transcription was initiated constitutively with no requirement for the inducer naringenin or, even, the NodD regulating protein...|$|E
40|$|Nodulation of {{leguminous plants}} by Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Azorhizobium spp. is {{dependent}} on the induction by the plant host of different bacterial nodulation (nod) loci. The transcription of these nod loci is activated in the presence of plant-produced flavonoids upon binding of the NodD protein [...] a LysR-type activator [...] to specific sequences present in the nod promoters. Originally, a 47 -base-pair (bp) region called the <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> was shown to be the target sequence for binding of NodD. From the comparison of the <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> sequences of (brady) rhizobia with a more divergent <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> from Azorhizobium caulinodans, we now propose a modular build-up of the <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> with the sequence A-T-C-N 9 -G-A-T as the binding target of the NodD protein (the NodD box). More generally, we show that LysR-type-regulated promoters contain the characteristic sequence T-N 11 -A as the core of an inverted repeat and propose this to be the "LysR motif" involved in specific binding to LysR-type proteins. Data obtained upon site-specific mutagenesis of this motif in the NodD box sustains this proposal. Further, we provide strong arguments that the inducer flavonoid, involved in transcriptional activation of Azorhizobium nod genes, interacts directly with the NodD protein, thereby increasing its binding affinities for the NodD box...|$|E

40|$|In Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae, the {{regulatory}} nodulation nodD gene {{has at least}} two functions. It constitutively represses its own transcription and {{in the presence of}} inducer flavonoid molecules, it activates the expression of two other nod gene transcriptional units, nodABCIJ and nodFE.

In the present study, we show, using gel retardation, that in crude extracts of bacteroids of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar (bv.) viciae, NodD protein does not bind to the nodF, nodM, and nodO box and that it binds only weakly to the nodA box. Binding of NodD from bacteroids to <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> DNA could be restored by mild proteinase K treatment, indicating that NodD is present in bacteroids in an altered form or complex which prevents its binding to <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> DNA. In addition, a novel nodA box DNA-protein complex was found which is specific for the nodA promoter region. This novel complex was formed neither with material from cultured bacterial cells nor with an extract from uninfected roots, {{and it did not}} contain NodD but another protein. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the protein present in the novel retardation complex acts as a transcriptional repressor causing the decreased nodD expression in bacteroids.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we show that}} the Sinorhizobium fredii HH 103 ttsI gene is {{essential}} for the expression of the tts genes and secretion of nodulation outer proteins (Nops). Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that the <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> preceding ttsI is necessary for Nops secretion. TtsI is responsible for the transcriptional activation of nopX, nopA, rhcJ and rhcQ. We confirm that the S. fredii HH 103 ttsI gene is activated by NodD 1 and repressed by NolR. In contrast, NodD 2 is not involved in the regulation of ttsI expression. Despite the dependence of expression of both ttsI and nodA on NodD 1 and flavonoids, clear differences in the capacity of some flavonoids to activate these genes were found. The expression of the ttsI and nodA genes was also sensitive to differences in the pH of the media. Secretion of Nops in the ttsI mutant could not be complemented with a DNA fragment containing the ttsI gene and its <b>nod</b> <b>box,</b> but it was restored when a plasmid harbouring the ttsI, rhcC 2 and y 4 xK genes was transferred to the mutant strain.

40|$|Sinorhizobium fredii HH 103 is a rhizobial soybean {{symbiont}} that exhibits {{an extremely}} broad host-range.

Immediately downstream from nodD, a repeated element, delta 1, has been described [Goethals et al., Mel. Plant-Microbe Interact. 5 (1992) 405 - 411]. The elements epsilon 1 and delta 1 form the borders of a shift in GC content between nodD and its surrounding sequences. delta 1 and the ORF 1 +ORF 2 sequence both occur as two copies in the Ac genome. Based on these observations, we postulate that the repeated elements {{played a role in the}} horizontal transfer of nodD during evolution. Insertion mutations in epsilon 1 and delta 1 did not influence the induction of the nodulation operon, nodABCSUIJ, and had no effect on the nodulation behavior on Sesbania rostrata. lacZ fusion studies suggested that nodD is constitutively transcribed and that the promoter driving nodD expression overlaps with the ORF 1 sequence.

Finally, both wild-type and green fluorescent protein-expressing transconjugant strains of Br 3461 and MAP 3 - 5 produced N 2 -fixing nodules on their original hosts, Mimosa bimucronata (Br 3461) and Mimosa pigra (MAP 3 - 5), and hence this confirms strongly that Burkholderia strains can form effective symbioses with legumes.

40|$|Rhizobium (Sinorhizobium) sp. strain NGR 234 {{contains}} three replicons, {{the smallest}} of which (pNGR 234 a) carries most symbiotic genes, including those required for nodulation and lipo-chito-oligosaccharide (Nod factor) biosynthesis. Activation of nod gene expression depends on plant-derived flavonoids, NodD transcriptional activators, and <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> promoter elements. Nod boxes NB 6 and NB 7 delimit six different types of genes, one of which (fixF) {{is essential for the}} formation of effective nodules on Vigna unguiculata. In vegetative culture, wild-type NGR 234 produces a distinct, flavonoid-inducible lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is not produced by the mutant (NGRΩfixF); this LPS is also found in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids isolated from V. unguiculata infected with NGR 234. Electron microscopy showed that peribacteroid membrane formation is perturbed in nodule cells infected by the fixF mutant. LPSs were purified from free-living NGR 234 cultured in the presence of apigenin. Structural analyses showed that the polysaccharide portions of these LPSs are specialized, rhamnose-containing O antigens attached to a modified core-lipid A carrier. The primary sequence of the O antigen is [- 3) -α-l-Rhap-(1, 3) -α-l-Rhap-(1, 2) -α-l-Rhap-(1 -]n, and the LPS core region lacks the acidic sugars commonly associated with the antigenic outer core of LPS from noninduced cells. This rhamnan O antigen, which is absent from noninduced cells, has the same primary sequence as the A-band O antigen of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, except that it is composed of l-rhamnose rather than the d-rhamnose characteristic of the latter. It is noteworthy that A-band LPS is selectively maintained on the P. aeruginosa cell surface during chronic cystic fibrosis lung infection, where it is associated with an increased duration of infection...|$|E
40|$|Background Rhizobium tropici strain CIAT 899 {{establishes}} effective symbioses {{with several}} legume species, including Phaseolus vulgaris and Leucaena leucocephala. This bacterium synthesizes a large variety of nodulation factors {{in response to}} nod-gene inducing flavonoids and, surprisingly, also under salt stress conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify differentially expressed genes in the presence of both inducer molecules, and analyze the promoter regions located upstream of these genes. Results Results obtained by RNA-seq analyses of CIAT 899 induced with apigenin, a nod gene-inducing flavonoid for this strain, or salt allowed the identification of 19 and 790 differentially expressed genes, respectively. Fifteen of these genes were up-regulated in both conditions and were involved in the synthesis of both Nod factors and indole- 3 -acetic acid. Transcription of these genes was presumably activated through binding of at least one of the five NodD proteins present in this strain to specific <b>nod</b> <b>box</b> promoter sequences when the bacterium was induced by both apigenin and salt. Finally, under saline conditions, many other transcriptional responses were detected, including an increase in the transcription of genes involved in trehalose catabolism, chemotaxis and protein secretion, as well as ribosomal genes, and a decrease in the transcription of genes involved in transmembrane transport. Conclusions To our knowledge this is the first time that a transcriptomic study shows that salt stress induces the expression of nodulation genes in the absence of flavonoids. Thus, in the presence of both nodulation inducer molecules, apigenin and salt, R. tropici CIAT 899 up-regulated the same set of symbiotic genes. It could be possible that the increases in the transcription levels of several genes related to nodulation under saline conditions could represent a strategy to establish symbiosis under abiotic stressing conditions.
