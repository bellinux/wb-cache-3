5|$|After {{it first}} came to light in October, {{it was found that}} it had been posted to YouTube several months earlier, along with a {{similarly}} threatening message in binary code. The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth about how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at his family's old summer house, Roche explains {{exactly what happened}} the night of Samantha's abduction. However, Mulder tells him {{that the house was}} bought by his father after Samantha's abduction, convincing him that Roche is <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth. Mulder plans to bring Roche back to prison, but—following another dream about Samantha—awakens to find Roche gone, with his badge, gun, and phone stolen.|$|E
25|$|Officers, {{including}} Bowie County Sheriff Presley, Miller County Sheriff Davis, Texas City Chief of Police Runnels, their {{officers and}} both State Police departments worked {{day and night}} for six months trying to validate Peggy Swinney's story of their whereabouts. They deduced that Peggy was <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth and that, {{on the night of the}} murder of Booker and Martin, the couple was sleeping in their car under a bridge near San Antonio.|$|E

You do <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> board about your commercial relationship with a person who has a contract with the NKF. Is that transparency?" ...|$|R
25|$|Gates {{consistently}} {{testified that}} he first heard on October 1, 1986, from Charles E. Allen, the national intelligence officer who was closest to the Iran initiative, that proceeds from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the Contras. Other evidence proves, however, that Gates received {{a report on the}} diversion during the summer of 1986 from DDI Richard Kerr. The issue was whether the Independent Counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gates was deliberately <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth when he later claimed not to have remembered any reference to the diversion before meeting with Allen in October.|$|E
25|$|On July 19, 2010, Ellerbe {{denied that}} {{negotiations}} ever took place {{and nothing was}} ever agreed on. Ellerbe stated: Here are the facts: Al Haymon, Richard Schaefer and myself {{speak to each other}} on a regular basis and the truth is no negotiations have ever taken place nor was there ever a deal agreed upon by Team Mayweather or Floyd Mayweather to fight Manny Pacquiao on November 13. Either Ross Greenburg or Bob Arum is <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth, but history tells us who is lying. Three days later, Schaefer backed Ellerbe's statement that negotiations never took place.|$|E
25|$|Wilson became {{increasingly}} concerned that Tudor, with the connivance of Lloyd George, {{who loved to}} drop hints to that effect, was operating an unofficial policy of killing IRA men in reprisal {{for the deaths of}} pro-Crown forces. Wilson wrote to Macready (June 1920) that “the discipline and good name of the Army is worth half a dozen Irelands” – although sympathetic, he had been deeply concerned to hear of troops smashing up Fermoy in reprisal for the kidnapping of General Cuthbert. However, Macready also told Wilson that the Army was arranging “accidents” for suspected IRA men, but <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> politicians as he did not want them “talked and joked about after dinner by Cabinet Ministers”. Lloyd George refused to formally declare martial law, not least because in July 1920 the Amritsar Massacre (of April 1919) was being debated by Parliament.|$|E

25|$|However, Ah Jie and Kai Qi's {{happiness}} is short lived {{when her father}} {{is part of a}} gang that kidnaps Ah Jie's brother for ransom. Kai Qi knowing her father is one of the cohorts protects him from the police by withholding information about the kidnappers identities when she thinks this will cause her to lose her new-found happiness with Ah Jie. Soon Ah Jie's brother is found badly injured in a comatose state, the authorities show Ah Jie's family that Kai Qi's father is one of the kidnappers. Ah Jie becomes furious with Kai Qi and blames her for <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> authorities earlier as it might have saved his brother from serious injuries. Due to her father's actions Kai Qi is too ashamed to face others and starts to revert to her isolated self, but once Ah Jie's anger cools down he tries hard to overlook what her father has done to save their relationship.|$|E
25|$|It is {{revealed}} that Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) {{is trying to}} get revenge on the Mitchells, especially Phil, because he believes Phil's father, Eric, murdered his own father, Henry, many years earlier. Their feud leads to Phil abducting Vincent's daughter Pearl Fox-Hubbard, with the two threatening to shoot each other, and Vincent trying to strangle Phil to death, though Vincent decides to end the feud when innocent Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) is accidentally killed. Phil's drinking worsens and he drives while intoxicated, with Ian and Dennis in the car. Distracted, Phil crashes the car, and Dennis is badly injured. In exchange for Sharon <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> police about Bobby killing Lucy, Phil agrees with Ian that Ian will take the blame for causing the crash. While Dennis is being attended to, a doctor tells Phil that his scans showed he has cirrhosis, a disease garnered from his alcoholism. The doctor warns Phil that without treatment, he could die, but Phil remains in denial about this. He later researches cirrhosis online at home and when he finds out that Dennis is recovering, decides to give up drinking and rushes to the hospital to tell Sharon that he will always stand by her.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} season Brian Benben and Caterina Scorsone were {{upgraded}} to series regulars. The season {{begins with the}} aftermath of Dell's death, including his funeral {{and what happens to}} his daughter Betsey. Violet and Pete get married in the season premiere and finally begin a new life with their son Lucas. Addison and Sam reveal their romance to the staff of Oceanside Wellness, which causes Naomi to leave town to learn to accept their new relationship. Cooper and Charlotte's relationship continues to get stronger as they get engaged. Charlotte is raped and badly beaten by one of the patients at her hospital and decides to only tell Addison and make her keep it a secret. Charlotte later decides she does not want to tell anyone she was raped, not even Cooper. Later everyone finds out but Charlotte won't identify Lee McHenry, her rapist. Later we find out Violet was raped while she was in college. Charlotte finally decides to identify Lee because Sheldon tells her to do so. She goes to the police station, but since she did not accuse him and because of the long history of Charlotte <b>not</b> <b>telling,</b> <b>the</b> lawyer does not accept to charge Lee, who is later stabbed by his girl friend in self-defense. She tells the authorities about almost getting killed, which finally leads to Lee's arrest, but before this, he is saved at the surgeon's slab with Charlotte granting the procedure in spite of her being victimized by him. In the season finale it was decided that they will close down Oceanside Wellness and open another practice; and Naomi decides {{it would be best to}} move to New York to be with Gabriel.|$|E

500|$|In {{the general}} election, Carroll faced Republican Robert E. Gable, a coal company owner. The main {{issue of the}} {{campaign}} was the imposition of desegregation busing on the city of Louisville. Both candidates opposed the busing, but Gable did so more vehemently and criticized the sitting governor for not [...] "doing something about it". In a televised debate with Carroll, Gable insisted on using {{what he called a}} [...] "truth bell". Gable rang the bell every time that he perceived that Carroll was <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth. Eventually, the moderator of the debate, newspaper publisher Al Smith, ordered Gable to put the bell away, and Gable's credibility suffered in the eyes of voters. Carroll won the general election by a vote of 470,159 to 277,998, representing a record margin of victory in the Kentucky governor's race. He carried every congressional district including Jefferson County, where a Democrat had not won a race in 20 years. His separately selected running mate, Thelma Stovall, became the first woman elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky.|$|E
500|$|The {{affidavit}} {{filed by}} authorities supporting the arrest warrant for Ward showed that investigators had concluded {{the men were}} <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth about what happened. The report states [...] "The evidence demonstrates that Robert Wone was restrained, incapacitated, sexually assaulted, and murdered inside 1509 Swann Street," [...] and there exists [...] "overwhelming evidence, far in excess of probable cause" [...] that Price, Zaborsky, and Ward [...] "obstructed justice by altering and orchestrating the crime scene, planting evidence, delaying the reporting of the murder to the authorities, and lying to the police about the true circumstances of the murder." [...] Lawyers for the three accused men have called the affidavit [...] "speculation, innuendo, assumptions, and irrelevant inflammatory comments" [...] and maintain their clients' innocence. Price and Zaborsky were domestic partners, and the affidavit alleges that Price had previously had {{a sexual relationship with}} Ward. Washington attorney Dale Sanders opined that the release of the extensively detailed affidavit was intended to turn one of the housemates, presumably Ward, against the others, and hypothesized that it indicated prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to charge any of the housemates with additional crimes without the cooperation of a witness.|$|E

[...] The Baltimore Sun commented on the inherently riveting subject matter and noted that the top-notch reporting and podcast format yield [...] "a novel twist on the investigative long-form piece".|$|E

About the case itself, she said her lawyer had instructed her not to discuss it with anyone; she ignored a specific question about whether she had indeed run out of gas that morning.|$|E

2500|$|After {{his return}} to politics, Gyurcsány was at first tight-lipped on his {{religious}} affiliation, leading many to assume {{that he is an}} atheist. In an interview aired on TV2 during the 2006 parliamentary election campaign, Gyurcsány said that as a teenager, he [...] "took part in confirmation for about two years" [...] and even considered becoming a priest. Since confirmation can only be taken once, some regarded this claim as a giveaway that he was <b>not</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth, while others such as Catholic bishop Endre Gyulay supposed he meant he took part in preparations for a confirmation.|$|E

In some versions, they stop talking, start listening and collaborate to [...] "see" [...] the full elephant. In another, a sighted man enters the parable and describes the entire elephant from various perspectives, the blind men then learn {{that they were all}} partially correct and partially wrong.
