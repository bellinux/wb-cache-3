5|$|Fuseli's <b>Nightmare</b> reverberated with twentieth-century {{psychological}} theorists. In 1926, American writer Max Eastman paid a {{visit to}} Sigmund Freud and claimed to have seen a print of The <b>Nightmare</b> displayed next to Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson in Freud's Vienna apartment. Psychoanalyst and Freud biographer Ernest Jones chose another version of Fuseli's painting as the frontispiece of his book On the <b>Nightmare</b> (1931); however, neither Freud nor Jones mentioned these paintings in their writings about dreams. Carl Jung included The <b>Nightmare</b> and other Fuseli works in his Man and His Symbols (1964).|$|E

40|$|Posttraumatic <b>nightmares</b> are {{considered}} as a reexperiencing symptom of the DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. Different types of posttraumatic <b>nightmares,</b> however, may differ in their relation to psychopathology. Thirty-two children were longitudinally assessed 10 days, 2 months, and 6 months after traffic accidents. Occurrence and characteristics of <b>nightmares</b> were examined and their relation to psychopathology assessed. Thirty-four percent of children reported posttraumatic <b>nightmares</b> during at least one assessment. Exact replicative <b>nightmares</b> at baseline assessment predicted PTSD symptoms 2 and 6 months postaccident, but not depressive symptoms. Exact replicative <b>nightmares</b> revealed the strongest cross-sectional association with trauma-specific psychopathology but not with depression. The authors conclude that posttraumatic <b>nightmares</b> [...] especially exact replicative ones [...] may be closely related to psychopathological mechanisms of posttraumatic stress in children...|$|R
30|$|<b>Nightmares</b> {{may be due}} to genetic, organic or {{psychological}} factors. Psychological stress often accompanies the occurrence of <b>nightmares,</b> for example typical life events that are stressful in nature can create enough significant anxiety to cause <b>nightmares</b> (Langston 2007).|$|R
5|$|Light House {{intentionally}} references the satirical {{novels of}} the early 19th-century British author and satirist Thomas Love Peacock, such as Headlong Hall and <b>Nightmare</b> Abbey. Peacock's novels have little plot and are best known for parodying the intellectual modes and pretenses of his contemporaries; his characters normally assemble in characteristic English country houses and predominantly engage in conversation. <b>Nightmare</b> Abbey satirized the English romantic movement and included characters based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E

50|$|Another study {{researching the}} causes of <b>nightmares</b> focuses on {{patients}} suffering from sleep apnea. The {{study was conducted to}} prove whether or not <b>nightmares</b> may be caused by sleep apnea, or being unable to breathe. In the nineteenth century, authors believed that <b>nightmares</b> were caused by not having enough oxygen, therefore it was believed that those with sleep apnea had more frequent <b>nightmares</b> than those without. The hypothesis, however, was proven wrong and the results actually showed that healthy people have more <b>nightmares</b> than the sleep apnea patients.|$|R
40|$|<b>Nightmares</b> are {{relatively}} common sleep complaints {{that seem to}} be associated with affective distress. To date, few {{attempts have been made to}} link <b>nightmares</b> to the biological markers of the stress response, and the HPA response in particular. The present study examined the relationship between frequent <b>nightmares</b> and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in a cross-sectional study of working women (N = 188). Analysis revealed that those who reported frequent <b>nightmares</b> (N = 13) showed a blunted CAR on a working day, compared to those who did not report <b>nightmares.</b> This result was independent of psychiatric symptoms, demographic variables, and lifestyle. Our preliminary findings suggest that decreased HPA reactivity might be a trait-like feature of women with frequent <b>nightmares...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Dreams hold {{particular}} {{relevance in}} mental health work with American Indians (AIs). <b>Nightmares</b> are a common sequelae of trauma and a frequent defi ning feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite mounting evidence of the prevalence of trauma and PTSD among AIs and the important cultural role of dreams, no work to date has directly examined <b>nightmares</b> in trauma. Drawing from epidemiological and clinical sources, data are presented about <b>nightmares</b> among Northern Plains AI veterans. <b>Nightmares</b> are common among these veterans: 97 % of combat veterans with PTSD report <b>nightmares.</b> These rates are higher than rates among other veteran populations. The frequency of <b>nightmares</b> and sleep disturbances increases with trauma and PTSD severity in this population. Qualitative materials, {{in the form of}} a brief cultural overview and a case presentation, are included to illustrate clinical and cultural contexts of <b>nightmares</b> in the Northern Plains. Clinicians working with this population should be aware of the high frequency and cultural context of <b>nightmares</b> for AI veterans. In order to improve culturally appropriate care, further research is needed to better understand the frequency, meaning, and context of <b>nightmares</b> in trauma and PTSD for AI populations...|$|R

5|$|Tate Britain held an {{exhibition}} titled Gothic Nightmares: Fuseli, Blake and the Romantic Imagination between 15 February and 1 May 2006, with the <b>Nightmare</b> {{as the central}} exhibit. The catalogue indicated the painting's influence on films such as the original Frankenstein (1931) and The Marquise of O (1976). Among modern artists, Balthus incorporated elements of The <b>Nightmare</b> in his work (e.g., The Room, 1952–54).|$|E
5|$|The Royal Academy {{exhibition}} brought Fuseli and {{his painting}} enduring fame. The exhibition included Shakespeare-themed works by Fuseli, which won him {{a commission to}} produce eight paintings for publisher John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery. One version of The <b>Nightmare</b> hung {{in the home of}} Fuseli's close friend and publisher Joseph Johnson, gracing his weekly dinners for London thinkers and writers. The <b>Nightmare</b> was widely plagiarised, and parodies of it were commonly used for political caricature, by George Cruikshank, Thomas Rowlandson, and others. In these satirical scenes, the incubus afflicts subjects such as Napoleon Bonaparte, Louis XVIII, British politician Charles James Fox, and Prime Minister William Pitt. In another example, admiral Lord Nelson is the demon, and his mistress Emma, Lady Hamilton, the sleeper. While some observers have viewed the parodies as mocking Fuseli, {{it is more likely that}} The <b>Nightmare</b> was simply a vehicle for ridicule of the caricatured subject. The Danish painter, Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard, whom Fuseli had met in Rome, produced his own version of The <b>Nightmare</b> (Danish: Mareridt) which develops on the eroticism of Fuseli's work. Abildgaard's painting shows two naked women asleep in the bed; it is the woman in the foreground who is experiencing the <b>nightmare</b> and the incubus — which is crouched on the woman's stomach, facing her parted legs — has its tail nestling between her exposed breasts.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis and {{medication}} {{can only be}} given to patients that report the recurring <b>nightmares</b> to a psychiatrist or other physician. Medications like prazosin are sometimes used to treat <b>nightmares</b> in people with PTSD. Therapy usually helps {{to deal with the}} frightening themes of the <b>nightmares</b> and alleviate the recurrence of the dreams. The persistent <b>nightmares</b> will usually improve as the patient gets older. Treatments are generally very successful.|$|R
40|$|This study details {{results of}} an open trial of a group {{psychological}} treatment for Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic posttraumatic <b>nightmares</b> called “Imagery Rescripting and Exposure Therapy” (IRET). IRET is a variant of a successful imagery rescripting treatment for civilian trauma-related <b>nightmares</b> that was modified {{to address the needs}} of the Veteran population. Thirtyseven male U. S. Veterans with PTSD and <b>nightmares</b> attended 6 multicomponent group sessions. Findings indicated that the intervention significantly reduced frequency of <b>nightmares</b> and PTSD severity, as well as increased hours of sleep. Unlike the few open trials examining treatment of <b>nightmares</b> in Veterans, effect sizes in this study were similar to those that have been found in the civilian randomized controlled trial. These preliminary findings suggest that a <b>nightmares</b> treatment can be adapted to successfully reduce distress associated with combat Veterans’ chronic <b>nightmares.</b> Clinical and research implications are discussed...|$|R
50|$|If the {{individual}} is on medication, the <b>nightmares</b> {{may be attributed to}} some side effects of the drug.

Spear & Sons to have input into how the game was developed, which was not the case with <b>Nightmare.</b> Village Roadshow was also involved with the game's development and with its release in the United States. The development ended six years after it started, with about six million dollars invested {{in the development of the}} game.|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with cancer}} often {{experience}} insomnia. <b>Nightmares</b> {{are also a}} strong factor that interferes with the maintenance of comfortable and satisfying sleep. However, the prevalence and standard treatment of <b>nightmares</b> in patients with cancer have not been established yet. We aimed to treat insomnia and <b>nightmares</b> with trazodone. From 2008 to 2011, trazodone was prescribed to 30 patients with cancer who reported experiencing insomnia with or without <b>nightmares</b> to the palliative care team in Osaka University Hospital. Effective treatment was seen in 15 patients (50 %). Four patients with cancer reported having severe <b>nightmares</b> and 2 patients had beneficial effects, with frightening dreams transformed into acceptable ones. Trazodone may be an effective drug {{for the treatment of}} insomnia and <b>nightmares</b> in patients with advanced cancer...|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from the}} single-player story, Undead <b>Nightmare</b> adds two {{multiplayer}} modes: Undead Overrun and Land Grab. The former is a horde mode in which {{up to four}} players cooperatively fight off waves of zombies. Players must open coffins between waves to replenish a countdown timer, which discourages players from camping in the same location. It is also designed so as to encourage cooperation such that players can revive each other if nearby. The other mode, Land Grab, is an additional game mode within the main game's multiplayer free roam and otherwise unconnected to the undead theme. In Land Grab, players attempt to secure seven areas across the game's environment. While players with the base game can join in Land Grab games, only Undead <b>Nightmare</b> owners can initiate them.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{direction}} of the predictive relationship between <b>nightmares</b> and suicidal behaviors is important to model its underlying mechanisms. We examine {{the direction}} of this relationship and the mediating role of negative affect. A fixed interval diary study obtained pre-sleep and post-sleep measures of affect, <b>nightmares,</b> and self-harmful thoughts and behaviors (SHTBs) from 72 university students (88. 9 % female). The results show predictive utility of <b>nightmares</b> on SHTBs - indicating a fourfold increased risk of SHTBs. Additionally, results support the suggestion of a unidirectional predictive influence (of <b>nightmares</b> on likelihood of SHTBs but not vice versa). Moreover, postsleep negative affect partially mediated the relationship between <b>nightmares</b> and postsleep SHTBs. This empirically validates assumptions of directionality for future models...|$|R
