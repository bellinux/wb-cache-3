In order to support the design of future <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements</b> it is useful to discuss how environmentally effective <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements</b> can be designed.

Based on three cases of <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements</b> regulating industrial energy consumption in Denmark, the Netherlands, and France, the adequacy of the OECD recommendations will be discussed.

The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreement</b> with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed—and, more importantly, whether it is accepted—by the Palestinian public.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the state}} of New York {{continued}} to assert a disputed claim that Vermont {{was a part of}} New York, Vermont could not be admitted to the Union under Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution until the legislature of New York consented. On March 6, 1790, the legislature made its consent contingent upon a <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreement</b> on the precise boundary between the two states. When commissioners from New York and Vermont met to decide on the boundary, Vermont's negotiators insisted on also settling the property ownership disputes with New Yorkers, rather than leaving that to be decided later in a federal court. The negotiations were successfully concluded in October 1790 with an agreement that Vermont would pay $30,000 to New York to be distributed among New Yorkers who claimed land in Vermont under New York land patents. In January 1791, a convention in Vermont voted 105–4 to petition Congress to become a state in the federal union. Congress acted on February 18, 1791 to admit Vermont to the Union as the 14th state as of March 4, 1791. Vermont became the first to enter the Union after the original 13 states.|$|E

30|$|In Queensland, {{mineral rights}} {{are owned by}} the State Government and mining {{companies}} need to get approval from the Commonwealth plus the State Government to proceed with a mine plan. The Commonwealth is concerned with matters of National Environmental Significance (e.g. rare or endangered species, and water quantity and quality), while the State is concerned with mineral rights, local environment, and social impacts. At the State level, there is new and changing legislation relevant to the political party and public perceptions/populist politics in government (which has a 3  year election cycle). There are multiagency, different statutory timeframe requirements, some legislation has timeframe limitations, and others do not. The coordination between government departments and between different legislation concerns is largely company-driven. Some of the steps and hurdles involved in mining lease approval in Queensland include (1) Environmental approval (including public consultation), (2) Strategic Cropping Land approval, (3) Landholder approval for access and surface disturbance (<b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements),</b> (4) Cultural Heritage approval (<b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements),</b> (5) Native Title approval (<b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements),</b> (6) Overlapping tenure holder approval (<b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements),</b> and (7) Local Government approval for access and services (<b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements).</b> In short, “the Queensland Government is committed to protecting the State’s best cropping land, called strategic cropping land, from development that will have an adverse impact on the productive capacity of the land”(Queensland Government 2014).|$|R

By 5 October, Zadar was completely surrounded by the JNA and the situation prompted Croatian authorities {{in the city to}} seek a ceasefire and negotiations. The ceasefire was arranged the same day, while the negotiations, held on 79 October, brought about the lifting of the JNA siege of Zadar and the evacuation of the remaining JNA garrison and its equipment from the city. The evacuation, involving seven JNA facilities, started on 11 October and took 15 days. The agreement stipulated that the evacuated units would leave Croatian soil and the JNA generally respected the obligation, even though twenty truckloads of weapons were left to the Serbian population in the hinterland around Zadar.|$|E

The House passed the Compromise Tariff by 119-85 and the Force Bill by 149-48.

2500|$|In some cases, a local {{business}} {{or even a}} multi-national company may choose to fund local air ambulance service as a goodwill or public relations gesture. Examples of this are common in the European Union, where in London the Virgin Corporation previously donated to the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service, and in Germany and the Netherlands {{a large number of}} the 'Christoph' air ambulance operations are actually funded by ADAC, Germany's largest automobile club and DRF Luftrettung. In Australia and New Zealand, many air ambulance helicopter operations are sponsored by the Westpac Bank. In these cases, the operation may vary, but {{is the result of a}} carefully <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreement</b> between government, EMS, hospitals, and the donor.

40|$|Governments in the European Union (EU) {{member states}} have {{invested}} considerable energies {{in recent years}} developing mechanisms to discharge their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse-gas emissions. The main focus of activity has been the industrial sector, which {{has been subjected to}} energy taxes, <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements,</b> and emissions-trading schemes. A priori critiques of these mechanisms have abounded; however, relatively little is known about their practical impacts on the environmental performance of affected industries and efforts to nurture corporate social responsibility. This paper reviews energy taxes and <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements</b> in the United Kingdom and Germany and concludes that <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements</b> are industry’s preferred instrument for encouraging corporate social responsibility. However, the design of the UK’s <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreements</b> may be instrumental in stimulating a sequential engagement by industries with climate-change. Evidence from business surveys suggests that an initial surge in improved energy management has occurred but moves towards more substantive investments have been more tentative. Although this can be explained partly by simple economics, it may be exacerbated by the structure of incentives created by UK policy. Issues of policy-instrument design are discussed along with principles for maintaining business competitiveness alongside genuine progress towards Kyoto targets...|$|R

2500|$|First, the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004, require {{undertakings}} with 50 or {{more employees}} to inform and consult on probable {{developments in the}} enterprise, changes to job structures, and contract changes - especially redundancies. Employees must voluntarily initiate an [...] "information and consultation procedure". If they do, but employers cannot find a <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreement,</b> a [...] "standard procedure" [...] model requires between 2 and 25 elected employee representatives having {{the right to be}} consulted on an ongoing basis: that is, an elected work council. A <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreement</b> can cover more issues than the model (for instance, to integrate health and safety issues in one council) if the parties choose. Crucially, consultation is not merely an exercise in management telling staff about their decisions, but requires meaningful dialogue [...] "with a view to reaching an agreement". This is [...] "an obligation to negotiate", similar to a duty to bargain in good faith. To start a procedure, at least 15 employees or 10 per cent of staff (whichever is higher) can request it. Occasionally, there could be a [...] "pre-existing" [...] council, or procedure in writing, covering all employees. If so, if it is not as good as the new method requested, and if the employer wants to keep it that way, a ballot must be held where over 50 per cent of staff favour a new procedure. For example, in Stewart v Moray Council, after 500 teachers requested a new procedure (over 10 per cent of staff, but under 40 per cent), the employer argued that a ballot had to be held, because the existing collective agreement with the union had a protocol on information and consultation. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, rejecting the employer's claim, held the pre-existing procedure was not good enough to force a ballot, because it did not explain how the views of staff would be sought. Employer currently face penalties up to £75,000 for failure to comply with the rules, though it is far from clear this is sufficient to ensure an [...] "effective remedy" [...] under EU law.|$|E
2500|$|The best {{alternative}} to a <b>negotiated</b> <b>agreement,</b> or BATNA is the alternative option a negotiator holds should the current negotiation fails and does not reach agreement. [...] The quality of a BATNA {{has the potential to}} improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward. One of the best strategy while going into a negotiation is to ensure that you have a strong BATNA, and if not, have tools equipped that can help you made the other side's BATNA weak. One of the major mistakes made by new negotiators is to disclose their BATNA at first without having had any discussion with the other side. This can jeopardise your position in the negotiation, as your negotiation might have been weaker than the other sides, and such disclosure puts you at a weaker spot in the negotiation. The best strategy is to {{ask a lot of questions}} to develop, if not an exact, but a guess about the other sides BATNA to know your position in the negotiation.|$|E
