The study concludes that significant similarities exist between paternal lines of Jews and Samaritans, but the maternal lines differ between the two populations. The pair-wise genetic distances (Fst) between 11 populations from AMOVA applied to the Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial data. For the Y-chromosome, all Jewish groups (except for the Ethiopian Jews) {{are closely related to}} each other and do <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> from the Samaritans (0.041) or Druze (0.033), but are different from Palestinian Arabs (0.163), Africans (0.219), and Europeans (0.111). This study indicated that the Samaritan and Jewish Y-chromosomes have a much greater affinity for the other than for their geographical neighbors, the Palestinian Arabs. This suggests the two share a common ancestral Near Eastern population preceding their divergence in the 4th century BCE, supporting the Samaritan narrative of descent from native Israelites who survived the Assyrian exile rather than from foreign populations introduced by the Assyrian Empire. However, the mtDNA results did not match other Jewish populations at all, supporting the Jewish narrative of the Assyrians displacing the population of the northern Israelite Kingdom. From these results the researchers concluded that the Samaritans are descended from Hebrew men and non-Hebrew women, confirming elements of both the Jewish and Samaritan narratives.|$|E

A low initial graft tension will not provide adequate joint stability, while excessive initial graft tension will restrain range of motion and is susceptible of early graft failure. Yoshia et al. studied the effect of initial graft tension on knee stability using an in vivo animal model [88]. They demonstrated that anteroposterior knee stability did <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>differ</b> between grafts fixed at 1 N and 39 N three months after surgery, however, knee joints with higher initial graft tension showed evidence of degenerative cartilage lesions.
