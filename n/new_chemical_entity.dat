25|$|This {{approval}} {{comes only}} after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials, {{as well as}} a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug (<b>new</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>entity,</b> or NCE), has been estimated at about 1.3 billion USD(not including marketing expenses). Professors Light and Lexchin reported in 2012, however, that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades.|$|E

2500|$|When a {{pharmaceutical}} company first markets a drug, {{it is usually}} under a patent that, until it expires, the company can use to exclude competitors by suing them for patent infringement. Pharmaceutical companies that develop new drugs generally only invest in drug candidates with strong patent protection as a strategy to recoup their costs to develop the drug (include {{the costs of the}} drug candidates that fail) and to make a profit. [...] The average cost to a brand-name company of discovering, testing, and obtaining regulatory approval for a new drug, with a <b>new</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>entity,</b> was estimated to be as much as $800 million in 2003 and $2.6 billion in 2014. [...] Drug companies that bring new products have several product line extension strategies they use to extend their exclusivity, some of which are seen as gaming the system and referred to by critics as [...] "evergreening", but at some point there is no patent protection available. [...] For as long as a drug patent lasts, a brand-name company enjoys a period of market exclusivity, or monopoly, in which the company is able to set the price of the drug at a level that maximizes profit. This profit often greatly exceeds the development and production costs of the drug, allowing the company to offset the cost of research and development of other drugs that are not profitable or do not pass clinical trials.|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, ‘Big Pharma’ has {{invested}} {{billions of dollars}} into ingenious and innovative strategies designed to develop drugs using high throughput screening of small molecule libraries generated on the laboratory bench. Within the same time frame, screening of natural products by pharmaceutical companies has suffered an equally significant reduction. This is {{despite the fact that}} the complexity, functional diversity and druggability of Nature’s natural product library are considered by many to be superior to any library any team of scientists can prepare. It is therefore no coincidence that the number of <b>New</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Entities</b> reaching the market has also suffered a substantial decrease, leading to a productivity crisis within the pharmaceutical sector. In fact, the current dearth of <b>New</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Entities</b> reaching the market in recent decades might be a direct consequence of the strategic decision to move away from screening of natural products. Nearly 700 novel drugs derived from natural product <b>New</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Entities</b> were approved between 1981 and 2010; more than 60 % of all approved drugs over the same time.
