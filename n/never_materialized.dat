5|$|The first {{proposal}} {{to build a}} fortification on Dragut Point {{was made by the}} Italian military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga in 1670. He proposed a fortified city known as Borgo della Città Piccola, with a design similar to Fort Ricasoli. The proposal <b>never</b> <b>materialized,</b> probably {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E

5|$|Linda passed {{very near}} Socorro Island. In addition, early {{forecasts}} predicted that Linda would make landfall in California. The landfall <b>never</b> <b>materialized</b> and warnings or watches were {{not necessary for}} any location. However, Linda caused large surf, which crashed ashore in California, where it swept five people off a jetty. Moisture related to Linda also contributed to a landslide in southern California that destroyed or damaged 79houses.|$|E
5|$|Tech kicker Chris Kinzer, who {{kicked the}} game-winning field goal, {{did not go}} on {{to play in the}} National Football League despite {{predictions}} that he might do so.

After a stop at Palermo, Sicily, she left the Mediterranean and headed for New York where she arrived on 14 September 1944.|$|E
5|$|Zappa later {{expanded}} on {{his television}} appearances in a non-musical role. He was an actor or voice artist in episodes of Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre, Miami Vice and The Ren & Stimpy Show.

5|$|By the 1990s Adkins {{had gained}} a cult {{following}} and began touring regularly, receiving offers from more record labels. In 1994 Miles Copeland III of I.R.S. Records purchased {{the rights to}} Adkins' recordings, and although an album was planned for release, it <b>never</b> <b>materialized.</b> Frustrated, Adkins soon gained back rights {{to some of his}} songs after a deal with Mississippi blues label Fat Possum, who recorded and released 1999's What The Hell Was I Thinking? and booked him a tour alongside T-Model Ford and Elmo Williams.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, {{poltergeist}} {{classes are}} created because the programmer anticipated {{the need for}} a more complex architecture. For example, a poltergeist arises if the same method acts as both the client and invoker in a Command pattern, and the programmer anticipates separating the two phases. However, this more complex architecture may actually <b>never</b> <b>materialize.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The mining {{industry}} {{relies heavily on}} federal land to produce minerals and meet market demands.

5000|$|The {{batteries}} on Long Point remained operational {{until the}} post was abandoned in 1872, {{but they were}} never used in combat.

5|$|Development {{for a pilot}} episode {{began in}} 2010, when 20th Century Fox Television and Imagine TV {{attempted}} to produce the concept {{in time for the}} 2010–11 television season; however, it <b>never</b> <b>materialized.</b> Its scripts were picked up by NBC in January 2011 and two months afterwards, principal photography for the episode commenced in Chicago, Illinois, where it occurred over a period of nine days. The pilot episode was heavily advertised in {{the weeks leading up to}} its premiere, as the show's producers collaborated with several companies such as Bloomingdale's to initiate cross-promotional advertising deals.|$|E
5|$|In November 2016, Kevin Smith {{said that}} he was open to having the Superman Lives script be adapted as an {{animated}} film, with Nicholas Cage voicing Superman and Michael Rooker voicing Lex Luthor.

According to Jelenic, Cage would have loved to voice Superman in the film, but the idea <b>never</b> <b>materialized</b> and Jelenic's pitch was eventually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following Caligaris release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to Caligari from Universum Film AG in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, which <b>never</b> <b>materialized</b> before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast Jean Cocteau as Cesare, and a script, believed to be written by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would have been replaced with a French surrealist style.|$|E
50|$|Sonny {{repeatedly}} {{turns her}} down, wanting {{to leave that}} life behind.

50|$|Based on {{mostly the}} same {{principles}} as the Nigerian 419 advance-fee fraud scam, this scam letter informs recipients that their e-mail addresses have been drawn in online lotteries {{and that they have}} won large sums of money.

5|$|When the Columbian Baseball League was {{forming in}} 1912, The New York Times named Shay {{as one of}} two {{candidates}} to manage the league's Kansas City team. The {{president of the new}} league, John T. Powers, said that the league would not serve as a third major league, but he noted that many players were eager to sign with the league after their contracts had expired in 1911. The league <b>never</b> <b>materialized.</b> One of its main investors, brewer Otto Stifel, withdrew his support of the league before play began.|$|E
5|$|As previous, the Swedish {{authorities}} {{continued to}} subsidize freight operations on their side, making it profitable for Swedish exports to go via the Baltic Sea. Hopes in Trondheim {{to act as}} a major transit port for Swedish cargo <b>never</b> <b>materialized.</b> The 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn paper mill saw an increase in transport of lumber from Sweden. The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests. A major customer was still Meråker Smelteverk, who used designated trains to haul ore from Muruvik to Kopperå and microsilica in return. By 1980, cargo volumes were up to the level seen during World War I.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} in 1912, the B {{operated}} 12 Boston-Albany round trips, one Boston-Pittsfield round trip, {{and as many as}} 10 Pittsfield-North Adams round trips. Around 1913 the New Haven planned to use the Housatonic as part of a New York-Montreal through route to compete with the NYC, but this <b>never</b> <b>materialized</b> and service levels were never high. After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E
5000|$|John Hawkes as Michael [...] "Bugsy" [...] Moran, {{a member}} of the Andrea Gail crew. Bugsy's {{somewhat}} comic inability to connect with women appears to change {{on the eve of the}} trip, when he meets a divorced mother at the Crow's Nest, who later comes to the dock to see him off. They hint at the prospect of a budding relationship that fatefully <b>never</b> <b>materializes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He works nights {{dealing in}} backroom card games {{operated}} by [...] "Zero" [...] Schwiefka. He aspires {{to join the}} Musicians' Union and work with jazz drummer Gene Krupa, but this dream <b>never</b> <b>materializes.</b> His constant companion and protégé is [...] "Sparrow" [...] Saltskin, a feeble-minded thief who specializes in stealing and selling dogs; Frankie gets Sparrow {{a job as a}} [...] "steerer", watching the door to the card games and drawing in gamblers.|$|R
6000|$|And {{so let us}} {{turn off}} the gas. Out in the brilliancy of the foot-lights--filling the {{attention}} of perhaps a crowded audience, and making many a breath and pulse swell and rise--O so much passion and imparted life!--over and over again, the season through--walking, gesticulating, singing, reciting his or her part--But then sooner or later inevitably wending to the flies or exit door--vanishing to sight and ear--and <b>never</b> <b>materializing</b> on this earth's stage again! ...|$|R
