500|$|The map was poorly {{distributed}} to the people at high risk from Ruiz: many survivors had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> even though several of the country's major newspapers featured versions of the map. Henry Villegas of INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) stated that the hazard maps clearly demonstrated that Armero {{would be affected by}} the lahars, but that the map [...] "met with strong opposition from economic interests." [...] He added that because the map was not prepared long before the eruption, mass production and distribution of it in time was difficult.|$|E
500|$|In September 1985, as {{earthquakes}} and phreatic eruptions rocked {{the area around}} the volcano, officials began planning for evacuation. A hazard map was prepared in October; it highlighted the danger from falling ash and rock near Murillo, Santa Isabel, and Líbano, as well as the threat of lahars in Mariquita, Guayabal, Chinchiná, and Armero. The map was poorly distributed to those at highest risk: many survivors had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> though several major newspapers had featured it. Henry Villegas of the Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology stated that the maps clearly demonstrated Armero would be affected by the lahars, but had [...] "met with strong opposition from economic interests." [...] He said that the short time between the map's preparation and the eruption hindered timely distribution.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} public opinion, the Oxford Research Group has {{reported}} that attitudes range [...] "between those who have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and those who don't believe a word of it." [...] A November–December 2008 poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah and the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace in Jerusalem found that only 36% of Israelis support the plan. A June 2008 Angus Reid Global Monitor poll found that about 67% of Palestinians and 39% of Israelis support it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{crew were}} {{surprised}} when actress Joan Collins {{expressed an interest}} in appearing in the series. After her agent asked her if she wanted to appear on the show, Collins, who had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> mentioned it to her children. When her oldest daughter was enthusiastic about the show, Collins decided to accept the offer from the studio. D'Agosta called her a [...] "notorious actress", but said that at the time they saw approaches {{from a wide range of}} actors and actresses who wanted to appear on the series. Pevney said [...] "Joan Collins was very good in it. She enjoyed working on the show and Bill and Leonard were both very good to her... Using her was a good choice." [...] Collins would later recall that Keeler was a Nazi sympathiser, a view which has been supported by other biographies of the actress. Ellison said in response that this was not an intended character trait.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the 19th century,)p. 305; p.307 & pp. 322–331 {{respectively}} {{scholars have}} questioned the traditional explanation of the origin of this creed, which has been passed down {{in the name of the}} council, whose official acts have been lost over time. A local council of Constantinople in 382 and the third ecumenical council (Ephesus, 431) made no mention of it, with the latter affirming the 325 creed of Nicaea as a valid statement of the faith and using it to denounce Nestorianism. Though some scholarship claims that hints of the later creed's existence are discernible in some writings, no extant document gives its text or makes explicit mention of it earlier than the fourth ecumenical council at Chalcedon in 451. Many of the bishops of the 451 council themselves had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and initially greeted it skeptically, but it was then produced from the episcopal archives of Constantinople, and the council accepted it [...] "not as supplying any omission but as an authentic interpretation of the faith of Nicaea". In spite of the questions raised, it is considered most likely that this creed was in fact adopted at the 381 second ecumenical council.|$|E
2500|$|The {{seven other}} murder charges {{are all of}} first degree murder; they relate to babies, whom staff have testified they saw move or cry after {{complete}} birth, and whose deaths are alleged to have resulted from subsequent lethal action. They arise because of the [...] "born alive rule", a principle of common law which stipulates that by default, for legal purposes, personhood arises – and therefore unlawful killing constituting murder becomes possible – immediately upon the victim's being born alive (several US {{states as well as}} Federal legislation have more specific laws to protect fetuses and newborn babies; see fetal rights and born alive laws in the United States). Steven Massof, a clinic employee who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2011, testified that he (Massof) had snipped the spines of more than 100 infants after they had been born alive, and that this was considered [...] "standard procedure" [...] at the clinic; a number of other employees had also testified to the same point. No physical evidence exists for five of the seven cases — charges are based on staff testimony and denied by Gosnell. A photograph exists of the sixth, who allegedly had a gestational age of 30 weeks, and the physical remains were obtained of the seventh. The Grand Jury report states that [...] "A medical expert with 43 years of experience in performing abortions was appalled. This expert told us, 'I’ve <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> [...] being done during an abortion'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Burnout Paradise {{utilizes}} the EA Trax program {{and can be}} played in sequential or random order. There is also the option to restrict when a specific song plays to a certain event in-game, {{as well as the}} ability to remove a song from the playlist. Songs are played through Crash FM, the game's fictional radio station featuring commentary and racing tips from DJ Atomika, the station's fictional host. The soundtrack, featuring 40 licensed tracks, consists mainly of pop punk, post-hardcore, and alternative rock songs. In addition, the soundtrack also includes music from previous games in the Burnout series, as well as some classical music. The theme song of the game is [...] "Paradise City" [...] by Guns N' Roses. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 can utilize custom soundtracks which allow players to cycle their own music while roaming in Paradise City. In February 2007, EA games held a competition on MySpace known as Burnout Bandslam for unsigned U.S. and Europe bands to be featured in Burnout Paradise (one band from each continent). The competition had over 7,000 entries from various countries across Europe and United States. In April 2007, the winners of the competition was announced with artists <b>Never</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>It</b> (from the United States) with their song [...] "Finger on the Trigger" [...] and Showing Off to Thieves (from the United Kingdom) with [...] "Everyone Has Their Secrets". Songs with explicit lyrics were edited to remove such content.|$|E
