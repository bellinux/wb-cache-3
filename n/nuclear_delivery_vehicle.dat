25|$|The other American piston bombers of the day, the B-29 and B-50, {{were also}} too limited in range and nuclear arsenal.

5000|$|Without the SALT {{agreements}} providing stability {{between the}} United States and the Soviet Union arms restraints, {{there would have}} been the scare of yet another strategic arms race between these two countries. The Soviet Union had deployed some 2,250 <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> and were capable of producing and deploying many more missiles {{by the middle of the}} 1980's. If this was to occur, the United States would then begin to retain the equipment necessary to build and increase their production of missiles to match that of the Soviet Union. This would increase the costs and security over the United States, nonetheless, making sure that neither side reached ultimate superiority over the other. [...] In addition, the failure of SALT consequently would have led to [...] "increased political insecurity, and the inherent instability of an unrestrained, and more costly, strategic arms competition".|$|R
25|$|On June 5, 2008, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates {{announced}} that he had asked Schlesinger to lead a senior-level task force to recommend improvements in the stewardship and operation of <b>nuclear</b> weapons, <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> and sensitive components by the US DoD following the 2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident.

5000|$|SALT II {{helped the}} United States to {{discourage}} the Soviets from arming their third-generation ICBMs of SS-17, SS-19 and SS-18 types with many more MIRVs. In the late 1970s the USSR's missile design bureaus had developed experimental versions of these missiles equipped with anywhere from 10 to 38 warheads each. Additionally, the United States debated {{whether or not to}} include the Soviet [...] "Backfire" [...] bomber into the aggregate total of strategic <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The U.S. panel stated that if there was a failure to include them in the total, it could potentially lead the Soviets, at the rate of their production, to have approximately 400 Backfire bombers by 1988, therefore exceeding the limitations set by the SALT agreement. The Soviets secretly agreed to reduce Tu-22M production to thirty aircraft per year and not to give them an intercontinental range. It was particularly important for the United States to limit Soviet efforts in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) rearmament area.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} B-50-equipped 97th Bomb Wing, Strategic Air Command {{established}} the 95th Bombardment Wing at Biggs in June 1952 {{and planned to}} base its heavy B-36 Peacemaker heavy bomber at the base. The B-36 was the largest mass-produced piston engine aircraft ever made, {{and was the first}} bomber capable of delivering all the nuclear weapons in the US arsenal from inside its two bomb bays without aircraft modifications. Although technically obsolete, the B-36, as the only truly intercontinental bomber, was the primary <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> SAC until the late 1950s when the B-52 Stratofortress began to be deployed to operational Wings.|$|R

40|$|Ron Huisken of the Australian National University {{argues that}} the strikingly {{different}} dimension of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s recent Defence White Paper, Force 2030 – “the sharply expanded submarine force and the intent to acquire Australia’s first strategic missile capability – stems from a disjointed, inconclusive but unmistakably alarmist assessment of what China is about to do to order and stability in East Asia”. Huisken notes that the missile {{most likely to be}} acquired, is today primarily used with conventional warheads, but “it began its life in the early 1980 s as a strategic <b>nuclear</b> weapon <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a 200 kiloton warhead. This pedigree, and its technical performance parameters, puts it in breach of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). ” It is possible, Huisken observes, that “Australia already has an understanding with the US administration regarding the acquisition of Tomahawk but this could well run into opposition in the Congress when we actually request the system. ...|$|R

There are {{unconfirmed}} reports that some tests were conducted in 1960. However the high cost and perceived vulnerability of the B-70 against the projected performance of Soviet air defenses, combined with the 1960 U-2 incident in which a high-flying spyplane had been shot down, led to the decision that intercontinental ballistic missiles would, in the future, be the primary <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> force of the United States, and therefore the B-70 project was cancelled in early 1961. Pye Wacket, its <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicle</b> no longer available, {{is believed to have}} been cancelled soon after, although the ultimate fate of the program remains classified.|$|R

40|$|Sullivan, MillicentDelivery of {{nucleic acids}} for {{therapeutic}} applications {{is an exciting}} field, promising innovative approaches for regulating protein expression towards the treatment of diseases including multiple varieties of cancer. The focus of this field is to develop efficacious <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> which can shuttle therapeutic nucleic acids into cells in a nontoxic manner, leading to treatment of diseases on a molecular level. However, the efficiency of non-viral <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> has been limited by an incomplete understanding of their cellular uptake, subcellular trafficking, and intracellular delivery to the nucleus. This dissertation focuses on experiments designed to elucidate the biological properties of the histone H 3 tail peptide utilized for DNA <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and how they enhance gene delivery. We have found that these H 3 tail peptides, {{in combination with the}} cationic polymer poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), can effectively bind and protect plasmid DNA (pDNA), for efficient delivery to the nucleus. The studies described in this dissertation focus on elucidating the endocytic pathway and <b>nuclear</b> <b>delivery</b> mechanisms of H 3 -targeted polyplexes in mammalian cell lines. These studies demonstrate that (1) the caveolar endocytic pathway plays a vital role in the fate of polyplexes, (2) H 3 -targeted polyplexes interact with histone effectors to effectively enter the nucleus during mitosis, and (3) H 3 -targeted polyplexes selectively target cancer cells that overexpress caveolin. In total, this dissertation provides new evidence for the potential role for histone-based materials as effective gene transfer vehicles, and supports the importance of subcellular trafficking for non-viral gene delivery. Ultimately, gene therapies will rely on the development of methods to control gene targeting and trafficking along the delivery pathway, requiring properties that enable them to appropriately navigate the intracellular space. This dissertation contributes to the growing body of literature to improve our fundamental understanding of the processing of non-viral carriers.
