On 27 June 1536, Pedro de Alvarado founded a Spanish town beside the Indian settlement, {{with the name of}} Villa de Señor San Pedro de Puerto Caballos (modern San Pedro Sula). The <b>new</b> <b>town</b> had 35 Spanish citizens, and Alvarado allocated 200 of his slaves to help build the <b>new</b> <b>town</b> and work the surrounding fields.

Alvarado annulled all encomienda rights established in the area under Cerezeda, and reassigned the villages to the citizens of San Pedro.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} <b>new</b> <b>town</b> was planned, Crawley was a retail centre for the {{surrounding}} area: there were 177 {{shops in the}} town in 1948, 99 of which were on the High Street. Early <b>new</b> <b>town</b> residents relied on these shopping facilities until the Corporation implemented the master plan's designs for a new shopping area on the mostly undeveloped land east of the High Street and north of the railway line. The Broadwalk and its 23 shops were built in 1954, followed by the Queen's Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s. Queen's Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops and linked to the High Street by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II. The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.|$|E

The predicted demand was that of 75,000 vehicles per day by 1990 and a need for a dual 3-lane motorway. Two corridors were identified for a possible new motorway route, and a third option to possibly upgrade existing roads. The route could have followed the A5 Corridor to the M6 South of Gailey, at junction 12, or a new corridor could have been established to the M6, north-east of Featherstone, at junction 11. Additionally, it was proposed that the existing A5 could be upgraded to full dual carriageway grade separated standards together with improvements to the A41 and A464 trunk routes.|$|E

5|$|The M54 is a 23-mile (37km) east-west {{motorway}} in the English {{counties of}} Shropshire and Staffordshire. It is {{also referred to}} as the Telford Motorway, after the road's primary westbound destination, the <b>new</b> <b>town</b> of Telford. The motorway cost £65million to construct, and is two-lane dual carriageway for the majority of its length, with sections of three-lane.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} M54 was {{originally}} presented due to the high volumes of traffic on the A5, London to Holyhead road which was largely constructed by civil engineer Thomas Telford in the early 19th century following {{the route of the}} Roman Watling Street, which connected Rochester, Kent with Wroxeter, Shropshire. The initial plan for a motorway following the M54's present route was therefore designed to alleviate the roads which handled the commercial traffic to the port of Holyhead, destined for Ireland. With the proposal in the early 1960s for a <b>new</b> <b>town</b> to provide an overspill housing area for the West Midlands conurbation, then named Dawley <b>New</b> <b>Town</b> (designated as Telford in 1967), the M54 was becoming more likely to be built; the government also wanted to increase transport provision to the rest of Shropshire.|$|E

25|$|In the 9th to 14th centuries, many {{hundreds}} of <b>new</b> <b>towns</b> were built in Europe, and many others were enlarged with newly planned extensions.
