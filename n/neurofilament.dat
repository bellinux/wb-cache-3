25|$|Arsenic is a neurotoxin {{commonly}} found concentrated in areas exposed to agricultural runoff, mining, and smelting sites (Martinez-Finley 2011). One {{of the effects}} of arsenic ingestion during the development of the nervous system is the inhibition of neurite growth which can occur both in PNS and the CNS. This neurite growth inhibition can often lead to defects in neural migration, and significant morphological changes of neurons during development,) often leading to neural tube defects in neonates. As a metabolite of arsenic, arsenite is formed after ingestion of arsenic and has shown significant toxicity to neurons within about 24 hours of exposure. The mechanism of this cytotoxicity functions through arsenite-induced increases in intracellular calcium ion levels within neurons, which may subsequently reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential which activates caspases, triggering cell death. Another known function of arsenite is its destructive nature towards the cytoskeleton through inhibition of <b>neurofilament</b> transport. This is particularly destructive as neurofilaments are used in basic cell structure and support. Lithium administration has shown promise, however, in restoring some of the lost <b>neurofilament</b> motility. Additionally, similar to other neurotoxin treatments, the administration of certain antioxidants has shown some promise in reducing neurotoxicity of ingested arsenic.|$|E
25|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} acts {{to organize}} and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during endocytosis, the uptake of external materials by a cell, and cytokinesis, the separation of daughter cells after cell division; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules. There are {{a great number of}} proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis. The subunit protein of microfilaments is a small, monomeric protein called actin. The subunit of microtubules is a dimeric molecule called tubulin. Intermediate filaments are heteropolymers whose subunits vary among the cell types in different tissues. But some of the subunit protein of intermediate filaments include vimentin, desmin, lamin (lamins A, B and C), keratin (multiple acidic and basic keratins), <b>neurofilament</b> proteins (NF - L, NF - M).|$|E

40|$|<b>Neurofilaments</b> are transported along axons in a rapid {{intermittent}} and bidirectional manner {{but there}} is a long-standing controversy about whether this applies to all axonal <b>neurofilaments.</b> Some have proposed that only a small proportion of axonal <b>neurofilaments</b> are mobile and that most are deposited into a persistently stationary and extensively cross-linked cytoskeleton that remains fixed in place for many months without move-ment, turning over very slowly. In contrast, others have proposed that this hypothesis is based on a misinterpre-tation of the experimental data and that, in fact, all axo-nal <b>neurofilaments</b> move. These contrary perspectives have distinct implications for our understanding of how <b>neurofilaments</b> are organized and reorganized in axons both in health and disease. Here, we discuss the history and substance of this controversy. We show that the pub-lished data on the kinetics and distribution of neurofila-ments along axons favor a simple ‘‘stop and go’’ transport model in which axons contain a single popula-tion of <b>neurofilaments</b> that all move in a stochastic, bidirectional and intermittent manner. Based on these considerations, we propose a dynamic view of the neuro-nal cytoskeleton in which all <b>neurofilaments</b> cycle repeatedly between moving and pausing states through-out their journey along the axon. The filaments move infrequently, but the average pause duration is on the order of hours rather than weeks or months. Against this fluid backdrop, the action of molecular motors on <b>neurofilaments</b> can have dramatic effects on neurofila-ment organization that would not be possible if the neu-rofilaments were extensively cross-linked into a trul...|$|R

40|$|Neuronal cytoskeletal {{elements}} such as <b>neurofilaments,</b> F-actin, and microtubules are actively translocated by an as yet unidentified mechanism. This report describes a novel interaction between <b>neurofilaments</b> and microtubule motor proteins that mediates the translocation of <b>neurofilaments</b> along microtubules in vitro. Native <b>neurofilaments</b> purified from spinal cord are transported along microtubules at rates of 100 - 1000 nm/s to both plus and minus ends. This motion requires ATP and is partially inhibited by vanadate, consistent with the activity of neurofilament-bound molecular motors. Motility is in part mediated by the dynein/dynactin motor complex and several kinesin-like proteins. This reconstituted motile system suggests how slow net movement of cytoskeletal polymers may be achieved by alternating activities of fast microtubule motors...|$|R

40|$|<b>Neuro{{filaments}}</b> (also called 10 -nm filaments or intermediate filaments) from bovine brain were incubated with microtubule protein at 37 degrees C in {{the presence}} or absence of 1 mM ATP and in a buffer that allowed microtubule assembly. Falling-ball viscometry revealed that the (non-Newtonian) apparent viscosity of the ATP-containing mixtures is 5 - 20 times greater than that of the mixtures prepared without ATP. A larger ATP-dependent increase in viscosity (approximately 100 -fold) was seen when purified tubulin replaced microtubule protein. The magnitude of the increase depended on the concentrations of both <b>neurofilaments</b> and tubulin. The presence of both <b>neurofilaments</b> and assembled microtubules was necessary for the increase to occur. The viscosity was drastically reduced by stirring or by cooling of the mixtures to 0 degrees C.

40|$|Time-lapse imaging of <b>neurofilaments</b> in axons of cul-tured {{nerve cells}} has {{demonstrated}} that these cytos-keletal polymers move along microtubule tracks in both anterograde and retrograde directions, powered by microtubule motors.

Here, we show that axonal <b>neurofilaments</b> are also very flexi-ble and frequently exhibit complex and dynamic fold-ing and unfolding behaviors while they are pausing. Remarkably, however, when the filaments move in a sustained manner, we find that they always adopt an unfolded, that is, fully extended configuration, and this applies to movement in both anterograde and retrograde directions. Given the flexibility of neurofi-lament polymers and the apparent ease with which they can fold back on themselves, the fact that they move in a fully extended configuration suggests that moving <b>neurofilaments</b> may be pulled from their leading end.
