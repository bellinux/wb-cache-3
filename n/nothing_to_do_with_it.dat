He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot {{go back to his}} apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On {{the way out of the}} bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

The producers found it difficult, however, to recruit Anglo actors to play strikebreakers or deputy sheriffs; those who disliked the union wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> while those who sympathized {{did not want to be}} seen switching sides, even as actors.|$|E

Carrie enlists Quinn to help clear Brody's name. To track down the bomber, she tells Franklin that Leland's firm {{has been linked to}} the bombing, provoking Leland into ordering the bomber moved out of the country. She takes part in a stakeout of the bomber's hotel room and watches as Franklin approaches with a silenced pistol. Carrie insists on intervening, as she cannot prove Brody's innocence without the bomber's testimony. Black ops agent Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) orders her to stand down, but she ignores him and starts running toward the hotel. Quinn shoots her in the shoulder to stop her. Adal's team then drives her to the hospital.|$|E

500|$|The Trivection oven’s {{inclusion}} in 30 Rock was {{widely seen as}} an example of product placement, especially as the product was later advertised during the commercial break. However, Tina Fey, the show’s creator and writer of the episode, stated the oven was actually included in the show purely as a joke and that GE had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> although she suspects that [...] "maybe somebody's taking credit for it."

It is very likely that this was done {{at the behest of the}} Emperor himself, although in a later public statement before the Senate, Nikephoros swore that he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Most scholars believe in Nikephoros's direct involvement, but Treadgold holds it likelier that the soldiers acted on their own, since Bardanes was no longer a credible threat to the Emperor.

500|$|Although {{the joke}} {{originally}} stemmed from Evel Knievel and not Kanye West, Parker and Stone said they realized West {{would probably be}} extremely humorless about the joke and not understand it, so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him.

During one scene in [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman steals credit from Jimmy for a joke he did not write.
