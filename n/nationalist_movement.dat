5|$|Alanya {{was set up}} as a {{municipality}} in 1872, electing {{its first}} mayor in 1901. Today, Alanya is governed by a mayor and a municipality council made up of thirty-seven members. Eighteen councilors are from the far-right <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Movement</b> Party, seven are from the center-left Republican People's Party, and twelve are of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which is currently in power in the national government. Mayor Adem Murat Yücel of the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Movement</b> Party was elected in 2014 by unseating the incumbent Hasan Sipahioğlu, who had previously been mayor since 1999.

In November 2007 Gani was made a National Hero of Indonesia. Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles.|$|E
40|$|Although {{comparative}} studies of nationalism have recently experienced a resurgence, few {{attempts have been}} made to analyse the reciprocal influences exerted upon one another by <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements.</b> This article distinguishes between a domino effect which denotes a concrete change at the governmental level, and a demonstration effect which signifies more general influences on <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> exerted by 'external' models. A comparative analysis of external ideological influences on Basque and Catalan nationalism reveals that the domino effect metaphor does not easily apply to nationalism, while demonstration effects are often confined to certain sectors of these <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements,</b> generally the most radical ones...|$|R

40|$|English Abstract <b>Nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> often utilize {{aspects of}} mythology and history in their {{attempts}} to create a nationalist ideology. Through a selective emphasis and narrow interpretation of historical events, nationalist groups strive to create a national mythology. In this regard, the <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> in fin de siècle Ireland are no different. This thesis attempts to show how the work of Gerald MacNamara, an Irish nationalist writing from Unionist Belfast during the periods of Revival and partition, was able to utilize the dramatic forms of parody and satire to create an oeuvre that critiqued both nationalist and unionist ideologies and <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> as a whole...|$|R
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, another {{proposal}} for the flag was initiated by Sister Nivedita, a Hindu reformist and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. The flag consisted of a thunderbolt in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the border, with the Vande Mataram caption split around the thunderbolt. It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906. Soon, many other proposals were initiated, {{but none of them}} gained attention from the <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement</b> on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more sympathetic to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|E
5|$|Belgians began campaigning against Lumumba, {{whom they}} wanted to marginalise; they {{accused him of being}} a {{communist}} and, hoping to fragment the <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement,</b> supported rival, ethnic-based parties like CONAKAT. Many Belgians hoped that an independent Congo would form part of a federation, like the French Community or British Commonwealth of Nations, and that close economic and political association with Belgium would continue. As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese elections in May 1960. These resulted in a broad MNC majority.|$|E

5000|$|Marxist {{historian}} Tom Nairn {{has argued}} that uneven development {{can also lead to}} peripheral nationalism, for example in Scotland. [...] Peripheral regions tend to promote <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> when regional inequalities overlap with ethnic differences, or when membership of a larger state no longer presents advantages. In underdeveloped regions, <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> mobilise the population against the persistence of ethnic economic inequality.|$|R

5|$|In Puerto Rico, Albizu Campos {{used the}} Rhoads scandal {{as part of}} his anti-colonial campaign, {{attracting}} followers to the Nationalist Party. In 1950, longtime Puerto Rican pro-independence activists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola tried to assassinate President Truman to bring their cause to the world stage. When later interviewed, Collazo said that as a young man, in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Santoso went to The Hague, in the Netherlands, in 1929 {{with her}} father, who was furthering his studies. Santoso then {{enrolled}} at Leiden University in Leiden, {{from which she}} graduated in 1933 with a Meester in de Rechten (Master of Laws) degree; this made her the first Indonesian woman to earn a law degree. During her studies, she became involved with the Indonesian <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement</b> and its leaders, including Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir.|$|E
5|$|Soebadio Sastrosatomo {{wrote that}} Santoso's {{selection}} as social minister {{was important for}} several reasons. Firstly, her selection showed that the government truly respected women's contributions to the <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement.</b> Secondly, {{it was a way}} for Sjahrir to show that the Indonesian people were committed to the needs of their people, by having a woman deal with women's issues. After Santoso, other women have held government positions. The second female Indonesian minister, S. K. Trimurti, served as minister of labour from 1947 to 1948. In 2001, Megawati Sukarnoputri became the first female president of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|The Mediterranean climate, natural attractions, and {{historic}} heritage make Alanya a popular destination for tourism, and responsible for nine percent of Turkey's tourism sector and {{thirty percent of}} foreign purchases of real estate in Turkey. Tourism has risen since 1958 to become the dominant industry in the city, resulting in a corresponding increase in city population. Warm-weather sporting events and cultural festivals take place annually in Alanya. In 2014 Mayor Adem Murat Yücel, of the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Movement</b> Party unseated Hasan Sipahioğlu, of the Justice and Development Party, who had previously led the city since 1999.|$|E
5|$|The nascent magazine, {{under the}} {{editorial}} control of Armijn and Alisjahbana, was initially poorly received by {{political parties and}} actors; they considered the magazine, which was generally non-political, liable to weaken the <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement</b> by diverting it into less important areas. To guarantee better support, {{people who were not}} writers or literary critics were accepted onto the editorial board. The first, Sumadang, was accepted in 1935. Other politicians involved during the end of the 1930s included Amir Sjarifuddin, Mohamad Sjah, and Sugiarti. During this period the magazine began to have a wider scope.|$|E

50|$|The {{founding}} of the NCBWA {{was based on the}} existing legacy of resistance and <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> throughout the colonies in British West Africa. Some of the resistance movements that influenced the development of the NCBWA were those by “King Aggrey of Cape Coast in the Gold Coast in the 1860s” and “King Kosoko of Lagos & Jaja of Opobo in the nineteen century”. The previous <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> that sparked the creation of the NCBWA included the Gold Coast Aborigines' Rights Protection Society (ARPS) and the Fante Confederation. The NCBWA was influenced not only by <b>nationalist</b> <b>movements</b> in the region but also by the works of key African nationalist scholars in the region, such as Dr. Africanus Beale Horton, Dr. Edward Wilmot Blyden, and John Payne Jackson.|$|R
5|$|While Mugabe was {{teaching}} abroad, an anti-colonialist African <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement</b> {{was established in}} Southern Rhodesia. This was first led by Joshua Nkomo's Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, founded in September 1957 and then banned by the colonial government in February 1959. This {{was replaced by the}} more radically oriented National Democratic Party (NDP), founded in January 1960. In May 1960, Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him. The pair had planned for their visit to be short, however Mugabe's friend, the African nationalist Leopold Takawira, urged them to stay.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement</b> reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's {{political}} elite was divided between those who embraced the Arab <b>nationalist</b> <b>movement</b> led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.|$|E
