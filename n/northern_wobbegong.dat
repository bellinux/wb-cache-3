5|$|Morphological {{studies have}} been {{inconclusive}} about the evolutionary relationships of the tasselled wobbegong, but overall have gauged it {{to be among the}} more derived wobbegong (Orectolobidae) species. A 2009 phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found otherwise, that this species was in fact basal to all other wobbegongs except the <b>northern</b> <b>wobbegong</b> (O. wardi). This result supports the synonymization of Eucrossorhinus with Orectolobus. Molecular clock estimation placed the speciation of the tasselled wobbegong at 11–6 Ma, coinciding with a period of significant geological rearrangement and the formation of coral reef habitats in the region.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>wobbegong,</b> Orectolobus wardi, is {{a carpet}} shark {{in the family}} Orectolobidae, found in the western Pacific Ocean around Australia, between latitudes 9° S to 26° S. It reaches a length of 63 cm.|$|E
50|$|The network {{wobbegong}} (Orectolobus reticulatus) is {{a recently}} described species of carpet shark found in relatively shallow waters off Kimberley and Darwin in north-western Australia. With a known maximum length of only 52.3 cm, {{it may be}} the smallest species of wobbegong. Until its description in 2008, it had been confused with the <b>northern</b> <b>wobbegong.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>wobbegongs</b> are {{excellent}} aquarium sharks {{due to their}} small (30 inch) adult size. They can be successfully reared in 135 gallon aquaria, but sharks in general tend to do better in aquaria 180 gallons or more in volume.|$|R
