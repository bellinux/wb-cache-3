5|$|Early {{housing in}} the village {{consisted}} of groups of thatched cottages clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after {{the establishment of the}} local board of health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply was a local well. During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{housing and}} land {{shortage}} existed in nearby Smethwick County Borough, which {{also resulted in}} the authority acquiring land from adjoining council areas. By 1914; the urban area of Bearwood had already spread over the border of Oldbury Urban District as far as Rathbone Road and Warley Park. A further adjustment of the county boundary took place in 1928 and on this occasion however, Staffordshire gained territory from Worcestershire at Warley Woods (See Fig 4). This enabled Smethwick to build <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> estates at Londonderry and {{to the west of}} Rathbone Road.|$|E
5|$|Although heavy {{industry}} died {{out in the}} area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated Central Belt, Giffnock has continued to grow as a dormitory town, supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents {{in the early twentieth}} century to 16,178 in 2001.

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new city hall and railway station, its centre was drawn towards the west. <b>New</b> <b>housing</b> developments grew up in Brønshøj and Valby while Frederiksberg became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen.

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, <b>new</b> <b>housing</b> estates {{were built}} north-west of the town. This was {{followed}} by the redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s and 1970s, which destroyed much of the old high street. There was speculation that the town's population could increase to around 55–60,000 by 1970. This did not happen: a decline in the linoleum industry in the mid-1960s led to a decrease in population, from a peak of 53,750 in 1961 to 47,962 in 1981.|$|E

The home owner is provided an official label to display the rating on the home’s furnace or electrical box.|$|R
5|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century {{to the start of the}} Second World War, there were few changes in Altrincham.
