40|$|The Baker Plan {{essentially}} made existing {{strategy on}} the debt problem more concrete. Like existing policy, it rejected a bankruptcy approach to the problem. It assumed that the principal debtor countries could grow {{their way out of}} the debt problem and could expand their exports enough over time to reduce their debt burden to normal levels. It called for structural reform, and it continued the adjustment efforts in the debtor country in return for financial support from foreign official and bank creditors. The plan did shift emphasis, however: from short-term balance of payments stabilization to longer-term development objectives, and thus from the IMF to the World Bank as the lead institution in debt management. The basic international debt strategy remains valid, but intensified policy efforts are necessary. Banks should provide multiyear <b>new</b> <b>money</b> <b>packages,</b> exit bonds should be guaranteed to allow voluntary debt reduction by banks, and net capital flows to the highly indebted countries should be raised 15 billion dollars a year. Successful emergence from the debt crisis, however, will depend primarily on sound economic policies in the debtor countries themselves.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{challenge}} one of the principal received truths in the field of Economics: the way that <b>new</b> <b>money</b> is created. We also aim to go further and argue that a proper understanding of how <b>new</b> <b>money</b> is created has such devastating consequences that it heralds no less than a coming revolution in how we understand political economy and future possibilities. Our main argument is that the received truth of the fractional reserve theory or 2 ̆ 018 money multiplier 2 ̆ 019 model taught in most economics textbooks cannot explain the expansion of the money supply by logic, simple math and by basic bank accounting practices. To demonstrate our argument we rely on Mankiw 2 ̆ 019 s 2 ̆ 018 Macroeconomics 2 ̆ 019 and his chapter explaining to students how <b>new</b> <b>money</b> is created. We use Professor Mankiw 2 ̆ 019 s textbook because of its widespread use as an introductory text to macroeconomics.

50|$|To {{continue}} in this illustration: Supplying more money {{does not make}} all people better off {{in the same way}} that supplying more pears does. When <b>new</b> <b>money</b> is supplied, it does not enter the economy at all points and in all places at once. It is often guided into specific markets sometimes unintentionally or intentionally incentivized by government legislation. Sometimes, <b>new</b> <b>money</b> from the government can be intentionally marketed to specific economic areas by banks. Sometimes government tries to guide <b>new</b> <b>money</b> into the most general dispersion as possible. But, <b>new</b> <b>money</b> always enters into specific areas, and this causes prices in those areas of the economy to rise faster than other prices of other things in the economy. If it entered into all areas of the economy at once, then a commensurate share of it would always appear under your pillow whenever it was created, and clearly, if everyone had twice the money than they did the day before, prices would also merely be doubled and the extra money would be of no real consequence.|$|R

5000|$|Suspend {{convertibility}} {{and issue}} additional money. The suspension of convertibility will halt the bank run {{and stop the}} loss of assets. This will not reverse the inflation that has occurred, but it will prevent further inflation. The remaining problem is to restore the money supply to its original level. For example, suppose as above that the gambler's IOU has fallen in value from $300 to $200, and the bank has paid out 40 ounces for $40, so {{that the value of}} the dollar stands at E=.375 oz./$. The $560 still in circulation would have an aggregate value of $560(.375 oz./$)=210 ounces.To return the money supply to its original aggregate real value of 600 ounces, the bank would issue 390/.375=$1040 in <b>new</b> <b>money,</b> in exchange for assets worth 390 ounces of silver. Note that the bank need not force this <b>new</b> <b>money</b> into circulation. If customers require an additional 390 ounces worth of <b>new</b> <b>money</b> in order to conduct their business, then they will voluntarily bring 390 ounces worth of assets to the bank in exchange for $1040 of <b>new</b> <b>money.</b> All that is required of the bank is to accommodate its customers' requests.|$|R

40|$|According to the {{conventional}} view, old money is more liberal than <b>new</b> <b>money.</b> Although widely shared, this thesis of old money liberalism has never been demonstrated empirically. In this paper, I discuss the origins and elaboration of this thesis within the social science literature. I then present evidence to refute the thesis from {{a study of the}} politics of the Forbes 400 richest Americans and several similar samples of wealthy persons drawn from earlier decades. The results of this study show that old money is, if anything, more uniformly conservative than <b>new</b> <b>money.</b> The paper also reviews the explanations commonly given for the reputed liberalism of old money and argues that the acceptance of the thesis is based less on the persuasiveness of these arguments than upon longstanding beliefs about old and new wealth that are invoked by the theory. In the conclusion, I sketch an alternative theory of the political differences between old and <b>new</b> <b>money</b> that is more consistent with the empirical evidence. In the sociology of the capitalist class, no concept is more widely accepted as a framework for explaining political and ideological differences among owners of great wealth than the distinction between old <b>money</b> and <b>new</b> <b>money.</b> According to {{the conventional}} view, old money tends toward political liberalism (or, at least, toward a moderate and mildly reformist variant of conservatism), while <b>new</b> <b>money</b> is inclined to embrace more hard-line conservative views.

5000|$|In most jurisdictions, a {{floating}} charge is only {{vulnerable to the}} extent that it does not secure <b>new</b> <b>money</b> for the company. [...] So if, for example, a bank has a loan of £100 outstanding to a company, and it advances a further £50 but takes an [...] "all-monies" [...] floating charge as security, and the company goes into liquidation 3 months later, the floating charge will validly secure the £50 advance which was made at the time, but not the earlier £100. Legislation relating to voidable floating charges is intended to prevent abuse of a security interest which catches literally all of the assets of the company, and could be used by person to strip out all of the assets from a company in difficulty from the unsecured creditors. However, if the holder of the floating charge has inserted <b>new</b> <b>money,</b> then giving the holder a valid security up to the amount of the <b>new</b> <b>money</b> injected does not prejudice the position of the unsecured creditors.|$|R
