5|$|The Montreal Summer Olympics proved {{disastrous}} to Canada {{not only}} in financial terms; it failed to win a single gold medal despite being the host nation.

5|$|Almost every <b>nation</b> <b>has</b> {{associated}} blood {{drinking with}} some kind of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Roman Empire of Charlemagne's successors {{would later}} {{come to the}} aid of the Byzantines under Louis II and during the Crusades, but {{relations}} between the two empires would be strained; based on the Salerno Chronicle, we know the Emperor Basil had sent an angry letter to his western counterpart, reprimanding him for usurping the title of emperor. He argued that the Frankish rulers were simple reges, and that each <b>nation</b> <b>has</b> its own title for the ruler, whereas the imperial title suited only the ruler of the Eastern Romans, Basil himself.|$|E

The Indian Olympic Association, the country's National Olympic Committee, {{is responsible for the}} Commonwealth and Commonwealth Youth Games in India. The <b>nation</b> <b>has</b> sent its delegation to all the editions of the Commonwealth Youth Games. India has hosted the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Youth Games in 2010 and 2008 in New Delhi and Pune, respectively. In the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games, India won the most gold (33), silver (26) and total medals, and finished first in the final medal table standings.

5|$|Tales of the undead {{consuming}} {{the blood}} or flesh of living beings {{have been found}} in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. Today we know these entities predominantly as vampires, but in ancient times, the term vampire did not exist; blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every <b>nation</b> <b>has</b> associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, from the ghouls of Arabia to the goddess Sekhmet of Egypt. Indeed, some of these legends could have given rise to the European folklore, though they are not strictly considered vampires by historians when using today's definitions.|$|E

This location astride {{some of the major}} transport routes in the <b>nation</b> <b>has</b> made Wagga Wagga an important heavy truck depot for a number of companies including Toll Holdings.

5|$|Hockey is Canada's {{national}} winter sport, and Canadians {{are extremely}} {{passionate about the}} game. The <b>nation</b> <b>has</b> traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union competed in its first World Championship in 1954, defeating Canada and winning the gold medal. At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, the Soviet team went undefeated and won its first gold medal. Canada's team lost to the Soviets and the United States in the medal round, winning the bronze. The 1960 Winter Olympics, in Squaw Valley, United States, saw the first, and to date only, team from Australia compete in the tournament. Canada, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Sweden were the top four teams heading into the Games, but were all defeated by the American team, which won all seven games en route to its first Olympic gold medal. Canada won the silver medal and the Soviet Union won the bronze.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the Government of the Cook Islands {{identified}} {{the lack of}} funding for sport facilities as a key reason why the <b>nation</b> <b>has</b> not succeeded at international competitions. It believed that investing in sporting infrastructure would enable the nation to be more globally competitive. Netball was not recognised as an Olympic sport until 1995. While official recognition as an Olympic sport {{did not mean that}} it was played at the Olympics, it did mean that the national association and the Cook Islands government could then access Olympic funding to help cover costs for facilities, travel, coaching, umpire training and other grass roots development efforts. The Cook Islands Netball Association is the governing body for the sport in the Cook Islands, and historically, the sport has been administered by women. Most netball courts are owned by the local village or club. With the exception of National Auditorium, all courts are outside. In 1990, the Cook Islands Netball Association had 15 clubs affiliated with it, all based in the southern islands group, including Ngatangia/Matavera, Avatiu/Nikao, Arorangi, Titikaveka, Takuvaine, Tupapa, Outer Islands.|$|E
5|$|Trinidad and Tobago is a two-island {{nation in}} the Caribbean Sea that lies close to South America. The <b>nation</b> <b>has</b> participated in the Olympics since the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and has {{appeared}} at every Summer Olympics since then {{with the exception of}} the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, when it joined Jamaica and Barbados in a political union called the West Indies Federation. Overall, Trinidad and Tobago had participated in eighteen Olympic games (15 Summer Olympics and 3 Winter Olympics) between its 1948 debut and its appearance at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and its fifteenth Olympic game since its independence, which was in 1962. The Trinidadian delegation in Beijing comprised its largest delegation by far, with 28 athletes. The previous record included 19 athletes, which happened in 1968, 1972, 2000 and 2004. Between 1948 and 2008, Trinidad and Tobago accumulated 14 medals (one gold, five silver and eight bronze); two of those medals were won in Beijing (a silver in the men's 100meters another in the men's 4x100meters relay). Richard Thompson, a male track athlete, medaled in the men's 100meters but also medaled as a member of the Trinidadian relay team. All Olympians participating in Beijing for Trinidad and Tobago, with the exception of Dexter St. Louis in table tennis, were planning as of the end of the Beijing Olympics to continue training for future Olympic games.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 18th century, {{the island of}} Madagascar was ruled by a {{fragmented}} assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar {{by a series of}} Merina nobles. The monarchy collapsed in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the French colonial empire, from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the <b>nation</b> <b>has</b> officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo. However, in a popular uprising in 2009, president Marc Ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to Andry Rajoelina. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when Hery Rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair and transparent by the international community.
