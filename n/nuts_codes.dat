It {{is based on}} a flashable controller utilizing the same ARM7TDMI core already used in the 2008 revision of the 12C but in a different package, an Atmel AT91SAM7L128-AU running an emulator written by Cyrille de Br√©bisson to execute the old HP <b>Nut</b> <b>code</b> much faster than on the original hardware. The calculator was released alongside the HP 12c 30th Anniversary Edition. This model is powered by two CR2032 batteries, and can easily be differentiated from the original model by the [...] "Limited Edition" [...] script below the company logo as well as the black text on brushed metal back label, as opposed to the white text on black of the original.|$|R

50|$|CPV {{codification}} {{consists of}} a main vocabulary which defines {{the subject of the}} contract, and a supplementary vocabulary to add further qualitative information. The main vocabulary is based on a tree structure made up with codes of up to 9 digits (an 8 digit code plus a check digit). This combination of digits is associated with a wording that describes the type of supplies, works or services defining the subject of the contract. A Call for Tender is quite often described by more than one CPV Code, aiming to give a better and more detailed description of the object of the contract. Commercial organisations promoting public contracts to their members or readers generally use CPV codes to identify business sectors likely to be interested in specific tenders, along with <b>NUTS</b> <b>Codes</b> which indicate the country and region within which the contract is to be performed.|$|E
