40|$|Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are {{classified}} into {{long and short}} categories based on their durations. Broad band studies suggest that these two categories of objects roughly correspond to two different classes of progenitor systems, i. e. compact star mergers (Type I) vs. massive star core collapse (Type II). However, the duration criterion sometimes leads to mis-identification of the progenitor systems. We perform a comprehensive multi-wavelength comparative study between duration-defined long GRBs and short GRBs {{as well as the}} so-called "consensus" long GRBs and short GRBs (which are believed to be more closely related to the two types of progenitor systems). The parameters we study include two parts: the prompt emission properties including duration (T_ 90), spectral peak energy (E_ p), low energy photon index (α), isotropic γ-ray energy (E_γ, iso), isotropic peak luminosity (L_ p,iso), and the amplitude parameters (f and f_ eff); and the host galaxy properties including stellar mass (M_*), star formation rate (SFR), metallicity ([X/H]), half light radius (R_ 50), angular and physical (R_ off) offset of the afterglow {{from the center of the}} host galaxy, the <b>normalized</b> <b>offset</b> (r_ off=R_ off/R_ 50), and the brightness fraction F_ light. For most parameters, we find interesting overlapping properties between the two populations in both 1 D and 2 D distribution plots. The three best parameters for the classification purpose are T_ 90, f_ eff, and F_ light. However, no single parameter alone is good enough to place a particular burst into the right physical category, suggesting a need of multiple criteria for physical classification.

40|$|NPLOT is an {{interactive}} computer graphics program for plotting undeformed and deformed NASTRAN finite element models (FEMs). Although there are many commercial codes already available for plotting FEMs, these have limited use due to their cost, speed, and lack of features to view BAR elements. NPLOT was specifically developed to overcome these limitations. On a vector type graphics device the two best ways to show depth are by hidden line plotting or haloed line plotting. A hidden line algorithm generates views of models with all hidden lines removed, and a haloed line algorithm displays views with aft lines broken {{in order to show}} depth while keeping the entire model visible. A haloed line algorithm is especially useful for plotting models composed of many line elements and few surface elements. The most important feature of NPLOT is its ability to create both hidden line and haloed line views accurately and much more quickly than with any other existing hidden or haloed line algorithms. NPLOT is also capable of plotting a normal wire frame view to display all lines of a model. NPLOT is able to aid in viewing all elements, but it has special features not generally available for plotting BAR elements. These features include plotting of TRUE LENGTH and <b>NORMALIZED</b> <b>offset</b> vectors and orientation vectors. Standard display operations such as rotation and perspective are possible, but different view planes such as X-Y, Y-Z, and X-Z may also be selected. Another display option is the Z-axis cut which allows a portion of the fore part of the model to be cut away to reveal details of the inside of the model. A zoom function is available to terminals with a locator (graphics cursor, joystick, etc.). The user interface of NPLOT is designed to make the program quick and easy to use. A combination of menus and commands with help menus for detailed information about each command allows experienced users greater speed and efficiency. Once a plot is on the screen the interface becomes command driven, enabling the user to manipulate the display or execute a command without having to return to the menu. NPLOT is also able to plot deformed shapes allowing it to perform post-processing. The program can read displacements, either static displacements or eigenvectors, from a MSC/NASTRAN F 06 file or a UAI/NASTRAN PRT file. The displacements are written into a unformatted scratch file where they are available for rapid access when the user wishes to display a deformed shape. All subcases or mode shapes can be read in at once. Then it is easy to enable the deformed shape, to change subcases or mode shapes and to change the scale factor for subsequent plots. NPLOT is written in VAX FORTRAN for DEC VAX series computers running VMS. As distributed, the NPLOT source code makes calls to the DI 3000 graphics package from Precision Visuals; however, a set of interface routines is provided to translate the DI 3000 calls into Tektronix PLOT 10 /TCS graphics library calls so that NPLOT can use the standard Tektronix 4010 which many PC terminal emulation software programs support. NPLOT is available in VAX BACKUP format on a 9 -track 1600 BPI DEC VAX BACKUP format magnetic tape (standard media) or a TK 50 tape cartridge. This program was developed in 1991.

40|$|Abstract—Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless systems are spectrally efficient {{but they are}} vulnerable to Inter carrier interference (ICI). The rapid variation of the channel can induce ICI. ICI will significantly increase the difficulty of OFDM channel estimation. Polynomial Cancellation Coding (PCC) is a self-cancellation scheme proposed by Y. Zhao and S. G. Haggman [5]. PCC has CIR improvement of more than 15 dB compared to conventional OFDM [6]. It is shown that performance is improved as compared to conventional OFDM by about 4 dB in the QPSK modulation at an error rate of 10 - 2 over fading channels with a <b>normalized</b> carrier frequency <b>offset</b> of 0. 1.

This paper proposes an efficient maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) using alternating projection technique, for the joint estimation of Rayleigh fading channels and multiple carrier frequency offsets (MCFO) in cooperative communication systems. Our proposed equalizer incorporates these channel and MCFO estimates and uses matrix inverse technique to decode the transmitted symbols.

The OSD is invoked only when the decoding failures are obtained for the preceded iterative decoding method. With respect to the existing OSD which is based on the accumulated log-likelihood ratio (LLR) metric, we extend the accumulative metric to the situation where the BP decoding is in the probability domain. Moreover, after generalizing the accumulative metric to the context of the <b>normalized</b> or <b>offset</b> min-sum decoding, the OSD shows appealing tradeoff between performance and complexity. In the OSD implementation, when deciding the true error pattern among many candidates, an alternative proposed proves to be effective {{to reduce the number of}} real additions without performance loss.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new method of carrier frequency offset estimation for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems. The method uses one or more pairs of adjacent subcarriers within an OFDM symbol. The pairs of subcarriers are modulated with equal amplitude and opposite polarity. In the absence of frequency offset, the received subcarrier pairs also have equal amplitude and opposite polarity. Frequency offset disrupts this balance in a predictable way. This is {{used as the basis}} for the new frequency offset estimator. When the <b>normalized</b> frequency <b>offset</b> is less than half of the subcarrier frequency spacing, the new estimator is shown to be an approximately linear function of carrier frequency offset. The method is particularly applicable to the technique of Polynomial Cancellation Coding (PCC) in which the data to be transmitted is mapped onto subcarrier pairs rather than individual subcarriers. A number of different implementations are possible depending on whether the basic modulation technique is ordinary OFDM, or PCC-OFDM. For use with ordinary OFDM pilot subcarrier pairs must be inserted. If the pilot pair is contained in a symbol that also carries data, when the frequency offset is not close to zero, inter-carrier interference (ICI) from the other subcarriers can result a large variance of the estimator. For PCC-OFDM the estimation can be based on the subcarrier pairs which are carrying data. The variance in this case is much reduced, both because of the reduced ICI of PCC-OFDM and because the estimate can be based on the average over a number of pairs. Simulation results are presented for a number of cases. 1...|$|R

This is arguably the strongest observational constraint yet against delayed merging remnants as the progenitors of long-duration GRBs. In the course of this study, we have also discovered the putative host galaxies of GRB 990510 and GRB 990308 in archival HST data.

40|$|Among all {{existing}} techniques for protein structure determination, NMR spectroscopy {{has the advantage}} to provide the most complete characterization of molecular structures in solution. On the other hand, the low sensitivity of NMR limits the available signal-to-noise ratio. This often leads to the disappearance of cross peaks and to the misinterpretations of noise peaks as peaks originating from the protein under consideration. These properties hamper {{the determination of the}} consistency between the two investigated spectra. In this work, a completely new quality control (AUREMOL-QTA) package has been developed in order to automatically infer structural conformational changes from spectral modifications (in a set of investigated spectra). These differences may be induced by alterations of the external conditions (e. g. temperature, pressure, pH and ligand binding) as well as (partial) protein denaturation. The complex task of manually collecting and interpreting vicinity relationships changes (through space and bonds) in order to extract structural modifications of the molecule is time demanding. The developed AUREMOL-QTA package facilitates this investigation by means of multi-dimensional NMR spectra and it is applicable to three main possible sceneries: 1. 	Quality control of a protein sample and assessment of the intact three- dimensional structure of the protein. 2. 	Automated identification of ligand binding sites by means of NMR spectroscopy. 3. 	Identification of structural changes (in the atomic resolution) induced by external perturbations such as pressure, pH and temperature. The AURMOL-QTA begins with a pre-processing step where one (or more) reference spectra of the target protein and one or more test spectra are <b>normalized</b> (spectral width, <b>offset,</b> receiver gain and the number of scans) to be properly compared. A possible spectrum shift is evaluated and if it has occurred it is corrected. The simulated spectrum of a protein can be used as an adjunctive reference spectrum and to recognize peak multiplets in the experimental spectra. If there are more reference spectra only the common peaks are retained and used for the requested comparison. The routine continues with a low-level analysis involving a peak feature collection (volume, line width, chemical shift, cross-correlation in the time domain and shape) with a consequent association of cross peaks among the spectra. A mid-level analysis relies on the calculation of feature-related Bayesian probabilities that the associated peaks represent the same signal. It facilitates the detection of missing signals and the identification of feature differences between the compared spectra. The ratio of matching peaks is computed in order to quantitatively determine the similarity of the investigated spectra. A high-level analysis allows the identification of structurally altered parts of the molecule, mapping the feature variations and computing the fraction of residues involved in the modifications. In particular, if NOESY and TOCSY spectra are investigated the symmetrical properties are exploited in order to perform an adjunctive pattern analysis of the residues. The method has been successfully tested on HSCQ spectra (pressurized with xenon) and on HSQC-TROSY spectra (with high pressure and temperature variations) of the human prion protein (huPrPC). It has been also used to compare the NOESY spectrum of the wild HPr protein from Staphylococcus aureus with the mutant (H 15 A) of the same protein and with the artificially denatured (partially and totally) ones. ...|$|R
