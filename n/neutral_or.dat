5|$|An atom is the {{smallest}} constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
5|$|King Stanisław Augustus {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. In Polish historiography and popular works, {{he has been}} criticized or marginalized by Szymon Askenazy, Joachim Lelewel, Jerzy Łojek (whom Andrzej Zahorski describes as Poniatowski's most vocal critic among modern historians), Tadeusz Korzon, Karol Zyszewski and Krystyna Zienkowska, whereas more <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> positive views have been expressed by Paweł Jasienica, Walerian Kalinka, Władysław Konopczyński, Stanisław Mackiewicz, Emanuel Rostworowski and Stanisław Wasylewski.|$|E

5|$|Mutations are {{changes in}} the DNA {{sequence}} of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter {{the product of a}} gene, or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{it has been suggested that}} if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> weakly beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Non-Christian {{sources are}} {{valuable}} in two ways. First, {{they show that}} even <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> hostile parties never evince any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, {{had a reputation as}} a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{occupiers}} chiefly came in {{the form}} of helping Allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this effort; for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 Allied servicemen to Gibraltar. The Comet Line had a series of safe houses throughout Belgium. Allied airmen were given civilian clothes and were frequently moved from house to house, staying with Belgian families who supported the resistance. The resistance would aid the airmen by giving them false papers and guiding them to either <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> Allied occupied territory.|$|E

5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
5|$|As Diệm had {{strongly}} discriminated along religious lines, the rebels' commented {{caused a}} negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau called on Buddhists {{to support the}} incumbent junta. The pro-Diệm speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist and anti-Diệm generals, such as Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Hữu Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively. They thought that Thảo and Phat might seek revenge, driving many anti-Diệm officers who may have otherwise been <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E
5|$|As Diệm had {{strongly}} discriminated {{in favor}} of minority Catholics and placed restrictions on Buddhism, the rebels' radio addresses caused an unsurprisingly negative response among the Buddhist majority. The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau spoke from a radio station in Nha Trang, exhorting his co-religionists to support the incumbent junta. The Diemist speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist or anti-Diệm generals, such as Thi and Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively, and feared retribution from Thảo and Phát. The speeches drove many anti-Diệm officers who may have otherwise been <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E
50|$|In {{photography}} and image processing, color balance is the global adjustment of {{the intensities of}} the colors (typically red, green, and blue primary colors). An important goal of this adjustment is to render specific colors - particularly neutral colors - correctly. Hence, the general method is sometimes called gray balance, <b>neutral</b> balance, <b>or</b> white balance. Color balance changes the overall mixture of colors in an image and is used for color correction. Generalized versions of color balance are used to correct colors other than <b>neutrals</b> <b>or</b> to deliberately change them for effect.|$|R

5|$|Brock {{continually}} {{kept the}} commanders of his posts informed of all developments. When {{news of the}} outbreak of war reached him, he sent a canoe party under the noted trader and voyager William McKay to the British outpost at St. Joseph Island on Lake Huron. His orders to commander (Captain Charles Roberts) allowed him {{to stand on the}} defensive or attack the nearby American outpost at Fort Mackinac at his discretion. Roberts immediately launched an attack on Fort Mackinac with a scratch force of regulars, fur traders, and First Nations warriors. On 17 July, the American garrison was taken by surprise (not being aware that war had been declared) and surrendered. This victory immediately encouraged many First Nations tribes, who had hitherto been <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> undecided, to give their active support to the British. They hoped to expel the American settlers from their territories west of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E
5|$|In {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> blue in color. The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg. The age of the ring system is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

5|$|The playable {{character}} can lead {{a group of}} three additional allies into battle, controlling their actions to attack a single enemy or to use specific powers. Characters can be set to one of three modes: defensive, <b>neutral,</b> <b>or</b> offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle. The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of injuries or staking—having been stabbed through the heart and rendered immobile.|$|E
5|$|The second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece (480–479 BC) {{occurred during the}} Greco-Persian Wars, as King Xerxes I of Persia sought to conquer all of Greece. The invasion was a direct, if delayed, response to {{the defeat of the}} first Persian {{invasion of}} Greece (492–490 BC) at the Battle of Marathon, which ended Darius I's attempts to subjugate Greece. After Darius's death, his son Xerxes spent several years planning for the second invasion, mustering an enormous army and navy. The Athenians and Spartans led the Greek resistance. About a tenth of the Greek city-states joined the 'Allied' effort; most remained <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> submitted to Xerxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip {{is greater than the}} rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E

5|$|Logan {{remained}} the Military Administrator and British representative to Samoa {{until the end}} of the war. At the time of its seizure, Samoa was politically stable and its economy was based on its plantations which were mainly German owned. Apart from replacing most of the key officials, who were Germans, with New Zealanders, he largely followed existing policies but over time made a series of misjudgements. The German-owned plantations were allowed to continue to operate but only to trade with <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> Allied countries. By 1916, most of the larger plantations were seized and placed into receivership when it was discovered that they were still trading with German companies. This placed considerable financial stress on the economy. Not long into Logan's administration, an uprising of Chinese labourers, who complained about their rations, had to be suppressed. He continued to restrict their civil liberties and over time most were repatriated back to China. By not implementing quarantine procedures, he significantly mishandled the arrival of the influenza pandemic in November 1918, which resulted in over 7,500 deaths. This represented over 20% of Samoa's population at the time. In the meantime, neighbouring American Samoa was quarantined by its Governor, John Martin Poyer, and consequently had no influenza deaths.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E
5|$|Oberon is the second-darkest large moon of Uranus after Umbriel. Its surface shows {{a strong}} {{opposition}} surge: its reflectivity decreases from 31% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 22% {{at an angle}} of about 1°. Oberon has a low Bond albedo of about 14%. Its surface is generally red in color, except for fresh impact deposits, which are <b>neutral</b> <b>or</b> slightly blue. Oberon is, in fact, the reddest among the major Uranian moons. Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical: the latter is much redder than the former, because it contains more dark red material. The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material spiraling in from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
