25|$|A gradual and {{generally}} cumulative drift in thermal EMF on long exposure at elevated temperatures. This is observed in all base-metal thermoelement materials and is mainly due to compositional changes caused by oxidation, carburization, or neutron irradiation {{that can produce}} transmutation in nuclear reactor environments. In the case of type-K thermocouples, manganese and aluminium atoms from the KN (<b>negative)</b> <b>wire</b> migrate to the KP (positive) wire, resulting in a down-scale drift due to chemical contamination. This effect is cumulative and irreversible.|$|E
25|$|The polywell {{attempts}} to confine the ions and electrons through two different means, borrowed from fusors and magnetic mirrors. The electrons {{are easier to}} confine magnetically because they have so much less mass than the ions.

In the fusor, they are attracted to a <b>negative</b> <b>wire</b> cage in the center.|$|E
25|$|In these {{thermocouples}} (chromel–gold/iron alloy), the <b>negative</b> <b>wire</b> is {{gold with}} a small fraction (0.03–0.15 atom percent) of iron. The impure gold wire gives the thermocouple a high sensitivity at low temperatures (compared to other thermocouples at that temperature), whereas the chromel wire maintains the sensitivity near room temperature. It {{can be used for}} cryogenic applications (1.2–300 K and even up to 600 K). Both the sensitivity and the temperature range depend on the iron concentration. The sensitivity is typically around 15 µV/K at low temperatures, and the lowest usable temperature varies between 1.2 and 4.2 K.|$|E
50|$|The {{connector}} physically isolates {{the positive}} and <b>negative</b> <b>wires</b> so that the connectors remain safe to use in damp conditions. This makes them safe for use in relatively low-current applications (up to about 15 A) in dirty conditions (for example, model boats or RC cars used outdoors).|$|R
50|$|A {{landslip}} or washaway detector {{is buried}} in the earth embankment, and opens a circuit should a landslide occur. It {{is not possible to}} guarantee that the wet earth of the embankment will not complete the circuit which is supposed to break. If the circuit is double cut with positive and <b>negative</b> <b>wires,</b> any wet conductive earth is likely to blow a fuse on the one hand, and short the detecting relay on the other hand, either of which is almost certain to apply the correct warning signal.|$|R
50|$|Another {{source of}} ground noise is also caused by unequal induced current. If a {{positive}} signal <b>wire</b> and <b>negative</b> signal <b>wire</b> travel different physical paths to the amplifier input then {{the differences in}} induced currents will arrive at the amplifier input terminals as differences which will be amplified. Thus {{it is imperative that}} the positive and <b>negative</b> signal <b>wires</b> are dressed out {{in such a way as}} to ensure that they both experience equal induction from outside sources. Two popular methods include using coaxial wire (both conductors have the same axis of rotation everywhere they exist, and thus have similar inductive experiences), and twisted pair where the two conductors have the same axis of rotation (but don't always exist in the same path).|$|R

Chemical decomposition.--Also distinct; {{and though}} Dr. Davy used an {{apparatus}} of similar construction {{with that of}} Dr. Wollaston (327.), still no error {{in the present case}} is involved, for the decompositions were polar, and in their nature truly electro-chemical. By the direction of the magnet {{it was found that the}} under surface of the fish was negative, and the upper positive; and in the chemical decompositions, silver and lead were precipitated on the wire connected with the under surface, and not on the other; and when these wires were either steel or silver, in solution of common salt, gas (hydrogen?) rose from the <b>negative</b> <b>wire,</b> but none from the positive.|$|E

A platina wire one twelfth of an inch in diameter, weighing two hundred and sixty grains, had the extremity rendered plain, so as to offer a definite surface equal to a circle of the same diameter as the wire; it was then connected in turn with the conductor of the machine, or with the voltaic apparatus (369.), so as always to form the positive pole, {{and at the same}} time retain a perpendicular position, that it might rest, with its whole weight, upon the test paper to be employed. The test paper itself was supported upon a platina spatula, connected either with the discharging train (292.), or with the <b>negative</b> <b>wire</b> of the voltaic apparatus, and it consisted of four thicknesses, moistened at all times to an equal degree in a standard solution of hydriodate of potassa (316.).|$|E

When the {{magnetic}} contact was made, the deflection was such as to indicate an induced current of {{electricity in the}} opposite direction to that fitted to form a magnet, having the same polarity as that really produced by contact with the bar magnets. Thus when the marked and unmarked poles were placed as in fig. 3, the current in the helix was in the direction represented, P being supposed {{to be the end of}} the wire going to the positive pole of the battery, or that end towards which the zinc plates face, and N the <b>negative</b> <b>wire.</b> Such a current would have converted the cylinder into a magnet of the opposite kind to that formed by contact with the poles A and B; and such a current moves {{in the opposite direction}} to the currents which in M. Ampère's beautiful theory are considered as constituting a magnet in the position figured[A].|$|E
40|$|A {{simple but}} novel driver {{system has been}} {{developed}} to operate the wire gating grid of a Time Projection Chamber (TPC). This system connects the wires of the gating grid to its driver via low impedance transmission lines. When the gating grid is open, all wires have the same voltage allowing drift electrons, produced by the ionization of the detector gas molecules, to pass through to the anode wires. When the grid is closed, the wires have alternating higher and lower voltages causing the drift electrons to terminate at the more positive wires. Rapid opening of the gating grid with low pickup noise is achieved by quickly shorting the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>wires</b> to attain the average bias potential with N-type and P-type MOSFET switches. The circuit analysis and simulation software SPICE shows that the driver restores the gating grid voltage to 90...|$|R

40|$|The {{ferromagnetic}} resonance properties in arrays of low diameter bistable nanowires have been studied. Measurements {{performed in the}} frequency swept mode show that in nonsaturated states, wires magnetized in {{the positive and negative}} direction absorb at different frequencies giving place to spectra with two absorption peaks. Moreover, the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>wires</b> obey different dispersion relations, which allow interpreting their different frequency-field dependence in terms of the uniform precession mode. Measurements along sets of first-order reversal curves allow to determine the dipolar interaction field {{as a function of the}} magnetic state. The configuration dependence of the interaction field is found to be proportional to the value of the dipolar interaction field of the saturated state. An analytical mean-field expression, which explicitly incorporates the dependence of the interaction field with the magnetic configuration, is proposed and used to obtain a general expression for both the effective field and the dispersion relation, which describes with remarkable agreement the {{ferromagnetic resonance}} measurements in saturated and nonsaturated states...|$|R

Upon fusing {{a portion of}} it {{on a piece of}} glass, and bringing the poles into contact with it, there is abundance of silver evolved at the negative pole, and an equal abundance absorbed at the positive pole, for no chlorine is set free: and by careful management, the <b>negative</b> <b>wire</b> may be withdrawn from the fused globule as the silver is reduced there, the latter serving as the continuation of the pole, until a wire or thread of revived silver, five or six inches in length, is produced; {{at the same time the}} silver at the positive pole is as rapidly dissolved by the chlorine, which seizes upon it, so that the wire has to be continually advanced as it is melted away. The whole experiment includes the action of only two elements, silver and chlorine, and illustrates in a beautiful manner their progress in opposite directions, parallel to the electric current, which is for the time giving a uniform general direction to their mutual affinities (524.).|$|E

A comparison of animals versus yeast has shown that, {{although most of the}} involved cell-cycle regulators are divergent in both clades, they fulfill a similar role and the overall network topology of G 1 /S regulation is highly conserved. Using germline development as a model system, we identified a regulatory cascade controlling entry into S phase in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which, {{as a member of the}} Plantae supergroup, is phylogenetically only distantly related to Opisthokonts such as yeast and animals.

40|$|A wire-to-plane {{discharge}} {{during the}} early phases of breakdown has been studied. The discharge has been modeled in a prolate spheroidal coordinate system with the wire shape taken as a hyperboloid of revolution. Four simultaneous coupled, time-dependent, nonlinear partial differential equations describe the electrical discharge. These are the conservation equations for ion and electron densities, the energy equation for electron temperature, and Poisson’s equation for the self-consistent electric field. By solving this formulation subject to appropriate initial and boundary conditions, charged particle densities and temperature variations have been obtained as the ionization progresses in the discharge. The results show that both the electron temperature and the charged particle densities increase with the progress of ionization. The effect of different wire polarities is also examined. With a positive wire polarity, the increases in electron temperature and charged particle densities are confined to regions of the discharge {{in the vicinity of}} the wire tip. With a <b>negative</b> <b>wire</b> polarity, the breakdown occurs in the entire gap at a faster rate than with a positive wire polarity. The wire polarity affects the magnitude of energy transfer between the particles...|$|E

50|$|A {{standard}} stereo jack {{is used on}} most battery-powered guitar effects pedals {{to eliminate}} the need for a separate power switch. In this configuration, the internal battery has its <b>negative</b> terminal <b>wired</b> to the sleeve contact of the jack. When the user plugs in a two-conductor (mono) guitar or microphone lead, the resulting short-circuit between sleeve and ring connects an internal battery to the unit's circuitry, ensuring that it powers up or down automatically whenever a signal lead is inserted or removed. A drawback of this design is the risk of inadvertently discharging the battery if the lead is not removed after use, such as if the equipment is left plugged in overnight.|$|R

Electron impact ionization, thermal ionization, and three-body recombination have been considered as the charged particle production and loss mechanisms. The electrode surfaces {{are considered to be}} absorbing and the initial density of the particles is small, but nonzero, A gap length of 0. 5 mm is investigated and the gas medium is air or argon at atmospheric pressure. The temporal development of the profiles of ion and electron number densities, potential and electric field, and current growth on both the electrodes are presented when the applied voltage is 1500 and 2500 V for both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>wires.</b> When the wire is negatively biased, the peaks in the radial distribution of both of the charged particle densities near the wire occur off the axis except during the very early part of the breakdown. With positive polarity, the electron density maximum always occurs on the discharge axis, while for ions it moves away from the axis, later in the transient, due to the reverse particle drift in the electric field from the negative polarity case, The discharge spreads farther out into the ambient (almost two times the gap length) when the wire is negatively biased than with positive polarity. The effect of charge separation on the externally applied electric field is significant at voltages 2500 V and higher. Ionization is greater in argon than in air for a fixed potential difference between the electrodes...|$|R
40|$|A new sensor for {{measuring}} liquid's {{flow rate in}} closed conduits is presented.
