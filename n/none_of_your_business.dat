25|$|In 1988, Morrissey {{launched}} his solo career with Viva Hate. This album and its follow-ups—Bona Drag, Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all {{did well in}} the UK Albums Chart and spawned a number of hit singles. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his subsequent albums, Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted, also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he embarked on a hiatus between 1998 and 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors, Years of Refusal, and World Peace Is <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Business.</b> He released his autobiography in 2013, followed by his first novel in 2015. His eleventh solo album, Low in High School, is set {{to be released in}} November 2017.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2013, Guru-Murthy interviewed Quentin Tarantino, who was {{promoting}} his new film, Django Unchained. When he asked Tarantino {{to consider whether}} there is a link between film violence and real-life atrocities in America, especially {{in the wake of the}} Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Tarantino stated that his opinion on the matter was well-documented and then responded, [...] "I refuse your question. I'm not your slave and you're not my master. You can't make me dance to your tune. I'm not a monkey." [...] When Guru-Murthy tried to steer the conversation back towards the subject later in the interview, Tarantino continued, [...] "It's <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> damn <b>business</b> what I think about that! … And I'm shutting your butt down." ...|$|R
5000|$|On March 15, 2013, Gucci Mane {{announced}} that frequent collaborator and close friend Waka Flocka Flame was [...] "dropped" [...] from 1017 Brick Squad Records. The two rappers proceeded to throw insults {{back and forth}} on Twitter. Though it was reported that Gucci's Twitter account was hacked, Waka stated, [...] "Dont let da media fool u. This shit real Shawty." [...] On March 27, 2013, during an MTV Jams interview with Sway, Waka explained that he would never do music nor business with Gucci ever again. Neither of the rappers have explained where the controversy originated from. Waka has stated, [...] "I guess we both be at the finish line we just going our own routes. That's all I can say. What's the reason? Sometimes it's <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> fuckin' <b>business</b> what's the reason. Just understand two men went they own ways but it's no problem." ...|$|R

2500|$|In March 2015, Morrissey {{released}} [...] "Kiss Me a Lot" [...] as {{the fifth}} single from World Peace Is <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Business.</b> After finishing a six date {{tour in the}} UK, he did a US tour during June and July, including a concert in New York with special guest Blondie at Madison Square Garden. In July 2015, he publicly claimed that an airport security guard had groped him at San Francisco International Airport. He filed a sexual assault complaint; the Transport Security Administration found no supporting evidence {{to act on the}} allegation.|$|E
2500|$|Also in January 2014, he {{announced}} that he had signed a two-record deal with Capitol Music, with recording to commence on 1 February in France. His 10th studio album, World Peace Is <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Business,</b> was released on 15 July. Prior to its release, he embarked on a US tour in May but was hospitalised in Boston in early June, and cancelled the remaining nine dates on the tour. The title track of the album was issued as a digital download in May. Three other songs, [...] "Istanbul", [...] "Earth Is the Loneliest Planet" [...] and [...] "The Bullfighter Dies" [...] followed in subsequent weeks. The songs were promoted with spoken word videos, featuring Morrissey reciting the lyrics.|$|E

5000|$|Jon Wiederhorn from Rolling Stone wrote after {{interviewing}} Staley {{in early}} 1996: [...] "When {{he returned from}} a trip to the bathroom, his sleeves were unbuttoned, exposing what appear to be red, round puncture marks from the wrist to the knuckles of his left hand. And as anyone who knows anything about IV drugs can tell you, the veins in the hands are used only after all the other veins have been tapped out." [...] The evidence of Staley's ongoing addiction was apparent, but he would deny using drugs when asked directly about it. [...] "If I'm staying busy, and if I'm getting my job done, and I'm doing things I think are great, then I don't have a problem with anything, you know?" [...] he asks. [...] "If I live on just a strictly sugar diet, hey, I like it. Nobody ever asks Meat Loaf, [...] "What do you eat? Why do you eat so much? Shouldn't you lose some weight?' No, he shouldn't. He's fucking Meat Loaf. He writes songs, and he has a great time, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> fuckin' <b>business.</b> Maybe he eats meatloaf every fucking night, you know?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2014, he {{released}} the song [...] "Nutty Bars", which generated {{a significant amount}} of buzz due to comparisons to Nas and the otherwise lack of information about the artist. The speculation began after Sacha Jenkins, a longtime associate of Nas, made a short positive review of the rapper on Mass Appeal with the sub-heading [...] "Who is this guy? <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> damn <b>business!</b> Just enjoy the music and stop asking questions." [...] The 10-song Your Old Droog EP was released soon after in June on SoundCloud, produced by Droog, Richard RTNC Herpe, and DJ Skizz. In August, Droog revealed himself in an interview with The New Yorker and soon showed his face {{for the first time in}} a video of him freestyling. [...] At the time, he embraced the publicity and speculation regarding his identity, expressing that [...] "This is like my street team, why would I stop free publicity?" [...] He played his first concert on September 3 to a sold out crowd at Webster Hall. [...] His debut self-titled album was released digitally on November 26, which included the 10 songs from the EP along with 8 new songs produced by EL RTNC. A limited edition of the album was released on vinyl shortly before the digital release.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more recent}} example is Monty Python's Matching Tie and Handkerchief. Also Tool's 1992 EP release, Opiate {{featured}} on the second side a double groove that would either play the first track of side two or the hidden song that was found {{at the end of}} the CD version. The Marillion Brave vinyl has a double groove on side four, ending the album either happily with the track Made Again or less so with water noise. In 2005 a 7-inch single titled [...] "The Road Leads Where It's Led" [...] by The Secret Machines was released in UK that contained both tracks on one side on parallel grooves. The Summer 1980 Mad magazine Super Special included a one-sided sound sheet (see [...] "flexidisc" [...] above), playable on a standard turntable. It had eight interlaced grooves, each track starts with the same happy and upbeat [...] "Super Spectacular Day" [...] beginning of the song but have eight different dark and gloomy endings. In the 1980s, Rhino Records re-released the Henny Youngman comedy album 128 Greatest Jokes as a series of concentric grooves, which they call a [...] "Trick-Track Master". Each side of the album has four grooves. In the 1980s, the band Pink Slip Daddy released a 10-inch single called [...] "LSD" [...] on clear pink vinyl with pink glitter inside the vinyl. One side of the single had one song that played from inside out and, on the other side, there were two songs that were pressed as concentric grooves. Many of The Shins' 7-inch records have parallel grooves (such as their 2007 single [...] "Phantom Limb," [...] which has [...] "Nothing at All" [...] and [...] "Split Needles (Alt. Version)" [...] on the b-side.) The band <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Fucking <b>Business</b> released a one-sided 7-inch called [...] "NOYFB Escapes from Hell" [...] (side 2 has a groove, but there is no audio encoded in the groove), with 2 grooves that started from the center and ended on the outside of the disc. One groove ran at 45 RPM, while the other ran at 33 RPM. UK punk rocker Johnny Moped's debut album Cycledelic has a lead track with a parallel groove listed on the label as [...] "0. Mystery Track," [...] which runs parallel to the track. The 12-inch single for rap group De La Soul's 1989 song [...] "Me Myself and I" [...] has two different tracks in a parallel groove on the B-side. One groove has the Oblapos remixes of [...] "Me Myself and I," [...] while the other has [...] "Brain Washed Follower." ...|$|R
