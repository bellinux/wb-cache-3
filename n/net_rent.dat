40|$|Purpose - This paper {{identifies}} {{the importance of}} key factors influencing the quality of CBD office buildings. An office building quality index (BQI) is constructed and its relationship with <b>net</b> <b>rent</b> assessed. Design/methodology/approach - The importance of 30 property-specific CBD office building attributes {{on the quality of}} CBD office buildings is assessed using a survey of property industry respondents. The analytical hierarchy process procedure is used to determine weights for each of these attributes to construct an office BQI. Findings - Findings indicate that functionality (31. 0 per cent), services (22. 6 per cent), access and circulation (16. 4 per cent), presentation (13. 1 per cent), management (11. 5 per cent) and amenities (5. 4 per cent) are the order of importance in assessing office building quality. There was found to be a strong functional relationship between office building quality and <b>net</b> <b>rent.</b> Practical implications - A better understanding of the factors influencing CBD office building quality is determined, with a more effective and practical office BQI developed for benchmarking purposes in property portfolios. Originality/value - Importance of CBD office building attributes is determined and a new CBD office BQI is developed for practical implementation in the property industry. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In most cases the calculation of service ch rge contribution for tenants of commercial real estate includes property taxes.

The ability to vary capital intensity also raises the specter of perverse responses where increases in interest rates accelerate investment decisions.

40|$|Home {{ownership}} is a {{claim on the}} stream of <b>net</b> <b>rents.</b> Like any income-producing asset, the market capitalizes its value. The price-rent multiple depends upon the expected growth rate of revenues and expenses, on financing terms, and on taxes. This paper derives this price-rent multiple in terms of these variables and calculates its value from 1963 through 1978. The results indicate that housing prices grew more rapidly than rents and the CPI largely {{as the result of}} a 33 % increase in the price-rent multiple over those years. This increase in the capitalization rate occurred, despite higher nominal financing terms, because the relative terms of housing finance tended to ease and because the expected growth rate of rents increased more than its discount rate.

40|$|A {{model of}} the real estate market is {{developed}} where the rent-vacancy trade-off also embeds selections on expenses. High expenses and rents or low expenses and rents are explicit strategies, positioning properties along an efficient isoprofit frontier. Instead of a rent-vacancy trade-off, the operator can select either gross or <b>net</b> <b>rent,</b> or some combination as an offset for vacancy. This macrostructure is more in keeping with observed real estate markets, where some managers focus on net operating income, and others on effective gross income. Empirical results for apartments in Portland, Oregon supports the hypothesis that expenses and rents are positively correlated. An aggressive expense-increasing strategy pays off in higher rents, though in not all cases is net operating income positive. There are two implications. First, incentives in management create strategies to maximize gross as opposed to net income. Second, rent-vacancy trade-offs that use gross income may misstate the adjustment toward equilibrium. ...|$|E
40|$|High rise office {{buildings}} represent large capital outlays in very competitive markets. Investment and development decisions require careful market analysis to assure sufficient demand to lease the office space at rental rates {{which will make}} the venture financially attractive. Present methodology for analyzing future {{commercial real estate market}} conditions can at best be said to be inadequate. This methodology relies on concepts such as "market absorption" rates and "normal" vacancy rates. These concepts usually rely on accounting type and trend line techniques to provide forecasts of space demand. In this paper we provide an alternative methodology for forecasting the key variables in the office space market by developing a statistical model of supply and demand. The key variables that need to be forecasted are the stock of office space (in square feet), the flow of new office construction (in square feet), the vacancy rate (in percent), and the rent for office space (<b>net</b> <b>rent</b> per square foot).

40|$|Since 1938 {{there has}} been a policy of rent {{arbitration}} in the Netherlands. Rent arbitration appeared to be necessary through the price policy of agricultural products. The purpose was to divide agricultural income fairly between farmers and the landowners. The author argued that rent arbitration should also be treated as an instrument and not only a consequence of agricultural price policy. By giving guaranteed prices to the farmers the government influenced on the land rent, but the land rent resulting from arbitration should also influence the guaranteed prices for agricultural products. The thesis provides a detailed description and analysis of the methods of rent arbitration, and some suggestions for improving the methods. Rent arbitration had had an important influence: before rent arbitration came into force, total <b>net</b> <b>rent</b> was about 25 % of agricultural income, whereas it is now only 5 %.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} in-kind {{benefits}} such as voucher programs may {{have a significant impact}} on the price of the subsidized good. It is thus very important to take this effect into account to assess properly the efficiency of such welfare programs. We use a French housing benefit reform to evaluate the effects of the benefits on rents. We find that one additional euro of housing benefit leads to an increase of 78 cents in rents, leaving only 22 cents for low income households to reduce their <b>net</b> <b>rent</b> and increase their consumption. This large impact of housing benefits on rents seems to be caused by a very low housing supply elasticity. We show that the housing benefits reform has induced additional demand not only from low income households but also from students who have used the benefits to become independent. Unfortunately, housing supply has responded very little in the short and middle term to the increase in demand. The only possible effect of the reform is a small increase in housing quality. These results question the use of such in-kind transfers when the supply of subsidized good is almost inelastic. ∗ ENS- EHESS (Fédération Paris-Jourdan,cepremap) ...|$|E
