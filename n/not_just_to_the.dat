The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{theories}} of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, {{it is reasonable}} to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional {{theories of}} grammar differ from formal theories of grammar, in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formal relations between linguistic elements.|$|E

25|$|Hence, blood {{with high}} carbon dioxide levels is also lower in pH (more acidic). Hemoglobin can bind protons and carbon dioxide, which causes a {{conformational}} {{change in the}} protein and facilitates the release of oxygen. Protons bind at various places on the protein, while carbon dioxide binds at the α-amino group. Carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin and forms carbaminohemoglobin. This decrease in hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen by the binding {{of carbon dioxide and}} acid is known as the Bohr effect The Bohr effect favors the T state rather than the R state. (shifts the O2-saturation curve to the right). Conversely, when the carbon dioxide levels in the blood decrease (i.e., in the lung capillaries), carbon dioxide and protons are released from hemoglobin, increasing the oxygen affinity of the protein. A reduction in the total binding capacity of hemoglobin to oxygen (i.e. shifting the curve down, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right) due to reduced pH is called the root effect. This is seen in bony fish.|$|E

In 1908, Edmund Dulac produced an edition of Shakespeare's Comedy of The Tempest with a scholarly plot summary and commentary by Arthur Quiller-Couch, lavishly bound and illustrated with 40 watercolour illustrations. The illustrations highlight the fairy-tale quality of the play, avoiding its dark side. Of the 40, only 12 are direct depictions of the action of the play: the others are based on action before the play begins, or on images such as [...] "full fathom five thy father lies" [...] or [...] "sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not".|$|E

They rejected the principle that there was a constitutional right to reside in one's own country, calling it [...] "extreme", and concluded that in any case no such right could not trump legislation such as an Order in Council. The phrase [...] "peace, order and good government", they thought, should be understood as referring <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of BIOT but to the governance of the region.
