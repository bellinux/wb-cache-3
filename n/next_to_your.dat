Schwartz also noted character-focused moments such as the Johnson and May heart-to-heart and the revelations about Mace, while highliy criticizing the ghost effects, saying, [...] "Maybe it's Lucy's makeup or maybe it's the downside of having a TV show budget, but the look of these affected beings takes me out of the episode whenever they appear.

He is known for his belting power, versatility and wide tenor vocal range, spanning over four octaves. Heavily influenced by Little Richard, McCartney's vocals would cross several musical genres throughout his career. On [...] "Call Me Back Again", according to Benitez, [...] "McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist" [...] while MacDonald called [...] "I'm Down" [...] "a rock-and-roll classic" [...] that [...] "illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility".

[...] MacDonald described [...] "I've Got a Feeling" [...] as a [...] "raunchy, mid-tempo rocker" [...] with a [...] "robust and soulful" [...] vocal performance and [...] "Back in the U.S.S.R." [...] as [...] "the last of [...] up-tempo rockers", McCartney's [...] "belting" [...] vocals among his best since [...] "Drive My Car", recorded three years earlier.
