5|$|On {{geophysical}} evidence, {{most of the}} nickel on Earth {{is believed}} to be in the Earth's outer and inner cores. Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel. For kamacite, the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90:10 to 95:5, although impurities (such as cobalt or carbon) may be present, while for taenite the <b>nickel</b> <b>content</b> is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, most sulfide ores {{have been}} {{processed}} using pyrometallurgical techniques {{to produce a}} matte for further refining. Recent advances in hydrometallurgical techniques resulted in significantly purer metallic nickel product. Most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction. In hydrometallurgical processes, nickel sulfide ores are concentrated with flotation (differential flotation if Ni/Fe ratio is too low) and then smelted. The nickel matte is further processed with the Sherritt-Gordon process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide, leaving a concentrate of cobalt and nickel. Then, solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel, with the final <b>nickel</b> <b>content</b> greater than 99%.|$|E
5|$|Beads {{made from}} {{meteoric}} iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a dagger made of meteoric iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the <b>nickel</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{aspect ratio}} and {{morphology}} of acicular ferrite formed in C-Mn-Ni weld metals {{and the effect}} of <b>nickel</b> and oxygen <b>contents</b> have been investigated. The experimental results revealed that nickel has a strong effect on the acicularity of acicular ferrite in C-Mn-Ni weld metals. High <b>nickel</b> <b>contents</b> resulted in sharper acicularferrite laths with a larger aspect ratio. It is considered that the two dominant mechanisms are the role of nickel in changing the balance of incoherent/coherent growth ledges, and the transformation temperatures at which this growth takes place. Reducing the oxygen content in the weld metals was also found to increase the aspect ratio...|$|R

25|$|The gold group, with a cubic {{close-packed}} structure, includes metals such as gold, silver, and copper. The platinum {{group is}} similar in structure to the gold group. The iron-nickel group is characterized by several iron-nickel alloy species. Two examples are kamacite and taenite, which are found in iron meteorites; these species differ {{by the amount of}} Ni in the alloy; kamacite has less than 5–7% nickel and is a variety of native iron, whereas the <b>nickel</b> <b>content</b> of taenite ranges from 7–37%. Arsenic group minerals consist of semi-metals, which have only some metallic; for example, they lack the malleability of metals. Native carbon occurs in two allotropes, graphite and diamond; the latter forms at very high pressure in the mantle, which gives it a much stronger structure than graphite.|$|E

500|$|Because the ores {{of nickel}} are easily mistaken for ores of silver, {{understanding}} of this metal and its use dates to relatively recent times. However, the unintentional use of nickel is ancient, and {{can be traced back}} as far as 3500 BCE. Bronzes from what is now Syria have been found to contain as much as 2% nickel. Some ancient Chinese manuscripts suggest that [...] "white copper" [...] (cupronickel, known as baitong) was used there between 1700 and 1400 BCE. This Paktong white copper was exported to Britain as early as the 17th century, but the <b>nickel</b> <b>content</b> of this alloy was not discovered until 1822. Coins of nickel-copper alloy were minted by the Bactrian kings Agathocles, Euthydemus II and Pantaleon in the 2nd Century BCE, possibly out of the Chinese cupronickel.|$|E
500|$|Sensitized {{individuals}} may show a skin contact allergy to nickel {{known as a}} contact dermatitis. Highly sensitized {{individuals may}} also react to foods with high <b>nickel</b> <b>content.</b> Sensitivity to nickel may also be present in patients with pompholyx. Nickel is the top confirmed contact allergen worldwide, partly due to its use in jewelry for pierced ears. Nickel allergies affecting pierced ears are often marked by itchy, red skin. Many earrings are now made without nickel or low-release nickel to address this problem. The amount allowed in products that contact human skin is now regulated by the European Union. In 2002, researchers found that the nickel released by 1 and 2 Euro coins was far in excess of those standards. This {{is believed to be}} the result of a galvanic reaction. Nickel was voted Allergen of the Year in 2008 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. In August 2015, the American Academy of Dermatology adopted a position statement on the safety of nickel: [...] "Estimates suggest that contact dermatitis, which includes nickel sensitization, accounts for approximately $1.918 billion and affects nearly 72.29 million people." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} textural relationships in hydrated upper mantle peridotites emplaced at a non-constructive ridge segment. Development of serpentinites and partially serpentinized peridotites {{takes place in}} four main stages: (1) pervasive serpentinization forming mainly lizardite, (2) a tensional stage forming chrysotile + talc + chlorite, (3) a deformational stage forming antigorite + tremolite, and (4) a late local tensional stage forming another generation of chrysotile veinlets. Mineral chemistry of serpentine pseudomorphs reflects in part primary mineral compositions. Olivine pseudomorphs are typically nickeliferous and depleted in aluminum and chromium. Orthopyroxene pseudomorphs have lower <b>nickel</b> <b>contents</b> and relatively high iron, aluminum, and chromium contents. Clinopyroxene pseudomorphs have very low <b>nickel</b> <b>contents</b> and relatively high aluminum and chromium contents. These chemical patterns in the serpentinites {{can be used to}} help discriminate between harzburgitic and lherzolitic protoliths. Oxygen isotopes and mineral parageneses suggest serpentine is derived from circulation of hydrothermal (200 °C) fluids through the peridotite body. Crystallization of tremolite, talc, and chlorite may have occurred at temperatures up to 525 °C if C 02 /H 20 ratios were less than 0. 25.
