The coif was white and made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who {{were not allowed to}} cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white cloth {{to the top of the}} wig, representing the coif.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{extraordinary}} claim by the VVS’s Il-2s is that, {{over a period of}} four hours, they destroyed 240 tanks and in the process virtually wiped out the 17th Panzer Division.

Writing on the first charge, he said that Irish troops were <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area at the time. Instead, he {{detailed}} that Ethiopian soldiers had stormed the hospital compound after being subjected to heavy firing from Katangese gendarmes who had dug in there. Gardiner reported that the nun on duty had said some of the patients were wearing khaki clothing similar to the gendarmes' uniforms. He conceded that one patient was shot in the leg while another received a grazing wound. Gardiner also said no protests of the presence of gendarmes was ever forwarded to the International Red Cross and that the mother superior of the hospital testified that medical authorities had been advised by Union Minière officials to refrain from taking any action against the gendarmes and to avoid involving themselves in the matter altogether. As for the 70 corpses brought to Prince Leopold Hospital, Gardiner stated that [...] "o evidence has been produced to substantiate this allegation." ...|$|E
500|$|In issuing desired {{specifications}} {{for the design}} that would become the Nevada-class, the Navy's General Board asked for triple gun turrets, i.e. three guns mounted per turret. They were very unsatisfied with the awkward placement required on classes preceding the Nevadas, which had five and six two-gun turrets—yet moving back to the four two-gun turrets of the [...] would be a significant loss in firepower. Although a triple turret was first proposed in American professional magazines in 1901 and briefly considered for the South Carolinas, it was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental stage—the first turret was authorized in 1911 {{and would not be}} ready until months after contracts for the new ships would be signed with the shipbuilders. The decision {{to go ahead with the}} turret was a calculated gamble, but proved to be a qualified success; the only issue came with shell interference when the center and outside guns were fired simultaneously, which was easily solved by delaying the firing of the center barrel by a small fraction of a second. Moreover, there was a major benefit in weight thanks to the accompanying loss of an armored barbette and turret. These weight savings were applied to the armor protection, making the [...] "all or nothing" [...] concept a reality.|$|E

500|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{also helped}} popularize {{political}} subject matter in hip hop music, as it epitomized the resurgence in black consciousness among African-American youths {{at the turn}} of the 1990s, amid a turbulent social and political zeitgeist during the Bush administration and South African apartheid. Black consciousness became the prevailing subject matter of many hip hop acts, exemplified by X-Clan's cultural nationalism on their debut album To the East, Blackwards, the revolutionary, Black Panther-minded The Devil Made Me Do It by Paris, and the Five Percenter religious nationalism of Poor Righteous Teachers' debut Holy Intellect. Christgau wrote in 1990 that Public Enemy had become not only [...] "the most innovative popular musicians in America if not the world" [...] but also [...] "the most politically ambitious. <b>Not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heyday of [...] Clash has any group come so close to the elusive and perhaps ridiculous '60s rock ideal of raising political consciousness with music." [...] Their music on the album inspired leftist and Afrocentric ideals among rap listeners who were previously exposed to more materialist themes in the music.

500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earliest drafts, then at first {{was not a}} villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] {{if we were going}} to make the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E

Kelly stated that no person would wish for a person to stop breathing for the sake of the film, but noted that it was not the best point of vision, but noted that the scene was well-managed. In Britain, The Bioscope reviewer agreed with other reviewers in finding the film to be, [...] "...a perfectly delightful little film. Although it is true that its plot, what there is of it, contains nothing very new, it is not merely a conventional dog and child picture of the ordinary type. It is, rather, an exquisite pictorial fancy, charmingly conceived for the most part and charmingly executed throughout. ...
