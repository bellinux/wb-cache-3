2500|$|The {{growth of}} private-label {{securitization}} {{and lack of}} regulation {{in this part of}} the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led, in 2006, to an increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrowers,</b> often with poor credit, who were unable to pay their mortgages – particularly with adjustable rate mortgages (ARM), caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures. As a result, home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages. This depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the GSEs, which back the majority of US mortgages. In July 2008, the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that [...] "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in the US housing finance system". The US Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs' stock. Despite these efforts, by August 2008, shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had tumbled more than 90% from their one-year prior levels.|$|E

40|$|Conference Theme: Exploring the Information FrontierLenders face great {{uncertainty}} {{because of}} the information asymmetry problem in peerto-peer (P 2 P) marketplaces. This paper studies an online feature on a P 2 P platform, which allows lenders to seek information directly from the <b>borrower</b> <b>of</b> a loan, and examines {{the impact of the}} direct lender-borrower communication on the funding outcomes and the loan performance. Our analysis results show that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lender comments is negatively associated with funding success. This implies that as a listing receives more comments from lenders, the chance of getting funded is lower. On the other hand, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrower</b> responses and response length are positively associated with funding success, although they cannot help reduce the final interest rate. The role <b>of</b> <b>borrower</b> response is even stronger for listings with poor credit grades.

40|$|We {{conduct an}} {{empirical}} investigation to explain observed differentials in mortgage overage pricing. Our analysis makes several contributions. First, we study {{an area of}} mortgage pricing that is little understood by consumers and has received little scrutiny in the literature. Second, we consider {{the impact of the}} market power of individual loan officers on overages paid by borrowers, particularly minorities. Third, we include a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>borrower</b> and lender characteristics not available in previous analysis.; Importantly, we introduce a new direct measure of the market power of individual loan officers. We also incorporate the interactive effects of loan officer market power and the race <b>of</b> the <b>borrower</b> in determining the rate of the mortgage loan. Through the use of these new variables and employing proprietary data from different branches of a nationwide mortgage lending institution, we conclude that the market power of the lender and the bargaining or negotiating ability <b>of</b> the <b>borrower</b> are important determinants of overages. We find that overages paid by minorities who purchase homes are larger than those paid by whites. Our evidence suggests that this is due to differences in the pools <b>of</b> <b>borrowers</b> rather than to racial discrimination. Indeed, tests show that the pool of refinancings is more homogeneous across races than the pool for purchases, and we find no differences by race for refinancings. We conclude that a more effective way to eliminate racial differences in overages is to pursue policies designed to increase the ability of minorities to bargain more effectively rather than to enact additional antidiscrimination laws.
