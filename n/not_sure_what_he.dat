Jackson's father Joseph also approved of the project and allowed him to record it on the condition that it didn't interfere with group business. Despite his brothers' desire to work with him, Jackson wanted to make the album independently of his family. Nevertheless, his brother Randy still contributed percussion to [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".|$|E

60|$|Upon {{returning}} to the cabin they found Allie had left her room. From appearances Neale concluded {{that she had made}} little use of the things he had brought her. He was conscious of something akin to impatience. He was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did feel. The situation had subtly changed and grown, all in that brief talk with Slingerland. Neale slowly walked out toward the brook, where he expected to find her. It struck him suddenly that if she had watched for him all week and had run when he came, then she must have wanted to see him, but was afraid or shy or perverse. How like any girl! Possibly in the week past she had unconsciously grown a little away from her grief.|$|E

6000|$|Practically and inevitably, for the time, to companionship, to the perpetual, {{the even}} exaggerated {{reference}} and {{appeal of a}} person brought to dependence by his time of life and his infirmities and always addicted moreover--this was the exaggeration--to the art of giving you pleasure by letting you do things for him. There were certain things Mr. Offord was capable of pretending he liked you to do even when he didn't--this, I mean, if he thought YOU liked them. If it happened that you didn't either--which was rare, yet might be--of course there were cross-purposes; but Brooksmith was there to prevent their going very far. This was precisely the way he acted as moderator; he averted misunderstandings or cleared them up. He had been capable, strange as it may appear, of acquiring for this purpose an insight into the French tongue, which was often used at Mr. Offord's; for besides being habitual {{to most of the}} foreigners, and they were many, who haunted the place or arrived with letters--letters often requiring a little worried consideration, of which Brooksmith always had cognisance--it had really become the primary language of the master of the house. I don't know if all the malentendus were in French, but almost all the explanations were, and this didn't a bit prevent Brooksmith's following them. I know Mr. Offord used to read passages to him from Montaigne and Saint-Simon, for he read perpetually when alone--when THEY were alone, that is--and Brooksmith was always about. Perhaps you'll say no wonder Mr. Offord's butler regarded him as [...] "rather mad." [...] However, if I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought about Montaigne I'm convinced he admired Saint-Simon. A certain feeling for letters must have rubbed off on him from the mere handling of his master's books, which he was always carrying to and fro and putting back in their places.|$|E
6000|$|As I have intimated, Mr. Abbey never {{deals with}} the things and figures of to-day; his {{imagination}} must perform a wide backward journey before it can take the air. But beyond this modern radius it breathes with singular freedom and naturalness. At a distance of fifty years it begins to be at home; it expands and takes possession; it recognizes its own. With all his ability, with all his tact, {{it would be impossible}} to him, we conceive, to illustrate a novel of contemporary manners; he would inevitably throw it back to the age of hair-powder and post-chaises. The coats and trousers, the feminine gear, the chairs and tables of the current year, the general aspect of things immediate and familiar, say nothing to his mind, and there are other interpreters to whom he is quite content to leave them. He shows no great interest even in the modern face, if there be a modern face apart from a modern setting; I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks of its complications and refinements of expression, but he has certainly little relish for its banal, vulgar mustache, its prosaic, mercantile whisker, surmounting the last new thing in shirt-collars. Dear to him is the physiognomy of clean-shaven periods, when cheek and lip and chin, abounding in line and surface, had the air of soliciting the pencil. Impeccable as he is in drawing, he likes a whole face, with reason, and likes a whole figure; the latter not to the exclusion of clothes, in which he delights, but as the clothes of our great-grandfathers helped it to be seen. No one has ever understood breeches and stockings better than he, or the human leg, that delight of the draughtsman, as the costume of the last century permitted it to be known. The petticoat and bodice of the same period have as little mystery for him, and his women and girls have altogether the poetry of a by-gone manner and fashion. They are not modern heroines, with modern nerves and accomplishments, but figures of remembered song and story, calling up visions of spinet and harpsichord that have lost their music today, high-walled gardens that have ceased to bloom, flowered stuffs that are faded, locks of hair that are lost, love-letters that are pale. By which I don't mean that they are vague and spectral, for Mr. Abbey has in the highest degree the art of imparting life, and he gives it in particular to his well-made, blooming maidens. They live in a world in which there is no question of their passing Harvard or other examinations, but they stand very firmly on their quaintly-shod feet. They are exhaustively [...] "felt," [...] and eminently qualified to attract the opposite sex, which is not the case with ghosts, who, moreover, do not wear the most palpable petticoats of quilted satin, nor sport the most delicate fans, nor take generally the most ingratiating attitudes.|$|E

50|$|It was {{observed}} that when Jowani {{was sent to}} dig the hole {{as a form of}} punishment all the digging equipment, wheelbarrows and send were on the move without any human intervention. Hosanna was heard singing in the air and it was as loud as a thousand people singing.

Aniello began production {{on the album}} in Los Angeles while the band toured. Aniello said, [...] "He was gone most of the time, so we weren't able to sit in a room and sort it all out.

After school he looks for J.T., and finds Ricky beating him up in an alley behind the school. Adam comes to J.T.'s defense and gets in another fight with Ricky.

When Fifi's performance was over all of the judges gave him a yes, except Željko who said he was shocked and <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> made of the act. When commenting on the performance, Željko refrained from using either male or female sex when talking to Fifi. Željko also added he's not conservative which prompted Kristina to ask him [...] "You aren't?". When voting, before giving a no, Željko said: [...] "I don't like it. But you sing good.".After the episode was broadcast, LGBT organisations were outraged and wanted Željko to apologize for the way he acted. Željko responded on Twitter that he doesn't think he did anything wrong and that everyone's entitled to their opinion.
