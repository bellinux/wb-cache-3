500|$|According to Durst, Limp Bizkit would [...] "comb {{the world}} for the illest guitar player known to man" [...] to replace Borland. After holding a {{nationwide}} audition for a new guitarist, [...] "Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is", the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith. [...] "Mike brought in a breath of fresh air," [...] Durst said. [...] "Creatively, it fit like a glove. It made life easier and more positive. It made us look forward to getting together as a band so much more. The positive effect he had on me just made the whole experience of Limp Bizkit feel like a brand-new entity." [...] Before Smith replaced Borland, Durst played a great deal of guitar. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit jammed with four finalists after their much-publicized guitarist audition tour, but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like Fred Durst might be taking a cue from his Puddle of Mudd pal Wes Scantlin and handling both vocal and guitar duties himself." ...|$|E
500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} {{moderately}} well received by critics. Writing for Common Sense Media, Melissa Camacho spoke favorably of the series' emphasis on [...] "a successful and powerful {{segment of the}} African-American community" [...] {{that appears to be}} frequently neglected by the popular television. Tim Hall from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented of his general distaste for reality television, particularly describing The Real Housewives of Orange County as [...] "utterly ridiculous". However, he admitted that the dynamic and conflict between the women, in addition to the wealthy lifestyles they led, to be [...] "somewhat entertaining". In a more mixed review, Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times joked that its portrayal of wealth served as [...] "the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade" [...] when noting the economic downturn the United States experienced around the time that the series premiered, although more seriously stated that the housewives' luxuries [...] "was never all that enviable, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as if it might not be viable." [...] Hanh Nguyen from Zap2It shared a similar sentiment, criticizing that the [...] "showy elite and rampant consumerism" [...] that the women regularly display [...] "seems rather out of touch" [...] given the United States' economic hardship, although she elaborated that the program [...] " [...] not by any means boring, but you do {{have to be in the}} mood to watch." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2003, British musicologists {{stumbled}} upon superficial {{similarities between the}} lyric and rhyming schemes of [...] "Yesterday" [...] and Nat King Cole's and Frankie Laine's [...] "Answer Me, My Love"; originally a German song by Gerhard Winkler and Fred Rauch called Mütterlein, it was a number 1 hit for Laine on the UK charts in 1953 as [...] "Answer Me, O Lord", leading to speculation that McCartney had {{been influenced by the}} song. McCartney's publicists denied any resemblance between [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] and [...] "Yesterday". [...] "Yesterday" [...] begins with the lines: [...] "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as though they're here to stay." [...] In its second stanza, [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] has the lines: [...] "You were mine yesterday. I believed that love was here to stay. Won't you tell me where I've gone astray".|$|E
60|$|But the spine. For that, {{the best}} way we can {{consider}} it is, with a crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But <b>now</b> <b>it's</b> done, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> much like Pompey's Pillar.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} both Tom and Sam were much {{alarmed by the}} forward move of the black bear. Up to this instant they had trusted the beast would depart with the fox's carcass, without {{discovering}} them. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> {{as if they were}} in for a hot fight, and that without delay.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was a note}} in {{her voice}} that struck through even Carl's thick thought. He did not reply, but {{continued}} to dwell upon that reply until its entire meaning came to him. Then his face became pitiful to see. It was usually round and red, but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> long and heavy and bitter. He was so infertile of phrases he could only say: ...|$|R
2500|$|Following on from Martin Kemp's {{decision}} to quit EastEnders, Outhwaite announced she was quitting the soap {{in the autumn}} of 2001, stating, [...] "I'm not sure what was left for Mel to do after she had been kidnapped, been married twice, burnt down a club and slept with her best friend's husband [...] To be honest with you, Mel's role in EastEnders has come to a kind of natural end. I always said I'd go when I felt that the character had run her course, and I'm going to leave when my contract runs out next year [...] Martin and I are in very similar situations with our characters. We came in at a similar time, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like we'll leave at a similar time, too. Mel and Steve had some kind of aura, a chemistry, that was unique. I was really proud of it." [...] She added, [...] "I'll always be indebted to EastEnders for providing me with a wonderful start to my career on television and the opportunity to play a character like Mel has been fabulous. I felt {{it was time to move}} on and try on a new coat – new characters, new challenges." [...] EastEnders executive producer John Yorke said of Outhwaite's departure, [...] "Tamzin has created one of the most-loved characters and (with Martin Kemp) one half of the most-admired on-screen couple in EastEnders since the show started. She has been fantastic to work with and we wish her all the luck in her career." [...] Yorke added that the character would be welcome back any time.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the {{recording}} process, Kerrang! reported that the band's new album would be released sometime in 2010. Towards the end of {{the recording}} process, Gaskarth said the album would be released in January 2011. On August 17, a demo was posted online of the track [...] "Actors". Gaskarth said he posted it because he [...] "thought people should hear it." [...] He said that the song wouldn't fit on Dirty Work since it [...] "didn't represent the theme of the new album closely enough." [...] After appearing at Reading and Leeds Festivals in August, the band returned to the studio to finalise the album's track listing in September. In October and November, the band went on a headlining club tour in the US with support from A Rocket to the Moon and City (Comma) State. The band held a contest where five fans could hear the new album at each stop on the tour. On October 18, the album's title as revealed: Dirty Work. In November, Barakat revealed that the album's release date had been pushed back to early spring and {{that the majority of the}} album's songs were mixed. In December, [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass" [...] was made available for streaming. In January 2011, Gaskarth said the group were sorting out the track order and working on the album's artwork. He also said that the album was originally going to be released in the same month, [...] "but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like we’re going to have to push it back" [...] and were aiming for its release between January and March. During an interview in early February, Gaskarth stated that the band were currently approving artwork. He went on to say: [...] "the record is slated to be released in late March so I would expect people to start hearing something in the next few weeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good! I'd a hankering after adventures, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as if I'd be gratified. But you {{had better}} not give us clothes with a name on them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{take our}} stand here!" [...] cried Poke Stover, motioning {{to a spot}} facing the door. [...] "Give it to 'em the minit {{daylight}} shines through!" [...] And they did, with such serious results that the party with the ram dropped that instrument {{and ran to the}} opposite side of the house. But their places were quickly taken by others, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> as if the door must give way at any instant.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she went}} back to her chair and turned her head. She had borne with her husband's follies and fought hard for him, {{sometimes}} with hope and sometimes in desperation, but always with unflinching courage. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> as if she had won. Victory was insecure yet, and there was a risk that it might turn to defeat, but Sadie never shrank from a daring venture. For a moment she could not speak; her heart was full.|$|R
60|$|Betty, {{studying}} some {{figures in}} the office, heard Jefferson stop the coaling clerk and smiled. Young men from the coal wharfs and fruit stores arrived rather often when they thought her employer was not about, and if she was not occupied she sometimes let them talk. For {{the most part they}} were a careless, good-humoured lot and she liked their cheerfulness, but this was all. When she refused Kit at Liverpool she was resolved he must get his chance; <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> as if she had got hers she was not moved.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{the case is}} queered," [...] said he. [...] "We tracked the rascal to Oakland, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> {{as if he had}} given us the slip for good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't grumble if {{this matter}} is {{straightened}} out finally, but just <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as though all hands {{would have been}} better off to let things go as they might." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{struck the}} nail on the head, Hans," [...] {{answered}} Sam. [...] "I thought we'd have plain sailing from to-day, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as if we'd have no sailing at all!" ...|$|E
60|$|Dick, {{who drank}} {{a glass of}} wine with him, went away in a {{thoughtful}} mood. He wondered where Don Ramon got his cement, and meant to find out, though he saw that caution would be needed. He owed much to Fuller and had made his master's business his. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> as if Fuller were being robbed and although he had, no doubt, cunning rogues to deal with, Dick determined that the thing must be stopped. When he returned to the dam he went to Bethune's hut and found him lying in his hammock.|$|R
60|$|Cheapest {{of all was}} the hall-bedroom. Its {{furniture}} was of the simplest. It consisted of a chair, another chair, a worn carpet, and a folding-bed. The folding-bed had an air of depression and baffled hopes. For years it had been trying to look like a bookcase in the daytime, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> more like a folding-bed than ever. There was also a plain deal table, much stained with ink. At this, night after night, sometimes far into the morning, Rutherford Maxwell would sit and write stories. <b>Now</b> and then <b>it</b> happened that one would be a good story, and find a market.|$|R
60|$|Riding on, she saw {{the roof}} of the Charnock {{homestead}} above a straggling bluff, and her thoughts centered on its occupants. Strange as the thing was, she had come to think of Sadie as her friend. Her loyalty and her patience with her husband commanded respect, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> as if they would be rewarded. Bob was taking an interest in his farm and had worked with steady industry for the last month or two. Helen thought she deserved some credit for this; she had had a part in Bob's reformation and had made Stephen help.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd hev to," [...] {{admitted}} Joe. [...] "That's why I 'asked ye {{how about}} it. Jes' <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> {{to me like}} I ain't hired at all. The black man said he'd gimme a dollar fer the trunks, that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tedham {{looked back}} at her in a dull bewilderment. [...] "I can't get back to that. It seemed so once; but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> selfish, and I'm afraid of it. I am not the one to take that ground. It might do for you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a grim, {{efficient}} lot," [...] Kit remarked. [...] "Just <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as if {{the pilot}} meant to hit the coaling tug. I don't {{know if you can}} stop him; that's your business and his. I'll get to mine before she starts to roll." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{he reached}} {{the edge of the}} Big River, he hurried along the bank until he reached a place where the water seldom freezes. As he had hoped, he found that it was not frozen <b>now.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> so black and cold that it made him shiver just to see it. Back and forth with his nose to the ground he ran. Suddenly he stopped and sniffed. Then he sniffed again. Then he {{followed}} his nose straight to {{the very edge of the}} Big River. There, floating in the black water, was a dead fish! By wading in he could get it.|$|R
6000|$|... "And look here, George. Give me your hand, man. Here's a merry Christmas to you. We've {{gone through}} some queerish times {{about this place}} together, but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> almost <b>looks</b> {{as though we were}} going to end our days in peace and plenty." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stared at}} me for a moment. I can see her pretty face <b>now</b> as <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> at me--her impenetrable dear face. She laughed a queer little laugh and her color went for a moment, and then so soon as she had spoken, came back again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely impossible," [...] he answered. [...] "Besides, I shouldn't care {{to do it}} just <b>now.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> {{like running}} away. A week or so ago you were talking of taking a villa down the river. I {{wondered}} whether you had thought any more of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is it!" [...] I cried. [...] "This is {{my little}} lost village found again, {{and it is}} well I found it so late in the day, for <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> less like even the loveliest old village in Devon than one in fairyland, or in Beulah." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We’ve {{seen this}} trouble coming and talked it over. So {{long as you}} don’t cut wages, we’ve nothing much to {{complain}} of and see no reason for quitting our job. <b>Now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as if the Vancouver boys were coming to turn us out. We’ll let them—if they can!” ...|$|E
60|$|Stannard {{called a}} waiter and when dinner was served began to talk. Laura {{supported}} him, but Jimmy rather thought her support too obvious. This was strange, because Laura was clever and {{knew where to}} stop. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> {{as if she did}} not. The Jardines were his friends, but nothing indicated that for them to dine at a fashionable hotel was embarrassing. He imagined Margaret studied Laura, and sometimes Laura's glance rested on the other for a moment and was gone. When Deering had satisfied his appetite, however, he firmly took the lead and Jimmy let him do so. Sometimes Deering's humor was rude, but it was kind.|$|R
60|$|He {{felt more}} cheerful <b>now.</b> <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> {{as if the}} end of his long search were near, since there was every reason to believe he would join the men before they could test the claim. On the second day he laboriously ascended a steep slope leading out of a valley he had followed, a broken line of {{footprints}} running upward in front of him. This seemed to indicate that the great ridge ahead could be crossed, though when he glanced at the ramparts of dark rock the task looked insuperable. Prescott knew nothing of mountaineering, but he judged that Kermode's companion must be accustomed to the ranges.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} building, a two-story boyar house, {{right in the}} heart of the city centre, dates back to 1609, but it has been re-constructed and re-modelled many times with total disregard to conservation to the extent that <b>now</b> <b>it</b> simply <b>looks</b> like an odd two-storey building.|$|R
6000|$|The {{white man}} has {{got into the}} way of [...] "{{carrying}}" [...] other people's burdens, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as if the yellow man were going to object to our carrying his any further. Maybe {{he is going to}} get nasty, and insist on carrying it himself. We call this [...] "the yellow danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As a rule, I {{try to be}} truthful. The country {{strikes me}} as being pretty mixed, full of contrasts. There's this place, for instance; one could imagine they had meant to build a Greek temple, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> more like a swimming-bath. After {{planning}} the rest magnificently, why couldn't they put on a roof that wouldn't leak?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My little Pansy! I put my own sorrow {{into your}} baby soul, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> {{back at me}} with this strange wistfulness, and these great drops are the unsubmissive tears I locked up in my heart because I would not be {{grateful}} for the good gift God gave me, even while he took that other one away. O Baby, forgive your mother; and don't let her find that she has given you clouds instead of sunshine." ...|$|E
5000|$|The demon {{possessing}} Chas's would-be protégé, Nicky, has {{unlocked the}} secrets of [...] "The Knowledge", and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> is <b>looking</b> to rip the soul right out of London. A football match {{between two of the}} city's most heated rivals creates a moment of decision in the life of Chas.|$|R
60|$|Clarke's revelation {{had been}} a shock. With his sense of duty and family pride, the Colonel had, when {{the news of the}} {{frontier}} disaster first reached him, found it almost impossible to believe that his nephew had been guilty of shameful cowardice; and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> as if the disgrace might be brought still closer home. Bertram would presently take his place and, retiring from active service, rule the estate in accordance with Challoner traditions and perhaps exert some influence in politics. Clarke had, however, shown him that Bertram, from whom so much was expected, had proved himself a poltroon and, what was even worse, had allowed an innocent man to suffer for his baseness.|$|R
60|$|Festing did {{not know}} how Miss Keller rated his value, but he was {{satisfied}} to remain a bachelor, and had perhaps allowed her to understand this, because she had since treated him with cold politeness. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> as if she had thrown Bob some favor, which was ominous, because Sadie had generally an object. Of course, if Bob were free and content to marry a girl from the settlement, Sadie would not be a bad choice. She certainly had some virtues. But Bob was not free, and it was unthinkable that a man who had won the love of the girl whose portrait Festing knew should be satisfied with another of Sadie's type.|$|R
