5000|$|PVF film {{lamination}} {{is made up}} of {{polyvinyl fluoride}} (commercially known as Tedlar). It consists of a film layer laminated to the PVC fabric during the manufacturing process. The result is a thicker fabric that can resist weather and chemical agents better than competing fabrics. Its self-cleaning ability repels such things as acid rain, graffiti, and bird droppings. Because of these characteristics it can often be found in use in industrialized areas, desert regions, and coastal zones. The thicker coating has a slow erosion rate, resulting in a life expectancy of approximately 25 years depending upon environmental conditions. This topcoating is flexible, which creates a strong and consistent bond to the PVC. PVF coated fabrics may be manufactured in a variety of colors, but are also subject to minimum manufacture runs. PVF coating also makes the fabric <b>non-weldable.</b> Seams are not overlapped, but instead are butted with an extra welded seam, then applied to the underside of the fabric that does not have a topcoating.|$|E

Friction stir welding technology has {{made possible the}} realization of high strength aluminum alloy joints, which are normally considered <b>non-weldable</b> with conventional welding techniques. FSW technology allows you to reduce time and cost of realization, and also increases the process joining efficiency. FSW is also a filler-free process, which would considerably lighten the structure. Currently, {{most of the studies}} regarding FSW have primarily been on butt joints. In the aircraft industry, there are a considerable number of structural reinforcements that are realized by T-joints. FSW technique T-joint realization has the advantage of welding the parts by an external single pass from the outside. This allows you to avoid fillet welds in the internal corner of the junction or to eliminate the rivets completely. The material used in this study is a 5 mm thick aluminum-lithium AA 8090 T 8 alloy, typically used in the aerospace industry due to its lightness. This low density alloy is attractive to the aerospace industry, since the structural weight reduction that it allows leads to an improvement of aircraft performance...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 9744 Friction stir welding (FSW) {{was invented}} and {{experimentally}} proven at The Welding Institute (TWI) in 1991. The process involves the joining of two metal pieces without melting by joining their molecules together. The tool traverses along the joint causing sufficient frictional heat {{to soften the}} material without melting. The rotation of the tool then stirs the molecules together leaving behind a fully consolidated joint. Because it is a solid state process and joining takes place below the melting temperature of the material, a high-quality weld is created with many advantages over fusion welding techniques. However, {{one of the main}} advantages of the process is its ability to weld 2 xxx series and 7 xxx series aluminium alloys which are used extensively within the aerospace industry, but are generally <b>non-weldable</b> using fusion welding techniques. FSW provides a solution to welding these alloys and an alternative to riveting. The overall aim of the project was to optimise the operational parameters and tooling design, and also to provide a comprehensive understanding of the FSW process during the welding of AA 2024 -T 3 plates. This was achieved through the development of a processing window for various operational parameters; testing of new tooling designs and the comparison of their performance to traditional FSW tooling; characterisation of the forces and temperatures generated {{and the development of a}} FE model to simulate the process...|$|E
40|$|Materials {{processing}} {{field has}} been witnessing tremendous growth {{during the past}} few decades. Welding is an important metal fabrication process that has high potential for industrial applications. Friction welding is a vital solid state joining process that has gained popularity in welding <b>non-weldable</b> alloys. Friction welding of tube to tube plate using an external tool (FWTPET) is an innovative friction welding process and was invented in the year 2006. FWTPET is capable of welding tube to tube plate of similar or dissimilar metals and is capable of producing good quality leak proof weld joints. In this work, experimental investigation of FWTPET has been carried out with and without backing block arrangement. The results of the experimental investigation revealed that by employing backing block, FWTPET is capable of producing defect free welds. This aspect has been ensured by the conduct of macro structural observation as well as tensile test. Besides experimental investigation, numerical investigation has been conducted using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Von-Misses stress pertaining to configuration with and without backing block is 1. 093 x 103 and 2. 811 x 103 N/mm 2 respectively. Strain rate observed in the configuration with and without backing block is 2. 441 x 10 - 3 and 1. 348 x 10 - 2 respectively. The results of FEA indicate that joints produced by FWTPET process supported with backing block have less stress, minimum deformation and lesser strain. The experimental and numerical investigation of FWTPET process revealed that the employment of backing block greatly enhances the quality of the joints produced...|$|E
40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} process that pan be used to join {{materials}} without melting. The process was invented by The Welding Institute (TWI), Cambridge, England. Friction stir welding exhibits several advantages over fusion welding in that it produces welds with fewer defects and higher joint efficiency and is capable of joining alloys that are generally considered <b>non-weldable</b> with a fusion weld process. In 1994, NASA-Marshall began collaborating with TWI to transform FSW from a laboratory curiosity to a viable metal joining process suitable for manufacturing hardware. While teamed with TWI, NASA-Marshall began its own FSW research and development effort to investigate possible aerospace applications for the FSW process. The work involved nearly all aspects of FSW development, including process modeling, scale-up issues, applications to advanced materials and development of tooling to use FSW on components of the Space Shuttle with particular emphasis on aluminum tanks. The friction stir welding process involves spinning a pin-tool at an appropriate speed, plunging it into the base metal pieces to be joined, and then translating it along the joint of the work pieces. In aluminum alloys the rotating speed typically ranges from 200 to 400 revolutions per minute and the translation speed is approximately two to five inches per minute. The pin-tool is inserted at a small lead angle from the axis normal to the work piece and requires significant loading along the axis of the tool. An anvil or reaction structure is required behind the welded material to react the load along the axis of the pin tool. The process requires no external heat input, filler material, protective shielding gas or inert atmosphere typical of fusion weld processes. The FSW solid-state weld process has resulted in aluminum welds with significantly higher strengths, higher joint efficiencies and fewer defects than fusion welds used to join similar alloys...|$|E
40|$|Friction welding(FW) is {{a fairly}} recent {{technique}} that utilizes a non-consumable welding tool to generate frictional heat and plastic deformation at the welding location, there by affecting {{the formation of a}} joint while the material is in solid state. The principal advantage of frictional welding, being a solid state process, low distortion, absence of melt-related defects and high joint strength, even in those alloys that are that are considered <b>non-weldable</b> by conventional welding techniques. Furthermore, friction welded joints are characterized by the absence of filler-induced problems or defects, since the technique requires no filler, and by the low hydrogen contents in the joints,an important consideration in welding steel and other alloys susceptible to hydrogen damage. FW can be used to produce butt, corner, lap, T, spot, fillet and hem joints, as well as to weld hollow objects, such as tanks and tubes or pipes, stock with different thickness, tapered section and parts with 3 -dimensional contours. The technique can produce joints utilizing equipment based on traditional machine tool technologies, and it has been used to weld a variety of similar and dissimilar alloys as well as for welding metal matrix composites and for repairing the existing joints. Replacement of fastened joints with FW welded joints can lead to significant weight and cost savings, attractive propositions for many industries. This document reviews some of the FW work performed to date, presents a brief account of mechanical testing of welded joints, tackles the issue of generating joint allowables, and offers some remarks and observation. FW is a leap forward in manufacturing technology, a leap that will benefit a wide range of industries, including transportation industry in general and the airframe industry in particular...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic forming (EMF) is a {{relative}} new and attractive technology, {{which can be used}} for joining, welding, forming and cutting of metals. The technology is based on the utilisation of electromagnetic forces and offers attractive possibilities for: -obtaining a larger deformation of some materials, in comparison with conventional forming, while avoiding the disadvantages of the conventional processes, -fast and cost-effective joining of <b>non-weldable</b> materials, like heterogeneous joints; -creating complex or new workpieces and products, impossible by conventional technologies, -improving the working conditions of the welders or operator, since EMF is environmentally clean (no heat, fumes, shielding gases, radiation, etc.). The critical part of the technology is the coil, which is always application-specific designed. When inappropriately designed or constructed, these parts fail very quickly, or low process efficiency is obtained. Durable, robust and efficient coil systems are however essential for a successful implementation of EMF in industry. Currently, the knowledge concerning coil design is dispersed among the pulse machine manufactures, often confidential and thus not available for end users. One of the aims of the project is to develop all necessary knowledge to provide SMEs and other companies the flexibility to design and manufacture coils for specific applications. This will lead to an increased use and applicability of EMF in the metal processing industry. The technical targets aimed at in this project are: -Development of finite-element models, which will increase the knowledge about the process and which will serve as a tool in the coil design process. -Methodology for designing coils for forming and cutting of sheets and forming and welding of tubular workpieces. -Guidelines for manufacturing, material selection, insulation strategy and other construction-related aspects. -Manufacturing and testing of coil prototypes, for the development of industrial applications. -Providing the companies with all essential information to make a considered decision about the successful integration of the EMF and related technologies in their production. The final goal of the project was to enable companies to produce in a faster and a more efficient way by implementing EMF, which is currently hindered by the difficulties in designing the right coil. Due to an increased productivity and cost reduction by using this advanced technique, joining and forming operations will be performed faster and more efficient, so more economic, due to a less expensive production process and a better guarantee of the quality. The experimental research using pulsed-power equipment was performed by Fraunhofer IWU and the Belgian Welding Institute. EELAB of the Ghent University used its expertise in the field of calculation of magnetic forces, current density, etc. in order to calculate the desired shape of the coil systems. Finite-element modelling of the process was performed by the University of Chemnitz...|$|E
