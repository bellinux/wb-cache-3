40|$|North Atlantic {{deep sea}} {{cephalopods}} caught in research <b>nets</b> (<b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> of 9 m 2) and I arge commercial trawls are {{compared with those}} eaten by Sperm Whales. 1 t is shown that at three latitudes the nets and whales sample cephalopods very differently. Research nets are biased towards collecting small species and young specimens of several families, principally gonatids, cranchiids, enoploteuthids and onychoteuthids, while sperm whales are biased towards catching much !arger cephalopods, particularly histioteuthids. Commercial trawls tend {{to bridge the gap}} in size of cephalopods selected by research nets and whales but where comparisons are possible they have a bias towards catching enoploteuthids. The contribution by numbers and weight of different cephalopod families to the cephalopod fraction of the diet of sperm whales throughout the world is reviewed. A detailed study of Antarctic cephalopods in the diet of large predators including cetaceans, seals and birds indicates areas where more knowledge is required to make accurate estimates of the biomass of Antarctic cephalopods consumed. The value of direct studies of food webs for quantitative consideration of particular cephalopod taxa is demonstrated and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Aims of this {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} were (1) {{to analyze the}} course of <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> up to 48 months post-radiotherapy (RT), (2) to assess risk factors predicting decrease in <b>mouth</b> <b>opening,</b> and (3) to develop a multivariable prediction model for change in <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> in a large sample of patients irradiated for head and neck cancer. Materials and methods: <b>Mouth</b> <b>opening</b> was measured prior to RT (baseline) and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months post-RT. The primary outcome variable was <b>mouth</b> <b>opening.</b> Potential risk factors were entered into a linear mixed model analysis (manual backward-stepwise elimination) to create a multivariable prediction model. The interaction terms between time and risk factors that {{were significantly related to}} <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> were explored. Results: The study population consisted of 641 patients: 70. 4 % male, mean age at baseline 62. 3 years (sd 12. 5). Primary tumors were predominantly located in the oro- and nasopharynx (25. 3 %) and oral cavity (20. 6 %). Mean <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> at baseline was 38. 7 mm (sd 10. 8). Six months post-RT, mean <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> was smallest, 36. 7 mm (sd 10. 0). In the linear mixed model analysis, <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> was statistically predicted by the location of the tumor, natural logarithm of time post-RT in months (Ln (months)), gender, baseline <b>mouth</b> <b>opening,</b> and baseline age. All main effects interacted with Ln (months). Conclusion: The mean <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> decreased slightly over time. <b>Mouth</b> <b>opening</b> was predicted by tumor location, time, gender, baseline <b>mouth</b> <b>opening,</b> and age.

40|$|Theoretically, <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> {{not only}} {{reflects}} {{the mobility of}} the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) but also the mandibular length. Clinically, the exact relationship between <b>mouth</b> <b>opening,</b> mandibular length, and mobility of TMJs is unclear. To study this relationship 91 healthy subjects, 59 women and 32 men (mean age 27. 2 years, s. d. 7. 5 years, range 13 - 56 years) were recruited from the patients of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of University Hospital, Groningen. <b>Mouth</b> <b>opening,</b> mobility of TMJs and mandibular length were measured. The mobility of TMJs was measured as the angular displacement of the mandible relative to the cranium, the angle of <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> (AMO). <b>Mouth</b> <b>opening</b> (MO) correlated significantly with mandibular length (ML) (r = 0. 36) and AMO (r = 0. 66). The regression equation MO = C 1 x ML x AMO + C 2, in which C = 0. 53 and C 2 = 25. 2 mm, correlated well (r = 0. 79) with <b>mouth</b> <b>opening.</b> It is concluded that <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> reflects both mobility of the TMJs and mandibular length...|$|R

Material and Methods: Maximum <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> was measured and questionnaire data collected from 551 men and 504 women (1055 adults), aged 16 – 72 years. Age, gender, presence of temporomandibular joint pain on palpation, tenderness of masticatory and neck muscles on palpation, type of bite, presence of temporomandibular joint sound, and a history of attendance of physician or dentist because of trouble with the jaw joint were all recorded. Results: The amount of maximum <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> was measured as 50. 38 mm for males and 46. 35 mm for females. 32 patients had open bite, 594 patients had normal bite, and 429 patients had deep bite, and their mean <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> is 52. 53 mm, 48. 62 mm, and 47. 09 mm, with respectively.

40|$|The {{population}} {{structures of}} the three dominant planktonic halocyprid Ostracoda species in Admiralty Bay (King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula) were followed {{throughout the course of}} a year in zooplankton samples collected once every three weeks from February 1993 to January 1994. The sampling was conducted at two stations: A in the central part of Admiralty Bay (400 – 0 m) and B in the entrance to the Bay from the Bransfield Strait (400 – 0 m). The samples were taken using a WP- 2 <b>net</b> (square <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> of 0. 196 m 2 and 200 ?m mesh) hauled vertically from the bottom to the surface. Changes in the age {{structures of the}} populations of three species Alacia belgicae, Alacia hettacra and Metaconchoecia isocheira were tracked. Their population structures differed. The changes in A. belgicae suggested that it reproduces year-round, whereas both A. hettacra and M. isocheira probably complete their life cycles within a year. The cycle in A. hettacra probably starts earlier in the year than that of M. isocheira. Populations of A. belgicae and M. isocheira were more advanced in their development at station A, than at station B, but A. hettacra was more advanced at the latter. Advection appears to play a role in maintaining the populations in the shelf waters. Comparisons between populations in the shelf area (Admiralty Bay) and in open ocean waters (Croker Passage) show that the M. isocheira population is older in shelf water whereas the age structure of A. belgicae population is not influenced by the locality...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although some {{research}} suggests that fetuses yawn, others disagree arguing that is it simple <b>mouth</b> <b>opening.</b> Furthermore there is no developmental account of fetal yawning compared with simple <b>mouth</b> <b>opening.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to establish in a repeated measures design the development of fetal yawning compared with simple <b>mouth</b> <b>opening.</b> Methodology/Findings: Video recordings were made of the fetal face and upper torso visualized by means of 4 D full frontal or facial profile ultrasound recordings. Fifteen healthy fetuses were scanned four times at 24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks gestation. Yawning was distinguished from non-yawning in terms of the length of time it took to reach the apex of the mouth stretch, with yawns being defined as more than 50 % of the total time observed. To assess changes in frequency, a Poisson mixed effects model was fitted to the count of number of yawn and simple <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> events with age and gender as fixed effects, and person as a random effect. For both yawns and simple <b>mouth</b> <b>openings</b> a smooth varying age effect was significant. The number of yawns observed declined with age from 28 weeks gestation, whereas simple <b>mouth</b> <b>openings</b> were less frequent and the decline was observed from 24 weeks. Gender was not significant either for yawn and simple <b>mouth</b> <b>openings</b> Conclusions/Significance: Yawning can be reliably distinguished from other forms of <b>mouth</b> <b>opening</b> with the potential of using yawning as an index of fetal healthy development...|$|R
