30|$|Novel {{methods of}} cardiac rhythm {{detection}} are proposed {{that are based}} on time-frequency analysis by a weighted overlap-add (WOLA) oversampled filterbank. Cardiac signals are obtained from intracardiac electrograms and decomposed into the time-frequency domain and analyzed by parallel peak detectors in selected frequency subbands. The coherence (synchrony) of the subband peaks is analyzed and employed to detect an optimal peak sequence representing the beat locations. By further analysis of the synchrony of the subband beats and the periodicity and regularity of the optimal beat, various possible cardiac events (including fibrillation, flutter, and tachycardia) are detected. The Ann Arbor Electrogram Library is used to evaluate the proposed detection method in clean and in additive noise. The evaluation results show that the method <b>never</b> <b>misses</b> <b>any</b> episode of fibrillation or flutter in clean or in noise and is robust to far-field R-wave interference. Furthermore, all other misclassification errors were within the acceptable limits.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for collision detection between large models composed of {{tens of millions of}} polygons. Each model is represented as a clustered hierarchy of progressive meshes (CHPM). The CHPM is a dual hierarchy of the original model; it serves both as a multiresolution representation of the original model, as well as a bounding volume hierarchy. We use the cluster hierarchy of a CHPM to perform coarse-grained selective refinement and the progressive meshes for fine-grained local refinement. We present a novel conservative error metric to perform collision queries based on the multiresolution representation. We use this error metric to perform dynamic simplification for collision detection. Our approach is conservative in that it may overestimate the set of colliding regions, but <b>never</b> <b>misses</b> <b>any</b> collisions. Furthermore, we are able to generate these hierarchies and perform collision queries using out-of-core techniques on all triangulated models. We have applied our algorithm to perform conservative collision detection between massive CAD and scanned models, consisting of millions of triangles at interactive rates on a commodity PC...|$|R

60|$|Nevertheless, {{from the}} very first day they met, Elma took most kindly to this new Miss Ewes, the strange and {{eccentric}} musical composer. The mistress of Dowlands was a distant cousin of Mrs. Clifford's own; so the family naturally had to call upon her at once; and Elma somehow seemed always to get on from the outset in a remarkable way with her mother's relations. At first, to be sure, Elma could see Mrs. Clifford was rather afraid to leave her alone with the odd new-comer, whose habits and manners were as curious and weird as the sudden twists and turns of her own wayward music. But, after a time, a change came over Mrs. Clifford in this respect; and instead of trying to keep Elma and Miss Ewes apart, it was evident to Elma--who <b>never</b> <b>missed</b> <b>any</b> of the small by-play of life--that her mother rather desired to throw them closely together. Thus it came to pass that one morning, about a month after Miss Ewes's arrival in her new home, Elma had run in with a message from her mother, and found the distinguished composer, as was often the case at that time of day, sitting dreamily at her piano, trying over on the gamut strange, fanciful chords of her own peculiar witch-like character.

50|$|In {{the same}} year (1811) Watson and Norris {{purchased}} the British Critic to restore it to its original lines as the organ of the high-church party, from which it had somewhat diverged. In 1814 Watson retired from business to devote himself exclusively to works of piety and charity. He <b>never</b> <b>missed</b> <b>any</b> meeting of the Society for Propagation of the Gospel, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, or the National Society, and his counsel was highly valued. He took a deep interest in the colonial church, being an intimate friend of Bishop Middleton of Calcutta, Bishop Inglis of Nova Scotia, Bishop Broughton of Australasia, and subsequently Bishop Selwyn of New Zealand. In 1814 he was appointed, together with his friend Archdeacon Cambridge, treasurer of the Society for PromotingChristian Knowledge, which during his treasurership increased greatly its work and income. About {{the same time he}} became secretary of the relief fund for the German sufferers from the Napoleonic wars. In 1817 the Church Building Society, called at first the Church Room Society, was formed. Watson was largely instrumental in its foundation, drawing up the original resolution. This was quickly followed by a royal commission for church building issued under Lord Liverpool's government. Watson was one of the commissioners, and found the work so engrossing that in 1822 he took a house, No. 6 Park Street, Westminster, where he lived for sixteen years, to be near the scene of his labours.|$|R
5|$|In 1865, after lengthy debates, Canada's {{legislative}} assembly approved confederation by 91 votes to 33. None of the Maritimes, however, had approved the plan. In 1866, Macdonald {{and his colleagues}} financed pro-confederation candidates in the New Brunswick general election, resulting in a pro-confederation assembly. Shortly after the election, Nova Scotia's premier, Charles Tupper, pushed a pro-confederation resolution through that colony's legislature. A final conference, {{to be held in}} London, was needed before the British parliament could formalise the union. Maritime delegates left for London in July 1866, but Macdonald, who was drinking heavily again, did not leave until November, angering the Maritimers. In December 1866, Macdonald both led the London Conference, winning acclaim for his handling of the discussions, and wooed and won his second wife, Agnes Bernard. Bernard was the sister of Macdonald's private secretary, Hewitt Bernard; the couple first met in Quebec in 1860, but Macdonald had seen and admired her as early as 1856. In January 1867, while still in London, he was seriously burned in his hotel room when his candle set fire to the chair he had fallen asleep in, but Macdonald refused to <b>miss</b> <b>any</b> <b>sessions</b> of the conference. In February, he married Agnes at St George's, Hanover Square.

Data were collected through structured telephone interviews on socio-demographics, dialysis factors, and evacuation characteristics. Overall, 44 % of patients reported missing at least one and almost 17 % reported missing 3 or more dialysis sessions. The likelihood of missing 3 or more sessions was greater for those whose dialysis vintage was less than 2 years compared to those for whom it was 5 or more years, who had 38 or fewer billed dialysis sessions {{compared to those who}} had 39 or more in the 3 months before the storm, who lived alone before the storm, who were unaware of their dialysis facility’s emergency plans, who did not evacuate prior to hurricane landfall, and who were placed in a shelter.
