The experimental results clearly showed that the <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> appears to be the best fluid as far as low viscosity and stability of viscosity with increase in temperature are concerned. However, the <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> is not compatible with other fluid which makes it difficult to be substitute as a clean brake fluid. The result of the Thepra Universal Brake Testing Equipment used for the braking efficiency test indicated that a pedal brake of 117 kN produce a brake force of 0. 96 kN for clean brake fluid, 0. 91 kN for the less dirty, 0. 85 kN for dirty and 1. 44 kN for <b>soap</b> <b>solution.</b> The value of 1. 44 kN which was achieved when the <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> was used indicated a positive braking force and the indicating that <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> could be used to produce a high pedal force within a very short time (about 10 - 30 min) and can therefore be used only in case of emergency.

40|$|Objective 					Disinfection {{procedures}} often cause {{deterioration in}} a maxillofacial prosthesis. Color and hardness alterations {{could lead to}} a replacement of the prosthesis. 		 				Material and Methods 					An experimental chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) and a commercial polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) sample were treated with four different disinfection procedures for a period which simulates 1 year of clinical service. The applied disinfection procedures included microwave exposure and immersion in three <b>solutions,</b> sodium hypochlorite, <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> and a commercial disinfecting soap. Shore A hardness (&# 8710;H) and color differences (&# 8710;E) were determined before and after each procedure. All data were analyzed by Two Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc tests at a level of &# 945;= 0. 05. 				Results 					The samples presented significant alterations in color and hardness after the different disinfection treatments. The color differences (&# 8710;E) were at least eye detectable in all cases and clinically unacceptable in most of the cases, with values ranging from 1. 51 to 4. 15 and from 1. 54 to 5. 92 for the PDMS and CPE material, respectively. Hardness was decreased after all the disinfection procedures in the PDMS, while for the CPE, a decrement was observed after disinfection with sodium hypochlorite and <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> and an increment after microwave exposure and the disinfection with a commercial antimicrobial agent. The PDMS samples presented greater alterations in color and hardness after disinfection with sodium hypochlorite solution, while the microwave exposure caused negligible effects.

Conclusions 					The disinfection procedures caused alterations in color and hardness of the examined materials. The most suitable disinfection procedure for the PDMS material is microwave exposure, while disinfection with sodium hypochlorite solution is not recommended. The CPE material is suggested to be disinfected with sodium hypochlorite solution and the use of <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> is not recommended.

The {{action of}} soap is {{explained}} by the following facts: (1) Carbon hastens the decomp. of soap in water by causing {{the formation of an}} acid salt. This combination of C with the soap is not stoichiometric but a combination such as exists between colloidal substances. The combination of the C with the soap is formed because of the difference of the electrical polarity of its constituents from water. (2) C suspended in water forms a combination of absorption more or less stable with the solid substances, especially cellulose. This, the author says, is proved by the fact that a suspension of finely divided C in water will give up its C to filter paper when filtered, and if the paper is then inverted the C cannot be washed off by means of water. There exists a combination of colloidal C and paper. (3) A suspension of C in <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> is characterized by its stability. When filtered all of the C passes through the filter paper. In his experiments the author employed a 2 % <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> and C from which all oily matter had been removed so that there was no chance for emulsions. It was found that there was an optimum % of concentration for which the C remained in suspension. In a 2 % sol. the C deposited almost as rapidly as in pure water, but in solutions of less than 0. 5 % the deposition was slower. In a 1 % sol. the C remained in suspension about 2 months. All of the <b>soap</b> <b>solutions</b> which had retained C in suspension nevertheless had a sediment. Acid and alkaline <b>solutions</b> of <b>soap</b> were tried with regard to their power of holding C in suspension. The acid solutions became clear rapidly while the alkaline held the C better than pure water does. MeOH and EtOH <b>solutions</b> of <b>soap</b> were also tried. The deposition of C from these took place more rapidly than in the case of water. <b>Soap</b> <b>solutions</b> which deposited C were examined to see whether any soap was dragged down with the C. It was found each time that the % of ash of the sol. which had been agitated with C and then filtered, was greater than the corresponding % of ash of the sol. not so treated, which was run as a comparison. The author concludes that the soap sol. was slightly decomposed by contact with the C into an acid portion which agglutinated with C and into a basic portion which remained in solution. The MeOH and EtOH sols. of soap when examined {{in the same manner as}} above showed less ash. This would mean that the solution underwent no change and that there was no agglutination with the C. This also explains why alc. <b>solutions</b> of <b>soap</b> give inferior detersive effects. The sediment of C deposited from <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> is different in character from that deposited from pure water. It is oleaginous and viscous. A suspension of C in water was subjected to electrolysis. With a difference of potential of 8 volts cataphoresis is doubtful, but when the sol. is made slightly alkaline the C acts as if charged electropositive and is deposited around the cathode. A 0. 2 % <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> when electrolyzed gave a white deposit around the anode after several hours. This, when separated from the solution and the ash determined and compared with that of the filtrate, indicates that the deposit at the anode is an acid soap while the soap left in the solution is basic.

The {{aim of this}} study was histopathological evaluation of the effect of sodium sulfonate application as <b>neutral</b> <b>soap</b> on the cat's dental pulp after an ideal composite restorative treatment.   Methods: Ten adult cats with 40 caries-free canine teeth were selected for the study. Class V cavities were prepared in the buccal surfaces of all the teeth. The teeth of the right quadrants were treated with composite, whereas the teeth of the left quadrants were primarily etched, after using of sodium sulfonate solution, they treated with composite. The first five cats were killed after one week and the other five cats after one month. The teeth were fixed, decalcified and after being sliced, paraffined blocks were made and microscopic slides were prepared and histologically evaluated. Results: The results of the histological evaluation showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the intensity of inflammation in the pulp of the teeth in the right and left quadrants after one week (P= 1. 000) and one month (P= 0. 773). However, there was significant difference after one week regarding predentin formation (P= 0. 017) and in the teeth of the left quadrants, the formation of predentin was more that the right quadrants, but no meaningful difference was observed after one month (P= 0. 203).    Conclusion: It seems that the sodium sulfonate in composite restorative treatments without fear of damage to the pulp can be used...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis [...] A {{characteristic}} {{deficiency of}} aerosol foams, such as shave creams, is {{the increase in}} foam wetness as the can empties. This change in foam density can be minimized with solubility and other theoretical considerations.

The per cent of product extruded as a satisfactory foam varies between formulations. To study the problem, a ternary graph showing propellant solubilities in fatty acid-amine com-positions where the water content of the total system is 80 % was prepared. A product with a perfectly uniform foam is realized by formulating a <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> that is clear with propellant included but where the propellant has a limited solubility in the soap. Propellant may then be added above this amount to form a reserve layer which will maintain a constant propellant percentage dissolved in the solution during extrusion.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is {{an investigation of the}} dynamics of unconfined hydrogen-air flames in the presence of buoyant effects and the determination of an ignition criterion for flame propagation between adjacent pockets of reactive gas separated by air. The experimental work was conducted using the soap bubble technique and visualized with high speed schlieren or large scale shadowgraph systems. A study was first conducted to determine the most suitable <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> additive among glycerol, guar and polyethylene oxide for conducting the experiments, isolating guar as the best candidate. The <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> was then used to study the dynamics of flames in single or multiple soap bubbles filled with reactive mixtures of different compositions. The soap bubble method was also further improved by designing a soap dispenser that can maintain a bubble indefinitely and a method to burst the <b>soap</b> <b>solution</b> prior to an experiment using timed heated wires. In the experiments with single bubbles, it was found that for sufficiently lean hydrogen-air mixtures, buoyancy effects become important at small scales. The critical radius of hemispherical flames that will rise due to buoyancy was measured and estimated using a model comparing the characteristic burning speed and the rise speed of the flame kernel. Excellent agreement was found between the model predictions and the measured critical flame radii. The experiments with multiple bubbles provided the scaling rules for flame transition between neighboring pockets of hemispherical or spherical shape separated by an inert gas. The test results demonstrated that the separation distance between the bubbles is mainly determined by the expansion ratio when the buoyancy effects are negligible, corresponding to near stoichiometric mixtures. For leaner mixtures with stronger buoyant effects, the critical separation distance was no longer governed by the expansion ratio alone, as buoyancy forces render the flame propagation across the inert gas more difficult. Visualization of the ignition dynamics confirmed that buoyancy forces tend to accelerate the first kernel up before ignition of the second kernel can be achieved...|$|R

The product under study was a soft, premoistened washcloth, including a 3 % dimethicone formula, with cleansing, moisturizing, and barrier protection properties. Design: randomized, controlled clinical trial. Subjects and setting: the study sample comprised a random sample of 11 nursing home wards (6 experimental and 5 control) in a convenience sample of 4 nursing homes in Belgium. The sample included nursing home residents at risk for and/or affected by IAD defined as incontinent of urine, feces, urine/feces, and/or having erythema of the perineal skin (not caused by pressure/shear), and/or having an edematous skin in the genital area. Methods: participants in the experimental group were treated according to a standardized protocol, including the use of a 3 -in- 1 perineal care washcloth impregnated with a 3 % dimethicone skin protectant. Participants in the control group received perineal skin care with water and pH <b>neutral</b> <b>soap,</b> the standard of care in Belgian nursing homes. The study period was 120 days. Data were collected between February and May 2010. Incontinence-associated dermatitis prevalence and severity were assessed using the IAD Skin Condition Assessment Tool. The surface (cm 2), redness, and depth of the perineal lesion were assessed daily by the nurses. This tool generates a cumulative severity score (maximum score = 10) based on area of skin affected, degree of redness, and depth of erosion. Results: four hundred sixty-four nursing home residents were assessed and 32. 9 % (n = 141) met the criteria for inclusion, including 73 subjects in the experimental group and 68 in the control group. Baseline IAD prevalence was comparable in both groups (experimental: 22. 3 % vs control: 22. 8 %, P =. 76). Baseline IAD severity was 6. 9 / 10 in the experimental group and 7. 3 / 10 in the control group. A significant intervention effect on IAD prevalence was found (experimental: 8. 1 % vs control: 27. 1 %, F = 3. 1, P =. 003). A nonsignificant effect on IAD severity could be determined (experimental: 3. 8 / 10 vs control: 6. 9 / 10, F = 0. 8, P =. 06).
