5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|During the Panic of 1893, Lilly {{created a}} {{commission}} to help provide food and shelter to the poor people who were adversely affected. His work with the commission led {{him to make a}} personal donation of funds and property to the Flower Mission of Indianapolis in 1895. Lilly's substantial donation allowed it to establish Eleanor Hospital, a children's hospital in Indianapolis named in honor of his deceased daughter. The hospital cared for children from families who had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay for routine medical care; it closed in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, a {{labor dispute}} {{led to the}} {{formation}} of a new league, composed of most of the better players from the National League. Although he was invited to join the competing league, Sunday's conscience would not allow him to break his contract with Pittsburgh. Sunday was named team captain, and he was their star player, but the team suffered one of the worst seasons in baseball history. By August the team had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> meet its payroll, and Sunday was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for two players and $1,000 in cash.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, county {{officials}} admitted {{that it was}} likely that the $7million appropriated would not be enough, and instead {{it would be better}} spent on improving other nearby parkways. The proposed parkway would have needed $400,000 more for additional right-of-way, and the construction costs would leave <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> repave the Bronx River Parkway, the link to the Cross County Parkway, and to extend the Saw Mill River Parkway. The county would have had to spend $8million of its own money as well. The parkway was instead shortened from Bronxville to Elmsford.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's four {{infantry}} regiments and two cavalry {{units that}} {{served in the}} Spanish–American War were beset by poor sanitation and disease in the army camps where they were stationed. The units saw little action in the war, but 84men {{died as a result}} of the poor conditions. When the time came for the troops to return home, Bradley found that the state had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay for the hospital trains needed for their trip. Bradley personally borrowed money from a bank to secure their passage, and trusted that the General Assembly would reimburse him.|$|E
50|$|The Association of State and Territorial Health Officers (ASTHO) {{estimated}} that {{implementation of the}} legislation would require at least 265 statutory or regulatory changes nationwide and cost approximately $420 million a year, though it provided <b>no</b> new <b>money</b> <b>to</b> finance any of these amendments.

5|$|After {{six months}} of development, Slither.io was {{released}} for browsers and iOS on March 25, 2016, with servers supporting up to 500 players. Two days after the iOS/browser versions' release, an Android version was made available by Lowtech Studios. The only way Howse could make revenue was to display advertising in the app after the player's snake died; this option could be removed for US$3.99. He chose not to sell virtual currency or power-ups so that those who paid would not have an advantage over players who didn't. As there was <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> advertise for the game, {{the only way to}} advertise was the various let's plays by players on YouTube, including PewDiePie, who had more than 47 million subscribers at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Chester Canal was an English canal {{linking the}} south Cheshire town of Nantwich with the River Dee at Chester. It was {{intended}} to link Chester to Middlewich, with a branch to Nantwich, but the Trent and Mersey Canal were unco-operative about a junction at Middlewich, and so the route to Nantwich was opened in 1779. There were also difficulties negotiating with the River Dee Company, and with no possibility of through traffic, the canal was uneconomic. Part of it was closed in 1787, when Beeston staircase locks collapsed, and there was <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> fund repairs. When the Ellesmere Canal was proposed in 1790, the company {{saw it as a}} ray of hope, and somehow managed to keep the struggling canal open. The Ellesmere Canal provided a link to the River Mersey at Ellesmere Port from 1797, and the fortunes of the Chester Canal began to improve.|$|E
5|$|The {{money was}} used to {{complete}} the line to Nantwich, and to build a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, to reduce the cost, but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated on trying to generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find any, and tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had no money {{and was unable to}} meet interest payments on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he did not respond to their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, but somehow the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> fund repairs.|$|E

5|$|Wood meets Loretta King, whom {{he thinks}} has {{enough money to}} fund Bride of the Atom and ends up casting her as the lead instead of Fuller as planned. Filming begins, but is halted when it is {{revealed}} that King is actually poor, and Wood has <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> continue production. Wood convinces meat packing industry tycoon Don McCoy to take over funding the film, who agrees {{as long as the}} film stars his son Tony as the leading man and the film ends with an explosion. The filming finishes with the title being changed to Bride of the Monster, but Fuller breaks up with Wood after the wrap party because of his circle of friends, his work, and transvestism. Lugosi attempts to conduct a double suicide with Ed after the government cuts off his unemployment, but is talked out of it. Lugosi checks himself into rehab, and Wood meets Kathy O'Hara, who is visiting her father there. He takes her on a date and reveals to her his transvestism, which she accepts.|$|E

25|$|The railway mania was a {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} huge number of railway schemes were put forward, when investors imagined that huge gains on investment were certain.
