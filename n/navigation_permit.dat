40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many {{satellite}} missions have marked {{the history of}} the optical remote sensing, providing a wide choice of products for every kind of application and investigation. The Proba- 1 program can not be compared in importance and budget to very important missions like Landsat and SPOT, but the innovations introduced in the payload design have attracted the attention of principal investigators and scientists since the beginning. The new spectral configuration of its high resolution sensor CHRIS can represent an innovation for the wide family of the optical instruments. In fact CHRIS is one of the experiments, as well as NASA Hyperion, concerning the developing of the expensive hyperspectral technology for the satellite environment. Moreover, the innovative solutions for the autonomous orbit maintaining and <b>navigation,</b> <b>permit</b> to the spacecraft difficult manoeuvres and multi-angular acquisitions during the target overpass. The result is an extraordinary and unique database of hyperspectral and multi-directional images acquired several times during the years over predefined test sites. This research work proposes a complete treatment of the CHRIS products since the radiometric and geometric correction till the classification processing. Phases like destriping, atmospheric corrections, spectral adjacency compensation and ortho-rectification have been performed and developed. Several classification exercises have been proposed with the aim of evaluating the impact of the principal key factors of the Proba mission (hyperspectral, multi-angular and multi-temporal) to the final classification accuracy. The directional anisotropy of the refiectance, as well as its temporal dependence, has been well explained and investigated trough the use of spectral models and radiative equations, but studies and applications based on real satellite high resolution and multi-directional data over lands and water bodies are few or still ongoing. Said that, this research work has been addressed to asses if these additional information, which reflect additional costs in terms of satellite technology and image processing are justified with significant improvements for the land cover production, {{as one of the most}} diffused application in the research environment. Once again the neural networks have confirmed their effectiveness for the classification of optical images at high and very high resolution. The new spectral, multi-angular and multi-temporal inputs have been well managed and used as additive information for the decision task, without impacting the design of the classification scheme. On the whole the results have been satisfactory in most cases...|$|E

In this paper we deal with the problem of vehicle routing on today’s congested roads. The result of this study is a web application that provides the user with two possibilities. The user can create a directed graph that corresponds to the city’s road network and he can also find the optimal path that leads to its destination as far as distance and traffic congestion are concerned. As we didn’t have real data about the traffic, we adopt a simulation technique to mimic actual traffic conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn an {{increasingly}} competitive environment, {{a more efficient}} management of resources is of utmost importance. However, despite the recognized importance given to the organization's strategy, many still remain focused on the usual budgeting cycle to financially control their actions. This short-term and incremental tactical behavior does not allow decisors {{to focus on what}} lies beyond the horizon. The Organizational Cockpit concept emerges as a strategic management system, in near real time, as an attempt to explain and communicate the organization's strategy at all levels. It fosters strategic performance monitoring and measuring by providing information on how the “flight” is doing, thus creating the conditions to allow strategic <b>navigation,</b> <b>permitting</b> to assess performance and, at the same time, information about actions taken, the resources used and their result. This concept {{can also be used to}} assess the organization's performance within the Portuguese Integrated Management System and Performance Evaluation in Public Administration...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Navigation, mapping, and {{ablation}} in {{the right}} ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) can be difficult. Catheter navigation using external magnetic fields may allow more accurate mapping and ablation. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the feasibility of RVOT tachycardia ablation using remote magnetic navigation. METHODS: Mapping and ablation were performed in eight patients with outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias. Tachycardia mapping was undertaken with a 64 -polar basket catheter, followed by remote activation and pace-mapping using a magnetically enabled catheter. The area of interest was localized on the basket catheter in seven patients in whom an RVOT arrhythmia was identified. Remote navigation of the magnetic catheter to this area was followed by pace-mapping. Ablation was performed at the site of perfect pace-mapping, with earliest activation if possible. RESULTS: Acute success was achieved in all patients (median four applications). Median procedural time was 144 minutes, with 13. 4 minutes of patient fluoroscopy time and 3. 8 minutes of physician fluoroscopy time. No complications occurred. One recurrence occurred during follow-up (mean 366 days). CONCLUSION: RVOT tachycardias can be mapped and ablated using remote magnetic navigation, initially guided by a basket catheter. Precise activation and pace-mapping are possible. Remote magnetic <b>navigation</b> <b>permitted</b> low fluoroscopy exposure for the physician. Long-term results are promising...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a global navigation strategy for repeated traverse of mobile robots in dynamic environments. The research {{is motivated by}} the fact that most real-world applications of mobile robotics imply repeated traverse between predefined target points in large, uncertain real-world domains. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop a framework for navigation in large-scale dynamic environments that permits the robot to fulfill its assignment by adapting to use of easily traversable paths. While mobile robots usually tackle the problem of path planning in uncertain environments by implementing obstacle avoidance routines, in this approach the robot also learns to use routes along which obstacles occur less often. The few alternative approaches that consider the problem of global obstacle avoidance function in well-structured environments using an a priori known topological map. The approach reported in this thesis uses a grid-based map for path planning. It is argued that a grid-based map together with a stochastic wavefront planner offers a greater number of alternatives to the path planning problem and that the robot adapts to be able to use the best routes even when very little a priori knowledge of the environment is available. To adapt to dynamic environments the robot uses case-based reasoning to remember the paths followed and to reason about their traversability. While case-based reasoning is usually applied for planning problems in static environments, this approach also works in dynamic environments and uses a unique similarity measure to reduce the solution space. This thesis also offers an alternative decision-making strategy for mobile robots in hazardous environments that is based on the concept of irreversible decisions. The experiments made in simulated and real environments demonstrate that this approach to global <b>navigation</b> <b>permits</b> the robot to increase the predictability of its behavior and to minimize the risk of collision an time delays...|$|R

Further, it showed that this activity is likely to occur at points where new rooms come into view, or after navigational mistakes have been realized and are being corrected. This indicates that theta oscillations in humans are related to the encoding and retrieval of spatial information.
