40|$|Human-Wildlife Conflicts: <b>Hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> can {{negatively}} impact {{a variety}} of human interests, including important natural resources, livestock and game bird production, human health and safety, and companion animals. Conflicts between raptors and people generally are localized and often site-specific. However, {{the economic and social}} impacts to the individuals involved can be severe. Despite the problems they may cause, <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> provide important benefits and environmental services. Raptors are popular with birdwatchers and much of the general public. They also hunt and kill large numbers of rodents, reducing crop damage and other problems. Damage Identification Management Methods Economics Species Overview: Given the number of different <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> in North America, the potential for human-raptor conflict is signifi-cant. The <b>northern</b> goshawk, red-tailed <b>hawk,</b> and great horned owl account for the majority of conflicts between humans and <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls.</b> This publication focuses on these three species, but most of the general biology, na-ture of conflicts, and damage management methods will apply to other <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls.</b> Legal Status: All <b>hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> in the United States are federally pro-tected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 USC, 703 − 711). <b>Hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> typically are protected under state wildlife laws or local ordinances, as well.

50|$|On July 31, 2003 {{lightning}} started five {{fires in}} Kootenay National Park that deteriorated {{into one of}} the largest wildfires in the Canadian Rockies, burning 17,000 hectares. There were dozens of other wildfires in British Columbia and Alberta — including large wildfires near the Crowsnest Pass, Kamloops and Kelowna. It cost almost $1 billion to fight the fires. Hundreds of homes were lost, thousands of people were evacuated across Western Canada. The 2003 fire led to positive environmental changes and development of a national wildland fire strategy in the mountain parks in 2005. In 2003, when the fire was threatening to spread from the Vermilion Valley and into the Bow Valley, when it was 50 kilometres from the town of Banff, fire fighters set up a containment line, a common strategy in wild fire control, by lighting a backfire 15 kilometres ahead of the fire, ultimately saving the Bow River Valley in general and Lake Louise and Banff in particular. Mike Flannigan, a professor with the department of renewable resources at the University of Alberta, explained that fires in the backcountry are healthy and beneficial to the forest and that the 2003 forest fire was ultimately good for the ecosystem in Kootenay. Rick Kubian, resource conservation manager with Lake Louise, Yoho and Kootenay national parks, explained how after the 2003 watershed year, Parks Canada changed its fire management strategy to include among other things, a prescribed burn program. They examined the landscape from a broader scale in time and space. Historically, a forest fire is part of a natural cycle, similar to the seasons, a winter that precedes the spring. In post-fire areas, {{over a long period of}} time, various stages of the habitat, support diverse species. The <b>northern</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> that thrives in post-burn conditions is already in the area. With a profusion of fireweed, a brilliant pink flower that thrives in these conditions, and new vistas have opened up, the park is beautiful. By 2018 or 2023 the burned area will be prime grizzly bear habitat and better for moose.|$|E
50|$|More so than diurnal {{varieties}} of raptor, fairly {{significant numbers of}} owls are hunted, as all species are to some extent nocturnal and thus their corresponding activity can attract the horned owl's unwanted attention. The extent of predation on other owls depends on the habitat preferences of the other species. Eastern and western screech owls may be most vulnerable since they prefer similar wooded edge habitat. In a block of Wisconsin, great horned owls {{were responsible for the}} failure of 78% of eastern screech owl's nests. Long-eared owls and, to a lesser extent, barn owls tend to hunt in open, sparsely treed habitats more so than great horned owls, but since they may return to wooded spots for nesting purposes, they may be more vulnerable there. The long-eared owl and barn owls are often compared to the great horned owl as these medium-sized species often occur in abutting habitats and often hunt primarily the same vole and mice species, although the alternate prey of the great horned tends to be much larger, including the smaller owls themselves. In a pair of studies from Colorado, the average weight of prey for long-eared owls was 28 to 30 g, 46 to 57.1 g for barn owl and 177 to 220 g for the great horned owl. Both young and adult great grey owls, despite their superficially superior size, are apparently hunted with impunity by great horned owls. In the boreal forests, both the <b>northern</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> and great grey owl appear to be in greater danger of great horned owl predation in years where the snowshoe hare have low populations. Great horned owls were the leading cause of mortality in juvenile spotted owls (30% of losses) and juvenile great grey owls (65% of losses). Less is known about relations with the snowy owl, which may compete with great horned owls for food while invading south for the winter. Anecdotally, both snowy and great horned owls have rarely been reported to dominate or even kill one another depending on the size and disposition of the individual owls, although the snowy's preference for more open areas again acts as something of a buffer. The snowy may be the one North American owl too formidable for the great horned owl to consider as prey.|$|E
30|$|The <b>{{northern}}</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> {{is one of}} the least-studied {{birds in}} North America. It occurs from Alaska to Newfoundland and also from Scandinavia to Siberia. Although northern hawk owls are known to occupy burned forests (Duncan and Duncan 1994), the importance of burned vs. unburned forests is still largely unknown. In the only published comparison of <b>northern</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> relative abundance between burned and unburned conifer-dominated boreal forest in North America, northern hawk owls were detected only in post-fire forest and were not detected in nearby unburned coniferous forest (Hannah and Hoyt 2004). There was also a significant negative exponential relationship between <b>northern</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> abundance and time since fire, suggesting that burns were suitable for only about eight years following fire. Thus, {{there is some evidence that}} the <b>northern</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> is yet another species that depends on (is relatively restricted to) conditions created by severe, stand-replacement fires in boreal forests of Canada.|$|E

50|$|The {{cinnabar}} boobook (Ninox ios) {{also known}} as the cinnabar <b>hawk</b> <b>owl,</b> is a <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> endemic to the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. It was described as a new species to science by American ornithologist Pamela C. Rasmussen in 1999 based on a single specimen collected by Frank Rozendaal from Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park on Minahassa Peninsula, northern Sulawesi, in 1985. Subsequently, it has also been observed in Lore Lindu National Park in central Sulawesi, greatly expanding the known habitat range.|$|R
50|$|Because the California vole is {{relatively}} common and widespread, it has numerous natural predators, including <b>hawks,</b> <b>owls,</b> egrets, long-tailed weasels, coyotes, skunks, and garter snakes.|$|R
30|$|The {{bird species}} {{that appear to}} be most {{restricted}} to and, therefore, most dependent upon, burned forests in these systems (black-backed woodpecker, and <b>northern</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>owl)</b> clearly require severe fires. This is entirely consistent with our current understanding that infrequent, severe fires dominate fire regimes in the boreal conifer forest system (Johnson et al. 2001), and it also reinforces the idea that the extensive mixed-conifer forest zones throughout the western US were probably historically dominated by mixed-fire regimes that included either some infrequent severe fire events or, more likely, always included patches of severe fire during fire events that occurred at intermediate frequencies. This conclusion corresponds well with the fact that mixed- and high-severity fire regimes characterize the majority (see data from LANDFIRE) of forest types in North America (Johnson et al. 2001, Graham 2003, Franklin et al. 2005, Noss et al. 2006), including even the more mesic ponderosa pine forests (Schoennagel et al. 2004, Baker et al. 2007, Sherriff and Veblen 2007).|$|E
30|$|Bird {{species that}} {{specialize}} {{in the use of}} burned forest conditions can provide insight into the prehistoric fire regimes associated with the forest types that they have occupied over evolutionary time. The nature of their adaptations reflects the specific post-fire conditions that occurred prior to the unnatural influence of humans after European settlement. Specifically, the post-fire conditions, nest site locations, and social systems of two species (Bachman’s sparrow [Aimophila aestivalis] and red-cockaded woodpecker [Picoides borealis]) suggest that, prehistorically, a frequent, low-severity fire regime characterized the southeastern pine system in which they evolved. In contrast, the patterns of distribution and abundance for several other bird species (black-backed woodpecker [Picoides arcticus], buff-breasted flycatcher [Empidonax fulvifrons], Lewis’ woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], <b>northern</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> [Surnia ulula], and Kirtland’s warbler [Dendroica kirtlandii]) suggest that severe fire has been {{an important component of the}} fire regimes with which they evolved. Patterns of habitat use by the latter species indicate that severe fires are important components not only of higher-elevation and high-latitude conifer forest types, which are known to be dominated by such fires, but also of mid-elevation and even low-elevation conifer forest types that are not normally assumed to have had high-severity fire as an integral part of their natural fire regimes. Because plant and animal adaptations can serve as reliable sources of information about what constitutes a natural fire regime, it might be wise to supplement traditional historical methods with careful consideration of information related to plant and animal adaptations when attempting to restore what are thought to be natural fire regimes.|$|E

40|$|The ethnopoetics of Gwich’in caribou anatomy rises {{out of our}} {{detailed}} {{compilation of}} more than one hundred fifty names for caribou bones, muscles, and internal organs. These names indicate that Gwich’in knowledge of caribou, accumulated over many centuries, is both systematic and precise. As it turns out, the names used for caribou body parts are rich in simile, metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and personification, illustrating the elegant robust imaginative life of Gwich’in subsistence hunters. My daughter, an accomplished poet, tells me that “language is not just about communication, but also about creativity,” and the data we have gathered in rural Alaska and the Yukon fully support that thesis. Gwich’in is a language with a full suite of tropes, and these tropes are deeply embedded both in personal experience narratives, traditional tales, riddles, and place names. Ch’ikiidruu, the first rib, for example, is actually a double metaphor, referring to the <b>northern</b> <b>hawk</b> <b>owl</b> and to a hunting tool used to catch snowshoe hares. Ch'ak'oh Handzee, the atlas, a neck bone that can be difficult to sever with a knife, was also the Gwich’in name of the late Daniel John, a stubborn tough guy whom I recorded back in 1972. These are only two of many compelling examples. There is even a descriptive literary term, “Gwigwii’ii ginjik” for metaphor itself. All of this is empowering and uplifting. Although Gwich’in is a small endangered language, we think that the use of figurative language residing in texts provides a rich supply of raw material and multiple contexts for developing curricula in Gwich’in schools. Gwich’in verbal art also provides opportunities for teaching the language at home and in the classroom. When students recognize how their elders and ancestors played with words, we believe they will gain a renewed enthusiasm for learning their heritage. At the same time, we think that the revelations of Gwich’in verbal art made in direct comparison to Western contemporary poetry make the world a richer and more fascinating place to live in...|$|E
