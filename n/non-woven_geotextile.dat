40|$|This chapter {{contains}} a laboratory {{assessment of the}} role of geosynthetics in the performance of railway ballast. The main objectives of this testing were to examine the actual potential of selected geosynthetic products for ballast stabilisation. A series of cyclic drained tests were carried out using a large scale prismoidal triaxial apparatus that was designed and built at the University of Wollongong, and is the most innovative cyclic process simulation testing equipment available in the world today. The effects of different types of geosynthetics, including bi-axial geogrid, <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> and geocomposite (a combination of bi-axial geogrid and <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile)</b> have been evaluated as single layer and dual layer arrangements. The test findings revealed that bi-axial geogrid with aperture size of 40  40 mm and with minimum bi-directional strength that complies with the University of Wollongong recommendations, would be a suitable grid reinforcement to be placed under the ballast layer for track stabilisation. This particular <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> offered an optimum separation function between the ballast and capping layers and maintained a higher resiliency during cyclic loading. Among the three types of geosynthetics tested, the use of geocomposite resulted in the least strain and particle breakage.

A comprehensive series of triaxial compression tests were performed for these investigation on unreinforced and reinforced sand with geotextiles. The Joomunjin standard sand was used and non-woven geotextiles were included into sand specimen with three layers. The inclusion of <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> reinforcement into sand increased the peak strength of sand significantly and the reinforced samples exhibited a greater axial strain at failure. Also {{the effect on}} number of reinforcement layers was studied and found as {{increasing the number of}} reinforcement layers resulting in more ductility by clogging developed in the shear band within the specimens.

An array of geosynthetics such as biaxial geogrids, <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> and woven geotextiles were extensively {{used in the}} project primarily for separation, filtration and reinforcement purposes. The geosynthetics were particularly used at locations of high embankments underlain by soft clays and loose sands. Ground improvement using geosynthetics in the project primarily included geogrid-reinforced piled embankments with individual pile caps, geogrids at bridge approach transitions, geogrids for ground treatment beneath culverts, geogrids for culverts supported by stone columns, woven geotextiles for cement column works, <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> for excavation works, <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> {{at the top of}} the railway subgrade layer, <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> for temporary retaining walls and <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> for slope protection works.

The filtration properties of seven <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> to water and oil were determined over a range of hydraulic gradients and confining pressures. The geotextile filter design criteria considered the grain size distribution, coefficient of uniformity, density and permeability of the sand surrounding the drainage systems and the apparent opening size, porosity and permeability of the geotextile filters. Permeability criteria, retention criteria and clogging criteria were examined for the <b>non-woven</b> fabrics. <b>Geotextile</b> filters for water and oil permeants should be made of fibers that are both hydrophobic (repelling water) and oleophobic (repelling oil) to provide a higher permeability for a given porosity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this {{research}} work, a comprehensive testing {{program has been}} carried out to study the stress-strain and volume change behavior of unreinforced and reinforced residual soil. A series of drained triaxial tests were conducted using computer controlled GDS triaxial apparatus for unreinforced and reinforced soil. Test results show that reinforced soils exhibit higher failure strains and volume contraction than unreinforced soils. Reinforced soils with <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> exhibit higher failure strains, strength and coefficient of interface friction than woven geotextile reinforced residual soil. A simplified approach for numerical calculations were proposed to predict the shear strength of unreinforced and reinforced soils for triaxial compression stress paths and the coefficient of interface friction for reinforced soils.

40|$|Eutrophication, {{the rapid}} growth of blue green algae in surface water, has become an {{environmental}} issue worldwide. In Canada, it has been also identified as one of the leading risks to surface water quality especially lake water quality. Lake Caron, an artificial lake, located in the municipality of Saint-Anne Des Lacs, Quebec, has been suffering from eutrophication due to high concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll α since 2008. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the water quality parameters of a eutrophic lake, to treat eutrophic lake water samples by filtration using <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> and hence evaluate the effectiveness of <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> as a filter media, and assess the relationship among various water quality parameters. To achieve these objectives, water samples from the lake were analysed for two consecutive years. Further, a small scale field experiment was conducted beside the lake by using <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> as filter media. Custom made geotextiles of distinct apparent opening sizes and materials (TE-GTX 300 – 110 µm, TE-GTN 300 – 90 µm, TE-GTN 350 – 90 µm and TE-GTN 340 - 75 µm) were used in different combinations to find the best combination providing maximum efficiency in removing nutrients and suspended solids to achieve acceptable level within shorter period of time. Several combinations of geotextile filters were tried for different initial turbidity range of lake water. For an initial turbidity ranging from 4 to 9 NTU, filtration with the combination of 2 layers of 110 μm (TE-GTX 300) followed by 3 layers of 90 μm (TE-GTN 350) showed the best result at 7 th day of filtration, whereas filtration with a filter media consisting of 2 layers of 110 μm (TE-GTX 300) and 3 layers of 75 μm (TE-GTN 340) geotextiles had been found to restore the water quality at the 3 rd day of filtration for an initial turbidity ranging from 9 to 14 NTU. The combination of 1 layer of 110 μm (TE-GTX 300) with 4 layers of 90 μm (TE-GTN 300) showed the best result at 2 nd day during filtration for an initial turbidity higher than 14 NTU. For the first two category (4 to 9 NTU and 9 to 14 NTU) the removal efficiencies were 66, 100 and 96 % for removing total P (TP), TSS and turbidity, respectively. For the remaining categories (14 to 19 NTU and higher than 19 NTU), the removal efficiencies were more than 90 % for TP and turbidity and more than 96 % efficiency had been found in case of TSS removal. TSS removal correlates with the reduction of turbidity, TP and COD concentration. Initial flow rates through the filter decrease with increasing number of filter layers and decreasing pore size of the filter media. A higher TSS decreases the flow rate through the filter and increases clogging. Geotextiles as a filter media have shown potential for improvement of surface water quality in terms of nutrients, turbidity and TSS removal...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{geotextiles}} {{in coastal}} {{structures such as}} revetments and bund walls has become a common practice. The performance of these structures during their lifetime depends on the durability of geotextile used. During construction of these coastal structures, geotextiles are subjected to a drop load with high impact stress and that can damage the geotextile.

50|$|There {{are several}} types of liners used in {{leachate}} control and collection. These types include geomembranes, geosynthetic clay liners, geotextiles, geogrids, geonets, and geocomposites. Each style of liner has specific uses and abilities. Geomembranes are used to provide a barrier between mobile polluting substances released from wastes and the groundwater. In the closing of landfills, geomembranes are used to provide a low-permeability cover barrier to prevent the intrusion of rain water. Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are fabricated by distributing sodium bentonite in a uniform thickness between woven and <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles.</b> Sodium bentonite has a low permeability, which makes GCLs a suitable alternative to clay liners in a composite liner system. Geotextiles are used as separation between {{two different types of}} soils to prevent contamination of the lower layer by the upper layer. Geotextiles also act as a cushion to protect synthetic layers against puncture from underlying and overlaying rocks. Geogrids are structural synthetic materials used in slope veneer stability to create stability for cover soils over synthetic liners or as soil reinforcement in steep slopes. Geonets are synthetic drainage materials that are often used in lieu of sand and gravel. Radz can take 12 in of drainage sand, thus increasing the landfill space for waste. Geocomposites are a combination of synthetic materials that are ordinarily used singly. A common type of geocomposite is a geonet that is heat-bonded to two layers of geotextile, one on each side. The geocomposite serves as a filter and drainage medium.|$|R

40|$|The {{clogging}} of fine-porosity geotextiles by {{soil particles}} {{is considered to}} be a problem in applications of these fabrics to filtering of municipal and industrial effluents. However, the clogging phenomenon can be an advantage for certain purposes, such as the creation of near-watertight membranes for sealing manure holding tanks. The conceived advantages of <b>non-woven</b> needle-punctured <b>geotextiles</b> are that they are less expensive due to lower material quantity, they are more resistant to tensile stresses compared to impermeable plastics and concrete, and they are easily installed. This thesis describes experimental work on the permeability and clogging characteristics of a <b>Non-woven</b> Polyester <b>Geotextile</b> with three different porosities (13. 4, 19. 5 and 26. 0 mum) but the same hydraulic conductivity (Kw = 10 - 5 m/s), when subjected to different heads of cattle slurry at 1, 2 and 4 % total solids (TS) concentrations. The resulting infiltration rates were used to establish the effect of geotextile pore size and manure TS on geotextile sealing and to find the location of the seal, whether at the surface or within the geotextile. After 100 days of experimentation, the lowest infiltration rate of 1. 1 L/m 2 /d was reached with the 13. 4 mum geotextile. Manure TS had a significant effect on the sealing and at least 4 % TS was required to minimize the geotextile's infiltration rate. Clogging occurred within the pores, suggesting that the seal remains even after removing the manure. This advantage can be translated into economic benefit when fun cost comparisons with sealing liners such as geomembranes and concrete are undertaken. This research also reviews and analyzes the physical, chemical and biological processes leading to clogging of geotextiles as well as a cost-benefit comparison with the other sealing materials. The analysis concludes that clogged geotextiles are a wise choice for Canadian livestock producers...|$|R

Infiltration rates decreased from 5 X 10 ^- 5 m/s to less than 1 X 10 ^- 7 m/s and 2 X 10 ^- 8 m/s within 150 and 1000 hours, respectively and all demonstrated minimum seepage rates of 1. 3 to 1. 8 X 10 ^- 8 m/s after 1000 to 1400 hours; these rates are slightly greater than the 10 ^- 8 m/s guideline established by the Quebec government. Field sealing of geotextiles liners was confirmed using a 20 micrometers fabric subjected to swine slurries of various total solids (TS) concentrations ranging from 1 % to 10 %. Infiltration rates indicate that satisfactory sealing requires slurries with a minimum TS content of 4 %. As well, higher TS levels favour a longer lasting manure seal at the fabric surface. Sterilized manure of 5 % total solids (TS) used to simulate cool field conditions or poor biological sealing mechanisms showed that the sterilized manure retained a constant infiltration rate after 1000 hours. The equivalent natural manure, on the other hand, demonstrated an increase in infiltration rates after 1000 hours, indicating that microbial degradation of the manure solids mat had occurred.

Geotextiles are planar {{polymeric}} {{textile materials}} which are utilised in geotechnical engineering in various applications, including the reinforcement of soils which {{is achieved by}} laying geotextile sheets horizontally to carry the induced horizontal stresses. The behaviour of such reinforced soil structures (e. g. retaining walls) is determined primarily by the shear interaction between the soil and individual geotextile sheets. This dissertation presents an investigation into the shear interaction behaviour between a locally manufactured <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> and Cape Flats sand. The literature review exposed a certain lack in understanding of the displacement and shear stress mechanisms involved in the pull-out of geotextiles from sand. Also, the prediction of either rupture or slippage failure was unclear. The shear stress at slippage failure has not previously been determined for confinements greater than 1 OOkPa.

Their basic function is to remain impervious over the entire design life of the project. However, mechanical stresses induced by the confined materials could produce a deformation of the membrane and, in critical situations, could ultimately puncture it. Protective cushions, typically heavy weight geotextiles, are used in geosynthetics engineering to reduce occurrence of local stresses and thus to control potential puncture of the liner by the material installed immediately above (typically the drainage layer). Various <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> cushion design methods are presented and discussed {{in the first part}} of the paper. It is shown that inappropriate understanding of the basic hypothesis used to apply these methods could lead to the inappropriate selection of a cushion material and thus to the failure of the lining material. Laboratory evaluation of protective cushions efficiency, based on a large-scale performance test (modified ASTM D 5514 procedure), is described in the second part of the paper. Experience gained throughout laboratory testing of different systems confirms that analytical methods can be considered as good approximations for the preliminary steps of a project, i. e. conceptual choices / pricing).

40|$|The soil-geotextile {{filtration}} {{mechanism is}} a complex process which depends on physical compatibility between the geotextile and the soil to be retained. Geotextiles often perform well under steady state conditions like those found in dams. However, when the soil-geotextile interface is subjected to dynamic loading, the requirements for successful filtering are uncertain and/ or conservative as the controlling factors are not well understood in these circumstances. There are few filter design criteria available for dynamic flow conditions. These criteria do not properly address the internal instability of soils for which the rearrangement of particles adjacent to the filter interface is complex. Unstable soils may exist in roadway bases adjacent to pavement edge drain. Therefore, this research work was carried out {{to better understand the}} filtration behaviour of <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextiles</b> with internally stable and unstable soils beneath roads. To carry out the filtration tests, a flexible wall gradient ratio (GR) apparatus was developed. The GR tests were performed to investigate the effect of different factors on the filtration performance of the soil-geotextile interface under dynamic conditions. The factors included hydraulic gradient, vertical stress and frequency of loading, soil gradation and geotextile properties. Test results were interpreted in terms of head loss within the soil and across the geotextile, GR values, permeability ratio, mass and gradation of particles passed through geotextiles, microscopic images of geotextiles after test, partial geotextile clogging levels and hydrometer sieve analyses of soil samples to compare the gradation of samples after test with the original gradation. All the tests were performed under a hydraulic gradient of five. The internal stability of soil samples were evaluated by three geometric criteria. The test results showed that a high hydraulic gradient has the ability to lead to the internal instability of soils which resulted in migration of fines towards the geotextiles. The dynamic loading resulted in increase of soil migration within the base soil as well as washing out of soil particles through geotextiles. No significant effect of increase in frequency and vertical stress was observed on filtration behaviour of soil-geotextile combinations. The geotextile pore size was found to be the main factor controlling the filtration behaviour as compared to other geotextile properties. The Kenney and Lau (1985) and the Kezdi (1979) criteria predicted well the internal instability of soils under dynamic conditions. In this research study, a new method was suggested which is able to measure the pore sizes along the entire thickness of geotextiles. The filtration tests showed that geotextiles having the same large openings but different pore size distributions may result in different filtration performances. Based on the test results, filter design criteria were suggested for piping and blinding limits which were compared with the existing design criteria. These new filter criteria were found to be more appropriate in terms of piping and blinding limit states...|$|R
40|$|Railways {{form one}} of the major {{worldwide}} transportation networks and they continue to provide quick and safe public and freight transportation. In order to compete with other modes of transportation and to meet the ever growing demand of public and freight transport, railway industries face challenges to improve their efficiency and decrease the costs of maintenance and infrastructure. Large cyclic loading from heavy haul and passenger trains often leads to progressive deterioration of the track. The excessive deformations and degradations of the ballast layer and unacceptable differential settlement or pumping of underlying soft and compressible subgrade soils necessitate frequent costly track maintenance works. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year for the construction and maintenance of rail tracks in large countries like the USA, Canada and Australia. A proper understanding of load transfer mechanisms and their effects on track deformations are essential prerequisites for designing the new track and rehabilitating the existing one. The reinforcement of the track by means of geosynthetics leads to significant reduction in the downward propagation of stresses and assures more resilient long-term performance. The geocomposite (combination of biaxial geogrid and <b>non-woven</b> polypropylene <b>geotextile)</b> serves the functions of reinforcement, filtration and separation, thereby reducing the vertical and lateral deformations. To stabilise subgrade soil under rail tacks and road embankments, two advanced ground improvement schemes have been introduced. Stabilization of soft subgrade soils using prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) is essential for improving overall stability of track and reducing the differential settlement during the train operation. The effectiveness of using geocomposite geosynthetic and PVDs has been observed through field measurements and elasto-plastic finite element analyses. These have been the first fully instrumented, comprehensive field trials carried out in Australian Railways, and it was very encouraging to see the field observations matching the numerical predictions. Moreover, the improvement of an unstable formation soil with pH neutral chemical admixture and the sub-surface drainage is described. Internal erosional behaviour of lignosulfonate treated erodible soils has been studied using the Process Simulation Apparatus for Internal Crack Erosion (PSAICE) designed and built at the University of Wollongong (UOW). Effectiveness of lignosulfonate treated erodible soils on the erosion resistance has been investigated and its advantages over conventional methods are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{cost-effective}} way {{of producing}} all-weather surfaces for cattle {{is to use}} a combined geotextile-gravel pad construction, which allows pavement depth to be reduced. This study sought to determine the pavement construction that would offer the least runoff, best drainage effect and highest quality runoff and drainage effluent after exposure to heavy precipitation under different manure loads in high animal density areas. The study also examined whether any pavement construction gave acceptable sealing to the underlying soil surface. Three different combinations of <b>non-woven</b> and woven <b>geotextile</b> together with two gravel fractions of 200 mm were exposed to 50 mm precipitation for 30 minutes and 15 kg of cattle manure under two manure regimes (manure removal and manure accumulation). Runoff, drainage effluent and leachate were flow measured and sampled in buckets as they exited their respective pipes for both regimes. The pad surface layer reduced runoff flow rate and stabilised drain flow throughout the experiments, confirming pad stability. Manure removal reduced total N, total P, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solid (TS) concentrations in drainage effluent. One pad construction proved better at oxidising NO 2 -N and another at trapping TS. One pad construction met the sealing liner norm to the underlying soil. The drainage effluent produced was acceptable for wetland treatment. The results show that geotextile and gravel pad constructions not only have a supporting and draining function, but also a filtering, aerating and sealing effect...|$|R
40|$|French drains or infiltrating filter drains are {{commonly}} fitted with slotted plastic pipe {{to act as}} an overflow mechanism when rainfall is too great to allow complete infiltration. The release of the effluent from such pipes is commonly to surface water courses. Whilst there is expected to be some slight degree of protection against hydrocarbon release because of interaction with the drain’s stone infill material this will be severely limited. This paper reports an experiment in which model filter drains with or without geotextile sleeves around the slotted drain are challenged with lubricating oil. The textile was a surface-treated <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> manufactured from polyester. The models were challenged with very high loadings of oil, as would be anticipated in a motor vehicle collision occurring close to the drain. A series of simulated 10 - 20 mm rain events over 1 hour were applied and two sample types were collected which either included or excluded any free product. Additional aliquots of oil were added at each rain event. The un-sleeved models were found to release visible free product with the addition of as little as 100 ml of oil per linear meter of drain. For the models with geotextile sleeves there was no such release with as much as 2000 ml per linear metre. Analysis showed that under these conditions the geotextile sleeved pipes continued to produce effluent with hydrocarbon concentrations well below the 5000 g/l limit usually accepted in the UK...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{inclined}} plane shear on three different geosynthetics (a geocomposite (GC), a <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> (GTX), and an extruded geogrid (GGR)) with a residual soil from granite. Soil and geosynthetic properties, test equipment, and procedures are described. The influence of soil moisture content and geosynthetic type on soil - geosynthetic interaction behavior is discussed by analyzing {{the results of the}} inclined plane shear tests. The main conclusions that can be outlined from the present study are the following: (1) the influence of soil moisture content was relevant for the soil - GTX and soil - GC interfaces. Indeed, the resistance of those interfaces decreased with the increase of soil moisture content. No significant differences were observed between the behavior of those geosynthetics; (2) the influence of soil moisture content on the behavior of the soil - GGR interface was less evident. A slight decrease on the interface friction angle was only observed for the highest soil moisture content; (3) the dry soil - GGR interface resistance was lower than that observed for the other two geosynthetics due to the relevance of soil - soil friction at the GGR apertures, to the high percentage of fines of the soil used in the research (D 50 = 1 Â· 00 mm), and to the smoother solid lateral surface of the extruded GGR when compared with the surface of the GTX or GC.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this project is to {{stabilize}} the abandoned coal storage area and redirect the storm water runoff from sanitary sewer system to the storm drain system. Currently, the existing storm water runoff is directed to a perimeter concrete drainage swale and collected in a containment basin. The collected water is then pumped to a treatment facility and after treatment, is discharged to the Y- 12 sanitary sewer system. The existing drainage swale and collection basin along with silt fencing will be used during aggregate placement and grading to provide erosion and sediment control. Inlet protection will also be installed around existing structures during the storm water diversion construction. This project scope will include the installation of a <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> fabric and compacted mineral aggregate base (paving optional) to stabilize the site. The geotextile specifications are provided on the vendor cut sheets in Appendix B. The installation of a storm water collection/retention area will also be installed on the southern side of the site in accordance with EPA Technical Guidance on Implementing the Stormwater Runoff Requirements for federal Projects under Section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act. The total area to be disturbed is approximately 2. 5 acres. The order of activities for this Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) will be: (1) post notice of coverage (NOC) in a prominent display near entrance of the site; (2) install rain gauge on site or contact Y- 12 Plant Shift Superintendent daily for Met tower rain gauge readings; (3) install stabilized construction exit on site; (4) install silt fencing along perimeter as indicated on the attached site plan; (5) regrade site; (6) install geotextile fabric and compacted mineral aggregate base; (7) install catch basin inlet protection where required; (8) excavate and lower existing catch basin tops, re-grade and asphalt to drain; and (9) when all disturbed areas are re-stabilized, remove silt fencing and any other temporary erosion control...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{field study}} sought to {{determine}} the all-weather surface construction providing the least contaminated runoff and drainage effluent when exposed to moderate to heavy precipitation and different manure loads in horse paddocks during wintertime. Two different combinations of <b>non-woven</b> and woven <b>geotextile</b> together with two gravel fractions of 200 mm were exposed to precipitation and horse manure/urine for two years under two manure regimes (manure removal and manure accumulation). In a simulated rainfall (SR) study, the test areas were also exposed to 50 mm precipitation for 30 min and 15 kg of horse manure under the two manure regimes. Runoff, drainage effluent and leachate flow were measured and sampled for both regimes. The geotextile-gravel construction reduced runoff and drained the test area throughout the two-year period, confirming construction stability and a dry walking surface area at a mean drain flow of 3. 65 L m- 2 h- 1. The concentrations of total N, total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solids (TS) in fluids leaving the test areas in winter were lower than in previous studies, due to lower horse density. The mean drainage concentration of TP, COD and TS was 3. 4, 231, 739 mg L- 1, respectively, due to manure removal in the SR study. The TP (1. 9 mg L- 1) concentration in drain fluids was reduced by 47 % in the test area consisting of a single geotextile compared with previously reported values (3. 6 mg L- 1). With the paddock designs tested here, non-point pollution from paddocks could be controlled and reduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this dissertation follows on from the study made by Jewell (1980) into the effects of tensile reinforcement on the mechanical behaviour of sand. For this study Jewell used the direct shear test with reinforcement placed about the central plane as shown in fig. 1. 1. The direct shear test was chosen for the following reasons. (1) The reinforcement variables could be better controlled and examined in a unit cell test than in modular field studies of soil reinforcement systems. (2) The pattern of deformation {{is similar to that}} experienced by soil in which a rupture band develops, with the principal axes of stress, strain and strain increment free to rotate {{as is the case in}} model and field structures. (3) The overall shear strength of the sample is measured directly at the boundaries of the apparatus. The direct shear tests were monitored by boundary measurements and internal measurements using a radiographic technique. The findings are outlined below with reference made to relevant observations by other researchers. 1) The optimum orientation for a relatively flexible steel grid was found to be approximately along the direction of principal tensile strains in the unreinforced sand, see fig. 1. 2. This indicated that the reinforcement functioned by limiting tensile strains in the sand. McGown et al. (1978) obtained a similar result for plane strain cell tests on sand containing a single layer of flexible reinforcement. However in both studies the reinforcement was observed to waken the sand. Jewell recognized weakening to occur when the steel grid was placed along the direction of principal compressive strains in the unreinforced sand. This was attributed to a reduction in vertical effective stress. McGown et al. observed weakening of the sand when the reinforcement orientation approached the rupture band which developed in the sand alone. This was recognized to be the direction of zero-extension in the unreinforced sand. The weakening was linked to a lower bond between soil and reinforcement than soil alone. 2) Internal strains determined by Jewell showed the tensile reinforcement modified strains in the sand over a well defined zone, see fig. 1. 3. This resulted in a significant rotation of principal axes of strain increment, with the bond of major strains which developed across the centre of the box in the unreinforced sand being prohibited from forming. This agreed with boundary measurements, indicating the reinforcement functioned by limiting tensile strains in the sand. Consequently a less favourable mode of failure took place. The limit of rotation of principal axes of strain increment was understood to be the alignment of a direction of zero-extension in the sand with the reinforcement. These findings agree with the ideas expressed by Basset and Last (1978) on the mode of action of tensile reinforcement, which in particular was related to the effect of tensile reinforcement on the strain field in a reinforced earth wall as shown in fig. 1. 4. 3) For efficient use of tensile reinforcement it was demonstrated that the bond with sand should be as high as possible. This could be achieved by roughening the surface. Alternatively, the bond was improved by introducing openings or apertures in the reinforcement, changing the shape to a grid. It appeared that the bond for a suitably proportioned grid could be as high as for a fully roughened surface. 4) The longitudinal stiffness of tensile reinforcement was observed to affect the magnitude and rate of increase in strength in the direct shear tests. The rupture strain of tensile reinforcement relative to maximum tensile strains of the soil, under the same operational stress conditions, have also been observed to influence the reinforcing effect in terms of its limiting behaviour, i. e. whether brittle or ductile (McGown, et al. 1978). With regards to the performance of reinforced earth walls, Al-Hussanini and Perry (1976) observed that steel reinforced strips produced a stiffer and stronger structure than a more extensible fabric reinforcement, even though surface roughness was less. The importance of reinforcement tensile stiffness is recognized in limit equilibrium designs for tensile reinforced soil structures by limiting the available reinforcement force to the tensile strains that can develop in the soil (e. g. Jewell 1985). For highly structured <b>non-woven</b> and composite <b>geotextiles,</b> McGown et al. (1982) demonstrated that the stress-strain behaviour can be significantly affected by soil confinement. Testing wider strips in isolation was not found to replicate the effects of soil confinement. Another factor which needs to be considered when assessing the tensile property of a polymer reinforcement is creep. McGown et al. (1984) illustrated an appropriate method of interpreting creep data using isochronous curves, which enable long term laboratory test data to be extrapolated to the design life of the soil structure. 5) The strain and hence stress fields in the reinforced direct shear tests have been shown to be complex and non-uniform. However Jewell successfully modelled the variation of reinforcing effect for tensile reinforcement at different orientations by using a simple limit equilibrium analysis, see fig. 1. 5. The effect of the tensile reinforcement force was represented as: - an increase in the normal effective stress acting on the central plane of the box due to the normal component of the force and - a reduction in the applied shear stress due to the parallel component of the force to the central plane. Subsequently this analysis has been applied to limit equilibrium design methods for reinforcing soil retaining walls and embankments, Jewell et al. 1984, and Jewell 1982 respectively. 6) A reduction in the reinforcing effect for individual reinforcement due to the presence of other reinforcement was observed in the shear box. This loss of efficiency of individual reinforcement was termed interference. Interference between tensile reinforcement has also been studied by Guilloux et al. (1979) for the pull-out resistance from soil. However interference between reinforcement has yet to be introduced into a limit equilibrium design method...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Landfill covers are designed as impermeable caps on top of waste containment facilities {{after the completion of}} landfill operations. Geocomposite drain (GD) materials consist of a geonet or geospacer (as a drainage core) sandwiched between non-woven geotextiles that act as separators and filters. GD provides a drainage function as part of the cover system. The stability performance of landfill cover system is largely controlled by the interface shear strength mobilised between the elements of the cover. If a GD is used, the interface shear strength properties between the upper surface of the GD and the overlying soil may govern stability of the system. It is not uncommon for fine grained materials to be used as cover soils. In these cases, understanding soil softening issues at the soil interface with the <b>non-woven</b> <b>geotextile</b> is important. Such softening can be caused by capillary break behaviour and build-up of water pressures from the toe of the drain upwards into the cover soil. The interaction processes to allow water flow into a GD core through the soil-geotextile interface is very complex, and have been defined herein as Capillary Related Interface Breakthrough (CRIB). The infiltration test using small column on CRIB conditions for GD in contact with fine grained soils confirmed the development of capillary break at the interface. The effect of water build-up on the interface leads to soil softening in fine grained soils layer and reduce the interface shear strength hence potential instability of the system. Two series of fine grained soil/GD interface shear strength tests conducted to determine the interface shear strength behaviour for a range of soil water contents. The soil softening at the interface due to soaked behaviour show a reduction in interface shear strength and this aspect should be emphasized in design specifications and construction control. Comparison on the main behaviour using field measurements on the trial landfill cover at Bletchley were conducted to increase confidence in the understanding of the implications for design of cover systems...|$|E
