This figure has been characterised as being many different people. One can argue whether it is the rock that forged the character of people over generations, or conversely if the people came to permeate it with the spirit of their nature. The surrounding area served as a <b>natural</b> <b>hiding</b> <b>place</b> for outlaws of all kinds: the [...] "Fairy's Cave" [...] {{was one of the most}} secure hiding places for Chouans and highwaymen.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, Castelmezzano was {{affected}} by brigandage. Due to its location, rich in <b>natural</b> <b>hiding</b> <b>places</b> among the rocks and lush vegetation, it was an ideal refuge for many bandits.

50|$|Enemies in {{the game}} {{primarily}} consist of Sligs, semi-robotic creatures who will attempt to kill the player character on sight. Although most have mechanical legs and carry machine guns, some Sligs wear helicopter flight packs and launch grenades. Some Sligs choose to sleep without wearing mechanical legs, in which case they are vulnerable until they can obtain a set. Sligs can be possessed by the player character, who can then control the Slig and utilize its weapon. Sligs cannot see in dark shadows, which create <b>natural</b> <b>hiding</b> <b>places</b> for the player character. Sligs are often accompanied by Slogs, bipedal dog-like creatures that chase and attack the player character on sight. Slogs can be commanded if the player possesses a Slig, and can be ordered to attack and kill enemies. Sloggies are the puppy form of Slogs, and are slower but just as deadly if the player character encounters them. Slogs and Sloggies can be distracted with bones.|$|R
