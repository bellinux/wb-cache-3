5|$|In {{identical}} twins, if one {{is affected}} there is a 50–60% chance that the other will also be affected. In <b>non-identical</b> <b>twins</b> the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, {{most of the time}} they have the same epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population. Between 1 and 10% of those with Down syndrome and 90% of those with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are {{three times more likely to}} be affected compared to <b>non-identical</b> <b>twins.</b> This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for <b>non-identical</b> <b>twins</b> and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E

25|$|There {{appear to}} be some genetic {{components}} with identical twins more often affected than <b>non-identical</b> <b>twins.</b> Further, individuals with OCD {{are more likely to}} have first-degree family members exhibiting the same disorders than do matched controls. In cases where OCD develops during childhood, there is a much stronger familial link in the disorder than cases in which OCD develops later in adulthood. In general, genetic factors account for 45–65% of the variability in OCD symptoms in children diagnosed with the disorder. Recent evidence supports the possibility of a heritable predisposition for neurological development favouring OCD.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. There {{appear to be}} some genetic {{components}} with both identical twins more often affected than both <b>non-identical</b> <b>twins.</b> Risk factors include a history of child abuse or other stress inducing event. Some cases have been documented to occur following infections. The diagnosis {{is based on the}} symptoms and requires ruling out other drug related or medical causes. Rating scales such as the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale can be used to assess the severity. Other disorders with similar symptoms include anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, tic disorders, and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder.|$|E

25|$|Allergic {{diseases}} are strongly familial: identical twins {{are likely to}} have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in <b>non-identical</b> <b>twins.</b> Allergic parents {{are more likely to have}} allergic children, and those children's allergies are likely to be more severe than those in children of non-allergic parents. Some allergies, however, are not consistent along genealogies; parents who are allergic to peanuts may have children who are allergic to ragweed. It seems that the likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and related to an irregularity in the immune system, but the specific allergen is not.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} not known. There {{appear to be}} some genetic {{components}} with identical twins more often affected than <b>non-identical</b> <b>twins.</b> Cultural factors also appear {{to play a role}} with societies that value thinness having higher rates of disease. Additionally, it occurs more commonly among those involved in activities that value thinness such as high-level athletics, modelling, and dancing. Anorexia often begins following a major life-change or stress-inducing event. The diagnosis requires a significantly low weight. The severity of disease is based on body mass index (BMI) in adults with mild disease having a BMI of greater than 17, moderate a BMI of 16 to 17, severe a BMI of 15 to 16, and extreme a BMI less than 15. In children a BMI for age percentile of less than the 5th percentile is often used.|$|E

50|$|An {{anomalous}} {{feature in}} the demographics in the archipelago {{is the number of}} twins. The tendency for <b>non-identical</b> <b>twin</b> births is partly hereditary, and the necessary genes are prevalent in the archipelago. In the 18th and 19th centuries the proportion of twin births was greater than anywhere in Europe, and enormously higher than in continental Finland. The reason for this was fishing. Fish is an excellent source of protein and unsaturated fat. It was also available even when crops failed. Hence having twins maximizes lifetime reproductive success.|$|R

50|$|Colpocephaly {{has been}} {{associated}} with chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 8 mosaic and trisomy 9 mosaic. A few reports of genetically transmitted colpocephaly are also found in literature. Some of these are of two siblings, monozygotic twins, and <b>non-identical</b> <b>twins.</b> The authors suggest a genetic origin with an autosomal or X-linked recessive inheritance rather than resulting from early prenatal disturbances.|$|E

People: There were 7500 adult twins (3084 twin pairs) of white ethnicity.

50|$|In 2013, a {{twin study}} {{combined}} {{a survey of}} pairs of twins where one or both had undergone, or had plans and medical approval to undergo, gender transition, with a literature review of published reports of transgender twins. The study found that one third of identical twin pairs in the sample were both transgender: 13 of 39 (33%) monozygotic or identical pairs of assigned males and 8 of 35 (22.8%) pairs of assigned females. Among dizygotic or <b>non-identical</b> <b>twin</b> pairs, there was only 1 of 38 (2.6%) pairs where both twins were trans. The significant percent of identical twin pairs where both twins are trans, and the virtual absence of dizygotic twins (raised {{in the same family}} at the same time, but not genetically identical) where both were trans, if both sets were raised in different families would provide evidence that transgender identity is significantly influenced by genetics.|$|R
