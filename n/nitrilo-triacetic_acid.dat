40|$|A polyhistidine tag (His-tag) {{present on}} Chlorobaculum tepidum {{reaction}} centers (RCs) {{was used to}} immobilize photosynthetic complexes on a silver nanowire (AgNW) modified with nickel-chelating <b>nitrilo-triacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (Ni-NTA). The optical properties of conjugated nanostructures were studied using wide-field and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Plasmonic enhancement of RCs conjugated to AgNWs was observed as their fluorescence intensity dependence on the excitation wavelength does not follow the excitation spectrum of RC complexes in solution. The strongest effect of plasmonic interactions on the emission intensity of RCs coincides with the absorption spectrum of AgNWs and is observed for excitation into the carotenoid absorption. From the absence of fluorescence decay shortening, we attribute the emission enhancement to increase of absorption in RC complexes...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{concept is}} {{introduced}} for the oriented incorporation of membrane proteins into solid supported lipid bilayers. Recombinant cytochrome c oxidase solubilized in detergent was immobilized on a chemically modified gold surface via the affinity of its histidine-tag to a nickel-chelating <b>nitrilo-triacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (NTA) surface. The oriented protein monolayer was reconstituted into the lipid environment by detergent substitution. The individual {{steps of the}} surface modification, including (1) chemical modification of the gold support, (2) adsorption of the protein, and (3) reconstitution of the lipid bilayer, were followed in situ by means of surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and accompanied by normal-mode analysis. The high surface sensitivity of SEIRAS allows for the identification of each chemical reaction process within the monolayer at the molecular level. Finally, full functionality of the surface-tethered cytochrome c oxidase was demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry after binding of the natural electron donor cytochrome c...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main results obtained during the geochemical {{monitoring of the}} fluids and deposits collected from the wells GPK- 4 and GPK- 3 after the four operations of chemical stimulation carried out in May and October 2006, and February 2007, at Soultz-sous-Forêts. During these operations, solutions of Regular Mud Acid (RMA), <b>Nitrilo-Triacetic</b> <b>Acid</b> (NTA) and Organic Clay Acid HT (OCA) were successively injected with fresh water into GPK- 4 whereas only the OCA treatment was used for GPK- 3. This paper shows that these acids have actively reacted with minerals present in the fractured and porous areas of the granite. The injection of the NTA basic solution (pH 12) into GPK- 4 has allowed cleaning this well {{and a part of}} the fractured areas, and recovering significant amounts of drilling wastes (grease, rests of cuttings), rock fragments and hydrothermal deposits. Dissolved and solid Ca-Fe-NTA compounds were also formed. The combination of the RMA, NTA and OCA treatments is possibly at the origin of the significant increase of GPK- 4 productivity. No major improvement in injectivity was observed for the well GPK- 3 for which only the OCA treatment was used...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSurface-enhanced {{infrared}} absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) represents a variation of conventional infrared spectroscopy and exploits the signal enhancement exerted by the plasmon resonance of nano-structured metal thin films. The surface enhancement decays in about 10 nm with {{the distance from the}} surface and is, thus, perfectly suited to selectively probe monolayers of biomembranes. Peculiar to membrane proteins is their vectorial functionality, the probing of which requires proper orientation within the membrane. To this end, the metal surface used in SEIRAS is chemically modified to generate an oriented membrane protein film. Monolayers of uniformly oriented membrane proteins are formed by tethering His-tagged proteins to a nickel <b>nitrilo-triacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (Ni-NTA) modified gold surface and SEIRAS commands molecular sensitivity to probe each step of surface modification. The solid surface used as plasmonic substrate for SEIRAS, can also be employed as an electrode to investigate systems where electron transfer reactions are relevant, like e. g. cytochrome c oxidase or plant-type photosystems. Furthermore, the interaction of these membrane proteins with water-soluble proteins, like cytochrome c or hydrogenase, is studied on the molecular level by SEIRAS. The impact of the membrane potential on protein functionality is verified by monitoring light–dark difference spectra of a monolayer of sensory rhodopsin (SRII) at different applied potentials. It is demonstrated that the interpretations of all of these experiments critically depend on the orientation of the solid-supported membrane protein. Finally, future directions of SEIRAS including cellular systems are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: FTIR in membrane proteins and peptide studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBiotic {{structures}} and {{processes of the}} comparatively large and deep Lake Constance are dominated by pelagic water bodies. Therefore, much more attention has thus far {{been paid to the}} carbon cycle of pelagic habitats as compared to littoral areas. Nevertheless, there is also an ongoing debate on the importance of littoral areas for the carbon cycle in this lake. Although actually existing data are certainly insufficient for a realistic carbon budget, investigations made during the past decade provide at least a rough basis for a first evaluation. Accordingly, littoral areas appear to contribute overproportionally (related to surface) both to production as well as to degradation of organic carbon in the lake. However, the relative effect seems to be more pronounced for heterotrophic activities, mostly due to intense degradation processes in littoral sediments. Related to volume, littoral water bodies exhibited similar or slightly higher microbial activities as compared to epilimnetic pelagic water bodies, while microbial abundances and activities observed for littoral sediments exceeded the corresponding overlying water layers by one to three orders of magnitude. As was confirmed by in situ measurements microbial oxygen consumption frequently exceeded photosynthetic oxygen production in the investigated littoral sites. Moreover, significant qualitative differences between water and sediment were found for the degradation potentials of xenobiotics as was exemplified for phenol and <b>nitrilo-triacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (NTA). Overall, a buffer function at the landwater interface may be ascribed to littoral areas due to which the large pelagic water bodies of the lake may become additionally protected against loads of undesired organic substances due to high littoral degradation capacities...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{catalytic}} system, {{which is}} able to translate a light signal into a chemical output with amplified response, was developed. The overall amplification factor is 15 after a reaction time of 20 min. Although its fidelity in terms of sensitivity and amplification is far from biological models, {{the results show that}} coupling optical and chemical processes allows for the processing and amplification of information. New fluorescent dyes containing alkyne- and azide-groups were synthesized. These compunds allow modular connection to a lot of substrates, such as labelling of proteins. Novel receptor building blocks for different binding motifs have been synthesized. Zn(II) -cyclen complexes for imide groups, bis-Zn(II) -cyclen complexes for phosphate groups, Zn(II) and Cu(II) <b>nitrilo-triacetic</b> <b>acid</b> complexes for N-terminal histidines, guanidines for carboxylic acids and a Zn(II) -porphyrin for non-polar regions on a protein surface. All compounds bear either an azide or an alkyne function and therefore can be connected in any combination using the Cu(I) -catalyzed cycloaddition. A biological relevant pentapeptide, with a histidine and a carboxyl-group as possible binding motifs, has been used as target in a kinetically controlled target guided reaction. In order to identify a bidentate receptor with a high binding constant for the target, combinations of Zn(II) - and Cu(II) -NTA complexes and guanidines have been tested in this reaction. Hit-detection was performed in situ with MS-spectroscopy. Results revealed one possible high affinity receptor out of 12 combinations. Six bidentate receptors have been synthesized and their binding interactions with the peptide target have been investigated with NMR- MS- and fluorescence-spectroscopy. All methods confirmed binding interactions. Results of NMR-investigations allowed a prediction of the structural relations of the formed complex between target and receptor. This prediction was confirmed by Spartan-calculations. Further, the association constant of this complex was determined with fluorescence spectroscopy to be in the micro molar range. However, a definite determination, as well as a comparison of the association constants of these six receptors was not possible. Fluorescent labelled N-terminal histidines, with a dansyl- or a fluorescein group have been synthesized. The binding interactions between the histidine-moiety and heavy metal cations as well as Cu(II) -NTA complexes has been investigated with fluorescence spectroscopy. Results revealed high association constants (> 1011 L 2 /mol 2) of these indicators towards Cu 2 + and Cu(II) -NTA complexes. Therefore, these indicators can be used in very sensitive detection assays for Cu(II) and corresponding complexes. Using the Cu(I) -catalyzed cycloaddition, several bidentate receptor molecules with different binding sites have been synthesized. Combinations of receptor building blocks were: bis-Zn(II) -cyclen-complexes with Zn(II) -NTA-complexes or guanidine compounds and further a Cu(II) -NTA- with a Zn(II) -porphyrin complex. The binding interactions between the bis-Zn(II) -cyclen compounds and phosphorylated peptides were investigated with a fluorescence polarisation assay. Results confirmed a slight increase of the binding affinity (factor 2) compared to a monodentate bis-Zn(II) -cyclen reference compound. The binding interactions between the Zn(II) -porphyrin-Cu(II) -NTA complex and amino acids, a pentapeptide and two His-containing proteins (HEL and Myo) were investigated with fluorescence titrations. Results showed a specific binding of histidine as well as of peptides with an N-terminal His. Binding affinities were in the micromolar range. The binding affinities of the porphyrine receptor towards His-containing proteins revealed to be also in the micromolar range, but unspecific. New 1, 1 �-disubstituted [4, 4 �]-bitriazole compounds have been synthesized using the Cu(I) -catalyzed cycloaddition between 1, 4 -butadiyne and various alkyl- and aryl-triazoles. Ru(II) -complexes of the obtained ligands have been synthesized and their characteristics in the UV- and fluorescence spectrum have been determined...|$|E
