As part of a continuing effort to elucidate the physiologic importance of human alveolar macrophage receptor-mediated binding of neutrophil (leukocyte) elastase, I have studied the binding of leukocyte elastase and two other <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granule</b> glycoproteins, cathepsin G and lactoferrin, to human alveolar macrophages. Saturable binding of all three ligands at 0 degrees C was observed, with equilibrium dissociation constants of 4. 0 x 10 (- 7), 2. 0 x 10 (- 7), and 1. 7 x 10 (- 6) M, respectively. All bound to a similar number (54 - 73 x 10 (6)) of sites per cell. Binding of all three ligands was inhibited by the polysaccharide fucoidin, and extensive cross-inhibition of their binding to macrophages was observed. The results indicate that alveolar macrophages possess a relatively low-affinity, high-volume receptor for a family of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granule</b> glycoproteins, which would be ideally suited for clearing released <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granule</b> contents from the extracellular space in inflamed tissues...|$|R

In this study, we investigated whether treatment with the recently discovered agonist of the Mas-related G-coupled receptor type D (MrgD) alamandine would impact on neutrophil degranulation in vivo and in vitro MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen-week old ApoE-/- mice were fed with a Western-type diet for an additional 11 weeks. After the first 2 -weeks of diet, mice were surgically implanted with a carotid "cast" device that alters the blood shear stress and induces different carotid plaque phenotypes. During the last 4 weeks before euthanasia, mice {{were randomly assigned to}} subcutaneously receive vehicle (NaCl 0. 15 M) or alamandine (24 μg/kg/h) by micropump. For in vitro experiments, neutrophils were obtained after thyoglychollate intraperitoneal injection in ApoE-/- mice RESULTS: Treatment with alamandine was well-tolerated, but failed to affect lipid, macrophage, neutrophil or collagen content within carotid and aortic root plaques. Also, treatment with alamandine did not affect Th cell polarization in lymphoid organs. Conversely, alamandine administration was associated with a reduction of serum levels of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granule</b> enzymes, such as MMP- 9 and MPO as well as MMP- 9 content within aortic root plaques.

Size, shape, density, and content of canine <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granules</b> were determined. Neutrophils obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque sedimentation were homogenized, and granule populations were separated by isopycnic centrifugation on a linear sucrose gradient (rho, 1. 14 to 1. 22 g/ml). The most dense granule population (rho, 1. 197 g/ml) contained all of the myeloperoxidase, beta-glucuronidase, and elastase, more than half of the acid beta-glycerophosphatase, and most of the lysozyme. The population with intermediate density (rho, 1. 179 g/ml) contained lactoferrin, vitamin B 12 -binding protein, and the remainder of the acid beta-glycerophosphatase and lysozyme. The least dense granule population did not contain a major peak of any of the enzymes or binding proteins tested but was distinguished by density and morphology. The size and shape of the granules were determined from scanning electron micrographs and assessment of shape was aided by transmission electron micrographs.

40|$|<b>Neutrophil</b> {{specific}} <b>granule</b> deficiency (SGD) is a congenital disorder {{associated with}} an impaired inflammatory response and a deficiency of several granule proteins. The underlying abnormality causing the deficiencies is unknown. We examined mRNA transcription and protein synthesis of two <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granule</b> proteins, lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase in SGD. Metabolically labeled SGD nucleated marrow cells produced normal amounts of myeloperoxidase, {{but there was no}} detectable synthesis of lactoferrin. Transcripts of the expected size for lactoferrin were detectable in the nucleated marrow cells of two SGD patients, but were markedly diminished in abundance when compared with normal nucleated marrow cell RNA. Because lactoferrin is secreted by the glandular epithelia of several tissues, we also assessed lactoferrin in the nasal secretions of one SGD patient by ELISA and immunoblotting. Nasal secretory lactoferrin was the same molecular weight as neutrophil lactoferrin and was secreted in normal amounts. From these data, we conclude that lactoferrin deficiency in SGD neutrophils is tissue specific and is secondary to an abnormality of RNA production. We speculate that the deficiency of several granule proteins is due to a common defect in regulation of transcription that is responsible for the abnormal myeloid differentiation seen in SGD patients...|$|R

HNP- 2 (peak activity at 5 X 10 (- 9) M) was somewhat less active, yielding 19 +/- 10 % (n = 11). HNP- 3 failed to demonstrate chemotactic activity. Checkerboard analysis of monocyte response to HNP- 1 and HNP- 2 confirmed that their activity was chemotactic rather than chemokinetic.

40|$|Ultrastructural and {{functional}} studies of degranulation responses by human neutrophils {{have suggested that}} microtubules (MTs) {{have a role in}} the intracellular transport of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granules.</b> We have found that granule-MT complexes can be isolated from disrupted taxol-treated (1. 0 microM) neutrophils, visualized by electron microscopy, and quantified in terms of granules per MT length. After incubation of neutrophils with the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), granule-MT complex formation was found to be increased two- to threefold. Enhanced binding of granules to MTs was detectable within 30 s of fMLP stimulation and was dependent on the concentration of fMLP. Incubation of cells with dibutyryl cAMP inhibited this fMLP-stimulated granule-MT complex formation in a dose-responsive fashion. These granule-MT interactions could be reproduced in a cell-free system with <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granules</b> isolated by density gradient centrifugation and MTs polymerized from phosphocellulose-purified tubulin. Furthermore, reconstituted granule-MT interactions were found to be modulated by ATPase inhibitors. Sodium orthovanadate increased granule-MT interactions in a concentration-dependent manner, while AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, and N-ethylmaleimide decreased or eliminated these interactions. In addition, we found that a MT- activated ATPase could be recovered from intact <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granules</b> by salt extraction, and that extracts enriched in this ATPase contained a polypeptide of between 115 and 120 kD which binds ATP and is immunologically related to kinesin. These studies demonstrate that cytoplasmic granules interact with MTs in human neutrophils in a regulated stimulus-responsive manner, and they suggest that such interactions may involve an MT-based, ATPase-dependent, vesicle translocation system as has been demonstrated in other types of cells...|$|E

Lysates of purified (F 0. 1 % eosinophil contamination) neutrophils contained EDN, 112 6 4 ng/ 106 cells, and ECP, 163 6 2 ng/ 106 cells, whereas eosinophil major basic pro-tein (MBP) was not detectable.

Lysozyme was more than 50 % inactivated by one addition of 100 nmol of H 2 O 2 /ml, whereas myeloperoxidase, beta-glucuronidase, gelatinase and collagenase were almost completely inactivated by three additions. Cathepsin G was slightly less susceptible, whereas elastase was extremely resistant to oxidative attack.

The release of myeloperoxidase correlated to an enhanced local release of the neutrophil activating peptide interleukin- 8 (IL- 8). Increased values of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were also found during intestinal perfusion of the patients and correlated with those of IL- 8. The results obtained are compatible with the hypothesis that local mucosal recruitment/activation of neutrophils in ulcerative colitis is mediated by an enhanced IL- 8 synthesis.
