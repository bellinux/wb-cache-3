25|$|The message I {{would give}} to Aikidoka {{in general is}} that what we see today is <b>not,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> humble opinion, the Aikido of the founder.

However, those who seek shall find, and if they are able to step outside of the box and dispassionately explore, they may discover a very simple magical secret!".|$|E

I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times {{to be able to make}} a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people look at it in full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E
500|$|The {{failure of}} the Cray-3 was in large {{part due to the}} {{changing}} political and technical climate. The machine was being designed during the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and ending of the cold war, which led to a massive downsizing in supercomputer purchases. At the same time, the market was increasingly investing in massively parallel (MP or MPP) designs. Cray was critical of this approach, and was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying that MPP systems had not yet proven their supremacy over vector computers, noting the difficulty many users have had programming for large parallel machines. [...] "I don't think they'll ever be universally successful, at least <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lifetime".|$|E

Swift's 1st Cavalry Division to the Admiralty Islands in response to urgent pleas from Brigadier General William C. Chase, who managed to defeat the numerically superior Japanese forces. Krueger was unimpressed with Chase. [...] "His task", Krueger wrote to Swift, [...] "was undoubtedly a difficult one, but did <b>not,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> judgment, warrant the nervousness apparent {{in some of his}} despatches. This, and his failure to obey repeated positive orders to furnish detailed information of his situation and his losses, his closing his radio station during long periods, and his evident ignorance that reinforcements could not reach him by the times he demanded, were not calculated to inspire confidence." ...|$|E

500|$|As Interior Secretary, Lane was {{responsible}} for the territories, and advocated the development of the Alaska Territory. While private railroads had been established there, they were not successful, and he pushed for a government-built railroad, which he believed would lead to large-scale population movement into Alaska. In 1914, Congress passed a bill authorizing construction of the Alaska Railroad, which passed the Senate following a two-day speech in support by Walsh. [...] Lane was the first Interior Secretary to appoint an Alaska resident, John Franklin Alexander Strong, as territorial governor. [...] Secretary Lane's vision for the territory was, [...] "Alaska should <b>not,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> judgment, be regarded as a mere storehouse of materials on which the people of the States may draw. [...] She has the potentialities of a State. And whatever policies may be adopted should look toward an Alaska of homes, of industries, and of an extended commerce." ...|$|E
500|$|Achebe's {{criticism}} {{has become a}} mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay {{was included in the}} 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E
500|$|Albini {{sought to}} produce a record that sounded nothing like Nevermind. [...] He felt the sound of Nevermind was [...] "sort of a {{standard}} hack recording that {{has been turned into}} a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...] That is <b>not,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, very flattering to a rock band." [...] Instead, the intention was to capture a more natural and visceral sound. [...] Albini refused to double-track Cobain's vocals and instead recorded him singing alone in a resonant room. [...] The producer noted the intensity of the singer's vocals on some tracks; he said, [...] "There's a really dry, really loud voice at the end of 'Milk It'... that was also done at the end of 'Rape Me', where [...] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band." [...] Albini achieved the album's sparse drum sound by simply placing several microphones around the room while Dave Grohl performed, picking up the natural reverberation of the room. [...] Albini explained, [...] "If you take a good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit that sounds good acoustically and just record it, you've done your job." ...|$|E

500|$|Avatar {{received}} compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as [...] "the most evocative {{and amazing}} science-fiction movie since Star Wars" [...] and others calling it [...] "audacious and awe inspiring", [...] "master class", and [...] "brilliant". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian {{is also a}} noted fan of the film. On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> top three James Cameron films.... t what point in the film {{did you have any}} doubt {{what was going to happen}} next?". For French filmmaker Luc Besson, Avatar opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series Valérian and Laureline that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film. TIME ranked Avatar number 3 in their list of [...] "The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)" [...] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-TIME 100 list, and IGN listed Avatar as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.|$|E
500|$|Boulton {{helped found}} the New Street Theatre in 1774, and later wrote that having a theatre {{encouraged}} well-to-do visitors to come to Birmingham, and {{to spend more money}} than they would have otherwise. [...] Boulton attempted to have the theatre recognised as a patent theatre with a Royal Patent, entitled to present serious drama; he failed in 1779 but succeeded in 1807. [...] He also supported Birmingham's Oratorio Choral Society, and collaborated with button maker and amateur musical promoter Joseph Moore to put on a series of private concerts in 1799. [...] He maintained a pew at St Paul's Church, Birmingham, a centre of musical excellence. [...] When performances of the Messiah were organised at Westminster Abbey in 1784 in the (incorrect) belief it was the centennial of Handel's birth and the (correct) belief that it was the 25thanniversary of his death, Boulton attended and wrote, [...] "I scarcely know which was grandest, the sounds or the scene. [...] Both was transcendibly fine that it is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power of words to describe. [...] In the grand Halleluja my soul almost ascended from my body." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} from The Slim Shady LP are written from the {{perspective}} of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish and over-the-top depictions of violence, which he refers to as [...] "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff". [...] The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: [...] "Why can't people see that records can be like movies? [...] The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen." [...] Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. [...] Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, [...] "I have a fairly salty relationship with women... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'" [...] Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word [...] "nigga" [...] on the album, with the rapper noting, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> vocabulary." [...] The Slim Shady LP begins with a [...] "Public Service Announcement" [...] introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. [...] Later in the album, a skit entitled [...] "Paul" [...] features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to [...] "tone down" [...] his lyrics.|$|E
