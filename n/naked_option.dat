5000|$|A {{call option}} {{can also be}} sold even if the option writer ("A") doesn't own the stock at all. This is called a [...] "naked call". It is more dangerous, as the option writer can later be forced to buy the stock at the then-current market price, then sell it {{immediately}} to the option owner at the low strike price (if the <b>naked</b> <b>option</b> is ever exercised).|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the {{rationale}} that informed traders use in choosing various financial instruments in order to speculate on the volatility of the underlying asset, here a common stock. Using a continuous-time trading model, we demonstrate {{that the quality of}} the private information regarding the volatility parameter together with the relative transaction costs observed in the various segments of the cash and derivatives markets will determine informed agents’ trading habitats. We further show that in the presence of imprecise volatility signals, only the “most sophisticated” traders (those with highly precise volatility signals) will engage in pure volatility bets. Traders with less precise signals will choose a <b>naked</b> <b>option</b> strategy, while traders at the low spectrum of the precision scale will invest in the underlying stock. Thus, the low volume of pure volatility trades observed by Lakonishok et al. (2007) does not necessarily imply that only fringe traders have chosen to speculate on volatility. Rather, it may suggest that the majority of informed traders do not have precise volatility signals. Informed traders, options, stocks, signal precision, transaction costs, volatility trading...|$|E
50|$|This bike is {{a popular}} choice for its half-fairing, upright seating position, and underseat exhaust. These {{features}} position it between a full supersport and a naked streetfighter (although in Europe and Australia, there is an available <b>naked</b> FZ6N <b>option).</b>|$|R
5000|$|LTCM's {{strategies}} were compared (a {{contrast with the}} market efficiency aphorism {{that there are no}} $100 bills lying on the street, as someone else has already picked them up) to [...] "picking up nickels in front of a bulldozer"—a likely small gain balanced against a small chance of a large loss, like the payouts from selling an out-of-the-money <b>naked</b> call <b>option.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another difference, which {{relates to}} the risk-tolerance of the trader, is that the <b>naked</b> call <b>option</b> in the Twisted Sister results in {{theoretical}} unlimited loss potential on the upside. Meanwhile, losses on the Jade Lizard are limited {{to the difference between}} the strike price of the short put and zero (assuming the underlying trades for nil at the time of option expiration) less the original option premium received for selling the Jade Lizard spread.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1971 by Harold Goldstein with $800. (There was no one {{by the name of}} Samuelson {{associated}} with the firm.) The company grew in 18 months to have over 100 branch offices and 1800 brokers, with annual revenues of $45 million. [...] They were one of the first firms to mass market the selling of <b>naked</b> <b>options</b> and became the nation's largest seller of commodity options. The company operated as a Ponzi scheme with trading gains from the first customers being paid off by funds from later customers. The company told customers that they were hedging the options by trading in commodities when they actually were not. In November 1972, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldstein Samuelson charging fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions in the sale of some options. The suit was settled by a consent decree. However, the company was placed in receivership in February 1973 by the California Corporations Commissioner and filed bankruptcy two months later. [...] Customer losses were estimated at up to $70 million. Goldstein reportedly took millions of dollars in customer funds and deposited them in a Swiss bank. Goldstein was arrested in May 1973 and charged with 15 counts of mail fraud and one count of perjury. He pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud and In March 1974 was sentenced to 18 months in prison.|$|R
40|$|Few papers provide {{research}} about options returns, {{and the few}} available are focused in the analysis {{from the perspective of}} the long side of the option contract, i. e. the buyer that pays the price and her expected and realized option return. The main point of our research work is to provide a simple metric to analyze option returns {{from the perspective of the}} short side of the contract, the seller, where at the time of the sale of <b>naked</b> <b>options,</b> capital is committed in the form of a guarantee or margin (similar to net worth). We estimate realized returns from passive investment strategies, by assuming puts and calls are kept until the expiration of the maturity. To that purpose we develop an appropriate algorithm which is applied on real historic data. Our result is a distribution of realized option returns (ex-ante prices and ex-post cash flows whether the options end up in or out-of-the-money with respect to margin requirements) for the seller point of view, as if the seller was an insurer seeking to calculate how profitable the insurance activity is. From the results we can see that selling puts is more profitable than selling calls, without adjusting for the return of the underlying asset and for the risk free rate of return, something in line with what was expected, but we also find that the risk is approximately the same. We also find that time tends to increase the realized returns, measured everything on annual basis...|$|R
50|$|Other U.S. exchanges, most {{prominently}} the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, employ several competing official market makers in a security. These market makers {{are required to}} maintain two-sided markets during exchange hours and are obligated {{to buy and sell}} at their displayed bids and offers. They typically do not receive the trading advantages a specialist does, but they do get some, such as the ability to naked short a stock, i.e., selling it without borrowing it. In most situations, only official market makers are permitted to engage in naked shorting. Recent changes to the rules have explicitly banned <b>naked</b> shorting by <b>options</b> market makers.|$|R
