25|$|Peach and <b>nectarines</b> are {{the same}} species, {{even though they are}} {{regarded}} commercially as different fruits. In contrast to peaches, whose fruits present the characteristic fuzz on the skin, <b>nectarines</b> are characterized by the absence of fruit-skin trichomes (fuzz-less fruit); genetic studies suggest <b>nectarines</b> are produced due to a recessive allele, whereas peaches are produced from a dominant allele for fuzzy skin.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the {{nectarine}} is unclear; the first recorded mention in English is from 1616, but they had probably been grown much earlier within the native range of the peach {{in central and eastern}} Asia. Although one source states that <b>nectarines</b> were introduced into the United States by David Fairchild of the Department of Agriculture in 1906, a number of colonial-era newspaper articles make reference to <b>nectarines</b> being grown in the United States prior to the Revolutionary War. 28 March 1768 edition of the New York Gazette (p.3), for example, mentions a farm in Jamaica, Long Island, New York, where <b>nectarines</b> were grown.|$|E

25|$|As with peaches, <b>nectarines</b> can {{be white}} or yellow, and {{clingstone}} or freestone. On average, <b>nectarines</b> are slightly smaller and sweeter than peaches, but with much overlap. The lack of skin fuzz can make nectarine skins appear more reddish {{than those of}} peaches, contributing to the fruit's plum-like appearance. The lack of down on nectarines' skin also means their skin is more easily bruised than peaches.|$|E

40|$|To {{study how}} chlorogenic acid affects changes of {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) and the proteins involved in ROS scavenging of <b>nectarine</b> during storage time, the fruits were treated with chlorogenic acid (CHA) then stored at 25 °C for further studies.

The key proteins related the <b>nectarine</b> fruit senescence during storage were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF.

25|$|Being {{a rather}} neutral grape, Australian winemakers first {{approached}} Chardonnay {{in the same}} manner they were making wine from the similarly neutral Sultana grape. Aromatic yeast were added and maceration was extended to get more flavors from skin contact. While the style of Australian Chardonnay is mostly characterized by the mass-produced products of the hot Riverland region, the cooler climates of the Southern Highlands in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have been creating more crisp, less oaked wines with lime notes. In the Cowra region, Chardonnay's citrus notes are emphasized while Hunter Valley examples have more richness and smoky notes. The Adelaide Hills and Yarra Valley produce a more Burgundian style while Mount Barker in the Great Southern wine region of Western Australia produces Chardonnay that more closely resembles those of Chablis. A rare, isolated clone exists in the Mudgee region that locals believe traces its ancestry back to some of the first vines brought to Australia in the 19th century. While the wine made from this clone is not particularly distinguished, it can still be of very good quality. Overall, there has been a shift in style since the 1980s from deep golden, oily wines with melon and butterscotch flavors to lighter, paler Chardonnays with more structure and notes of white peaches and <b>nectarines.</b> Sparkling wines from Chardonnay are produced in the cool regions of Geelong, Adelaide Hills, Macedon Ranges and Tasmania.|$|E
