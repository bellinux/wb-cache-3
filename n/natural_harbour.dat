5|$|Plymouth {{lies between}} the River Plym {{to the east}} and the River Tamar to the west; both rivers flow into the <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> of Plymouth Sound. Since 1967, the unitary {{authority}} of Plymouth has included the, once independent, towns of Plympton and Plymstock which lie along the east of the River Plym. The River Tamar forms the county boundary between Devon and Cornwall and its estuary forms the Hamoaze on which is sited Devonport Dockyard.|$|E
5|$|The area's {{location}} with a <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> {{near the}} Akashi Strait which links Osaka Bay and the Seto inland sea {{has been an}} important location throughout the history of Japan. The capital of Japan was located in the area for a short period in the 12th century. Today the area is an important manufacturing zone.|$|E
5|$|Before the Suez Canal {{was opened}} in 1869, the Indonesian {{archipelago}} was reached via the Sunda Strait from Africa. From the Suez Canal, {{the route to}} Indonesia is shorter via the Malacca Strait. Due to its <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> with relatively deep and well sheltered water, the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay. In 1883, Sabang quay was opened for ships to dock by the Atjeh Associate. At first, the harbour {{was intended as a}} coal station for the Dutch navy, but later also served merchant vessels and for the transfer of export goods from northern Sumatra.|$|E

5|$|Monaco's history predates the Roman {{occupation}} of AD122. Its large <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> ensured {{a steady stream}} of visitors from Byblos, Tyre, and Sidon. Later the Phoenicians came to trade silk, oil, and spices with the natives. It was the Phoenicians who introduced to this area of the Mediterranean their god Melkart, later known by the Romans as Hercules Monoikos. It was after this god that the Romans renamed the area Portus Hercules Moneici, which has evolved to the present name of Monaco.|$|E
5|$|Poole is {{a tourist}} resort, {{attracting}} visitors with its large <b>natural</b> <b>harbour,</b> history, the Lighthouse arts centre and Blue Flag beaches. The town has a commercial port with cross-Channel {{freight and passenger}} ferry services. The headquarters of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are in Poole, and the Royal Marines have a base in the town's harbour. Despite their names, Poole {{is the home of}} The Arts University Bournemouth, the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and a significant part of Bournemouth University.|$|E
5|$|The Rath is a {{landscaped}} {{street on}} high ground, with panoramic {{views of the}} Haven. The land {{was used in the}} 18th century as a gun battery, and its eastern edge was the site of the Royalist fort constructed by Charles I known as Pill Fort. In the 1930s it became the home of an outdoor swimming pool, which was converted into a water gardens in 1990. Milford Haven Waterway is the <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> on which the town stands and from which the town takes its name.|$|E

5|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> of the Haven {{was known}} as a safe port and was {{exploited}} for several historical military operations throughout the second millennium. Campaigns conducted from the Haven included part of Henry II's Invasion of Ireland in 1171 and Cromwell's own attack on Ireland in 1649, while forces which have disembarked at the point include Jean II de Rieux's 1405 reinforcement of the Glyndŵr Rising. In 1485, the future Henry VII landed close to his birthplace in Mill Bay before marching on to England.|$|E
5|$|During Darwin's lifetime, many {{geographical}} {{features were}} given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the Beagle Channel was named Darwin Sound by Robert FitzRoy after Darwin's prompt action, {{along with two}} or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing glacier caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats, and the nearby Mount Darwin in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday. When the Beagle was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend John Lort Stokes sighted a <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> which the ship's captain Wickham named Port Darwin: a nearby settlement was renamed Darwin in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{after an}} {{additional}} British {{request for assistance}} on 6 August 1914, the Australian government hurriedly prepared another expeditionary force to destroy the German wireless stations at Yap in the Caroline Islands, Nauru, and Rabaul in New Britain. As with the New Zealand military operation against German Samoa, which was completed in late August, the targets were strategically important wireless stations used by the German East Asiatic Squadron, {{under the command of}} Count Maximilian von Spee. The existence of the powerful German fleet—including the modern cruisers SMS Scharnhorst and SMS Gneisenau—in the Pacific at the outbreak of the war worried the British Admiralty and the Australian government, and the elimination of its radio network was a key priority. Although the location of the German fleet was unknown, it was suspected they may have been hiding in the excellent <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> at Rabaul.|$|E

50|$|An {{anchorage}} is only safe if ships anchored {{there are}} {{protected from the}} force of high winds and powerful waves by some large underwater barrier which they can shelter behind. <b>Natural</b> <b>harbours</b> are formed by such barriers as headlands or reefs. Artificial harbours can be created {{with the help of}} breakwaters. Mobile harbours, such as the D-Day Mulberry harbours, were floated into position and acted as breakwaters. Some <b>natural</b> <b>harbours,</b> such as those in Plymouth Sound, Portland Harbour and Cherbourg, have been enhanced or extended by breakwaters made of rock.|$|R
50|$|Common sense {{seamanship}} implies {{to avoid}} open and treacherous seas {{unless they are}} unavoidable. Moreover, appropriate <b>natural</b> <b>harbours</b> would be required for the ships. This provides possible constraints to the routes taken.|$|R
5|$|The Portuguese were {{actively}} involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay. They called the islands by various names, which finally took the written form Bombaim. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael's Church at Mahim, St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri, St. Andrew's Church at Bandra, and Gloria Church at Byculla. The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, Castella de Aguada (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The British were in constant struggle with the Portuguese vying for hegemony over Bombay, as they recognized its strategic <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> and its natural isolation from land-attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of an island used in this list {{is that it is}} 'land that is surrounded by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways'. There are four islands joined to the Orkney Mainland by a series of causeways known as the Churchill Barriers. They are South Ronaldsay, Burray, Lamb Holm and Glims Holm. In addition, Hunda is connected to Burray by a causeway. The barriers were constructed by Italian prisoners-of-war as a means of preventing enemy submarine access to the vast <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> of Scapa Flow after the sinking of HMS Royal Oak by a German U-boat in 1939 with the loss of 883 lives. The Italian prisoners constructed a small Roman Catholic chapel on Lamb Holm as a place of worship during their incarceration.|$|E
5|$|The {{features}} of the <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> around Wadamisaki peninsula has meant the port in Hyogo {{has been an important}} gateway to the Seto inland sea since the 8th century Nara period. In the 12th century, {{in the latter part of}} the Heian period, Taira no Kiyomori recognized the strategic benefit of the location and developed the harbor, including the building of , a man-made island completed in 1173 and described as 37 hectares in size in The Tale of the Heike. Kiyomori, the de facto ruler of Japan between 1160 and 1180, moved his official residence to Fukuhara, in what is modern-day Hyogo. Fukuhara became the capital of Japan for a brief period near the end of Kiyomori's rule. A monument erected shortly after his death, the Kiyomori-zuka, stands in the gardens of a shrine opposite Kiyomori Bridge, also named in his honour.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Aarhus {{began as a}} {{fortified}} Viking settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the bishopric seated here from at least 948. The city was founded on the northern shores of a fjord at a <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products. Market town privileges were granted in 1441, but growth stagnated in the 17thcentury as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish Wars. In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the Schleswig Wars but avoided destruction. As the industrial revolution took hold, the city grew to become the second-largest in the country by the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} time {{anything}} other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron, and La Salle's voyage was thus germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. Located in the <b>natural</b> <b>harbour,</b> the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products. The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas, together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because Oil Springs {{was the first}} place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil, the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} history of {{habitation}} in the area is limited, the Romans called the settlement Caletum. Julius Caesar mustered 800 to 1,000 sailing boats, five legions and some 2,000 horses at Calais due to its strategic position to attack Britannia. At some time prior to the 10th century, {{it would have been a}} Flemish speaking fishing village on a sandy beach backed by pebbles and a creek, with a <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> located at the western edge of the early medieval estuary of the River Aa. As the pebble and sand ridge extended eastward from Calais, the haven behind it developed into fen, as the estuary progressively filled with silt and peat. Subsequently, canals were cut between Saint-Omer, the trading centre formerly at the head of the estuary, and three places to the west, centre and east on the newly formed coast: respectively Calais, Gravelines and Dunkirk. Calais was improved by the Count of Flanders in 997 and fortified by the Count of Boulogne in 1224.|$|E

5|$|The path {{continues}} north {{beside the}} Torridge Estuary, in places following {{the route of}} the Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway, past Northam to Appledore and around the promontory past the Shell middens and a submerged forest, that dates from the Mesolithic period, off the pebble ridge to Westward Ho! (this is the only placename in the UK which includes an exclamation mark). The path then follows the coast around Clovelly Bay where several small villages including Abbotsham lie inland, because of the cliffs. The path passes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Peppercombe Castle and the village of Bucks Mills. Clovelly itself is a historic village with a small <b>natural</b> <b>harbour.</b> The path continues past the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Windbury Head to Hartland Point and Hartland Quay. Hartland Point features a lighthouse and radar tower, and marks the western limit (on the English side) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean to the west. There is a winter helicopter service from Hartland Point to Lundy, which is visible from many points along the path between Welcombe and the Cornish border.|$|E
5|$|With Île Bourbon secured in July 1810, the British now {{occupied}} a large fortified island base within easy sailing distance of Isle de France. Even before Île Bourbon was completely in British hands, Rowley had detached HMS Sirius from the invasion squadron with orders {{to restore the}} blockade of Isle de France. Shortly afterwards, Siriuss captain Samuel Pym led his men in a raid on a coastal vessel moored off the southern side of the island. Two days after this successful operation, reinforcements arrived {{in the form of}} the frigates HMS Iphigenia, HMS Nereide and the small brig HMS Staunch. Nereide carried 100 specially selected soldiers from the 69th and 33rd Regiments and some artillerymen from the garrison at Madras, to be used in storming and garrisoning offshore islands, beginning with Île de la Passe off Grand Port, a well defended islet that protected a <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> on the southeastern shore. These fortified islands could be used to block entry to the ports of Isle de France and thus trap Hamelin's squadron.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad Shah I retaliated {{by sending}} his son Jafar Khan to {{recapture}} the lost territory. Jafar emerged victorious in the battle fought with Ahmad Shah I Wali. In 1431, Mahim was recaptured by the Sultanate of Gujarat. The Sultanate's patronage led {{to the construction of}} many mosques, prominent being the Haji Ali Dargah in Mahim, built in honour the Muslim saint Haji Ali in 1431. After the death of Kutb Khan, the Gujarat commandant of Mahim, Ahmad Shah I Wali again despatched a large army to capture Mahim. Ahmad Shah I responded with a large army and navy under Jafar Khan leading to the defeat of Ahmad Shah I Wali. During 1491–1494, the islands suffered sea piracies from Bahadur Khan Gilani, a nobleman of the Bahamani Sultanate. After the end of the Bahamani Sultanate, Bahadur Khan Gilani and Mahmud Gavan (1482–1518) broke out in rebellion at the port of Dabhol and conquered the islands along with the whole of Konkan. Portuguese explorer Francisco de Almeida's ship sailed into the deep <b>natural</b> <b>harbour</b> of the island in 1508, and he called it Bom baía (Good Bay). However, the Portuguese paid their first visit to the islands on 21 January 1509, when they landed at Mahim after capturing a Gujarat barge in the Mahim creek. After a series of attacks by the Gujarat Sultanate, the islands were recaptured by Sultan Bahadur Shah.|$|E
