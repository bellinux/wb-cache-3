After Swedish conquest of most of Livonia in the 1620s, the sejmiks were moved to Dyneburg.

A letter from the defeated Tz'utujil Maya <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> Santiago Atitlán to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.|$|E
5|$|As was customary, {{the treaty}} {{would have to}} be {{approved}} by the nobles and knights of both lands. The meeting between the <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13–15 September 1284 in the town of Nakło, where they confirmed the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland was not the only decision made by Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia to the powerful witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking {{by the standards of the}} period. He had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his generosity to his household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was not prepared for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate {{it was determined that}} the entire <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E
5|$|In August 1562, David Lindsay {{received}} Mary, Queen of Scots, at Edzell. The Queen {{was on a}} Royal progress, {{with the}} aim of subduing the rebellious Earl of Huntly, and spent two nights at Edzell. During her stay she convened a meeting of the Privy Council, attended by the <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> Scotland. Her son, King James VI, visited Edzell twice; on 28 June 1580, and in August 1589.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July Warwick had to {{withdraw}} from government to his estates on account of illness. When he died on 12 August 1315, political leadership was soon left almost entirely to Lancaster. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham reported rumours that the king had had Warwick poisoned. He was buried at Bordesley Abbey in Worcestershire, an establishment to which his family had been benefactors. In value, his possessions were second only {{to those of the}} earl of Lancaster among the <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> England.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1399, Jadwiga {{gave birth}} to a {{daughter}}, baptised Elizabeth Bonifacia, but within a month the mother and daughter died, leaving Władysław sole ruler of the Kingdom of Poland and without an heir nor much legitimacy to rule the kingdom. Jadwiga's death undermined Władysław's right to the throne, and as a result old conflicts between the <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> Lesser Poland, generally sympathetic to Władysław, and the gentry of Greater Poland began to surface. In 1402, Władysław answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying Anna of Celje, a granddaughter of Casimir III of Poland, a political match that re-legitimised his reign.|$|E
5|$|The lord of Castle Baynard {{appears to}} have had held a special place among the <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> London.

5|$|The {{suppression}} of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt signalled {{the end of}} the power of the tribal <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> Iraq, which henceforth came under the direct control of the Umayyad regime's staunchly loyal Syrian troops. Later revolts, under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab and Zayd ibn Ali, also failed, and it was not until the success of the Abbasid Revolution that the Syrian dominance of Iraq was broken.|$|E
5|$|A new {{aristocracy}} {{known as}} the Kazoku was established. It merged the ancient court <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> the Heian period, the Kuge, and the former Daimyo, feudal lords subordinate to the Shogun. It also established the Imperial Diet, consisting of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers. Members of the House of Peers were {{made up of the}} Imperial Family, the Kazoku, and those nominated by the Emperor, while members of the House of Representatives were elected by direct male suffrage. Despite clear distinctions between powers of the executive branch and the Emperor in the Meiji Constitution, ambiguity and contradictions in the Constitution eventually led to a political crisis. It also devalued the notion of civilian control over the military, which meant that the military could develop and exercise a great influence on politics.|$|E
5|$|During the Georgian era Bath became fashionable, and {{the architects}} John Wood, the Elder, and his son, John Wood the Younger, laid out new areas of housing for {{residents}} and visitors. Assembly rooms {{had been built}} early in the 18th century, but a new venue for balls, concerts and gambling was envisaged in the area between Queen Square, The Circus and the Royal Crescent. Robert Adam submitted a proposal that was rejected as too expensive. John Wood, the Younger raised funding through a Tontine and construction started in 1769. The New or Upper Assembly Rooms opened with a grand ball in 1771 and became the hub of fashionable society, being frequented by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, along with the <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> the time.|$|E

50|$|Someone {{belongs to}} the Dutch nobility when either they have been granted nobility by Royal Decree, or when their father belonged to the nobility.

Someone can be granted <b>nobility</b> through acknowledgement <b>of</b> indigenous titles <b>of</b> <b>nobility</b> existing before 1795, through incorporation of foreign titles <b>of</b> <b>nobility,</b> or through elevation, in which a new title <b>of</b> <b>nobility</b> is created. There are seven titles <b>of</b> <b>nobility.</b> In order <b>of</b> precedence, these are Prince, Duke, Marquis, Count, Viscount, Baron and Knight. People in the nobility who have not been granted a title carry the predicate Jonkheer.|$|R

5|$|Gloucester's {{political}} importance did not {{end with}} his death; his disappearance from the political scene had immediate consequences. In his Welsh lordship of Glamorgan, the uncertain situation caused by his death caused a short-lived rebellion in 1316. In Ireland, where he also held large possessions, the power vacuum he left behind facilitated the 1315 invasion by Robert the Bruce's brother Edward. The greatest consequences, however, resulted from {{the division of the}} de Clare estates. In 1308, Gilbert de Clare had married Maud (or Matilda) de Burgh, the daughter of Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster. The couple left no surviving issue, so his death marked the end of the great de Clare family. The family lands were worth as much as £6,000, second only to those of the Earl of Lancaster among the <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> the realm.|$|E
5|$|Having gained {{prestige}} {{from the}} constructions in the Loggia, Cairano {{received at least}} two commissions from the <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> Brescia. Involved in {{the leadership of the}} new administration, they were certainly aware of his ability. There are papers dating back to 1496 that document Cairano's commission for the Tomb of Gaspare Brunelli, which, in 1500, was placed in the Brunelli chapel within the Church of St Francis. During the same period, the Caprioli family commissioned the tomb of Luigi Caprioli to be placed within their chapel in the church of San Giorgio, probably together with other sculptures, made probably in collaboration with the Sanmicheli workshop, to which is attributed the marble jamb decorated with candelabras.|$|E
5|$|John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian {{military}} leader during the Wars of the Roses. The Clifford family {{was one of}} the most prominent families among the northern English <b>nobility</b> <b>of</b> the fifteenth century; and by the marriages of his sisters John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the earls of Devon. He was orphaned at about twenty years of age when his father was slain at the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of St Albans in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of King Henry VI, who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.|$|E
