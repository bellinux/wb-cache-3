40|$|All African {{societies}} are multilingingual. Yet most {{children do not}} enjoy the normality of going to school in their mother tongue or a familiar language, or if they do, {{it is not for}} long. The development of African languages in high status functions is held back by the hegemonic status of English or another ex-colonial language, 1 brought about by colonial conquest and post-colonial language policies. African languages have extremely low status, particularly as languages in print. This is evidenced by the kind of print we see used and displayed even in urban but particularly in rural settings. For instance, most signs in African languages are ones which make sure that negative messages are understood, such as NO JOBS, <b>NO</b> <b>DUMPING,</b> DANGER, TRESSPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED; there is only one African language daily newspaper in the country (in isiZulu); none of the food or other packaging uses African language print, and so on. Yet the power and status functions of language are most clearly marked in printed form. In Decolonising the Mind Ngugi wa Thiong ‘o (1993 : 17) makes the fundamental point that while the dislocation of children from their mother tongues in school could not actually destroy the vitality of oral language, it had serious negative impacts on literacy development...|$|E
40|$|Field and {{experimental}} {{observations on the}} European ichneumonid Sphinctus serotinus as a koinobiont ectoparasitoid of the limacodid moth Apoda limacodes are recorded. The egg is anchored into the extremely thick cuticle of its host but not deeply enough {{so that it would}} survive host ecdysis. That may explain the late summer-early autumn flight time of the parasitoid, when practically all host larvae that remain are in their final instar, though avoiding competition from other parasitoids may also play a part. The tough cuticle of the host probably also underlies the lack of host feeding by the adult parasitoid. There is no ability to avoid superparasitism, though self-superparasitism is limited by post-oviposition flight to leave the host. The egg can be laid with its chorion still uncoloured when hosts are in plentiful supply, but such eggs become the usual pale brown colour within a short time. <b>No</b> <b>dumping</b> of eggs in the absence of hosts occurs. The egg normally doesn’t hatch until after the host has prepared its cocoon, and the parasitoid larva, still anchored in the eggshell at first, feeds very slowly through the winter and early summer on the prepupal host. Development through the prepupal and pupal stages within the host cocoon similarly proceed slowly, with no evident diapause at any stage. The various stages of the life cycle are illustrated photographically...|$|E

40|$|Haloperidol decafloate (HPL-D) is {{a useful}} depot {{neuroleptic}} on several counts: it has a duration of action of 4 - 6 weeks, there is <b>no</b> <b>dumping</b> effect associated with its administration, and the adverse effects milligram for milligram are fewer and milder than those observed with the oral form of haloperidol (Beresford and Ward, 1987, Glazer and Kane, 1992). HPL-D requires to be administered by deep intramuscular injection; subcutaneous administration {{may be associated with}} the development of injection site reactions (Hamann et al., 1990). In low doses, intramuscular administration into the deltoid is feasible and convenient. In high doses, however, the larger volume of drug to be administered necessitates injection into the gluteus. This is where the problem arises. Disposable syringes in India usually have an approximately one inch needle length. Disposable 21 gauge needles, required for use with HPL-D, are generally of the same length. Consttutional and behavioural factors, more in women than in men, usually result in the presence of gluteal fat that is over an inch or two in thickness in the average Indian patient. In consequence, it is likely that despite gluteal compression during injection, few Indian patients truly receive deep intramuscular HPL-D when the drug is injected into the buttock, in fact, it is possible that many patients are actually receiving the injection in subcutaneous fat. No reports of injection site reaction with HPL-D have appeared in the Indian scientific press. Is this because of under-reporting or might subcutaneous HPL-D be less harmful than earlier believed?

40|$|ObjectiveMany {{patients}} with cancer have limited esophageal reconstruction options when the stomach is unavailable {{as a replacement}} conduit or when long-segment discontinuity exists. Jejunum {{has been used as}} an alternative conduit, both as a pedicled or free flap interposition; however, reports of this are usually limited to short-segment repairs. Microvascular augmentation of a pedicled jejunal flap allows creation of a longer conduit, making it possible to replace the entire esophagus with jejunum. Few reports describe this technique in {{patients with}} cancer. We report our initial experience with “supercharged” pedicled jejunum as an alternative conduit for total esophageal reconstruction. MethodsReview of a prospectively collected departmental database was performed to identify those patients who underwent total esophageal reconstruction with supercharged pedicled jejunum. Data regarding their perioperative course and postoperative function were gathered from the prospectively collected clinical data, review of hospital records, and patient interviews. ResultsTotal esophageal reconstruction with supercharged pedicled jejunum was attempted in 26 patients (age range, 37 - 74 years) between March 2000 and April 2004. Twenty-four of 26 patients were ultimately discharged with an intact supercharged pedicled jejunum flap, for an overall success rate of 92. 3 %. One patient experienced intraoperative flap loss caused by technical difficulties harvesting the flap and never had the flap interposed. One other flap loss occurred in the early postoperative period in a patient who had multisystem organ failure after a prolonged reconstruction. Cervical anastomotic leaks occurred in 19. 2 % (5 / 26) of the patients. Two midconduit leaks occurred that were suspicious for iatrogenic perforation from nasogastric tube placement; one required reoperation. One additional early reoperation was performed for cecal ischemia. There were no mortalities. Functional results were available in 95. 4 % (21 / 22) of the patients receiving supercharged pedicled jejunum who survived at least 6 months after reconstruction. At the time of follow-up, 95 % (20 / 21) of the patients were tolerating regular diet, and 76. 2 % (16 / 21) did not require any supplemental alimentation. Ninety-five percent (20 / 21) of the patients were free from reflux symptoms, and 80. 9 % (17 / 21) had <b>no</b> <b>dumping</b> symptoms. Only 1 patient required dilation of a midconduit stricture. One patient required late reoperation for conduit redundancy. ConclusionsSupercharged pedicled jejunum is a suitable alternative conduit for total esophageal replacement in patients with cancer with otherwise limited reconstructive options. Functional outcomes are excellent, despite the severity of disease and technical challenges in this patient population...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is now {{a common}} {{treatment}} for obesity with well-documented effects on long-term weight reduction, health-related quality of life, obesity-related morbidity and mortality. There {{is a need for}} a better understanding of changes in dietary intake and meal-related symptoms after RYGB. The aim of this thesis was to study these phenomena and to improve current treatment protocols. Methods: Forty-three adults (31 women, 12 men; mean age 42. 6 years, mean BMI 44. 5 kg/m²) were followed in a longitudinal cohort study and examined preoperatively and at six weeks, one and two years after surgery (Paper I and II). They completed the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R 21) on attitudes to food, and questionnaires on dietary intake and meal pattern; in addition, a test meal ad libitum was administered and portion size and eating rate were assessed. A Dumping Symptom Rating Scale (DSRS) was developed and evaluated for its reliability and construct validity over two years on 124 respondents of whom 43 adults from Paper I and II and in addition 81 adolescents (Paper III). Thirty-one non-obese subjects served as reference group (Paper II and III). Another eight RYGB patients with hypoglycemia -like symptoms and eight patients with no hypoglycemia -like symptoms ingested a liquid carbohydrate meal. Insulin, plasma glucose, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) and glucagon were measured intermittently up to 180 minutes after the meal. Results: The dietary questionnaire showed decreased energy intake, Food weight fell initially but was not lower two years after surgery resulting in a significantly decreased dietary energy density at two years after surgery. The meal test showed decreased portion size despite meal duration remaining constant, resulting in a reduced eating rate. Number of meals increased, with more meals in the mornings. TFEQ-R 21 revealed decreased emotional and uncontrolled eating, whereas there was a transient increase in cognitive restraint six weeks after surgery. Most subjects reported mild or <b>no</b> <b>dumping</b> symptoms, although 6 – 12 % had persistent problems – in particular, postprandial fatigue, need to lie down, nausea, and feeling faint – two years after surgery. The result of the validation process of DSRS was satisfactory overall. The patients with a history of hypoglycemia-like symptoms after RYGB demonstrated neither lower plasma glucose nor greater insulin response compared to asymptomatic patients in response to a liquid carbohydrate meal, but they perceived more symptoms. Conclusion: After RYGB, patients displayed major changes in eating behavior and meal pattern, suggesting that RYGB drives the individual to an eating behavior that promotes weight loss. Despite lack of association between the reduction in dietary energy density and percentage weight loss, changes in food choice were overall nutritionally beneficial. Dumping symptoms were rarely evident, but some patients reported persistent problems up to two years after surgery. DSRS is a reliable clinical screening instrument to identify patients with pronounced dumping symptoms. The mechanisms of action behind the origin of hypoglycemia-like symptoms remain obscure and need further exploration...|$|E
40|$|In superconducting magnets {{with large}} energies, quench {{protection}} heaters (QPHs) {{are necessary to}} prevent localized quenches. If the full energy of a magnet is dissipated into a small volume, the magnet may suffer irreparable damage. The QPHs are used to heat {{the surface of the}} coil to increase the volume of the normal zone so the heat is dissipated over a larger area. As a result, the maximum temperature after a quench will be reduced. The KEK low- beta quadrupole magnets for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have four QPHs on the outer surface of the coil. Several aspects of the performance of the QPHs for the KEK-LHC insertion quadrupole magnets have been studied. The time from firing the QPHs to quench vs. QPH-input-energy, the effects of varying quench-detection time on the magnet power supply, and the results of a normal training quench with <b>no</b> <b>dump</b> resistor and using the QPHs are reported and compared to a quench simulation code.

40|$|A dumping {{investigation}} involves comparing {{export prices}} with a “normal value” loosely {{defined as the}} price in the exporter’s domestic market observed {{in the course of}} normal trade. However, domestic sales with prices below production costs are excluded from the computation of a normal value; thus increasing the probability products with cyclical prices will get caught with positive dumping margins although there are <b>no</b> intentions to <b>dump.</b> The objective of the paper is to illustrate how price cycles impact the magnitude of estimated dumping margins. The empirical analysis focuses on Canadian hog exports to the U. S. and U. S. potato exports to Canada. The period and amplitude of each price cycles are estimated. The analysis starts with the assumption that export and domestic prices are equal so <b>no</b> true <b>dumping</b> occurs. Margins are then calculated based on rules that exclude below cost sales. The resulting average dumping margins for Canadian hogs and U. S. potato exports are respectively 11. 5 and 5. 9 percent.
