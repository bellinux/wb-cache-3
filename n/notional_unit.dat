5000|$|In 538/539, Emperor Justinian I {{introduced}} further {{changes to}} the 40-nummi follis, raising its weight to 25 grams. It was reduced again to 22.5 grams in 541/542, and further reductions followed until the century's end. At this time, a new 30-nummi coin (marked with [...] "Λ" [...] or [...] "XXX") was introduced, but the single follis had ceased to be struck at Constantinople. It survived in the Exarchate of Carthage well into the 7th century however. During the 7th century, the successive military and financial crises led to increased reduction in the weight and a marked deterioration {{of the quality of}} bronze coinage; by the time of Emperor Constans II (r. 641-668), a follis weighed only 3 grams. Consequently, the denominations lower than the semifollis were practically unmintable and abandoned. Thereafter, the term nummus remained in use as a <b>notional</b> <b>unit</b> for 1⁄6,000 of the solidus, and in colloquial usage for [...] "small change".|$|E
40|$|If {{emerging}} markets are {{to achieve their}} objective of joining the ranks of industrialized, developed countries, they must use their economic and political influence to support radical change in the international financial system. This working paper recommends John Maynard Keynes's "clearing union" as a blueprint for reform of the international financial architecture that could address emerging market grievances more effectively than current approaches. Keynes's proposal for the postwar international system sought to remedy {{some of the same}} problems currently facing emerging market economies. It was {{based on the idea that}} financial stability was predicated on a balance between imports and exports over time, with any divergence from balance providing automatic financing of the debit countries by the creditor countries via a global clearinghouse or settlement system for trade and payments on current account. This eliminated national currency payments for imports and exports; countries received credits or debits in a <b>notional</b> <b>unit</b> of account fixed to national currency. Since the unit of account could not be traded, bought, or sold, it would not be an international reserve currency. The credits with the clearinghouse could only be used to offset debits by buying imports, and if not used for this purpose they would eventually be extinguished; hence the burden of adjustment would be shared equally - credit generated by surpluses would have to be used to buy imports from the countries with debit balances. Emerging market economies could improve upon current schemes for regionally governed financial institutions by using this proposal as a template for the creation of regional clearing unions using a <b>notional</b> <b>unit</b> of account...|$|E
40|$|To the Editor—Law and Yip’s 1 {{attempt to}} model the {{sustainability}} of the proposed Health Protection Account (HPA) is a useful first step in debating Hong Kong’s health financing options, given the relatively muted evidence-based discussion of the topic thus far. However, we have found several methodological inconsistencies and queries that should be further addressed. First, {{there appears to be}} some confusion over the economic concepts of quantity and price in Table 1. The growth projection of the <b>notional</b> <b>unit</b> costs of hospitalisa-tion (HK$ 3622) and specialist consultation (HK$ 549) should not be based on the aggregate, unadjusted medical expenditure annual growth rate. More importantly, the 5 % annual expenditure growth rate was derived from the period 1993 to 2000, during which the Hospital Authorit...|$|E
2500|$|The first Carolingian-style pennies were {{introduced}} by King Offa of Mercia (. 757–796), modeled on Pepin's system.

Near {{the end of}} his reign, Offa minted his coins in imitation of Charlemagne's reformed pennies. Offa's coins were imitated by East Anglia, Kent, Wessex and Northumbria, as well as by two Archbishops of Canterbury. As in the Frankish Empire, all these pennies notionally composed shillings ( [...] ; [...] ) and pounds ( [...] ; [...] ) but during this period neither larger unit was minted. Instead, they functioned only as <b>notional</b> <b>units</b> of account. (For instance, a [...] "shilling" [...] or [...] "solidus" [...] of grain was a measure equivalent to the amount of grain that 12 pennies could purchase.) English currency was notionally [...]925-fine sterling silver at the time of Henry II, but the weight and value of the silver penny steadily declined from 1300 onwards.|$|R

A {{variety of}} local systems was standardized, with minor mints being closed, royal {{control over the}} rest strengthened, and purity increased. In place of the gold Roman and Byzantine solidus then common, he established a system based on a new [...]940-fine silver penny (denarius; denier) weighing 1/240 of a pound ( [...] , , or [...] ). (The Carolingian pound {{seems to have been}} about 489.5 grams, making each penny about 2 grams.) As the debased solidus was then roughly equivalent to 11 of these pennies, the shilling ( [...] ; [...] ) was established at that value, making it 1/22 of the silver pound. This was later adjusted to 12 and 1/20, respectively. During the Carolingian period, however, neither shillings or pounds were minted, being instead used as <b>notional</b> <b>units</b> of account. (For instance, a [...] "shilling" [...] or [...] "solidus" [...] of grain was a measure equivalent to the amount of grain that 12 pennies could purchase.) Despite the purity and quality of the new pennies, however, they were repeatedly rejected by traders throughout the Carolingian period in favor of the gold coins used elsewhere, a situation that led to repeated legislation against such refusal to accept the king's currency.|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{market economies}} are taking an ill-targeted {{and far too}} limited {{approach}} to addressing their ongoing problems with the international financial system, according to Senior Scholar Jan Kregel. In this policy brief, he explains why only a wholesale reform of the international financial architecture can adequately address these countries' concerns. As a blueprint for reform, Kregel recommends a radical proposal advanced in the 1940 s, most notably by John Maynard Keynes. Keynes {{was among those who}} were developing proposals for shaping the international financial system in the immediate postwar period. His clearing union plan, itself inspired by Hjalmar Schacht's system of bilateral clearing agreements, would have effectively eliminated the need for an international reserve currency. Under Keynes's clearing union, trade and other international payments would be automatically facilitated through a global clearinghouse, using debits and credits denominated in a <b>notional</b> <b>unit</b> of account. The unit of account would have a fixed conversion rate to national currencies and could not be bought, sold, or traded - meaning no market for foreign currency would be required. Clearinghouse credits could only be used to offset debits by buying imports, and if not used within a specified period of time, the credits would be extinguished, giving export surplus countries an incentive to spend them. As Kregel points out, this would help support global demand and enable a shared adjustment burden. [ [...] . ...|$|E

50|$|Levered ETFs, notably inverse {{exchange-traded}} funds, {{have the}} unusual property that their notional changes every day: {{this is because}} they pay the compounded daily return, so {{it is as if}} one were re-investing each day's earnings at the new daily price: if one has an inverse ETF in an asset that goes down, one has more money, which one uses to short a cheaper asset, hence one's <b>unit</b> <b>notional</b> goes up, and conversely if the asset has gone up in value.

40|$|I. Current {{international}} {{standards for the}} statistical treatment of the issue In many cases, a business will set up a separate legal entity in order to undertake operations in an economy outside its home economy. However, where a separate entity is not created in the outside economy, but the operations are substantial, a <b>notional</b> institutional <b>unit</b> resident in that economy may be identified for statistical purposes. In this paper, such a unit is called a “branch. ” 1 Although a branch is not a legal entity, it behaves in many ways as if it were, and treating it as a unit can allow statistics to give a better portrayal of the economic reality, see 1993 SNA paras. 4. 49 - 52. (An issues paper for DITEG deals with the valuation of branches, so this paper is only concerned with the units and residence issues.)
