40|$|Solid state {{fermentation}} (SSF) {{deals with}} the cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms on the surface or inside porous solid matrices. These solid matrices can act as substrates or as inert supports and absorb {{the components of the}} culture medium without liquid draining. Filamentous fungi (#Aspergillus$, #Claviceps$, #Penicillium$, #Rhisopus$, #Trichoderma$) are the most adapted microorganisms for SSF. Ectomycorrhizal fungi (#Lactarious$, #Pisolitus$, #Suillus$) as well as saprophytic fungi (#Lentinus$, #Pleurotus$) grow well on solid media containing different <b>biodegradable</b> and <b>non</b> <b>biodegradable</b> materials. For instance, manioc starch and sugar cane cellulose are biodegrable supports, while amberlite and vermiculite are <b>non</b> <b>biodegradable</b> supports.

40|$|Abstract 2, 4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) is {{the third}} most {{commonly}} used herbicide all over the world. There is a contradicted opinion about its toxicity and its half life in the environment. In this study the most effective method of its degradation and bioremediation has been studied. Two microbial consortia capable of utilizing 2, 4 -D as a sole source of carbon were isolated from the Egyptian environment. One of the microbial consortia interestingly contained {{a certain kind of}} protozoa as one of the mixed consortia members. Degradation of 2, 4 -D by the microbial consortia was affected by 2, 4 -D initial concentration, agitation, pH of the medium and temperature. The two consortia were able to degrade up to 700 mgl− 1 of 2, 4 -D. Pre-treatment with UV radiations in the presence of photocatalyst such as TiO 2 accelerates the biodegradation process. The toxic <b>non</b> <b>biodegradable</b> concentration of 2, 4 -D which was found to be the 800 mgl− 1, was degraded by pre-treatment with UV/TiO 2 and a subsequent microbial inoculation.
