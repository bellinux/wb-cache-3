5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws <b>no</b> <b>distinction</b> in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the former is simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An example of this is ring species.|$|E

5|$|Historian R. E. Smith {{notes that}} there was a need to raise {{additional}} legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion. Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps with little or no military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder. However, <b>no</b> <b>distinction</b> in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.|$|E

5|$|The Chhera Pahara (sweeping with water) is a {{significant}} ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra. During this ritual, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots.

As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannatha. This ritual signifies that under the lordship of Jagannatha, there is <b>no</b> <b>distinction</b> between the powerful sovereign and the humblest devotee.|$|E

By 1991 four floors were completely protected by sprinklers and in part on three other floors.

50|$|Chapter 2The most ominous {{event of}} our time {{is that people are}} {{steadily}} doing away with the distinctions which themselves create society. The preservation of society is directly linked with the recovery of knowledge. Society has structure and hierarchy which is determined by distinctions. People {{are becoming more and more}} overcome with the idea that in a just society there are <b>no</b> <b>distinctions</b> and everyone is equal. But people are engaged in self-promotion, contradicting that there are <b>no</b> <b>distinctions.</b> How can there be equality between sexes and ages? The basis of an organic society is a fraternity which unites parts that are distinct. Democracy presumes hierarchy and discrimination. Authority goes to knowledge.|$|R
5|$|When Richard died, {{his brother}} John – Henry’s fifth and only {{surviving}} son – took the throne. In 1204 John {{lost much of}} the Angevins' continental territories, including Anjou, to the French crown. He and his successors were still recognized as dukes of Aquitaine. The loss of Anjou from which the dynasty is named is the rationale behind John's sonHenry III of England being considered the first Plantageneta name derived from the nickname of his great-grandfather, Geoffrey. Where <b>no</b> <b>distinction</b> is made between the Angevinsand Angevin era and subsequent English Kings, Henry II is the first Plantagenet king. From John the dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in the senior male line until the reign of Richard II before dividing into two competing cadet branches, the House of Lancaster and the House of York.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was <b>no</b> <b>distinction</b> between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E
5|$|On {{the upright}} collar of full generals, {{lieutenant}} generals, major generals, and brigadier generals three stars were stitched within a wreath, all embroidered in gold coloring. The center star was {{slightly larger than}} the other stars. It {{was not possible to}} know which grade of general an officer was by his collar insignia. However, major generals and lieutenant generals wore two rows of nine buttons in groups of three down the front of the overcoat, and brigadier generals wore two rows of eight buttons in groups of two. However, Confederate Army Regulations had <b>no</b> <b>distinction</b> between the general officer grades, and had only the insignia for brigadier generals recognized. At least three general officers did not wear the prescribed uniform: Robert E. Lee, who wore the uniform of a colonel, refusing to wear a general's insignia until the Confederate victory; Joseph L. Hogg, who died of a fever; and Benjamin McCulloch.|$|E

5|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{commented that}} the route {{was designed to be}} easier than that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven flat or undulating stages (officially there was <b>no</b> <b>distinction</b> made between flat and undulating), four intermediate stages, and three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia. This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars made the trip by boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via Montenapoleone.|$|E
