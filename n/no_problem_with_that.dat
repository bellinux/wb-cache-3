50|$|In July 2015, the St. Lucian {{government}} announced that intended to soon table {{legislation that would}} replace the Privy Council with the CCJ. Prime Minister Dr. Kenny Anthony noted that St. Lucia had a provision in its Constitution which was identical to {{a provision in the}} Constitution of Dominica which allowed that country to recently join the CCJ. Further noting that St. Lucia's Attorney General had received an advisory opinion from the Court of Appeal to a possible erroneous section that the provision in question had referred to; the Court of Appeal agreed by a 2-1 majority that there was indeed an error in the Constitution. On that basis the government plans to proceed with accession to the CCJ's appellate jurisdiction and it has formally written to the British government advising them that the government of St. Lucia wishes to delink from the Privy Council pursuant to the requirements of that section of the Constitution. Prime Minister Anthony anticipated opposition and possible legal challenges to this move, and stated his government had <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> even suggesting {{it would be interesting to}} see what pronouncement the Privy Council would make on the non-binding advisory opinion of the Court of Appeal.|$|R

5000|$|Chenevix-Trench's biographer, Mark Peel, credits {{him with}} {{transforming}} Bradfield, building the early foundations for Eton's later rise to academic glory, and bringing Fettes {{back to being}} a popular, happy and successful school. Even when just appointed housemaster at Shrewsbury, Peel describes him as having been [...] "already a legend". Not all of these conclusions were accepted wisdom; The Sunday Times viewed the dramatic Eton turnaround as entirely the work of later headmasters. Peel comments that Chenevix-Trench's intensive approach to tutoring, with corporal punishment an integral part of it if the pupil {{failed to live up to}} his potential, was something that most boys had <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with,</b> but <b>that</b> it generated lasting resentment for perhaps one in ten. Peel argued <b>that</b> for boys <b>with</b> non-conformist or politically radical tendencies, intense opposition to Chenevix-Trench was natural; in particular, that Paul Foot and Richard Ingrams were amongst those who revolutionised the school magazine at Shrewsbury, carried their wit from there to Private Eye, and carried their resentment with it.|$|R
40|$|Extract] Should {{environmental}} groups that engage in public debate lose their tax-free status? That's {{the focus of}} a hotly disputed inquiry currently being considered by the Australian government — specifically, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment. Many green groups rely on tax-deductible donations from private citizens and small donors to sustain their work. In Australia, some 600 groups on the environmental register currently qualify. This is comparable to schemes in Europe and the United States, and was initiated to allow citizens and corporations to fund organisations that engage in issues of public interest. Those who initiated the inquiry, such as the committee's chair, Liberal MP Matthew Hawke, evidently have <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> groups <b>that</b> do "on-the-ground" activities, such as planting trees and saving baby flying foxes. But they apparently see red when pondering groups such as Greenpeace, The Wilderness Society and Friends of the Earth, who openly decry some government policies. Particularly rankling for some conservatives have been campaigns to stop coal developments in Australia...|$|R

40|$|Original title: Grenzen aan de eenheid The Dutch Ministry of Defence is {{committed}} to increasing diversity within the organisation. Personnel have <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the groups <b>that</b> are the target of this policy, but are also not avid supporters of the targeted promotion of diversity through specific policy. They do not see diversity as an added value in itself. This appears to correspond with the strong focus on unity: {{a strong sense of}} community with a perception of the functional utility of the unit. The affective engagement and satisfaction of personnel are accordingly high. At the same time, a tight-knit inward focus can lead to exclusion of perceived outsiders, in which colleagues who do not conform to the dominant culture within a unit or department find themselves subject to social sanctions. This applies for all personnel, but especially for those from minority groups. The Netherlands Institute for Social Research¦SCP investigated the experiences of women, people from ethnic/cultural minorities and LGB persons in the Defence organisation. Although they display high levels of satisfaction and engagement, they also more often encounter negative experiences because their minority identity clashes with the dominant ‘masculine’ and ‘white’ norm.

But according to him, in spite of this, Libya is soon expected to take such a step. During a meeting with Krasniqi, the Prime Minister of Libya, Ali Zeidan, thanked him for the visit, which was considered as the first step of the relations between the two countries after the revolution. On this occasion, Zeidan drew parallels between the war effort of the two nations for freedom and democracy. Zeidan said that after the major changes in Libya, conditions were created for friendship between the two nations and for establishing relations in all fields. Zeidan said that he has only one month in this post, but assured that steps would be taken soon in terms of recognising Kosovo, respecting some necessary administrative and legal procedures.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} a unique epitaph {{monument}} of Chrudim couple of Thomas Lvík of Domažlice and his wife Salomena Francová of Liblic (after 1619). The central scene of the epitaph represents very rare iconography – Allegorical Crucifixion. We can find similar allegorical scenes especially at Silesian protestant epitaphs around 1600. The paper tries {{to take advantage of}} this painted epitaph to use it as specific historical source comparable with traditional written documents. Because we suffer from lack of personal and individual references in these traditional documents it seems to be useful to look round for other sources. We realize this deficiency especially in the context of sepulchral culture when we try to find out something about religious mentality of early modern people. The specific iconography of the Chrudim epitaph provides us very unique opportunity for observing religious ideas of Non-Catholic in case of town of Chrudim. Comparing with similar epitaph it seems relevant to consider this Lvík´s monument as reflection of typically protestant hopeful eschatological teaching. There is <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the fact <b>that</b> it was „Catholic“ etching that served as graphic pattern for this epitaph. More important is „using“ of such iconographical theme in concrete non-Catholic environment of Chrudim.

Even the fact that he’s the father of the philosopher and has all these crazy ideas and attracts this cultish {{following}} is very similar to Xenophilius father.

40|$|By {{applying}} the semiological analysis, this paper considers planned and unplanned readings of a provocative domestic commercial, which, {{in order to}} convey its message, transposed the Little Red Riding Hood’s character {{in accordance with the}} advertised product – Durex condoms. This commercial caused furious reactions of parents who took legal action for breaching the Law on public advertising and, especially, "harming children’s sensibility and integrity". Provocative billboards also caused numerous comments in the daily newspapers, in the Internet chat rooms, with some considering the commercial vulgar and offensive and others having <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> it, adding <b>that</b> the ones who took offence belonged to those puritan and conservative layers of the society. In order to discover the reasons to this kind of reactions, I started with researching how the commercial was made and what kind of message it offered. Next, I reconsidered the meaning of the very fairy tale "The Red Riding Hood". Its original version, which contains open sexual allusions, is quite different to the changed versions offered by Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. Their versions can be seen as fakelore, since they outrageously intervened on the plot and the meaning of the original fairy tale. However, since the Grimm brothers’ version is the most popular, {{it is a fact that}} our public reacted with such anger led by the meaning of their version, which accentuates overeating and cannibalism, and not sexual development of girls, which is the basic message of the original version. This is where the "communicational noise" that led to those negative reactions came from. By discovering the true meaning of the tale, the answer is given to the question whether the advertising agency made a slip up, or it had actually found the right way to communicate the hidden message of the tale, and at the same time ruin the advertising campaign for which it was used. In the end, range and possibilities of the social semiological analysis of commercials are considered...|$|R

I criticise those who keep perseverating with Gold OA and costs while usage and impact continue to be lost and Green OA mandates (or ID/OA) can already put an immediate end to that loss, once and for all, right now. (4) CERN could have done a far greater service for other disciplines and for the growth of OA if it had put its weight and energy behind promoting its own own Green OA policy as a model worldwide, instead of diverting attention and energy to the needless and premature endgame of Gold OA within its own subfields. (5) Paying for Gold OA in a hybrid-Gold journal is indeed double-payment while subscriptions are still paying all publication costs. (6) I criticise depositing in CRs instead of depositing in Institutional Repositories (IRs), especially mandating deposit in CRs instead of in IRs. (7) I have no wish to vye for priority for the term "open access". I used "free online access" for years without feeling any pressing need for a more formal term of art. (8) Yes I (and no doubt others too, independently) mooted the notion of journals funded by means other than the subscription model (later to become Gold OA) in 1997 and even earlier (1994); but I never for a microsecond thought Gold OA would come before Green OA.
