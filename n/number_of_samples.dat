CryptoLocker was particularly successful, procuring an estimated US $3 million before it was taken down by authorities, and CryptoWall was estimated by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to have accrued over US $18m by June 2015.|$|E
5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes to be fun, others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the video}} camera, most {{sampling}} schemes are periodic; that is, {{they have a}} characteristic sampling frequency in time or in space. Digital cameras provide a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> (pixels) per degree or per radian, or samples per mm in the focal plane of the camera. Audio signals are sampled (digitized) with an analog-to-digital converter, which produces a constant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> per second.

25|$|The genetic {{history of}} Europe has mostly been reconstructed from the modern populations of Europe, {{assuming}} genetic continuity. This {{is because it}} is far easier to retrieve DNA from living subjects than ancient human remains. However, {{a growing number of}} ancient mtDNA and Y-DNA analyses are available from both the historical and prehistoric periods. 2015 saw an exponential {{rise in the number of}} ancient DNA samples available.

25|$|Glycine is a {{significant}} component of some solutions used in the SDS-PAGE method of protein analysis. It serves as a buffering agent, maintaining pH and preventing sample damage during electrophoresis. Glycine {{is also used to}} remove protein-labeling antibodies from Western blot membranes to enable the probing of numerous proteins of interest from SDS-PAGE gel. This allows more data to be drawn from the same specimen, increasing the reliability of the data, reducing the amount of sample processing, and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> required. This process is known as stripping.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{episode of}} the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's popular science show Catalyst, which {{strongly}} argued against whaling, reported that of the 18 year JARPA I program, which lethally obtained samples from 6800 whales, less than 55 peer-reviewed papers were produced, of which only 14 were claimed on the program to be relevant to {{the goals of the}} JARPA program, and that only four would require lethal sampling. Some of the research includes a paper named Fertilizability of ovine, bovine, and minke whales spermatozoa intracytoplasmically injected into bovine oocytes. Joji Morishita of JARPA has said the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> was required in order to obtain statistically significant data.|$|E

25|$|The nominal 1.5Gbit/s {{interfaces}} support most high-definition video formats. Supported formats include 1080/60i, 1080/59.94i, 1080/50i, 1080/30p, 1080/29.97p, 1080/25p, 1080/24p, 1080/23.98p, 720/60p, 720/59.94p, and 720/50p. In addition, {{there are}} several 1035i formats (an obsolete Japanese television standard), half-bandwidth 720p standards such as 720/24p (used in some film conversion applications, and unusual because it has an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> per line), and various 1080psf (progressive, segmented frame) formats. Progressive Segmented frames formats appear as interlace video but contain video which is progressively scanned. This is done to support analog monitors and televisions, {{many of which are}} incapable of locking to low field rates such as 30Hz and 24Hz.|$|E
25|$|In general, if {{the nature}} of the {{population}} distribution is known a priori, it is possible to test if the number of outliers deviate significantly from what can be expected: for a given cutoff (so samples fall beyond the cutoff with probability p) of a given distribution, the number of outliers will follow a binomial distribution with parameter p, which can generally be well-approximated by the Poisson distribution with λ = pn. Thus if one takes a normal distribution with cutoff 3 standard deviations from the mean, p is approximately 0.3%, and thus for 1000 trials one can approximate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> whose deviation exceeds 3 sigmas by a Poisson distribution with λ = 3.|$|E
25|$|Water quality. In 2015 WASREB {{reported}} that 23 utilities provided good quality water (defined {{as more than}} 95% compliance with standards), 15 acceptable quality and for 53 utilities water quality was not acceptable (defined as less than 90% compliance). The two parameters measured were residual chlorine (40% weight) and compliance with bacteriological standards (60% weight). If the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> taken was lower than foreseen in the standard, the compliance was rated lower. The highest compliance was achieved in Kericho and Kisumu with 100% each. A citizens' report carried out in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu in 2007 provided information about customers' perception of water quality: around 70% of households using water from connections to the mains said they found the taste and smell of water acceptable, and that the water was clear. Even so, {{the vast majority of}} respondents treat water prior to consumption, which shows continuing uncertainty about its quality.|$|E

25|$|Roughly speaking, the theorem {{states that}} {{although}} there are many series of results that may be produced by a random process, the one actually produced is most probably from a loosely defined set of outcomes that all have approximately the same chance of being the one actually realized. (This is a consequence of the law of large numbers and ergodic theory.) Although there are individual outcomes which have a higher probability than any outcome in this set, the vast number of outcomes in the set almost guarantees that the outcome will come from the set. One way of intuitively understanding the property is through Cramér's large deviation theorem, which states that the probability of a large deviation from mean decays exponentially with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples.</b> Such results are studied in large deviations theory; intuitively, it is the large deviations that would violate equipartition, but these are unlikely.|$|E
500|$|Bizarre Ride also {{featured}} the acclaimed production work of J-Swift, who provides the album with a lush, jazzy soundscape {{through use of}} live instrumentation and sampling. Swift relied on a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples,</b> by artists including James Brown, Donald Byrd, Sly & the Family Stone, The Meters, Quincy Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Roy Ayers and Marvin Gaye. Aside from the samples, Swift also provided piano, bass and rhodes on the album, and fellow producer JMD provided drum arrangements. These upbeat key arrangements and quick-paced drum loops provide much of the backdrop for the rapper's animated lyrical deliveries. Allmusic calls the album's production [...] "easily some of the tightest and most inventive of any hip-hop record of the era."
