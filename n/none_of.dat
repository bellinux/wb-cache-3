30|$|The work [12] {{pointed out}} that {{evaluating}} the safety and trust level of vehicles is important to ensure the reliability of applications.

However, the attacker can interrupt the regular communication among vehicles by creating a case <b>of</b> <b>None</b> Line <b>of</b> Sight. In addition, the case <b>of</b> <b>None</b> Line <b>of</b> Sight can prevent vehicles from monitoring other vehicle nodes. To solve the problem, the work proposes a location information-based trust evaluation model. The model can be used to evaluate the trust level of other vehicle nodes.|$|R
