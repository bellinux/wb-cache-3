40|$|ALTHOUGH STILL LESS {{than one}} year old as this volume goes to press, Euro-pean Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is already under trial, charged with at least three offenses. The first is false advertising: Europeans, it is claimed, {{did not get the}} strong, stable {{currency}} they were promised, for within seven months of its birth the euro had lost 13. 5 percent of its value against the dollar. The second is obfuscation: markets are finding the sig-nals from the <b>new</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions</b> confusing and inconsistent, and a scarcity of relevant information—from delays in releasing reliable euro area–wide statistics to lack of access to the deliberations of the Governing Council—makes it difficult to forecast economic developments and to understand the policy conduct of the new European Central Bank (ECB). The third is lack of impartiality: the ECB’s new policies are claimed to be exacerbating asymmetries between fast-growing and slow-growing coun-tries and validating the presumption that {{the costs and benefits of}} monetary cohabitation are unfairly distributed among small and large member states. This paper espouses a rather different thesis. In terms of its impact on financial market integration and the ability of its institutions to cope wit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} Lithuanian {{monetary and}} exchange rate developments. Experiences {{of the other}} two Baltic states Estonia and Latvia have been analysed as well. <b>New</b> <b>monetary</b> and financial <b>institutions</b> introduced in all Baltic states facedseveral problems. One was how to maintain the credibility for new fixed exchange rates in order to preserve positive effect on the economy due to the sharp fall of the inflation. The currency board system has been proposed as a reasonable solution. Central Banks of Estonia and Lithuania are operating under the currency board arrangement. The main objective was to keep monetary expansion and inflation under control. Lithuania undertook several currency reforms. After two year experience of the floating exchange rate, the Lithuanian Government pegged Lithuanian currency to the US dollar in April 1994. From that moment the Lithuanian Central bank has been operating like strict currency board. As an outcome, inflation rates slightly went down and credibility of the Lithuanian currency, the litas, increased. The paper concludes that under an instability in the transitional economies the Currency Board can serve as an anti-inflationary tool creating convertibility and credibility effects. Moreover, the exchange rate pegging might prevent the government's inflationary policy. The period after the reforms in Lithuania and also in Estonia is too short for definitive conclusions. But, from historical point of view the currency board's arrangements in those countries helped to reach the currency credibility and economic stability to a certain extent. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the sovereignty of national <b>monetary</b> <b>institutions</b> {{has been replaced by}} a common <b>monetary</b> <b>institution,</b> the European Central Bank (ECB) and national currencies have been replaced by a common currency, the euro. EMU therefore implies the loss of national monetary policy autonomy and internal exchange rate flexibility inside the EMU area. However, external exchange rate adjustment, i. e. adjustment of the euro exchange rate, remains a feasible adjustment mechanism. This paper analyses how internal and external exchange rate flexibility affect macroeconomic adjustment in EMU and non-EMU countries. To do so, a model is constructed in which three countries interact: two countries that decide to form a monetary union and a third country that does not participate in the monetary union. Numerical simulations of a representative example are used to characterise the adjustment dynamics induced by monetary and fiscal policies before and after the start of the EMU...|$|R
