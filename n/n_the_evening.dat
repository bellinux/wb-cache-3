40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a potentially demoralizing 2008 electoral defeat, when the Republican Party seemed widely discredited, the emergence of theTea Party provided conservative activists with a new identity funded by Republican business elites and reinforced by a network of conservative media sources. Untethered from recent GOP baggage and policy specifics, the Tea Party energized disgruntled white middle-class conservatives and garnered widespread attention, despite stagnant or declining favorability ratings among the general public. As participant observation and interviews withMassachusetts activists reveal, Tea Partiers are not mono-lithically hostile toward government; they distinguish between programs perceived as going to hard-working contributors to US society like themselves and “handouts ” perceived as going to unworthy or freeloading people. During 2010, Tea Party activism reshaped many GOP primaries and enhanced voter turnout, but achieved a mixed record in the November general election. Activ-ismmaywell continue to influence dynamics inCongress andGOPpresidential primaries. Even if theTea Party eventually subsides, it has undercut Obama’s presidency, revitalized conservatism, and pulled the national Republican Party toward the far right. O <b>n</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of March 23, 2010, more thanforty Tea Partiers filled to overflowing a room in asmall café on Main Street in the gritty town of Brockton, Massachusetts.
