50|$|This sealed, <b>non-spill</b> feature made it {{possible}} to make very small VRLA batteries (1 -12 Amp hr. range) that fit into the growing portable electronics market. A large market for inexpensive smaller sealed lead acid batteries was generated quickly. Portable TV, light for news cameras, children's toy riding cars, emergency lighting, and UPS systems for computer back-up, to name a few, were powered with small sealed VRLA batteries.|$|E
50|$|The Vega LED Beacon (VLB)-36 is a self {{contained}} Light Emitting Diode (LED) lantern {{suitable for use}} on both buoys and structures. It is used where it is economical to replace legacy signal and power hardware with a single lantern and a {{self contained}} power system (i.e., solar panels, battery and light are a single unit). The US Coast Guard amongst others purchases and distributes VLB-36 LED red and green lanterns. The lantern is completely self-contained and has three solar panels, LED optic head and a lead-acid <b>non-spill</b> rechargeable battery. It is provided to meet the usual marine requirements in white, yellow, red and green. The cap above the lantern indicates the signal color.|$|E
50|$|It may be {{the case}} that the graph {{coloring}} algorithm fails to find a coloring of the interference graph. In this case, some of the variables must be spilled to memory in order to enable the remaining variables to be allocated to registers. This may be accomplished by a recursive search that tries spilling one variable and then recursively either colors the remaining set of variables or continues spilling recursively until all remaining <b>non-spilled</b> variables can be colored and assigned to registers.|$|R
40|$|Acoustic Doppler current {{profilers}} (ADCPs) {{were used}} to measure water velocities in the tailrace at John Day Dam over a two-week period in February 2005. Data were collected by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the Hydraulic Design Section, Portland District, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The objective of this project was therefore to collect field measurements of water velocities in the near-field draft tube exit zone {{as well as the}} far-field tailrace to be used for improving these models. Field data were collected during the project using five separate ADCPs. Mobile ADCP data were collected using two ADCPs mounted on two separate boats. Data were collected by either holding the boat on-station at pre-defined locations for approximately 10 minutes or in moving transect mode when the boat would move over large distances during the data collection. Results from the mobile ADCP survey indicated a complex hydrodynamic flow field in the tailrace downstream of John Day Dam. A large gyre was noted between the skeleton section of the powerhouse and <b>non-spilling</b> portion of the spillway. Downstream of the spillway, the spillway flow is constrained against the navigation lock guide wall, and large velocities were noted in this region. Downstream of the guide wall, velocities decreased as the spillway jet dispersed. Near the tailrace island, the flow split was measured to be approximately equal on Day 2 (25. 4 kcfs spillway/ 123 kcfs total). However, approximately 60 % of the flow passed along the south shore of the island on Day 1 (15. 0 kcfs spillway/ 150 kcfs total). At a distance of 9000 ft downstream of the dam, flows had equalized laterally and were generally uniform over the cross section. The collection of water velocities near the draft tube exit of an operating turbine unit is not routine, and equipment capable of measuring 3 D water velocities in these zones are at the forefront of hydraulic measurement technology. Although the feasibility of measuring 1 D water velocity magnitudes has been previously demonstrated by the authors, the feasibility of resolving 3 D water velocity vectors given the heterogeneity of the flow field was unknown before this study’s data were collected. Both the 1 D and 3 D data were collected by deploying three ADCPs on dual-axis rotators directly above the draft tube exit of Turbine Unit 16. These instruments collected 1 D data during both the mobile reconnaissance campaign and a later one-week period with zero spillway discharge. During the zero spillway discharge period, Turbine Unit 16 was operated over a range of discharges. Approximately 12 hours of 1 D velocity data were collected at low (12 kcfs), middle (16. 2 kcfs), and high (19. 2 kcfs) turbine discharges. The 1 D dataset indicates large differences in flow patterns and RMS velocity fluctuations among the various discharge levels. Results from this project show that it is technically feasible to measure 3 D water velocities directly downstream of an operating turbine unit using a narrow beam swath (i. e., 6 -degree) ADCP. Data products from these 3 D velocity data include a measurement of the draft tube barrel flow distribution (a. k. a., the flow split), directional changes and the general decay of velocity as flow exits the draft tube and enters the tailrace, and a relative measure of the homogeneity of the flow field...|$|R

40|$|Select {{portions}} of the Clearwater and North Fork of the Clearwater rivers were electroshocked to estimate the incidence of gas bubble trauma (GBT) occurring in resident fish populations for {{the spring and summer}} months of 1998. The study area was divided into four sections and sampled weekly during periods of spill and <b>non-spill</b> from Dworshak Dam. Five thousand five hundred and forty one fish, representing 22 different species, were captured and examined for GBT. Two fish were detected with signs of GBT; exhibiting the lowest incidence of GBT {{in the last four years}} (0. 04 %). Reduced discharge and lower levels of total dissolved gases may have resulted in lower incidence of GBT in the 1998 monitoring period...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} to detect oil spills using MODIS near-infrared sun glittered radiance imagery. The methodology {{was developed by}} using a set of seven MODIS images (training dataset) and validated using four other images (validation dataset). The method {{is based on the}} ratio image R = L'GN/LGN, where L'GN is the MODIS-retrieved normalized sun glint radiance image and LGN the same quantity, but obtained from the Cox and Munk isotropic (independent of wind direction) sun glint model. We show that in the R image, while clean water pixel values tend to one, oil spills stand out as anomalies. Moreover, we provide a criterion to distinguish between positive and negative oil-water contrast. A pixel in an R image is classified as a potential oil spill or water via a variable threshold Rs as a function of L'GN, where the threshold values are obtained from the slicks of our training dataset. Two different fitting curves are provided for Rs, according to the contrast sign. The selection of the correct fitting curve is based on the contrast type, resulting from the criterion above. Results indicate that the thresholding is able to isolate the spills and that the spills of the validation dataset are successfully detected. Spurious look-alike features, such as clouds, and other <b>non-spill</b> features, e. g., large areas at the glint region border, are also detected as oil spills and must be eliminated. We believe that our methodology represents a novel and promising, though preliminary, approach towards automatic oil spill detection in optical satellite images...|$|E
