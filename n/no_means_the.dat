5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> most severe downturn in the region.|$|E
5|$|Aston's {{return to}} England in late 1626, {{along with all}} the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, {{arriving}} on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England. He had taken both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.|$|E
5|$|Theo Osterkamp {{pointed to}} the massed {{formations}} used by the British (Big Wing), and put their use down to the ineffectiveness of the 15 September raids. Göring was delighted {{with the news that}} the British were committing mass formations to battle. The Big Wing's use would allow the German fighters to engage and destroy RAF fighters in large numbers. However, the Germans had not realised this stratagem was by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> uniform strategy in Fighter Command. Nevertheless, the OKL were still confident of victory. It blamed the bad weather and RAF's last-minute change of strategy for prolonging summer operations. Still, the Luftwaffe bomber crews were ordered to prepare winter quarters. The campaign turned to London for the duration of 1940. It would witness some large-scale daylight air battles, but it gradually turned to a campaign by night. It would become known as The Blitz.|$|E

5|$|Whatever {{his sources}} may have been, the immense {{popularity}} of Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae cannot be denied. Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey's Latin work {{are known to}} have survived, and this does not include translations into other languages. Thus, for example, around 60 manuscripts are extant containing Welsh-language versions of the Historia, the earliest of which were created in the 13th century; the old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey's Historia, advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th-century Lewis Morris, has long since been discounted in academic circles. As a result of this popularity, Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae was enormously influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend. While it was by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> only creative force behind Arthurian romance, many of its elements were borrowed and developed (e.g., Merlin and the final fate of Arthur), and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers' tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted.|$|E

25|$|Individuals of African descent have a {{lower level}} of binge {{drinking}} followed by those of Asian descent.

A tribe of Susquehannock Indians had what appears to have been a fairly major settlement at the mouth of the creek. The early European settlers found the remains of an Indian village there. Arhaeologic evidence of earthenware, soapstone ware, pestles, hatchets, ornaments, and charms were found on the land that is across the river from Lycoming Creek and nearby where the Sheshequin Path crossed the river.|$|E

Late {{in the evolution of}} the FidoNet system, there was a proposal to allow mail (but not forum messages) from these systems to switch into the FidoNet structure. This was not adopted, and the rapid rise of the internet made this superfluous as these networks rapidly added internet exchange, which acted as a lingua franca.|$|E
25|$|Titus Andronicus is by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> {{most brutal}} of Shakespeare's plays. More people die in Richard III. King Lear {{is a much}} more cruel play. In the whole Shakespearean {{repertory}} I can find no scene so revolting as Cordelia's death. In reading, the cruelties of Titus can seem ridiculous. But I have seen it on the stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching Titus Andronicus we come to understand – perhaps more than by looking at any other Shakespeare play – the nature of his genius: he gave an inner awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on earth.|$|E

The sievert is a unit of weighted radiation dose for ionising radiation, which supersedes the older unit the REM (roentgen equivalent man).|$|E

In fact, {{the loss of the}} first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side, one from which they still have not fully come back from to this date. It was a match they should have won, and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency and basically dominated the series from that point onwards.|$|E
