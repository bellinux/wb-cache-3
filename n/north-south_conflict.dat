But there are clearly changes to be observed in the environment, both political and economic, {{that we need to be}} cognizant of which have occurred during the past few years. Specifically, we are all aware of an increasing tendency, not necessarily tending to isolationist but to unilateralist views in the U.

Starting in 19 th century from deliberations on factor endowments and trade, {{as a consequence of}} new and hardly envisioned trade patterns in the 20 th century. While theory was rather quick in taking up these new developments, policy waited to react till the Uruguay Round. The article outlines these two dimensions of change and explains in short the impact of innovations and services on foreign trade – its theories, policies and new structure of the international transfers. Both elements are analysed at first separately and then by looking at their interaction. Concerning innovation the development of the theory of foreign trade is traced (traditional, product cycle, “new” theory of foreign trade and the “new” growth theory and foreign trade). The trade policy follows only slowly and cautiously these sometimes extremely sophisticated theories. The growth of the international transfer of services {{and its impact on the}} pattern of foreign trade is so remarkable that the wording “revolutionary” is even used.

Acht Jahre nach dem Beginn der „Großen Rezession“ ist die Eurozone tief gespalten zwischen Ländern, welche die Krise erfolgreich überwunden haben, und anderen, die nach wie vor mit deren katastrophalen Folgen zu kämpfen haben. Der Grund sind fundamentale Strukturunterschiede zwischen „nördlichen“ und „südlichen“ Mitgliedsökonomien und ein einheitliches Euro-Regime, das strukturelle Konvergenz erzwingen muss, um die Stabilität der Währungsunion zu sichern. Dieses Regime kann jedoch ökonomisch scheitern, wenn seine strikten Regeln gelockert werden müssten, und es kann politisch scheitern, wenn es nicht länger gelingen sollte, den potenziell explosiven Nord-Süd-Konflikt zu unterdrücken.

The developed countries with a much longer history as "industrial economies " have always argued- often with some justification-that the developing countries have long used many and varied instruments to restrict trade.

One cornerstone of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) is the provision of special and differential treatment (SDT) of developing countries.

However, when viewed in the light of its support for dictatorial regimes in those host countries, do Chinese peacekeeping efforts improve the perceptions local populations have of China? This article examines changes in Cambodian perceptions of China during the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) from 1992 to 1993. It argues that China's peacekeeping contribution to UNTAC helped to overcome negative perceptions of that country rooted in its support of the Khmer Rouge before 1992. The key to overcoming current negative perceptions is to project an image of Chinese neutrality with respect to all parties in a civil war.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a social history of disease and {{mortality}} in the American Deep South before the Civil War. Yellow fever attacked the region at epidemic levels {{every two or three}} years between 1800 and 1860, killing about eight percent of the urban population, and as many as 20 or 30 percent of recent migrants from Europe. With little epidemiological understanding of mosquito-borne virusesâand almost no public health infrastructure to ameliorate diseaseâthe only real protection from this scourge was to "get acclimated": fall sick with, and survive, yellow fever. About half of all people would die in the acclimating process. By placing the Deep South within an Atlantic disease diaspora uncontained by continental boundaries, the project shifts the fault-lines of the Southern past from <b>North-South</b> political <b>conflicts</b> onto similarly formative but overlooked ecological processes in the Greater Caribbean. Yellow fever and mass mortality are largely absent from the recent historiography on the cotton kingdom and "slave racial capitalism. " But as well as being a âslave society,â this thesis suggests the Deep South was also a "disease society": Deep Southerners discussed yellow fever obsessively, worked according to its seasonal schedule, and judged others based on their perceived vulnerability to the disease. Yellow fever, and immunity to it, profoundly shaped the asymmetrical hierarchies of Deep Southern society, with acclimated "immunocapitalist" creoles on top, and unacclimated "foreigners" below. Slavers and their allies argued only intellectually-inferior but naturally-resistant black people could perform the arduous labour of sugar and cotton cultivation in the Deep South, as whites too frequently died. This became the region's chief argument for permanent racial slavery. However, almost every slave revolt in Louisiana coincided with a particularly bad epidemic, suggesting slaves found disease politically intriguing and understood that yellow fever left white society chaotic and vulnerable to attack. </p...|$|R
40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) by Northern {{firms in the}} South often induces technology spillovers which benefits Southern firms. This topic has recently received significant attention in the international trade literature. Is inducing FDI with technology spillovers always a good policy for the South? What are the optimal Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policy and trade policy for the South and the world? The thesis addresses these questions by exploring technology spillovers that {{is accompanied by a}} Northern firm's FDI in the South. It contains three closely related essays. The first two essays develop different frameworks of technology spillovers, namely quality-enhancing and cost-reducing technology spillovers. The goal of these essays is to provide an explanation for the <b>North-South</b> IPR <b>conflict</b> and suggest policy recommendations along this line. The third essay studies an export platform FDI model with technology spillovers. Our goal for this essay is to understand the connection between regional trade liberalization and IPR regime in the South. The thesis leads to several new policy implications, some of which can be listed as follows. First, in the presence of quality-enhancing technology spillovers in the South, the Northern firm strategically reduces its product quality level under FDI in a range of parameterizations. Consequently, this leads to the possibility in which FDI hurts the South, and at the same time, the optimal level of spillovers for global welfare could be strictly less than South optimal level. Second, when spillovers are cost-reducing, these results do not necessarily hold. This is because the Northern firm chooses the minimum marginal cost level for its product regardless of its location choice. Under linear demand, we also find that, FDI improves Southern welfare and global welfare with cost-reducing spillovers. Consequently, cost-reducing spillovers and quality-enhancing spillovers can yield different, even contrasting, policy implications. Finally, if the Northern firm follows the export-platform FDI strategy then FDI benefits the South under a range of parameterizations. When export-platform FDI is optimal for the South, the greater the degree of trade liberalization between the South and the export market, the less incentive the South has toward protecting the technology of the Northern firm...|$|R
