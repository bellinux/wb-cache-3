40|$|Evidence {{shows that}} {{globally}} observed disinflation {{in the last}} two decades has been more predominant in emerging economies. This paper undertakes a quantitative investigation of the distributional and welfare consequences of a sharp reduction in inflation in a monetary model of a small open economy with uninsured idiosyncratic earnings risk. Consumers hold non-interest bearing real balances (demand deposits) that economize transactions costs of consumption and internationally-traded risk-free bonds (term deposits) that are useful for consumption smoothing. Bonds are modeled as inflation-indexed to incorporate financial dollarization. Analytical results for deterministic economies show that alternative fiscal responses to inflationary finance create various redistributive wealth effects in addition to wealth-eroding and consumption-distorting effects of inflation. The stochastic model is calibrated to Turkish data and is used to compare stationary equilibria with quarterly inflation rates of 15 % (for 1987 : 1 - 2003 : 4) and 2 % (for 2004 : 1 - 2009 : 4) under alternative fiscal arrangements. I find that (i) when uniform transfers are endogenous, reducing inflation lowers aggregate welfare by 2. 65 % in terms of compensating consumption variation. This is because the reduction in the costs of inflation for the poor is less than the decrease in transfers. This also tightens <b>natural</b> <b>debt</b> limits, increases precautionary savings motive and causes the distribution of bonds to be more equitable. When endogenous transfers are proportional to individual-specific inflation tax payments, aggregate welfare increases by 0. 5 %. This is because proportional transfers do not drive redistributive effects. Welfare gains increase further (1. 67 %) if wasteful spending is endogenous. The model also generates a cross sectional portfolio consistent with the disaggregated deposits data and the literature. ...|$|E

Costa Rica¿s debt ratio remained stable but at a high level; near 50 per cent. Is there reason {{to be concerned about the}} solvency of the public sector in these economies? We provide an answer to this question based on the quantitative predictions of a variant of the framework proposed by Mendoza and Oviedo (2007). This methodology yields forward-looking estimates of debt ratios that are consistent with fiscal solvency, for a government that faces revenue uncertainty and can issue only non-state-contingent debt. In this environment, aversion to a collapse in outlays leads the government to respect a <b>natural</b> <b>debt</b> limit equal to the annuity value of the primary balance in a fiscal crisis. A fiscal crisis occurs after a long sequence of adverse revenue shocks, and public outlays adjust to their tolerable minimum. The debt limit also represents a credible commitment to remain able to repay even in a fiscal crisis. The debt limit is not, in general, the same as the sustainable debt, which is driven by the probabilistic dynamics of the primary balance. The results of a baseline scenario question the sustainability of current debt ratios in Brazil and Colombia, while those in Costa Rica and Mexico are inside the limits consistent with fiscal solvency. In contrast, current debt ratios are found to be unsustainable in all four countries for plausible changes to lower average growth rates or higher real interest rates.

40|$|This study {{undertakes}} {{a quantitative}} {{investigation of the}} distributional and welfare consequences of a sharp reduction in inflation in a small open economy. In the first chapter, a monetary model of a small open economy with uninsured idiosyncratic earnings risk is analyzed. In this model, consumers hold non-interest bearing real balances (demand deposits) that economize transactions costs of consumption and internationally-traded risk-free bonds (term deposits) that are useful for consumption smoothing. Bonds are modeled as inflation-indexed to incorporate financial dollarization. The model is calibrated to Turkish data and is used to compare stationary equilibria with quarterly inflation rates of 14. 25 % (for 1987 : 1 - 2002 : 4) and 2. 25 % (for 2003 : 1 - 2010 : 3) under alternative fiscal arrangements. The results show that (i) when uniform transfers are endogenous, reducing inflation lowers aggregate welfare by 1. 25 % in terms of compensating consumption variation. This is because {{the reduction in the}} costs of inflation for the poor is less than the reduction in their transfers income. This also tightens <b>natural</b> <b>debt</b> limits and increases precautionary savings motive. (ii) When endogenous transfers depend on individual-specific inflation tax payments, aggregate welfare increases by 0. 45 %. This is because proportional transfers do not drive redistributive effects. (iii) Welfare gains increase further (1. 62 %) if wasteful spending is endogenous. The model also generates a cross sectional portfolio consistent with the disaggregated deposits data and the literature. The second chapter examines quantitative properties of the transitional dynamics produced by gradual disinflation (as opposed to the stationary equilibria analysis conducted in the first chapter). The main exercise is to feed the empirically observed declining path for inflation into the calibrated model and account for its macroeconomic, distributional and welfare effects under alternative fiscal arrangements. The results show that (i) when uniform transfers are endogenous, gradual decline in the inflation rate from 14. 25 % to 2. 25 % increases aggregate welfare by 0. 28 %. (ii) When wasteful spending is endogenous, aggregate welfare increases by 0. 53 %. These welfare effects are substantially different from those implied by steady state comparisons. This is because when transition is accounted for, fiscal variables do not jump to their low inflation steady state levels immediately...|$|E

40|$|Environmental health’s purview, {{driven by}} an {{accelerating}} transformation of social and ecological systems, has been progressively expanding to encompass a broader array of environment health relationships. This widening perspective embraces persistent, resurgent, and nascent threats to human health that often operate at multiple scales, generating the attributable burdens of the present {{as well as the}} avoidable burdens of the future. Analyzing linkages from the planetary to the individual is a core challenge for evolving environmental health into its “global” incarnation. The complications and uncertainties involved are daunting as causality cascades through multiple scales, prompting global environmental health to expand not only its paradigm but also its toolkit. In this dissertation, I motivate, develop, and demonstrate three such approaches for investigating multiscale drivers of global environmental health: (1) a metric for analyzing contributions and responses to climate change from global to sectoral scales, (2) a framework for unraveling the influence of environmental change on infectious diseases at regional to local scales, and (3) a model for informing the design and evaluation of clean cooking interventions at community to household scales. The full utility of climate debt as an analytical perspective will remain untapped without tools that can be manipulated by a wide range of analysts, including global environmental health researchers. Chapter 2 explains how international <b>natural</b> <b>debt</b> (IND) apportions global radiative forcing from fossil fuel carbon dioxide and methane, the two most significant climate altering pollutants, to individual entities − primarily countries but also subnational states and economic sectors, with even finer scales possible − as a function of unique trajectories of historical emissions, taking into account the quite different radiative efficiencies and atmospheric lifetimes of each pollutant. Owing to its straightforward and transparent derivation, IND can readily operationalize climate debt to consider issues of equity and efficiency and drive scenario exercises that explore the response to climate change at multiple scales. Collectively, the analyses presented in this chapter demonstrate how IND can inform a range of key question on climate change mitigation at multiple scales, compelling environmental health towards an appraisal of the causes and not just the consequences of climate change. The environmental change and infectious disease (EnvID) conceptual framework of Chapter 3 builds on a rich history of prior efforts in epidemiologic theory, environmental science, and mathematical modeling by: (1) articulating a flexible and logical system specification; (2) incorporating transmission groupings linked to public health intervention strategies; (3) emphasizing the intersection of proximal environmental characteristics and transmission cycles; (4) incorporating a matrix formulation to identify knowledge gaps and facilitate an integration of research; and (5) highlighting hypothesis generation amidst dynamic processes. A systems based approach leverages the reality that studies relevant to environmental change and infectious disease are embedded within a wider web of interactions. As scientific understanding advances, the EnvID framework can help integrate the various factors at play in determining environment–disease relationships and the connections between intrinsically multiscale causal networks. In Chapter 4, the coverage effect model functions primarily as a “proof of concept” analysis to address whether the efficacy of a clean cooking technology may be determined by the extent of not only household level use but also community level coverage. Such coverage dependent efficacy, or a “coverage effect,” would transform how interventions are studied and deployed. Ensemble results are consistent with the concept that an appreciable coverage effect from clean cooking interventions can manifest within moderately dense communities. Benefits for users derive largely from direct effects; initially, at low coverage levels, almost exclusively so. Yet, as coverage expands within a user’s community, a coverage effect becomes increasingly beneficial. In contrast, non users, despite also experiencing comparable exposure reductions from community-level intervention use, cannot proportionately benefit because their exposures remain overwhelmingly dominated by household-level use of traditional solid fuel cookstoves. The coverage effect model strengthens the rationale for public health programs and policies to encourage clean cooking technologies with an added incentive to realize high coverage within contiguous areas. The implications of the modeling exercise extend to priorities for data collection, underscoring the importance of outdoor pollution concentrations during, as well as before and/or after, community cooking windows and also routine measurement of ventilation, meteorology, time activity patterns, and cooking practices. The possibility of a coverage effect necessitates appropriate strategies to estimate not only direct effects but also coverage and total effects to avoid impaired conclusions. The specter of accelerating social and ecological change challenges efforts to respond to climate change, re/emerging infectious diseases, and household air pollution. Environmental health possesses a well-established and well-tested repertoire of methods but contending with multiscale drivers of risk requires complementary approaches, as well. Integrating metrics, frameworks, and models − and their insights − into its analytical arsenal can help global environmental health meet the challenges of today and tomorrow...|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} public debt dynamics {{with a view to}} assess the optimal size and composition of public debt in Zimbabwe that is consistent with maintaining public debt at sustainable levels. The analysis was performed by applying public debt data for Zimbabwe over the period 1980 to 2012. Robustness checks were conducted, using data for selected low income countries in the sub-Saharan Africa. The study was motivated by the public debt management concerns caused by the 2008 / 09 global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis as well as the external public debt overhang experienced by Zimbabwe since the year 2000. The findings of the study complement existing research findings and information on public debt management of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other researchers. The major contribution of this thesis is the determination of optimal public debt thresholds for Zimbabwe. The optimal public debt thresholds were estimated from a joint analysis of the macroeconomic variables that affect public debt and the reaction of fiscal policy to changes in debt. The classical linear regression and Bayesian Vector Auto Regression (BVAR) models were applied to examine the drivers of debt accumulation and to assess the sensitivity of debt to macroeconomic shocks. The information from the drivers of public debt accumulation, together with the fiscal response mechanism was used to calibrate the long-run stable (optimal) public debt target. The optimal public debt threshold was also determined by assessing the link between public debt and economic growth. This assessment was carried out to establish the tipping point beyond which public debt adversely affects growth. Such a tipping point provides valuable information on the optimal size of public debt. The study also applied simulation approaches to determine the optimal composition of public debt. The results show that public debt dynamics in Zimbabwe largely comprised extensive stock flow adjustments emanating from extra budgetary expenditures to meet social and political related needs. The results of the assessment on the sensitivity of public debt to macroeconomic shocks show that Zimbabwe‟s public debt has been more vulnerable to economic growth, exchange rate and interest rate shocks. The significant influence of these variables highlights the role of automatic debt dynamics in public debt management. The results from the fiscal reaction function show that government has been responding positively to increases in public debt. This analysis also shows that government‟s policies are a-cyclical; as explained by the negative and insignificant response of the primary balance to the output gap. The dynamic stochastic simulation analysis suggests that Zimbabwe‟s public debt could follow an array of potential paths depending on the policy stance implemented by government. The simulated risk to public debt dynamics is larger, with an upper bound public debt to GDP ratio of 100 per cent and a lower bound public debt ratio of 32 per cent. The simulated lower bound provides a measure of a <b>natural</b> <b>debt</b> limit, which the government could adopt without fearing the risk of default. The results suggest that the main risks to public debt sustainability lie in growth shocks, whose volatility have been high for the period under study. The results from the analysis of growth and debt confirm the existence of an optimal growth maximising public debt ratio depicted by an inverted U-shaped relationship between public debt and economic growth. The optimal size of public debt was found to be at public debt levels of between 45 - 50 per cent of GDP. This means that higher public debt ratios have been associated with lower economic growth rates at debt levels above 50 per cent of GDP. The results are consistent with empirical findings for low income countries which suggest the existence of a debt laffer-curve. The results from an analysis of an optimal composition of public debt show a trade-off between a debt composition with more external concessional debt and one with more domestic debt. While a composition with more concessional borrowing was found to be desirable from a cost perspective, it proved to be less desirable from a risk perspective after taking into consideration stock flow adjustments due to changes in cross exchange rates. The findings of the study point to a need for the Zimbabwean government to swiftly respond to increases in public debt to control the swings in debt dynamics caused by macroeconomic shocks. The inverted U-shaped relationship between debt and growth suggests that government borrowing must be done in a way that simultaneously entrenches debt sustainability and ensures sustained economic growth rates in the medium to long-term. The study also highlights the need for counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies to avoid explosive debt dynamics emanating from frequent changes in the business cycle, and to minimise the interest/growth rate differential to ensure sustainable public debt dynamics. There is also a need for authorities to ensure a true balance between external and domestic borrowing to minimise the volatility in debt service costs caused by macroeconomic shocks. Generally, the findings from this study can assist in informing the policy agenda to address the imperatives of debt resolution, fiscal consolidation and economic growth acceleration...|$|E

This diverts their capital away from potential borrowers and channels it into collateral to support speculative positions. The resulting shift in the terms of lending against borrowers can cause some projects with positive net present value to remain unfunded, or (in the presence of agency problems) to be replaced by riskier projects with negative net present value. It can also result in an increased likelihood of default and the selection of equilibria in which rollover risk is amplified.

We find evidence of unique, as well as common, factors that determine each debt type's use thus indicating the importance of examining debt at a disaggregated level. Specifically, the use of <b>natural</b> local currency <b>debt</b> is associated primarily with factors found by many other studies to determine total debt levels such as size, profitability, and the market-to-book ratio. Foreign currency debt {{is used as a}} complement to local currency debt by firms with substantial capital needs seeking to lower the cost or extend the maturity structure of debt. However, the use of foreign currency debt is also determined by asset and income type consistent with agency cost and financial risk management theories. The use of synthetic local debt is primarily determined by risk management concerns. Finally, contrary to anecdotal reports and existing theory, we find no evidence that unhedged foreign currency debt is associated with significantly worse performance during the Asian crisis. Surprisingly, the use of synthetic local currency debt is associated with the biggest drop in market value, possibly due to currency derivative market illiquidity during the crisis...|$|R
40|$|Energetic {{security}} is {{becoming one of}} the priorities of the economic policies of the European Union. One of the elements on which it depends is adequate financial standing of companies producing and distributing electricity. A factor contributing to this is the structure of funding sources. Based on the assumption that in order to maintain maximum energy security, risk should be avoided, hence the assumption that it will be <b>natural</b> to avoid <b>debt</b> in companies in the energy sector. That would disprove the fundamental theory of Modigliani Miller, describing the structure of financing. The aim of the publication is an attempt to identify the relation between the level of debt in energy companies performing in United Europe countries sector and their profitability. factors that determine the structure of sources of financing in the energy sector in the EU. The article poses three hypotheses: in the energy sector dominates financing by equity (in medium and large companies), company size does not matter for the financial structure, as well as the share of debt financing affects the efficiency measured ROA of companies in the energy sector (in average and large enterprises). Research used descriptive statistics and regression analysis. We also used appropriate tests supporting the inference regarding normal distribution and equality of medians. The results obtained indicate that the first and the second hypothesis is true, the third hypothesis was not confirmed. For the wider importance of research, this means that the energy sector, which in this study was represented by a group of European companies for financing investments are backed by some predominantly equity...|$|R
40|$|Public debt in the Middle East {{increased}} {{during the}} mid- 1990 s {{mainly because of}} fiscal expansions. It decreased in recent years, thanks to high oil revenue, economic growth, some primary non-oil fiscal adjustment, and debt relief. While countries in the Middle East appear to have adequately reacted to high indebtedness in the past, public debt levels remain uncomfortably high in many, particularly non-oil producing countries and middle income oil producers. Non-oil countries adjust mainly by increasing revenues, whereas oil countries adjust expenditure. For non-oil producing countries, substantial fiscal adjustment {{would be needed to}} bring debt down to below 50 percent of GDP. Oil producers as a group appear to follow sustainable, though procyclical, fiscal policies. Middle-income (but not high-income) oil producing countries would need to adjust somewhat to bring their policies in line with the permanent oil income benchmark.

40|$|PhDThis thesis {{seeks to}} examine Novalis's {{philosophy}} of practical knowledge and to position {{it within the}} context of the work of other Romantic natural philosophers and some aspects of contemporary science. His views on Ritter's galvanism and the latter's significance for his thought in general are treated here for the first time in full. Contrary to most previous views, it is argued that a major part of Novalis's outlook stems from his concept of practical knowledge and his reflection over the term "experiment", which proves to be an extremely complex and central idea in his thought. It is shown how this philosophy of his finds most explicit expression in the idea of a symbolic notation or a "phenomenal" calculus. These notions merge in Novalis's idea of productive "Plastisirung". Particular attention is paid to the symbolic use of phosphorus in the pneumatic debate and Ritter's galvanic interpretation of the nerve. Beyond contemporary science, it is further shown how broad an historical base Novalis channels into his notion of practical knowledge. This should lead to a clearer understanding of Novalis's position within Romantic <b>natural</b> philosophy, his <b>debt</b> to tradition, and his originality. In the light of these findings, it is argued that Novalis's concern for practical knowledge provides the basis for a possible form of consensus in his thought. It is shown that there is an increasing tendency in his writings away from a programme for classifying knowledge in general towards the idea of individual knowledge and the case study, as is exemplified in his reception of Ritter's work. It is also advanced that Novalis's notion of practical knowledge is a significant methodological statement of early Romantic science, which also puts a new perspective on thinkers such as Goethe, Humboldt, Schelling and Ritte...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} concerns {{itself with the}} underlying social content detected in the romance literature of James Leslie Mitchell/Lewis Grassic Gibbon (JLM/LGG), which applied to all his writings gives as a result a second meaning in his texts, {{that turns out to}} be his essential meaning. Two short stories, He Who Seeks, HWS and For Ten's Sake FTS were selected as objects of analysis. However, at least two romance novels are also analyzed even if partially only. The nature of the method employed determined that any other work by JLM/LGG, even if realistic in style, could be brought into focus at any time since all his works are mutually related both in content and imagery romance and realistic alike so that eventually, practially all his literary production came to play a more or less active role in the research. But the trilogy A Scots Quair, ASQ was excepted as a rule. Apart from the General Introduction in which are to be found the explanations concerning the nature of the problem that motivated this research, the objective pursued, the method used, etc. and the theoretical premises that contribute to its orientation, the present work is divided into three parts. Part One deals with the Model. It consists of seven chapters: whereof the first five explain the five respective phases of The Model of Society in the Writings of JLM/LGG. Chapter 6 has been conceived as a suitable illustration of the model, since it contains a partial analysis of FTS as its paradigm; as in a nutshell it suggests the whole outlook of contemporary culture, its stage, its trends, the controversies, challenges, the ideological camps, etc. and the author's own system. Chapter 7 is an attempt at explicating his imagery. meaning. This is in fact the work which led us to the essential Part Two deals with the author's cultural approach, which includes both his own credo as a writer and his assessment of culture as a historical phenomenon, according to our analysis of HWS and our brief studies on his humanist tradition respectively. Chapter 8 is devoted to the analysis of HWS, a tale based on the Grail legend conventions which the author applies to contemporary social questions in order to bring forth both his critique of modern culture and his plea in favour of world peace. It also highlights his conception of freedom, equality, and fraternity. Chapter 9 seeks to throw light on the intellectual concerns of the author and his debt to the humanist tradition in thought on the one hand, and to the same tradition in literature and art on the other. His debt to French socialism, to the German philosophy and the scientific tradition in <b>natural</b> science. His <b>debt</b> to romantic, anarchist and socialist writers. Here many familiar names turn up: from Campanella and More to Engels and Marx, from Columbus to Rousseau, from Morris and Shelley to H. G. Wells, from Shakespeare and Dickens to Tolstoy, etc. Part Three deals with the ideological question. It consists of seven chapters, each one devoted to some specific issue highlighted in the model. Since the author perceives them as part of an ideological battle, the subdivision "Protagonists" includes the relevant humanist trends that the author rallies round his cause, whereas the "Antagonists" includes trends which the author assesses as opposite to those of humanism. Chapter 10 is devoted to highlighting the humanism that the author seems to have derived from Rousseau as his main source: his views on the respectability of the human race, on the origin of social inequality, on Man I s perfectibility, etc. Chapter 11 explains the real interest of the author in Diffusionism and why he incorporated it into his model. The importance he saw in the mechanisms of the diffusion of culture, and the merits of the English School of Anthropology of G. E. Smith, Perry, and Rivers. Chapter 12 analyzes the influence Haecke 1 had on JLM/LGG. This provides scientific support for most of his conceptions, especially those connected with nature as a whole and of the inner connection and interdependence of all phenomena, and why as a monist he combats dualistic thought. Chapter 13 takes a look at the influence that Kropotkin had on JLM/LGG, especially in relation to some specific humanistic views, apart from his subsequent anarchistic idea that his model pursues as ultimate target. This in turn explains his political strategy to the future. Chapter 14 is devoted to analyzing Bebel's influence in relation to the feminine question in History. It explains why some authors have detected a certain "feminine personality" in JLM. The two antagonists are Spengler and Nietzsche who represent the pessimistic, elitist, bellicist, nihilist, etc. trends which the author sees as arising from the perceptions of an upper class social consciousness on the one hand, and from the neo-Darwinian notions on the other. Finally, the work closes with some concluding statements, which, generally, assess the model as conveying a clear social content. The latter arises from a materialist analysis of the culture to his time, and an extrapolation of its probable outcome and destination in its movement towards the distant future and the distant stars in the cosmos...|$|R
