5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who had suggested that black holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do <b>not</b> <b>destroy</b> information as they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E
5|$|Not all of Diocletian's {{plans were}} successful: the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), {{his attempt to}} curb {{inflation}} via price controls, was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's tetrarchic system collapsed after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of Maxentius and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The Diocletianic Persecution (303–11), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official persecution of Christianity, did <b>not</b> <b>destroy</b> the empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, Constantine.|$|E

After being summoned to the palace by Toad, Mario and Luigi confront and subdue Bowser, who coincidentally was attempting to kidnap Peach. Bowser decides against doing so, and teams up with Mario and Luigi to take her voice back from Cackletta, who has fled to the Beanbean Kingdom, with the intention of kidnapping Peach afterward when her voice would <b>not</b> <b>destroy</b> his castle.|$|E

5|$|A {{few seconds}} after Pajota {{and his men}} heard Murphy fire the first shot, they fired on the alerted Japanese {{contingent}} situated across the Cabu River. Pajota had earlier sent a demolitions expert to set charges on the unguarded bridge to go off at 19:45. The bomb detonated at the designated time, and although it did <b>not</b> <b>destroy</b> the bridge, it formed a large hole over which tanks and other vehicles could not pass. Waves of Japanese troops rushed the bridge, but the V-shaped choke point created by the Filipino guerrillas repulsed each attack. Oneguerrilla, who had been trained to use the bazooka {{only a few hours}} earlier by the Rangers, destroyed or disabled four tanks that were hiding behind a clump of trees. A group of Japanese soldiers made an effort to flank the ambush position by crossing the river away from the bridge, but the guerrillas spotted and eliminated them.|$|E
5|$|Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has {{one or two}} special {{units that}} are {{exclusive}} to that Civilization. For instance, the Britons have access to longbowmen, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The monk is {{a special kind of}} military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics; relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does <b>not</b> <b>destroy</b> a monastery holding a relic after the set time, then that player wins.|$|E
5|$|Half {{the area}} of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been {{reclaimed}} in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The Environment Agency's management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness {{in the face of a}} potential sea level rise of 1.1m (3ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5m (10ft) per year. This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should <b>not</b> <b>destroy</b> their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.|$|E

5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could <b>not</b> <b>destroy</b> with lightning.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} {{section of the}} fort, similar actions were taking place, as the airborne troops raced to destroy or otherwise disable the fortifications housing artillery pieces. Objective No. 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine-guns whose arcs of fire covered {{the western side of}} the Fort; to destroy the casemate, the airborne troops used a flamethrower to force the Belgian soldiers manning the weapons to retreat, and then detonated shaped charges against the fortification to disable it. Another observation cupola fitted with machine-guns, Objective No. 19, was destroyed, but two further objectives, Nos. 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations. Unexpected complications came from Objective No. 23, a retractable cupola housing two 75mm artillery pieces. It had been assumed that the weapons in this fortification could not stop the airborne assault, but this assumption was found to be false when the weapons opened fire, forcing the airborne troops in the area to go to cover. The rapid fire of the weapons led to air support being summoned, and a Stuka squadron bombed the cupola. Although the bombs did <b>not</b> <b>destroy</b> the cupola, the explosions did force the Belgians to retract it {{throughout the rest of the}} fighting. Any exterior entrances and exits located by the airborne troops were destroyed with explosives to seal the garrison inside the Fort, giving the garrison few opportunities to attempt a counter-attack. The airborne troops had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling the artillery pieces that the fort could have used to bombard the captured bridges, but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled. A number of these included anti-aircraft weapons and machine-guns.|$|E
5|$|The nine {{remaining}} gliders transporting {{the airborne}} troops assigned to Group Granite successfully {{landed on the}} roof of Fort Eben-Emael, using arrester-parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt. The airborne troops rapidly emerged from the gliders and began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements {{on the top of the}} Fort which housed the artillery pieces that could target the three captured bridges. In the southern part of the Fort, Objective No. 18, an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge, which collapsed the casemate's observation dome and part of the roof of the Fort itself. Objective No. 12, a traversing turret holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by airborne troops, who then moved to Objective No. 26, a turret holding another three 75mm weapons; although explosives were detonated against this and the airborne troops assigned to destroy it moved off, this proved to be premature as one of the guns was rapidly brought to bear against the attackers, who were forced to assault it for a second time to destroy it. Another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola was disabled, as was a barracks known to house Belgian troops. However, attempts to destroy Objective No. 24 proved to be less successful; the objective, twin turrets with heavy-calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola, was too large for airborne troops from a single glider to destroy on their own, forcing troops from two gliders to be used. Primitive unlined shaped charges were affixed to the turrets and detonated, but whilst they shook the turrets they did <b>not</b> <b>destroy</b> them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb the turrets and smash the gun barrels.|$|E
