Separately, accumulation of BIA 10-2474 given orally in humans was supported by pharmacokinetic data from the trial itself, reviewed by the ANSM expert committee.

In rats, the Tmax is found to be 0.5 hours after a single 10 mg/kg dose and the half-life of deramciclane is about 3.5-5.5 hours.

50|$|In {{determining}} bioequivalence, for example, {{between two}} {{products such as}} a commercially available Brand product and a potential to-be-marketed Generic product, pharmacokinetic studies are conducted whereby each of the preparations are administered in a cross-over study to volunteer subjects, generally healthy individuals but occasionally in patients. Serum/plasma samples are obtained at regular intervals and assayed for parent drug (or occasionally metabolite) concentration. Occasionally, blood concentration levels are neither feasible or possible to compare the two products (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids), then pharmacodynamic endpoints rather than pharmacokinetic endpoints (see below) are used for comparison. For a pharmacokinetic comparison, the plasma concentration data are used to assess key pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), and absorption lag time (tlag). Testing should be conducted at several different doses, especially when the drug displays <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics.</b>|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The pharmacokinetics of three unrelated compounds, bumetanide (a diuretic), lorazepam (an anxiolytic) and clofibric acid (an antihyperlipidaemic agent), were investigated in two species of non-human primates commonly used in risk assessment studies. Each of the three drug substances used was independently administered at each of three dose levels, the lowest selected to correspond with the human therapeutic dose (normalised for body weight) and the highest, at ten times the therapeutic dose, selected to approximate to a dose level which might be used during chronic toxicity tests. By use of three dose levels, {{it was possible to}} assess whether any <b>non-linear</b> changes in <b>pharmacokinetics</b> occurred between "pseudo-therapeutic" dose levels and those likely to be used during risk assessment studies. Two routes of administration, intravenous and oral, were used at each dose level, the former to establish the basic pharmacokinetics of each compound, the latter to assess the absorption characteristics of the drugs and the systemic availability after oral dosing. Sensitive and specific highperformance liquid chromatographic assays were developed for the quantitative measurement of the compounds of interest. In both the cynomolgus monkey and the baboon, the pharmacokinetics - 1 of bumetanide was linear over the dose range examined (O. 03 - 0. 3 Omg. kg) after either intravenous or oral administration. The pharmacokinetics - 1 of lorazepam (dose range O. 05 - 0. 50 mg. kg) was also linesr after intravenous dosing, but the extent of bioavailability after oral administration was <b>non-linear.</b> The <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of clofibric acid (dose range 15 - 150 mg. kg-l) was non-linear (dose-dependent) by either route of administration. The pharmacokinetics of the three drug substances in the two non-human primate species investigsted were compared with published pharmacokinetic data for these compounds in other animal species, including man. The use of the non-human primate as a "predictive model" for the pharmacokinetics of these compounds in humans is considered in relation to these comparative data and the role of "toxicokinetics" in the design and interpretation of toxicity studies during safety evaluation of drugs is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{infections in}} animals impact our food production, leading to {{economic}} losses due to food rejection {{and the need}} for preventive and curative measures. Since the onset of the antibiotic era, the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is causing scares in health care and food producing facilities worldwide. In the search of new therapeutics, re-evaluation of bacteriophage (phage) therapy, using naturally occurring bacterial viruses to tackle infections, is gaining interest. Many studies report about phage therapy success, showing the value and power of these natural viruses. Although phages carry some interesting traits and their basic biology is now well understood, this review argues that phage therapy has not revealed all of its secrets and many parameters remain understudied, making the outcome of phage therapy highly variable depending on the disease incidence. These difficulties include poorly understood mechanisms of phage penetration and distribution throughout the body, the variable expression and accessibility of phage receptors on the bacterial host in in vivo conditions and the unusual (<b>non-linear)</b> phage <b>pharmacokinetics.</b> These parameters are not easily measured in realistic in vivo settings, but are nevertheless important hurdles to overcome the high variability of phage therapy trials. This critical approach is in accordance with Goethe's statement; "Difficulties increase the nearer we get to the goal". However, since the importance of the goal itself also rises, both difficulties and goal justify the need for additional in depth research in this domain. status: publishe...|$|R

The drug is an important option {{in the management of}} many human mycoses including various clinical presentations of aspergillosis. Indeed, the compound exhibits potent in vitro antifungal activity against Aspergillus spp. and shows variable fungicidal effect against the different species and strains. After amphotericin B, itraconazole has been the very first agent, and the first azole antifungal to have demonstrated clinical efficacy in aspergillosis. In vivo, the antifungal efficacy of itraconazole has been demonstrated in several types of aspergillosis both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised animal models. The drug administered in its oral or intravenous formulations displays <b>non-linear</b> plasma <b>pharmacokinetics.</b> Despite best current therapies, the outcome of invasive aspergillosis may remain dismal. Fungal cells can induce enormous damage on a background of immunosuppression. Medical help comes often too slow or is too weak. It will {{be a long time before}} the ideal strategy is found for an effective prophylaxis or for the optimal therapy of disseminated and invasive aspergillosis. In spite of this limitation, itraconazole has a definite chemotherapeutic effect in experimental aspergillosis. Non-comparative clinical data of itraconazole in the treatment of suspected or proven invasive aspergillosis indicate response rates at least similar and possibly superior to those of amphotericin B. Itraconazole has clearly improved the clinical outcome in some of the less immunosuppressed patients with invasive aspergillosis. The experience with itraconazole for induction therapy of invasive aspergillosis is more limited in profoundly neutropenic patients. Itraconazole has an important role for consolidation and maintenance therapy of patients with invasive aspegillosis. Itraconazole oral cyclodextrin solution is particularly suitable in these indications. Novel combination and sequential therapies involving itraconazole with other antifungals are promising. Itraconazole is usually well tolerated, but a potential for drug interactions exists, mediated through the cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 system. This possibility should be considered when itraconazole is used as part of a multi-drug regimen...|$|R
50|$|The ANSM expert {{committee}} {{reported that}} complete FAAH inhibition {{should have been}} achieved by a dose of 1.25 mg remarking that: It appears unjustified to plan to test a dose (100 mg) 80 times higher than that presumed to induce complete and prolonged FAAH inhibition. Further, the ANSM committee remarked that {{the gap between the}} 20 mg and 50 mg dose cohorts, in effect, skipped a dose based on extrapolation from the single dose part of the study, and that the progression to 50 mg was too large a jump. On reviewing the subject data from the trial itself, the committee noted that BIA 10-2474 showed <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> at doses between 40-100 mg (that is, the molecule appeared to be accumulating at higher doses) and that most likely the elimination mechanism had become saturated.

This study aimed to investigate the population pharmacokinetics of voriconazole in adults, including the effect of CYP 2 C 19 genotype and drug–drug interactions. Methods: Non-linear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) was undertaken of six voriconazole studies in healthy volunteers and patients. Dosing simulations to examine influential covariate effects and voriconazole target attainment (2 – 5 mg/L) stratified by CYP 2 C 19 phenotype were performed. Results: We analysed 3352 voriconazole concentration measurements from 240 participants. A two-compart-ment pharmacokinetic model with first-order oral absorption with lag time and Michaelis–Menten elimination best described voriconazole pharmacokinetics. Participants with one or more CYP 2 C 19 loss-of-function (LoF) alleles had a 41. 2 % lower Vmax for voriconazole. Co-administration of phenytoin or rifampicin, St John’s wort or glucocorticoids significantly increased voriconazole elimination. Among patients receiving 200 mg of voricon-azole twice daily, predicted trough concentrations on day 7 were, 2 mg/L for oral and intravenous regimens for 72 % and 63 % of patients without CYP 2 C 19 LoF alleles, respectively, with 49 % and 35 % below this threshold with 300 mg twice daily dosing.

40|$|Estimating the in vivo {{absorption}} {{profile of a}} drug is essential when developing extended-release medications. Such estimates {{can be obtained by}} measuring plasma concentrations over time and inferring the absorption from a model of the drug’s pharmacokinetics. Of particular interest is to predict the bioavailability—the fraction of the drug that is absorbed and enters the systemic circulation. This paper presents a framework for addressing this class of estimation problems and gives advice on the choice of method. In parametric methods, a model is constructed for the absorption process, which can be difficult when the absorption has a complicated profile. Here, we place emphasis on non-parametric methods that avoid making strong assumptions about the absorption. A modern estimation method that can address very general input-estimation problems has previously been presented. In this method, the {{absorption profile}} is modeled as a stochastic process, which is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The applicability of this method for extended-release formulation development is evaluated by analyzing a dataset of Bydureon, an injectable extended-release suspension formulation of exenatide, a GLP- 1 receptor agonist for treating diabetes. This drug is known to have <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics.</b> Its plasma concentration profile exhibits multiple peaks, something that can make parametric modeling challenging, but poses no major difficulties for non-parametric methods. The method is also validated on synthetic data, exploring the effects of sampling and noise on the accuracy of the estimates. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In septic patients, an {{unpredictable}} response to epinephrine {{may be due}} to pharmacodynamic factors or to <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the pharmacokinetics of epinephrine and its determinants in patients with septic shock. Methods Thirty-eight consecutive adult patients with septic shock were prospectively recruited immediately before epinephrine infusion. A baseline blood sample (C 0) was taken to assess endogenous epinephrine, norepinephrine, renin, aldosterone, and plasma cortisol levels before epinephrine infusion. At a fixed cumulative epinephrine dose adjusted to body weight and under steady-state infusion, a second blood sample (C 1) was taken to assess epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations. Data were analyzed using the nonlinear mixed effect modeling software program NONMEM. Results Plasma epinephrine concentrations ranged from 4. 4 to 540 nmol/L at steady-state infusion (range 0. 1 to 7 mg/hr; 0. 026 to 1. 67 μg/kg/min). A one-compartment model adequately described the data. Only body weight (BW) and New Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPSII) at intensive care unit admission significantly influenced epinephrine clearance: CL (L/hr) = 127 × (BW/ 70) 0. 60 × (SAPS II/ 50) - 0. 67. The corresponding half-life was 3. 5 minutes. Endogenous norepinephrine plasma concentration significantly decreased during epinephrine infusion (median (range) 8. 8 (1 – 56. 7) at C 0 vs. 4. 5 (0. 3 – 38. 9) nmol/L at C 1, P < 0. 001). Conclusions Epinephrine pharmacokinetics is linear in septic shock patients, without any saturation at high doses. Basal neurohormonal status does not influence epinephrine pharmacokinetics.

This humanized antibody to HER- 2 {{has been shown to}} have activity as a single agent in a phase II trial of heavily pretreated patients with advanced breast cancer and, in phase III studies, its use with chemotherapy is associated with higher response rates, longer time to progression and improved survival when compared with chemotherapy alone. Retrospective analysis of data from these pivotal trials suggests that attributable benefit of herceptin is greater in those patients who express HER- 2 at the highest levels, that is 3 + expression by immunohistochemistry. Further analysis also implies that cases which are positive for HER- 2 by fluorescent in situ hybridization may also benefit from treatment regardless of whether they express HER- 2 at the 2 + or 3 + level. Use of herceptin as first-line therapy for metastatic disease in early studies suggest that response rates and clinical benefit rate similar to chemotherapy may be achievable and that survival using this sequential approach may not be compromized. Other combinations of herceptin and chemotherapy have been investigated with phase II data suggesting considerable activity with weekly taxol and when combined with navelbine. The <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of herceptin suggest that, as doses increased, half-life increases and may be feasible on a 3 -weekly schedule.

40|$|Background. Gemcitabine (GEM) and {{paclitaxel}} (TAX) are active, non-cross-resistant {{drugs in}} non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We performed a phase I {{study to determine}} the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics of GEM and TAX given weekly in chemo-naive patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients and methods: Escalating doses of GEM (800 - 2000 mg/m(2)) and TAX (60 - 100 mg/m(2)) were administered on days 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks to 35 patients with advanced NSCLC. Plasma pharmacokinetics of TAX and GEM was assessed at the three higher dose-levels. Results: Dose-escalation was discontinued in absence of MTD because of increased cumulative toxicity leading to dose modification or treatment delay at levels 6 and 7 (TAX 100 mg/m(2) plus GEM 1750 and, respectively, 2000 mg/m(2)). Hematological toxicity included grade 4 neutropenia in 3 % of cycles, grade 3 thrombocytopenia in one cycle and febrile neutropenia in three cycles. Maximal non-hemathological toxicity was grade 3 elevation in serum transaminases and grade 2 neuro-sensory toxicity in 8 % and 5 % of cycles, respectively. At the two higher dose-levels a <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of GEM was observed with a remarkable variability of C-max and AUG. No pharmacokinetic interactions were reported. Objectives responses were seen at all dose levels, with an overall response rate of 43 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : 25. 5 %- 62. 6 %) in 30 evaluable patients. Conclusions: The weekly administration of GEM and TAX is very well tolerated, and has shown promising antitumor activity in NSCLC. In view of the cumulative toxicity and of the pharmacokinetic profile of GEM, doses of 1500 mg/m(2) of GEM and 100 mg/m 2 of TAX are recommended for phase II studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-linear}} plasma pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel {{in patients}} {{has been well}} established, however, the exact underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. We have previously shown that the non-linear plasma pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in mice results from Cremophor EL. To investigate whether Cremophor EL also {{plays a role in}} the <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of paclitaxel in patients, we have established its pharmacokinetics in patients receiving paclitaxel by 3 -, 24 - or 96 -h intravenous infusion. The pharmacokinetics of Cremophor EL itself was non-linear as the clearance (Cl) in the 3 -h schedules was significantly lower than when using the longer 24 - or 96 -h infusions (Cl 175 – 3 h = 42. 8 ± 24. 9 ml h− 1 m− 2; Cl 175 – 24 h = 79. 7 ± 24. 3; P = 0. 035 and Cl 135 – 3 h = 44. 1 ± 21. 8 ml h− 1 m− 1; Cl 140 – 96 h = 211. 8 ± 32. 0; P < 0. 001). Consequently, the maximum plasma levels were much higher (0. 62 %) in the 3 -h infusions than when using longer infusion durations. By using an in vitro equilibrium assay and determination in plasma ultrafiltrate we have established that the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma is inversely related with the Cremophor EL level. Despite its relatively low molecular weight, no Cremophor EL was found in the ultrafiltrate fraction. Our results strongly suggest that entrapment of paclitaxel in plasma by Cremophor EL, probably by inclusion in micelles, is the cause of the apparent nonlinear plasma pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. This mechanism of a (pseudo-) non-linearity contrasts previous postulations about saturable distribution and elimination kinetics and means that we must re-evaluate previous assumptions on pharmacokinetics–pharmacodynamics relationships. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{pharmacokinetics}} of the hypoxic radio-sensitizer nimorazole {{were studied}} in 19 individuals after single oral doses of between 0. 5 - 3. 5 g. HPLC measurements showed, after a rapid absorption, a linear relationship between peak plasma concentration and given dose. Mean elimination half life was 3. 1 h. A tendency to a dose-dependent {{variation in the}} apparent volume of distribution, total body clearance and elimination half life suggest <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of nimorazole. Tumour concentrations measured in 5 patients gave tumour/plasma ratios between 0. 8 - 1. 3. No toxicity was observed. The results indicate that nimorazole may have potential as a clinically useful hypoxic radiosensitizer. Recent studies in experimental tumours in vivo suggest that nimorazole (1 -(N-p-ethyl-morpholine) - 5 -nitro-imidazole) may possess hypoxic cell radiosensitizing properties {{similar to that of}} misonidazole (MISO) when given in moderate doses (Overgaard et al., 1982 b). At tumour concentrations of 50 g g- 1 both drugs were found to yield enhancement ratios of 1. 4 in a C 3 H mammary carcinoma (Overgaard et al., 1982 b). Clinical studies of plasma and tumour concentrations indicate that an equivalent dose level in humans would require- 1. 5 - 2. 0 gm- 2 MISO on the likely assumption that a tumour-plasma ratio of about unity can be achieved (Ash & Schmidt, 1980; Dische, 1982; Rich et al., 1981). Such a dose cannot be given daily in conjunction with conventional radiation fractionation schedules due to excessive doselimiting toxicity, primarily expressed as peripheral neuropathy (Dische et al., 1978; Kogelnik 1980; Phillips et al., 1981).

The drug was administered by short-term (10 - 60 min) intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. The doses ranged from 15 to 2250 mg/m 2. At doses higher than 1500 mg/m 2 the areas under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC) increased non-proportionally, while the total body clearance (Cl 1) dropped substantially, indicating <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> of the drug. Brequinar sodium showed a triphasic decay of plasma concentrations with half-life ranges of 11. 1 - 36. 6 min, 1. 7 - 6. 9 h and 12. 5 - 25. 0 h, respectively. The volume of distribution (Vdss) ranged from 4. 4 to 10. 6 l/m 2. The total body clearance (Cl 1) ranged from 6. 9 to 22. 1 ml/min with a small contribution of the renal clearance (0. 04 - 0. 4 ml/min). Up to 7 days, the cumulative urinary excretion (CUE) and the cumulative fecal excretion (CFE) ranged from 0. 4 to 8. 3 % and from 7. 7 to 18. 3 % of the dose, respectively. There was evidence {{for the presence of}} drug metabolites in urine and feces. There was no drug accumulation with repeated administration of Brequinar sodium by the above mentioned drug schedule. The ratio between the plasma AUC at the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) in mana nd that at the mouse ld 10 was 0. 8, while the ratio between the respective doses was 5. 7. The ratios between the AUC in patients and that at the mouse ld 10 were applied to guide dose escalation in the phase I study. The results of the above mentioned pharmacokinetic studies were useful for the choice of an optimal schedule for phase II trials of Brequinar sodium. © 1990.

40|$|Prednisolone and {{prednisone}} {{are integral}} components of induction and maintenance immunosuppressive regimens in solid organ transplantation. The pharmacokinetics of these agents are extremely complex. Prednisolone is the active drug moiety while prednisone {{is both a}} pro-drug and inactive metabolite of prednisolone. Within the dosage range used in transplantation, prednisolone and prednisone exhibit concentration-dependent <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> when parameters are measured with reference to total drug concentration. Dose dependency disappears when free (unbound) prednisolone is measured. Altered organ function, changing biochemistry and use {{of a number of}} concomitant medicines in transplantation appear to lead to pharmacokinetic differences in transplant recipients compared with other patient groups. Greater than threefold variability in dose-adjusted exposure to total prednisolone in transplant recipients is evident. Time post-transplant, hepatic and renal dysfunction, patient age, sex, bodyweight, serum albumin concentration, concomitant medication exposure, various disease states and genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes and drug transporters have sometimes been associated with prednisolone pharmacokinetic variability. The clinical impact of corticosteroid therapy on the disposition of ciclosporin, tacrolimus and sirolimus and the impact of different immunosuppressant therapy combinations on prednisolone exposure needs to be further elucidated. Patient response patterns to prednisolone are consistent with delayed and indirect mechanisms of corticosteroid action involving modification of nuclear transcription and protein synthesis. Many adverse effects have been linked with prednisolone and prednisone therapy, but not all of these have been investigated thoroughly in transplant populations. Dyslipidaemia, growth restriction, diabetogenesis, hypertension and cataracts are well studied toxicities. Evidence is less clear for prednisolone-induced osteonecrosis, obesity and hypertriglyceridaemia. There have been some reports of a relationship between prednisolone pharmacokinetics and incidence of acute rejection, Cushing 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome and adverse cardiovascular and metabolic events. Dosing of prednisolone and prednisone in transplantation is typically empirical and varies significantly across transplant centres. Currently, authoritative guidelines are conflicting in their opinions regarding corticosteroid avoidance and early discontinuation in adult kidney transplantation. Overall, data suggest the promise of corticosteroid-free immunosuppression in paediatric patients. Further investigation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prednisolone and prednisone in transplant recipients based on new chromatography assay techniques and free drug measurement, population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling approaches, genetic testing and larger studies in patients on modern day immunosuppressant protocols may lead to better individualization of corticosteroid therapy in the future...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2010. Major: Medicinal Chemistry. Advisor: Rory P. Remmel. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 143 pages. Ill. (some col.) The determination of pharmacokinetic parameters is crucial both for clinical studies and {{early in the}} drug discovery and development. This thesis describes a clinical pharmacokinetics study of one anticonvulsant drug, i. e. phenytoin (PHT) and the early screening study of potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer. PHT is extensively bound to plasma proteins, is excreted from the body as oxidative metabolites in the urine, and exhibits a <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> profile. In this study, stable-labeled PHT was given either intravenously or intramuscularly. The simultaneous administration of oral and IV PHT enables a direct determination of the pharmacokinetic parameters of clearance, volume, half-life, and absolute oral bioavailability. Urine samples from epilepsy patients who were on maintenance therapy of PHT were collected from 0 - 12 hours and 12 - 24 hours after a single daily dose to measure the two principal PHT urinary metabolites, 5 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 5 -phenylhydantoin (p-HPPH) and 5 -(3, 4 -dihydroxy- 1, 5 -cyclohexadien- 1 -yl) - 5 -phenylhydantoin (DHD). An isocratic HPLC-NI-APCI-MS method was used to quantify metabolites in urine. A weak, but significant, Spearman Rank Correlation was observed between the total urinary metabolites recovered and the oral bioavailability (p-value = 0. 00924, r 2 = 0. 166). The percent of dose recovered in urine ranged from 35. 4 % ± 15. 7 % in young adult patients (age 21 - 49 years old) and 32. 9 % ± 15. 0 % in patients of age 65 - 93 years indicating highly variable absorption. In contrast, absolute bioavailability was 0. 864 ± 0. 194 and 0. 925 ± 0. 252 for the two groups, {{as determined by the}} stable-isotope technique. Unaccounted biliary-fecal excretion of p-HPPH glucuronide, subjects’ noncompliance, and incomplete urine collection are possible explanations. Consequently, bioavailability is best determined by stable-isotope method. Chapter 2 of this thesis illustrates the early screening study of chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer. The rationale of this study was attempting to inhibit the metabolism of 5 -androstane- 3 , 17 β-diol (3 -Adiol). A metabolite of dihydrotestosterone, 3 -Adiol, inhibits LNCaP prostate cell proliferation in the presence of Estrogen Receptor . CYP 7 B 1 is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the 6  and 7  hydroxylations of 3 -Adiol in prostate. In this study, expression and purification of human CYP 7 B 1 in E. coli was attempted. Despite spectroscopic evidence of P 450 expression, the enzyme failed to turn over its endogenous substrate, DHEA to 7 -hydroxy DHEA...|$|E
40|$|The {{extracts}} from {{the roots of}} Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen) are widely and traditionally used {{in the treatment of}} angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarct, hyperlipidemia and stroke in China and other Asian countries. In this study, we have investigated the role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the intestinal absorption of tanshinone IIA (TSA), a major active constituent of Danshen, using several in vitro and in vivo models. The oral bioavailability of TSA was about 2. 9 - 3. 4 % in rats, with <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> when its dosage increased. In a single pass rat intestinal perfusion model, the permeability coefficients (Papp) based on TSA disappearance from the luminal perfusates (Plumen) were 6. 2 - to 7. 2 -fold higher (P < 0. 01) than those based on drug appearance in mesenteric venous blood (Pblood). The Pblood, but not Plumen, was significantly increased when co-perfused with verapamil, or quinidine (both P-gp inhibitors). The uptake and efflux of TSA in confluent Caco- 2 cells were significantly altered in the presence of verapamil, quinidine, MK- 571, or probenecid. The transport of TSA across Caco- 2 monolayers was pH-, temperature- and ATP-dependent. Furthermore, the transport from the apical (AP) to basolateral (BL) side of the Caco- 2 monolayers was 3. 3 - to 8. 5 -fold lower than that from the BL to AP side, but such a polarized transport was attenuated by co-incubated verapamil or quinidine. A polarized transport was also observed in the control MDCKII cells and more apparent in MDR 1 -MDCKII monolayers, with the Papp values of TSA in the BL-AP direction being 7 - to 9 -fold higher in MDR 1 -MDCKII monolayers than those in the control MDCKII cells. Moreover, TSA significantly inhibited P-gp-mediated transport of digoxin in P-gp-overexpressing membrane vesicles with an IC 50 of 2. 6 μM, but stimulated vanadate-sensitive P-gp ATPase activity with estimated Km and Vmax values of 10. 70 ± 0. 69 μM and 67. 65 ± 1. 31 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. TSA was extensively metabolized to tanshinone IIB (TSB), and two other oxidative metabolites in rat liver microsomes, but the formation rate of TSB in rat intestinal microsomes was only about 1 / 10 of that in liver microsomes. These findings indicate that TSA is a substrate and reversing agent for P-gp; and P-gp-mediated efflux of TSA into the gut lumen and the first-pass metabolism contribute to the low oral bioavailability. Further studies are needed to explore the role of other drug transporters and first-pass metabolism in the low bioavailability of TSA...|$|E
30|$|Paclitaxel is an {{extensively}} used {{chemotherapeutic agent}} that suffers from very poor solubility. As such, the commercial intravenous formulation of paclitaxel requires {{the inclusion of}} Cremophor EL {{in order to keep}} it solubilized. The use of Cremophor EL in the intravenous paclitaxel formulation has introduced a number of unique undesirable features including <b>non-linear</b> <b>pharmacokinetics</b> [37] and more importantly hypersensitivity reactions which require anti-allergic pre-medication with corticosteroids and antihistamines [4]. Due to these undesirable properties, {{there is a need to}} explore alternate formulations. We had previously evaluated the use of nanosuspension to enable intravenous delivery of ten poorly soluble compounds in a cassette dosing format [34]. In this intravenous cassette study, no changes in pharmacokinetics were observed with nanosuspension delivery compared to the use of a solution formulation with high organic content. In contrast, our current work with paclitaxel nanosuspension delivery shows substantial alterations in the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel compared with the standard Cremophor EL formulation (Figures  3 and 4). Plasma clearance was substantially higher (approximately 30 -fold) with nanosuspension delivery. Since paclitaxel was given intravenously, alterations in plasma pharmacokinetics are attributed entirely to alterations in paclitaxel distribution and/or systemic elimination. Distribution was clearly different with higher tissue to plasma ratios in the spleen, liver, and tumor following nanosuspension delivery (Figure  5, Table  2). In particular, a high concentration of paclitaxel was present in the liver. This high sustained concentration of paclitaxel in the liver may result in an overestimation of plasma clearance since plasma concentrations drop rapidly yet drug was not really eliminated from the body, but rather trapped in the liver. An explanation for the high concentrations of drug in tissue may be that the nanoparticles in the nanosuspension may be dissolving slower than anticipated in vivo. Our theoretical estimation of the required particle size for instantaneous dissolution was based on assumed sink conditions. We did not observe alterations in pharmacokinetics in our previous cassette doing study [34] with intravenous administration of ten poorly soluble compounds. However, in our previous study, low doses (0.5  mg/kg) of each compound were administered, and therefore, the assumption of sink conditions in vivo was more likely. Our current study utilizes a 40 -fold higher intravenous dose of paclitaxel (20  mg/kg). At this dose, it is conceivable that non-sink conditions likely occurred in vivo since plasma concentrations that were achieved using the commercial formulation (see Figure  3) clearly exceed the plasma solubility of paclitaxel (i.e., 40  μg/mL). The occurrence of non-sink dissolution conditions following intravenous administration would result in a slower dissolution rate that would not be considered ‘instantaneous.’ Our data are consistent with slowly dissolving nanoparticles being taken up into organs by phagocytic cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system that are abundant in tissues such as the liver and spleen [38, 39]. One possible way to overcome the above issue is to use infusion instead of bolus injection (upon fully determining the PK/PD) to allow better dissolution of the nanoparticles, where recently, a successful use of nanoparticles to deliver drugs to high plasma concentration was reported [32]. An additional factor that may contribute to the observed difference in pharmacokinetics is that there are known non-linearities in pharmacokinetics caused by Cremophor EL impacting both paclitaxel distribution and elimination [40]. Since our nanosuspension formulation contains only a very small percentage (0.1 %) of Cremophor EL compared to the standard commercial formulation, less non-linearity is expected with nanosuspension delivery.|$|E
