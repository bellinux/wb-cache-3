50|$|One {{benefit of}} {{rotational}} molding {{is the ability}} to experiment, particularly with wall thicknesses. Cost is entirely dependent on wall thickness, with thicker walls being costlier and more time consuming to produce. While the wall can have nearly any thickness, designers must remember that the thicker the wall, the more material and time will be required, increasing costs. In some cases, the plastics may significantly degrade due to extended periods at high temperature. Also, different materials have different thermal conductivity, meaning they require different times in the heating chamber and cooling chamber. Ideally, the part will be tested to use the minimum thickness required for the application. This minimum will then be established as a <b>nominal</b> <b>thickness.</b>|$|E
50|$|Boundary walls include privacy walls, boundary-marking walls on property, {{and town}} walls. These intergrade into fences. The {{conventional}} differentiation {{is that a}} fence is of minimal thickness and often open in nature, while a wall is usually more than a <b>nominal</b> <b>thickness</b> and is completely closed, or opaque. More to the point, an exterior structure of wood or wire is generally called a fence—but one of masonry is a wall. A common term for both is barrier, which is convenient for structures that are partly wall and partly fence—for example the Berlin Wall. Another kind of wall-fence ambiguity is the ha-ha—which is set below ground level to protect a view, yet acts as a barrier (to cattle, for example).|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} four different preparations of plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on Ti 6 Al 4 V substrates in static Hank's {{balanced salt solution}} was investigated using dc potentiodynamic and ac impedance techniques. Two different <b>nominal</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> 50 m and 200 m, and two different spraying conditions, were considered. The electrochemical impedance experiments proved this technique to be very suitable for {{the investigation of the}} electrochemical behavior of surgical implant alloys when they are coated with HA, which is characterized by the dissolution and passivation characteristics of the underlying metal substrate. Because the coatings are porous, ionic paths between the electrolytic medium and the base material can eventually be produced, resulting in the corrosion of the coated metal. Differences in the corrosion resistance of the coated materials were detected, and a relevant model for the description of the coating degradation in the biosimulating solution was proposed. The model consisted of the description of the coated system in terms of a two-layer model of the surface film.

The reasons for this low thickness are deceptively complex, but the potential insulation is good essentially because {{there can be no}} convection or gaseous conduction in a vacuum.|$|R
