25|$|Windows Explorer's task {{panel has}} been removed, {{integrating}} the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane {{on the left}} contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated Search Folders. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the <b>Navigation</b> <b>Pane.</b> Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as author or subject) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the Details Pane that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The <b>Navigation</b> <b>Pane</b> contains a list of most common folders (the Favorites) for quick navigation. It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as virtual ones. By default it contains links to folders such as Documents and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The Preview Pane can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the Windows Imaging Component is installed. Also, if an application installs Preview handlers (like Office 2007 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.|$|E

40|$|An Interactive {{electronic}} Atlas (IeA) {{was developed}} to assist first-year nursing students with interpretation of laboratory-based prosected cadaveric material. It was designed, using pedagogically sound principles, as a student-centered resource accessible to students {{from a wide range}} of learning backgrounds. It consisted of a highly simplified interactive interface limited to essential anatomical structures and was intended for use in a blended learning situation. The IeA 2 ̆ 7 s nine modules mirrored the body systems covered in a Nursing Biosciences course, with each module comprising a maximum of 10 pages using the same template: an image displaying a cadaveric specimen and, in most cases, a corresponding anatomical model with <b>navigation</b> <b>panes</b> (menus) on one side. Cursor movement over the image or clicking the menu highlighted the structure with a transparent overlay and revealed a succinct functional description. The atlas was complemented by a multiple-choice database of nearly 1, 000 questions using IeA images. Students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of usability and utility were measured by survey (n = 115; 57...|$|R
40|$|Browsers {{are crucial}} to make {{software}} models accessible. Problem domains often require multiple views to access, interpret and edit the underlying elements. However, browsers are expensive to create and burdensome to maintain. Glamour is a framework dedicated to building browsers. It uses a components and connectors architecture and it comes with an embedded domain specific language that allows the user to build browsers quickly. It accommodates any kind of domain models via on-the-fly transformations and it enforces a strict and explicit separation between {{the presentation of the}} data and the navigation flow between different entities. Glamour is platform independent and can be used with various GUI frameworks such as Morphic or Widgetry as backend. For details, we refer the reader to the Masters thesis of the first author [Bun 09]. 2 Glamour in Action As a practical example of Glamour we show how to implement a simple Smalltalk code browser (figure 1) with less than 20 lines of code. A Glamour script consists of two parts. The first part defines the overall location of the different panes in the window. The secondpart defines how the panes should present the entities and what the <b>navigation</b> between these <b>panes</b> is. First we specify that the browser has a table layout. The upper part contains the class tree and the method for each class and the lower part displays the source code. The following code defines two rows. In the first row we create two columns: one for the classes and one for the selectors. The second row is for displaying the source code. 1 browser: = GLMTableLayoutBrowser new...|$|R

5000|$|A new {{interface}} {{referred to}} as the Backstage view is included in all Office 2010 apps and replaces the Office menu that was introduced in Office 2007. The Backstage view is designed to facilitate access to file management tasks, including compatibility, metadata, permission, printing, and sharing tasks, and to consolidate them within a single location. The term [...] "backstage" [...] refers to the area behind the stage in a theatre where behind the scenes activities and preparations commence—accordingly, the backstage view in Office is an interface dedicated to document activities and preparations prior to saving or sharing. The Backstage view consists of both a left-hand <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> and an adjacent main pane. The <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> includes a series of vertically arranged common commands such as commands to open or save files, and tabs that, when opened, expose file management tasks and contextual information within the main pane. A customizable number of recently opened documents can also be displayed within the <b>navigation</b> <b>pane.</b>|$|E

50|$|Windows Explorer in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 also {{introduces}} a new layout. The Task Panes from Windows XP are {{replaced with a}} toolbar on top and a <b>Navigation</b> <b>pane</b> on the left. The <b>Navigation</b> <b>pane</b> contains commonly accessed folders and preconfigured Search Folders. Eight different views are available to view files and folders, including Extra Large, Large, Medium, Small, List, Details, Tiles, and Content. In addition, column headers now appear in all icon viewing modes, unlike Windows XP where they only appear in the Details icon viewing mode. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the <b>Navigation</b> <b>Pane.</b> The Preview Pane enables users to preview files (e.g., documents or media files) without opening them. If an application, such as Office 2007, installs preview handlers for file types, then these files can also be edited within the Preview Pane itself.|$|E
50|$|In the {{database}} container or <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> in Access 2007 and later versions, the system automatically categorizes each object by type (e.g., table, query, macro). Many Access developers use the Leszynski naming convention, {{though this is}} not universal; it is a programming convention, not a DBMS-enforced rule. It is particularly helpful in VBA where references to object names may not indicate its data type (e.g. tbl for tables, qry for queries).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> {{has been}} {{enhanced}} in Windows XP to support [...] "simple folder view" [...] which when turned on hides the dotted lines that connect folders and subfolders and makes folders browsable with single click while still keeping double clicking {{on in the}} right pane. Single clicking in simple folder view auto expands the folder and clicking another folder automatically expands that folder and collapses the previous one.|$|E
5000|$|Windows Vista, by default, {{references}} {{the profile}} of the user who originally created a saved search as part of the query's scope, which includes the disk partition. This design choice does not prevent saved searches from being shared with other users, but it prevents them from operating on different partitions or user profiles. While users can manually modify the contents of a saved search so that the scope references the %USERPROFILE% environment variable, which will enable it to operate on other machines or profiles regardless of the original author or location, Microsoft has released a SearchMelt Creator utility that automates this process for the user.In early development builds of Windows Vista, there existed pre-configured Search Folders for the default user profile folders (e.g., Documents, Music, and Pictures) that replaced the links to these folders seen on the Windows Start menu. When browsing directories in Windows Explorer, the <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> would feature predefined Search Folders that were relevant to a currently viewed directory. When viewing the Documents folder, for example, the <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> would populate with individual Search Folders based on authors of documents, their ratings, their keywords, their types, and documents that were recently changed.|$|E
50|$|In Windows 7, several {{features}} {{have been}} removed from Windows Explorer, including the collapsible folder pane, overlay icon for shared items, remembering individual folder window sizes and positions, free disk space on the status bar, icons on the command bar, ability to disable Auto Arrange and Align to Grid, sortable column headings in other views except details view, ability to disable full row selection in details view, automatic horizontal scrolling and scrollbar in the <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> and maintaining selection when sorting from the Edit menu.|$|E
50|$|Selecting a {{directory}} in the <b>Navigation</b> <b>pane</b> {{on the left}} designates it as the current directory, displaying its contents in the Contents pane on the right. However, expanding (+) or collapsing (-) {{a portion of the}} tree without selecting {{a directory}} will not alter the contents of the right pane. The exception to this behavior applies when collapsing a parent of the current directory, in which case the selection is refocused on the collapsed parent directory, thus altering the list in the Contents pane.|$|E
50|$|Version 11 has {{improved}} synchronization features for loading content onto PlaysForSure-compatible portable players. WMP 11 supports reverse-synchronization, by which media {{present on the}} portable device can be replicated back to the PC. Shuffle Sync {{can be used to}} randomize content synced with the portable device, Multi PC Sync to synchronize portable device content across multiple PCs and Guest Sync to synchronize different content from multiple PCs with the portable device. Portable devices appear in the <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> of the library where their content can be browsed and searched.|$|E
50|$|The task pane is {{displayed}} {{on the left side}} of the window instead of the traditional folder tree view when the <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> is turned off. It presents the user with a list of common actions and destinations that are relevant to the current directory or file(s) selected. For instance, when in a directory containing mostly pictures, a set of “Picture tasks” is shown, offering the options to display these pictures as a slide show, to print them, or to go online to order prints. Conversely, a folder containing music files would offer options to play those files in a media player, or to go online to purchase music.|$|E
50|$|On May 14, 2006, Microsoft {{released}} the first Community Technology Preview (CTP) version of Expression Web. On September 5, 2006, Microsoft released Beta 1. Beta 1 removed {{most of the}} FrontPage-proprietary (non-standard) features such as bots (use of FPSE features for server-side scripting), parts, functions, themes, automatic generation of navigation buttons, FrontPage forms, <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> to build a web site's hierarchy, and other non-standard features available in CTP 1. The Release To Manufacturing version was made available on December 4, 2006. The first and the only service pack was published in December 2007. Expression Web {{does not have the}} form validation controls for HTML fields like FrontPage, but supports validator controls for ASP.NET.|$|E

50|$|Windows Explorer in Windows 7 {{supports}} file libraries that aggregate {{content from}} various locations - including shared folders on networked systems if the shared folder has been indexed by the host system - and present {{them in a}} unified view. The libraries hide the actual location the file is stored in. Searching in a library automatically federates the query to the remote systems, in addition to searching on the local system, so that files on the remote systems are also searched. Unlike search folders, Libraries are backed by a physical location which allows files to be saved in the Libraries. Such files are transparently saved in the backing physical folder. The default save location for a library may be configured by the user, as can the default view layout for each library. Libraries are generally stored in the Libraries special folder, which allows them to be displayed on the <b>navigation</b> <b>pane.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Windows Media Player 11, the Quick Access Panel {{was removed}} and {{replaced}} with an Explorer-style <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> on the left which can be customized for each library to show the user selected media or metadata categories, with contents appearing on the right, in a graphical manner with thumbnails featuring album art or other art depicting the item. Missing album art can be added directly to the placeholders in the Library itself (though the program re-renders all album art imported this way into 1x1 pixel ratio, 200x200 resolution jpegs). There are separate Tiles, Icons, Details or Extended Tiles views for Music, Pictures, Video and Recorded TV which can be set individually from the navigation bar. Entries for Pictures and Video show their thumbnails. Version 11 also introduced the ability to search and display results on-the-fly as characters are being entered, without waiting for Enter key to be hit. Incremental search results are refined based on further characters that are typed. Stacking allows graphical representations of how many albums there are in a specific category or folder. The pile appears larger as the category contains more albums. The List pane includes an option to prompt the user to remove items skipped in a playlist upon save or skip them only during playback.|$|E
50|$|Windows Explorer has {{received}} numerous minor enhancements that improve its overall functionality. The Explorer's search {{box and the}} address bar can be resized. Folders such as those on the desktop or user profile folders can be hidden in the <b>navigation</b> <b>pane</b> to reduce clutter. A new Content view is added, which shows thumbnails and metadata together. A new button to toggle the Preview Pane {{has been added to}} the toolbar. The button to create a new folder has been moved from the Organize menu and onto the toolbar. List view provides more space between items than in Windows Vista. Finally, storage space consumption bars that were only present for hard disks in Windows Vista are now shown for removable storage devices. Other areas of the shell have also received similar fine-tunings: Progress bars and overlay icons may now appear on an application's button on the taskbar to better alert the user of the status of the application or the work in progress. File types for which property handlers or iFilters are installed are re-indexed by default. Previously, adding submenus to shell context menus or customizing the context menu's behavior for a certain folder was only possible by installing a form of plug-in known as shell extensions. In Windows 7 however, computer-savvy users can do so by editing Windows Registry and/or desktop.ini files. Additionally, a new shell API was introduced designed to simplify the writing of context menu shell extensions by software developers.|$|E
