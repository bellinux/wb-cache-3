5000|$|Infectious <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is {{a disease}} of large animals, {{especially}} sheep, caused by Clostridium novyi infection. The primary infection is intestinal and transferred by the faecal-oral route. Spores of C. novyi escape from the gut and lodge in the liver, where they remain dormant until some injury creates anaerobic conditions for them to germinate, causing local necrosis and widespread damage to the microvascular system, resulting in subcutaneous bleeding and blackening of the skin, hence the common name [...] "black disease." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the course}} of the novel, working in the {{hospital}} takes a psychological toll on Basch. His personality and outlook change, and he has outbursts of temper. He has adulterous trysts with various nurses (portrayed in great detail) and social service workers (nicknamed the [...] "Sociable Cervix") and his relationship with his girlfriend Berry suffers. A colleague, Wayne Potts, who had been constantly badgered by the upper hierarchy and haunted by a patient (nicknamed [...] "The Yellow Man" [...] for his fulminant <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> who goes comatose and eventually dies possibly because Potts had not put him on steroids), commits suicide. Basch becomes more callous and he secretly euthanizes a patient, a man called Saul the leukemic tailor, whose illness had gone into remission but was back in the hospital in incredible pain and begging for death. Basch becomes more and more emotionally unstable, until finally his friends force him to attend a mime performance by Marcel Marceau, where he has an experience of catharsis and recovers his emotional stability.|$|E
40|$|Severe {{adverse effects}} due to 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) are {{reported}} {{with increasing frequency}} in the medical literature. The signs of acute toxicity most often seen are fulminant hyperthermia, hyperexcitatory states, acute renal failure and hyponatraemia. In 1992, hepatotoxicity was also described with unexplained jaundice and hepatomegaly after ingestion of MDMA. We report a case of severe toxic hepatitis following ingestion of MDMA with fulminant hepatic failure which required auxiliary liver transplantation. The diagnosis was <b>necrotic</b> toxic <b>hepatitis</b> following ecstasy ingestion. The outcome was successful, and the patient was discharged from ICU 20 d after surgery. Hepatotoxic effects of MDMA seem infrequent, but may be lethal; liver transplantation is the ultimate therapeutic option in some cases...|$|R
40|$|Novel Duck Reovirus (NDRV) is {{the major}} causative agent of the Duck <b>Necrotic</b> Hemorrhagic <b>Hepatitis</b> (DNHH), it causes huge {{economic}} losses to the duck industry in China. The affected ducks (including Muscovy, Mule, Peking ducks and Sheldrake) manifest the main clinical symptoms with hemorrhage and necrosis in the hepatitis which can cause high mortality in ducks. Develop a rapid and simple detection is {{the most efficient way}} for prevention and control the disease in short time. In this study, a Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was employed for detecting the disease. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay was 1000 folds greater and the detection limit was 2. 8 x 10 - 3 ng RNA. In addition, the specificity results shown that it was no any cross-reaction with other duck’s viruses. The RT-LAMP assay may be a good method for specific diagnosis of NDRV infection in fewer well-equipped laboratories, especially in farm or rural veterinary clinics...|$|R
40|$|During routine {{harvest of}} murine {{resident}} peritoneal cells for macrophage function assays the authors recently noted that mice showed a 3 - 4 -fold spontaneous increase {{in number of}} peritoneal cells within 1 week of being placed {{in one of their}} animal rooms. While the mice appeared clinically normal, the collected macrophages had highly convoluted membranes, showed enhanced spontaneous tumor cell killing, and showed increased erythrophagocytosis. Histopathologic findings included mild peritonitis and occasional foci of individual hepatocyte necrosis. The results of routine murine serologic studies and bacterial cultures of the peritoneal cavity were negative. Immunosuppressed mice placed in this room showed severe hepatic necrosis within 4 days, and ultrastructural particles characteristic of corona virus could be demonstrated in the <b>necrotic</b> foci. Mouse <b>hepatitis</b> virus (MHV) was isolated from these livers. Untreated mice showed positive MHV titers, as detected by the enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) after 21 days in the room. This episode demonstrates that MHV have profound effects on macrophage parameters while causing few clinical signs or histopathologic alterations. Secondly, the complement fixation assay for MHV as included in routine viral screens appears relatively insensitive for detecting outbreaks of MHV...|$|R

It is advised that chickens meant for feeding captive-reared pythons or other wildlife must be certified worm-free to avoid such economic and wildlife resource loss in future...|$|E
40|$|HHV type 6 {{has been}} {{reported}} with enhanced pathogenicity in immunocompromised patients. Herein, we report about a two-yr-old girl who experienced primary HHV 6 infection after liver transplantation. She clinically presented with graft rejection and <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> as well as high fever, pneumonitis with respiratory failure and a rash. Therapy with cidofovir of 5 mg/kg per wk did not show improvement, so that a full pharmacokinetic profile of cidofovir was performed. It demonstrated enhanced body weight normalized clearance of cidofovir and cidofovir dosage was augmented to 12 mg/kg per wk to reach adequate drug exposure. With additional reduction of immunosuppression, the patient dramatically improved and liver function stabilized...|$|E
40|$|Seven rabbits {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus were examined haematologically and histologically. Haematologically, activated {{partial thromboplastin time}} and prothrombin time were markedly prolonged in the terminal phase of the disease, just prior to death (all the animals died between 27 and 40 hr after inoculation with rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus). There was an increase in the titre of fibrin degradation products and a decrease in antithrombin III activity during the same interval. Acute <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in many organs, including the lung, kidney, spleen and heart were the characteristic histopathological changes. Thus, the haematological and histological changes suggested that DIC was induced by rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus infection. Severe liver necrosis was considered to be a factor causing DIC by inducing a hypercoagulable condition in the systemic blood circulation...|$|E
40|$|Eight European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) {{found dead}} {{throughout}} Greece were examined {{for the presence}} of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS). The diagnosis of the disease was established by macro- and microscopical lesions, and RT-PCR analysis. The most common lesions, such as <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> were observed in the liver, while congestion and haemorrhages were present mainly in lungs and tracheal mucosa. To determine the extent ofgenetic heterogeneity of the EBHSVisolates, a 265 bp fragment of the capsidprotein (VP 60) gene of the eight isolates were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Greek isolates were indeedEBHS viruses and that EBHSVand RHDVdiffered by an average ofapproximately 39 %. The maximum nucleotide variation amongst all the EBHS viruses was 15 %, whereas variation within the RHDVgroup amountsto 11 %. Apart from GRE- 8, all the Greek viruses fell on a single geneticlineage and differed between 1 and 7 %; however, bootstrap confidence limits were particularly low on all the branches leading {{from the base of the}} EBHSVlineage to GRE- 8 (viz. 20, 13 and 9 %) isolates was better supported (65 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Homologous and {{heterologous}} haemagglutination-inhibition (HAI), complement-fixation (CF), immunodiffusion (ID) {{and mouse}} neutralization tests were {{performed with the}} Lunyo (LUN) and a Zimbabwean strain of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus, the prototype and a South African strain of Arumowot (AMT) virus and prototype strains of Gordil (GOR), Saint-Floris (SAF) and Gabek Forest (GF) viruses, using immune mouse ascitic fluids prepared against these viruses. Reactions of identity occurred in all tests between LUN and the Zimbabwean strains of RVF and between the two strains of AMT virus. Otherwise, cross-reactions occurred between all the phleboviruses in HAI tests, while reactions in CF, ID and neutralization tests were monospecific for virus serotypes, except that weak cross-reaction occurred between GOR and SAF viruses in CF and ID tests. Four sheep infected subcutaneously with the Zimbabwean strain of RVF virus developed transient fever, viraemia, leucopaenia, relative thrombocytopaenia, haemoconcentration and raised serum enzyme levels, which indicated that the sheep had developed <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Disseminated focal <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> was confirmed in a sheep killed for examination on day 4 post-infection. The other three sheep recovered uneventfully after only mild depression and anorexia. Groups of three sheep infected with SAF, GOR, AMT and GF viruses had no demonstrable viraemia or other sign of infection or illness, except that the sheep infected with AMT developed mild fever lasting less than 24 h. Antibody responses were monitored at intervals {{over a period of}} 24 weeks in all sheep by homologous and heterologous HAI, CF and cell culture neutralization (CPENT) tests. Homologous antibody responses were marked in the RVF-infected sheep and their sera cross-reacted strongly in HAI tests with antigens of the other viruses. The sera of the RVF-infected sheep cross-reacted less markedly in CF and CPENT tests. Homologous antibody responses were poor in all the sheep infected with phleboviruses other than RVF, and the cross-reactivity of their sera for RVF antigen or virus was negligible. All sheep were challenged with RVF virus 48 weeks after their initial infection. The sheep which had originally been infected with RVF virus were immune and developed neither fever nor viraemia. All other sheep developed fever, viraemia and antibodies to RVF virus. It was concluded that the African phleboviruses, other than RVF, are unlikely to cause disease in livestock or to induce antibodies which could cause confusion in the diagnosis of RVF...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to report on a fatal case of feline toxoplasmosis with coinfection with the feline leukemia virus (FeLV). A domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) presented intense dyspnea and died three days later. In the necropsy, the lungs were firm, without collapse and with many white areas; moderate lymphadenomegaly and splenomegaly were also observed. The histopathological examination showed severe necrotic interstitial bronchopneumonia and mild <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> associated with intralesional cysts and tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii that were positive by anti-T. gondii immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation. The bone marrow showed chronic myeloid leukemia and the neoplastic cells were positive by anti-FeLV IHC evaluation. DNA extracted from lungs was positive for T. gondii by PCR targeting REP- 529. T. gondii was characterized by PCR-RFLP and by the microsatellites technique. ToxoDB-PCR-RFLP # 10, i. e. the archetypal type I, was identified. Microsatellite analysis showed that the strain was a variant of type I with two atypical alleles. This was the first time that a T. gondii clonal type I genotype was correlated with a case of acute toxoplasmosis in a host in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|An age-dependent {{increase}} in the resistance of BALB/c mice to induction of focal <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> by herpes simplex virus type 2 was demonstrated. In 3 -week-old mice inoculated intraperitoneally with virus, numerous necrotic foci developed in the liver. As the mice matured, the number of lesions declined {{until the age of}} 8 weeks, when no further {{increase in}} resistance appeared. Corresponding to this, the virus titers of livers and spleens of 3 -week-old mice were higher than in 8 -week-old animals throughout the infection, and the infection was apparently terminated in these organs of the adult mice by day 5. In vitro infection of peritoneal macrophages from 3 -week-old and 8 -week-old mice showed that this age-related resistance was concomitant with an increased restriction of virus replication in peritoneal macrophages from adult mice. Since, furthermore, the resistance of adult mice could be abolished by intravenous inoculation of the macrophage-toxic agent silica before infection, and since adoptive transfer of 2 X 10 (6) syngeneic macrophages from adult mice to young ones conferred to the latter a resistance comparable to that of the adult mice, it is concluded that macrophage maturation is responsible for the age-dependent resistance seen in this infection...|$|E
40|$|Congenitally athymic nude (nu/nu) mice of a BALB/c genetic {{background}} were found considerably {{more resistant to}} the induction of focal <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) tha, were phenotypically normal littermates (nu/+) or BALB/c mice. The augmented resistance was age dependent, as it was only manifested in mice from 4 to 5 weeks of age. Studies of the course of infection showed that nude mice were able to restrain virus multiplication in the liver far better than normal mice in the early phase of infection. However, they seemed inferior to normal mice in eliminating the infectious process. In vitro investigation of peritoneal macrophages revealed that macrophages from 6 -week-old nude mice exhibited accelerated spreading and were three times as restrictive in the replication of HSV- 2 as macrophages from normal mice. However, no difference {{was found in the}} efficiency of adsorption/phagocytosis between macrophages from nude and normal mice. The increased resistance of nude mice could be abolished by blockade of the microphage function of the mice by silica. Nude mice reconstituted at birth with thymus cells were just as susceptible to infection as normal mice. These data suggest that the increased resistance of nude mice to HSV- 2 hepatitis is due to the presence of nonspecifically activated macrophages before infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 was compared after inoculation of mice by different routes. Intravaginal inoculation of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 produced a local infection, with virus recovery from the vagina through 5 days. Virus was recovered from the spinal cords 4 to 5 days after inoculation but not from liver, kidney, lung, spleen, or blood. Intravenous or intraperitoneal inoculation of HSV- 2 produced a focal <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> similar to that described previously (S. C. Mogenson, B. Teisner, and H. K. Andersen, 1974). The viral etiology of the liver lesions was confirmed by virus isolation (through 4 days) and electron microscopy. No evidence of infection of the kidney, lung, blood, or spleen was observed, although virus was isolated from spinal cord homogenates 7 days after inoculation. HSV- 1 inoculation by the intraperitoneal or intravenous route resulted in virus isolation from the kidney during the 7 -day harvest period, without producing overt pathological changes. Virus was isolated from spinal cord homogenates 2 to 3 days after HSV- 1 inoculation but not from homogenates prepared from spleen, lung, or blood. Increases in serum transaminase activity were observed after systemic (intravenous) inoculation of HSV- 2 but not after HSV- 1 inoculation...|$|E
40|$|Rabbit {{haemorrhagic}} disease (RHD) {{is a highly}} infectious and fatal disease of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), responsible for important economic losses in the rabbit industry. The aetiological agent of the disease is a RNA virus (RHDV, Lagovirus, Caliciviridae) first detected in China in 1984. Currently RHDV is endemic {{in most parts of}} Europe, Asia and North Africa. Phylogenetic analyses of RHDV strains have identified 3 distinct groups : the classic RHDV, the variant RHDVa and RHDV 2. This latter has been detected in France {{for the first time in}} 2010 in domestic and wild rabbits (Le Gall-Reculé G et al., 2013) and since then has spread throughout Europe, replacing the circulating RHDV/RHDVa strains in most european countries. RHDV 2 has already been detected in Belgium in rabbitries (Marlier D et al., 2014). Here, we report for the first time the presence of RHDV 2 in wild rabbits in Southern Belgium. In november 2015, the Surveillance Network of Wildlife Diseases received seven dead wild rabbits for necropsy. The discovery of 7 fresh carcasses found at the same time in a same area (Hainaut province) emphasised the infectious or intoxication hypothesis as cause of death. Postmortem examinations were performed at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (FVM) of the University of Liege according to a systematic protocol based on gross lesions, histopathological and targeted microbiological analysis. For necropsy, each rabbit (1) was weighted and age was determined by the presence/absence of the distal ulna protuberance, (2) stomach was investigated to exclude poison, (3) spleen was systematically driven into Yersinia CIN culture media for detection of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, (4) lungs and livers were systematically (a) packaged into 10 % formaldehyde solution for histopathology analysis (Service of Pathology, FVM) and (b) frozen at - 20 °C for RHDV analysis (Scanelis Laboratory,Toulouse, France) and finally (6) feces were gathered for parasitology (Service of Parasitology, FVM). At necropsy, animals (5 adults: 3 males/ 2 females and 2 juveniles: 1 male/ 1 female) were in good condition. No hematomas or broken bones were detected, only one displayed clues of diarrhoea. Examinations of the carcasses showed congestion of lungs/kidneys and livers were macroscopically normal. No foreign body or suspicious particles was seen in the stomachs, only one rabbit was hardly infested by tapeworms in the gut. Histopathological examination revealed haemorragic lung lesions in one animal while 5 of them presented severe <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> sometimes associated with peri-angiocholitis. Only one animal presented an abnormal high rate of coccidia in feces. Samples of livers were sent to Scanelis Laboratory for RHDV RT-qPCR diagnostic. The results were positive for the new variant RHDV 2 in 5 out of the 7 rabbit livers. All the samples were negative for the classic RHDV. To determine if RHDV 2 was already present before 2015 in wild rabbits in the region, we tested a series of livers that had been collected in 2013 and 2014 for a retrospective study. Among the 25 rabbit livers checked, 12 presented <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and were sent for analysis. Ten were confirmed positive by RT-qPCR for RHDV 2...|$|E
40|$|A broiler {{breeder flock}} was subcutaneously vaccinated at the {{hatchery}} {{with a live}} avian orthoreovirus (ARV) vaccine against viral arthritis. Chicks began to die at 3 days of age and postmortem examination revealed massive subcutaneous hemorrhages and edema on the dorsal aspect of the neck {{at the site of}} vaccination, a severe <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and pulmonary edema. Microscopically, the main lesion was a multifocal vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of randomly distributed small groups of hepatocytes with presence of apoptotic and multinucleated syncytial cells. Necrotic foci were also found in the lungs as well as a hemorrhagic, granulomatous, and heterophilic cellulitis and myositis of the neck and a generalized depletion and lymphocytolysis of lymphoid organs. At 8 days of age, birds also began to show hock swelling histologically characterized by a fibrinoleucocytic inflammation of the articulation and tendon sheaths, with hyperplasia of the synovial membrane, and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration. PCR and viral culture of livers were positive for ARV. Partial sequencing of the S 1 gene from the virus isolate showed 99. 2 % to 99. 8 % homology with three vaccinal strains (ARV S 1133, 1733, and 2408). Viral particles compatible with reovirus virions were observed at transmission electron microscopy. Investigation at the hatchery revealed that chicks were inadvertently administered an S 1133 reovirus vaccine labeled for water administration in 10 - to 17 -week-old chickens. This human error is most likely the reason for this unusually severe viremic reovirus infection that affected this flock at such an early age...|$|E
40|$|Rift Valley fever {{phlebovirus}} (RVFV) causes {{high rates}} of abortions and fetal malformations in ruminants, and hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or blindness in humans. Viral transmission occurs via mosquito vectors in endemic areas, which necessitates regular vaccination of susceptible livestock animals to prevent the RVF outbreaks. Although ZH 501 strain {{has been used as}} a challenge strain for past vaccine efficacy studies, further characterization of other RVFV strains is important to optimize ruminant and nonhuman primate RVFV challenge models. This study aimed to characterize the virulence of wild-type RVFV strains belonging to different genetic lineages in outbred CD 1 mice. Mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1 x 103 PFU of wild-type ZH 501, Kenya 9800523, Kenya 90058, Saudi Arabia 200010911, OS 1, OS 7, SA 75, Entebbe, or SA 51 strains. Among them, mice infected with SA 51, Entebbe, or OS 7 strain showed rapid dissemination of virus in livers and peracute <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> at 2 - 3 dpi. Recombinant SA 51 (rSA 51) and Zinga (rZinga) strains were recovered by reverse genetics, and their virulence was also tested in CD 1 mice. The rSA 51 strain reproduced peracute RVF disease in mice, whereas the rZinga strain showed a similar virulence with that of rZH 501 strain. This study showed that RVFV strains in different genetic lineages display distinct virulence in outbred mice. Importantly, since wild-type RVFV strains contain defective-interfering RNA or various genetic subpopulations during passage from original viral isolations, recombinant RVFV strains generated by reverse genetics will be better suitable for reproducible challenge studies for vaccine development as well as pathological studies...|$|E
40|$|In May 2003, an {{outbreak}} of fatal hemorrhagic fever, caused by yellow fever virus, occurred in southern Sudan. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus belonged to the East African genotype, which supports the contention that yellow fever is endemic in East Africa {{with the potential to}} cause large outbreaks in humans. Yellow fever virus (genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae) is a mosquitoborne virus endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America, where it has been responsible for large epidemics. The virus is maintained in sylvatic transmission cycles involving nonhuman primates but uses humans as the sole vertebrate host in urban epidemics. In South America, the sylvatic vectors belong to the Haemogogus and Sabethes genera, and the urban vector is Aedes aegypti; in Africa, Aedes species mosquitoes serve as both sylvatic and urban vectors. The virus causes febrile disease with <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in humans, and death rates can exceed 50 %. Although an effective vaccine is available, the virus remains a major public health threat, particularly in Africa, where vaccination is limited by poverty, civil wars, and the inaccessibility of rural areas where outbreaks of the disease occur. The World Health Organization estimates 200, 000 cases of the disease occur annually and 30, 000 deaths, but because of underreporting, {{only a small percentage of}} these cases are recorded. The first genetic studies of yellow fever virus identified three topotypes, which corresponded with the virus’s geographic distribution in West Africa, Central and East Africa, and South America (1). In a more recent study, which included a larger number of isolates, greater diversity was identified in Africa, with five genotypes designated...|$|E
40|$|Master of EducationThis thesis {{examines}} {{the life and}} veterinary contribution of Dr Harold E. Albiston. Through his professional life can be traced the history of veterinary science in Victoria, from the horse doctor days of pre World War I to the re-establishment of the University of Melbourne Veterinary School in September 1962. Special {{attention is paid to}} the late 1920 s which saw veterinary teaching cease at the end of 1927 and the University of Melbourne Veterinary School officially close in June 1928. Albiston, who was {{on the staff of the}} Veterinary School, witnessed this critical time in Victorian veterinary history. During the world-wide veterinary recession from 1920 to 1935, due to the declining influence of the horse, Albiston was one of the first veterinarians to appreciate that a new direction was necessary for the profession. While he was assistant-director, he upgraded the facilities of the Veterinary School, and encouraged research and diagnostic work on farm animals. As the day of the horse passed Albiston had built up the Veterinary School or the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) as it became known in 1931, into an organisation of status serving the emerging livestock industries. The VRI was a unique establishment since it functioned as a normal university department, under the aegis of the University of Melbourne, yet performed diagnostic and research work for the Department of Agriculture. The VRI became an enlightened veterinary centre - a meeting place where veterinarians would visit, browse in the library and discuss problems with Harold Albiston or the VRI senior staff. It also became the centre of post graduate veterinary education in Victoria since all conferences, meetings and seminars were held there and for twenty-three years it was the home of the Australian Veterinary Journal (AVJ). The thesis also examines Albiston's research and diagnostic achievements before he was engulfed by administrative responsibilities. In 1927 he helped to solve black disease, or infectious <b>necrotic</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> which was costing the sheep industry millions of pounds. He also played a major role in diagnosing and eradicating the first Newcastle disease outbreak in Australia in 1930. In 1933 he was credited with giving the first post-graduate veterinary course in Australia when he gave a series of poultry lectures at the VRI. So successful was this venture that he gave a similar course on cattle diseases the following year. Harold Albiston has been the longest serving member of the faculty of veterinary science, the longest serving editor of the AVJ and the longest serving member of both the Veterinary and Zoological Boards of Victoria. His contribution came from his humanity and a dogged determination, at board, faculty or committee level to make the most effective use of his talents - his warmth, his lack of pomposity, his consultative ability and his capacity for hard work. In 1959 Harold Albiston was awarded the Gilruth Prize for meritorious service to veterinary science. In 1963 he was awarded the honour of Commander of the British Empire.
