In one incident, he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a <b>neighbor,</b> some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The <b>neighbor</b> sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the <b>neighbor</b> was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E

In fact, it might only be required once. The point of communicating with two-hop <b>neighbors</b> is often to eliminate a flip ambiguity.

50|$|The energy {{required}} to remove an atom {{from the surface}} depends {{on the number of}} bonds to other surface atoms which must be broken. For a simple cubic lattice in this model, each atom is treated as a cube and bonding occurs at each face, giving a coordination number of 6 nearest <b>neighbors.</b> Second-nearest <b>neighbors</b> in this cubic model are those that share an edge and third-nearest <b>neighbors</b> are those that share corners. The number of <b>neighbors,</b> second-nearest <b>neighbors,</b> and third-nearest <b>neighbors</b> for each of the different atom positions are given in Table 1.|$|R
5|$|The nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} and implemented in 1982 by Jean-Paul Benzécri and J. Juan.

5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} in contact with a <b>neighbor</b> is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact with a <b>neighbor).</b> The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E

5|$|Rand {{did not use}} a {{specific}} architect {{as a model for}} Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a <b>neighbor</b> she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the <b>neighbor</b> wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.|$|E

40|$|A {{complex set}} of {{interactions}} among <b>neighbors</b> influences plant performance and community structure. Understanding their joint operation requires extensive information on species characteristics and individual performance. We evaluated first-year survival of 35   719 tropical forest seedlings of 222 species and 15 annual cohorts relative to the density of conspecific and heterospecific <b>neighbors</b> and the phylogenetic similarity of heterospecific <b>neighbors.</b> <b>Neighbors</b> were from two size classes, and size asymmetric interactions provided insight into likely mechanisms. Large heterospecific and conspecific <b>neighbors</b> reduced seedling survival equally, suggesting resource competition rather than host-specific enemies as a mechanism. In contrast, much stronger negative conspecific effects were associated with seedling <b>neighbors</b> capable of limited resource uptake, suggesting shared pests rather than competition as the mechanism. Survival improved, however, near phylogenetically similar heterospecific <b>neighbors,</b> suggesting habitat associations shared among closely related species affect spatial patterns of performance. Improved performance near phylogenetically similar <b>neighbors</b> is an emerging pattern in the handful of similar studies...|$|R
