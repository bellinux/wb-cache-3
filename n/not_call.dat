Robert asks why Oscar did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> after the fundraiser and heavily hints at his attraction to Oscar, which Oscar has repeatedly suggested to be the case. Oscar appears taken aback, but flattered and tempted.|$|E
5|$|During a {{press conference}} in early November, Financial Services {{minister}} Shozaburo Jimi said the market should <b>not</b> <b>call</b> into question the standards of corporate governance of other listed companies just because of Olympus. However, some journals linked the case of Daio Paper Corp, also subject of a scandal involving diversion of funds by its chairman.|$|E
5|$|Nedvěd played UEFA Champions League {{football}} with Lazio, scoring against Real Madrid in a 2–2 draw in {{the second}} group stage before the Italian side was eliminated. In Lazio's final Champions League match of the season, Nedvěd was criticised by Leeds United manager David O'Leary for a challenge on Alan Maybury (although the referee did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> a foul), and he received a three-match suspension from European competition from UEFA.|$|E

5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> another general {{convention}} {{in the twentieth}} century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent to the voters for ratification referendum have failed to be enacted, but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} two-track connection, tracks ST-1 and ST-2, {{is planned}} between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do <b>not</b> <b>call</b> {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves, and to provide a connection to the Jamaica Yard maintenance depot. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Super-Express Bypass was built.|$|E
5|$|Belgian plans did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> for the {{garrison}} {{of the fort}} and the attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and {{the garrison}} ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would link up with other Allied forces.|$|E

5|$|Human Rights Commission: In {{a report}} on de facto couples {{presented}} to the Justice Minister in May 2006, the Irish Human Rights Commission evaluated international standards in dealing with unmarried couples, and assessed the changes needed in Irish law from a human rights perspective. The Commission called for legal recognition of all de facto relationships, but did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> for civil marriage to {{be made available to}} same-sex couples. The IHRC has also released {{a report on}} the civil partnership scheme in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, all twelve T2000 {{units were}} taken out of service, before {{the last of the}} much older T1300. Kollektivtransportproduksjon, the {{successor}} of Oslo Sporveier, stated that procuring spare parts was becoming nearly impossible and that the small size of the series forced high maintenance costs. The initial orders for MX3000 trains did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> for sufficient numbers to replace the T2000. Kollektivtransportproduksjon has estimated the cost of renovating the units so they can run for 15 more years at NOK50 million. Alternatively, the city council has been recommended by Kollektivtransportproduksjon to purchase 15 new MX3000 three-car trains for NOK250 million.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, Maryland hired Kansas State {{offensive}} coordinator James Franklin {{to serve in}} that same role for the Terrapins. From 2000 to 2004, he was the Maryland wide receivers coach. In 2003 and 2004, he also served as the recruiting coordinator, and Rivals.com ranked Franklin {{as one of the}} nation's top-25 recruiters both years. Because of the arrival of Franklin, 2008 was the first since 2005 that head coach Ralph Friedgen did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> the offensive plays himself. At Maryland, Franklin installed a West Coast offense, which was well suited to quarterback Chris Turner's playing style and an experienced wide receiver corps that included play-maker Darrius Heyward-Bey and sure-handed Danny Oquendo.|$|E

5|$|In February 2010, local councillors from Kent and Pas-de-Calais {{announced}} {{they were in}} talks to establish a frequent local rail service between the regional stations along the route. Trains would leave Lille and stop at Calais, Ashford and Stratford before reaching London St Pancras. Currently, Ashford and Calais have an infrequent service and Eurostar trains do <b>not</b> <b>call</b> at Stratford. The initiative is part of Calais' branding {{as part of the}} UK in order to benefit from the 2012 London Olympics but is supported {{on both sides of the}} channel to bring in more commuters.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining the {{services}} of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company did, at times, take some {{effort on the part}} of the residents. For example, in Ulladulla a wooden jetty was built in 1859 in order to retain {{the services}} of the company; they had informed the farmers that their ships would <b>not</b> <b>call</b> again at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided. (After seven years the jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef). Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small jetty, built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25km away at Merimbula.|$|E
5|$|Mose Wright {{stayed on}} his front porch for twenty minutes waiting for Till to return. He did {{not go back to}} bed. He and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and drove around trying to find Till. Unsuccessful, they {{returned}} home by 8:00am. After hearing from Wright that he would <b>not</b> <b>call</b> the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E

5|$|Nina is {{left alone}} until Tyler enters. He tells Charlotte—"Nina"—to hang on, {{before turning to}} the crossword. With Squires, he works out MYSTERYGUEST. Tyler reveals {{that he has no}} {{antidote}} for Charlotte, and will <b>not</b> <b>call</b> the emergency services. Instead, he wants Squires to eat Charlotte, as the Sphinx would. Tyler tells Squires that he cannot call the police, as the crossword displays premeditation: the KNOWITALL received a MYSTERYGUEST at number NEUN, resulting in ASPHYXIATION. Tyler reveals PUFFERFISH, predicting that a DOWNANDOUT will find Charlotte WRAPped in her UNDERSLIP in SWAMPLANDS, incriminating Squires. This is, Tyler says, his revenge.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July, NATO {{prepared}} for a large-scale mission in Srebrenica involving 60 aircraft. At 2:30 PM, {{the first wave of}} the assault, two Dutch F-16s, bombed two Serb tanks {{on the outskirts of the}} town. Two USAF F-16s were dispatched next to attack an artillery piece, but they failed to find their target. Soon thereafter, Bosnian Serb troops seized several Dutch peacekeepers as hostages and threatened to kill them if NATO did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> off its attacks. The Dutch commander reported this back to his government, and Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve immediately telephoned the NATO operations center and ordered an end to the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Friedgen led {{the team}} for his eighth season as head coach and was {{assisted}} by first-year offensive coordinator James Franklin and third-year defensive coordinator Chris Cosh. It was the first season since the departure of Charlie Taaffe in 2005 that Friedgen did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> the offensive plays himself. Instead, those duties were handled by Franklin, a former Maryland wide receivers coach, who returned after a brief stint at Kansas State and in the National Football League (NFL). With him, Franklin brought a new system: the West Coast offense. Cosh, whose complex defensive scheme had been criticized as too passive, resigned {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E

5|$|St-Calais was a Norman, and {{a native}} of Bayeux; {{he may have been}} a member of one of its {{clerical}} dynasties. His mother's name, Ascelina or Anselma, is given in Durham's records; his father, whose name is unknown, became a monk at the monastery of Saint-Calais in Maine, and may previously have been a knight. Although St-Calais is generally referred to as Saint Calais or St-Calais, the main source of information about his life, the monastic chronicle of Symeon of Durham, does <b>not</b> <b>call</b> him such.|$|E
5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, {{under the door}} of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the {{curtains}} and wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, {{at the other end of}} the palace complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{route through}} the station will be busier from December 2014 to 2018 as Thameslink trains serving London Bridge will be {{diverted}} via Herne Hill– an additional four trains per hour in both directions. This {{is due to}} the redevelopment of London Bridge that will temporarily close it to Bedford-Brighton trains. The additional trains will <b>not</b> <b>call</b> at Herne Hill; they will run fast between London Blackfriars and East Croydon. It would not be possible for the 12-car peak trains to call at Herne Hill as the platforms are too short and it would not be viable to use selective door operation as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.|$|E
