Despite this, director Rob Bowman wanted to give the fans of the show a good episode to start the second season, the idea of which Berman agreed with. So Bowman said that his direction [...] "went a bit further" [...] than he would normally, in order to compensate for the script difficulties. He was allowed to use additional cameras and equipment to improve the style of filming, including the opening shot of the episode.|$|E
500|$|... "Homer's Enemy" [...] {{explores the}} comic {{possibilities}} of a realistic character {{with a strong}} work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In an essay for the book Leaving Springfield, Robert Sloane describes the episode as [...] "an incisive consideration of The Simpsonss world. Although The Simpsons {{is known for its}} self-reflectivity, the show had <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> (or critiqued) itself as directly as it does in [...]" [...] In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero," [...] is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.

500|$|In {{the same}} year he tried to free Confederate prisoners of war by {{recruiting}} former members of Morgan's Raiders who had escaped to Canada, including John Hunt Morgan's telegrapher George [...] "Lightning" [...] Ellsworth, who {{was a native of}} Canada. On his last day in Chicago, Hines had to avoid discovery by Union soldiers inspecting the home he was hiding in by crawling into a mattress upon which the homeowner's wife lay ill with delirium. The Union soldiers inspected the house he was in, and even checked to see if Hines was the one lying on the bed, but did not discover Hines in the mattress. The soldiers established a guard by the door of the house. As it rained the next day, visitors were encouraged to visit the sick woman. The soldiers <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the faces under the umbrellas, and as a result, Hines sneaked {{out of the house and}} left Chicago.|$|E

500|$|Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode after his dog had worms, a situation he called [...] "very disgusting". He also had been reading about Chernobyl and the extinction of species at the time and blended all three of these concepts when writing the episode. Carter described his mood while writing the episode, [...] "I was in a funk when I wrote that episode. We were coming back from hiatus and I was trying to find something more interesting than just the Flukeman. I was irritated at the time and I brought my irritation to Mulder's attitude. Basically, he had become fed up with the FBI. They had given him what he felt was a low assignment, which was sending him into the city after a dead body. But lo and behold, he finds that this is a case that {{for all intents and purposes}} is an X-File. It's been given to him by a man he's <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> as an ally, Skinner. So it's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them." [...] Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter.|$|E
2500|$|Production began for {{the film}} on June 5, 2012. Reitman and the film's art {{director}} Steve Saklad searched a number of houses in Massachusetts {{as most of the}} film is set inside the Wheelers' home. According to Reitman, [...] "We searched the entire state of Massachusetts for that house. My location manager has <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> that many locations looking for one place. For weeks we would just drive down the street, knocking on people’s doors. The house we found was perfect but it was very modern. Steve brought it back to 1987." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back in high school, Gilbert <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> big-time {{football}} factories such as Michigan. He {{wanted to}} get away from what he saw in Detroit. He wanted a quiet, smaller environment in which to live after one of his classmates was gunned down. So he turned down Bo Schembechler and the University of Michigan to go to a school known for its powerful basketball program, and not for its football ability: the University of Kansas. The Kansas Jayhawks coach Glen Mason said, [...] "The very first play of the first drill, he goes up against a lineman and he absolutely demolished him. We just looked around at each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show's {{writing was}} {{grounded}} in improv, employing a [...] "yes to everything" [...] mentality. Much of the humor derived from extended improv {{games with the}} show's studio and at-home audience, such as Colbert's poll to name a bridge in Hungary after himself. Many of the writers had improv training {{and at one point}} put together [...] "improv evenings" [...] at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre once a month. Writers on The Colbert Report were predominantly male and white; Colbert acknowledged this lack of diversity, but he contended he had hired writers based solely on the quality of their material and had <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the names on writing packets submitted for employment. Subjects considered too dark were not even considered for comedic material; for example, the show would poke fun at press coverage of a tragedy, rather than the tragedy itself. Issues discussed on the show were later reported on actual newscasts, in turn allowing the show to comment on its own impact, creating an echo chamber of sorts. This led Colbert to describe his show, [...] "at its purest expression, [...] a pebble that we throw into the puddle of the news, and then we report on our own ripples." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{engaged in}} one of the {{favorite}} activities of military personnel on the island: alcohol consumption. Both the soldiers and the instructors at the base drank excessively, as alcohol was cheap and plentiful. Toole remarked in another letter to Fletcher, [...] "We are all rotting here at the moment. The decreased draft has meant no trainees since June...the inactivity here, coupled with the remnants of a rainy and enervating summer has (have?) plunged the English instructors into an abyss of drinking and inertia. Occasionally someone will struggle off to the beach or to San Juan, but the maxim here remains, 'It's too hot. When Emilie Griffin paid Toole a visit in December 1961 she was dismayed at what she saw. Toole was notably depressed and while dining at a local hotel she noted that [...] "the windows on all sides of our table were filled with perfect rainbows. Ken was sitting in a pocket of darkness surrounded by these brilliant colored arches and he <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> them." [...] Adding to Toole's dismay, his class ring from Tulane went missing and he searched the entire base for it, questioning everyone, until concluding that it had been stolen. Disgusted, he wrote home, [...] "It's a wonder I haven't been stabbed yet or paralyzed by intestinal diseases on this insane little geographical mountain top protruding from the Caribbean. However, under any circumstances the loss of the ring affects me deeply." ...|$|E
