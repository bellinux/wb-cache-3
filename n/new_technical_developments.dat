5000|$|In 1957 {{when the}} pair and Ken's brother Stan {{went looking for}} capital, {{they found that the}} American {{business}} community was hostile to investing in computer companies. Many smaller computer companies had come and gone in the 1950s, wiped out when <b>new</b> <b>technical</b> <b>developments</b> rendered their platforms obsolete, and even large companies like RCA and General Electric were failing to make a profit in the market. The only serious expression of interest came from Georges Doriot and his American Research and Development Corporation (AR&D). Worried that a new computer company would find it difficult to arrange further financing, Doriot suggested the fledgling company change its business plan to focus less on computers, and even change their name from [...] "Digital Computer Corporation".|$|E
50|$|She {{worked in}} German films until {{the start of}} sound movies. Nielsen made only one feature movie with sound, Unmögliche Liebe (Crown of Thorns) in 1932. However, the <b>new</b> <b>technical</b> <b>developments</b> in cinema were not {{suitable}} to Nielsen's style, nor could her maturity compete with the young American ingenues, so she retired from the screen. Thereafter, Nielsen acted only on stage. After the rise of Nazism she was offered her own studio by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Nielsen later described being invited to tea with Adolf Hitler, who tried to convince her to return to film and explained {{the political power of}} her on-screen presence. Understanding the implications, Nielsen declined and left Germany in 1936. She returned home to Denmark where she wrote articles on art and politics and a two-volume autobiography.|$|E

His engine design was first licensed by Curtiss-Wright in New Jersey, United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{prevention}} {{is based on}} four pillars. Firstly, the aim is the reduction of hazardous substances in vehicles to minimize their release to the environment. Secondly, vehicles should be designed to facilitate proper dismantling and to allow components and materials to be reused, recycled and/or recovered. Thirdly, the producers (both vehicle and component) shall increase the demand for recycled material. Finally, certain materials (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium) are forbidden {{except for a few}} applications with defined phase-out dates. These exemptions are cataloged in the Annex II to the ELV Directive.Since technology is subject to constant change, the Annex II is revised on a regular basis to account for <b>new</b> <b>technical</b> <b>developments</b> making certain materials in specific applications no longer necessary or allow for reduction of thresholds. As of today, 5 revisions have already been conducted with revision 6 under preparation.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} issue of Critical Care, van Heerde and colleagues {{describe}} a <b>new</b> <b>technical</b> <b>development</b> (a flow-demand system during high-frequency oscillation) {{that may have}} an important impact on the future use of high-frequency ventilation in children and adults. Flow compensation on patient demand seems to reduce the imposed work of breathing, may therefore increase patient comfort, and should theoretically allow for maintaining spontaneous breathing while heavy sedation and muscular paralysis could be avoided. With further <b>technical</b> <b>development</b> of this concept, high-frequency oscillation can finally {{be added to the}} techniques of mechanical ventilatory support that maintain, rather than suppress, spontaneous breathing efforts. Furthermore, this concept will give high-frequency oscillation the chance to prove its potential role as primary therapy in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome, the chance to reduce the incidence of high-frequency oscillation failure for patient or physician discomfort as reported in so many clinical trials in the past, the chance to most probably allow successful weaning from high-frequency oscillation to extubation, and, ultimately, in analogy to what has been reported from the experience with other ventilator modes that allow for maintaining spontaneous breathing, the chance to decrease ventilator days in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{influences}} all art, {{and therefore}} all music, including composition, performance and listening. It always has, {{and it always}} will. For example, <b>technical</b> <b>developments</b> in materials, mechanics and manufacturing were important factors that permitted the piano to supersede the harpsichord as the primary concert Western keyboard instrument by about 1800. And with each <b>new</b> <b>technical</b> <b>development</b> <b>new</b> performance issues have been introduced. Piano performance technique {{is quite different from}} harpsichord technique, and composers responded to these differences with new music ideas and gestures. The multiple relationships between technology and composer and performer are dynamic and of paramount importance to each party. And a true consideration of any aspect of music requires that all three areas be examined. This has always been a part of music, and so these relationships are inherently important within computer music. The difference is that electronic technology has caused a fundamental change for all aspects of music, a difference that is as pivotal in the history of Western music as was the shift from oral to written preservation of music over a thousand years ago, and then also the accessibility provided by printed music five hundred years ago. In computer music, all parties are always acutely aware of the presence and influence of machine technology in both the visual and audible realms...|$|R

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers {{are playing}} a key role for future aircraft structure design concepts as the <b>newest</b> <b>technical</b> <b>developments</b> for aircraft models B 787 and A 350 are showing. Due to the specific mechanical properties of this composite material and the novel manufacturing and machining techniques for large-scale CFRP made aircraft structures, {{it is necessary to}} establish an adequate process integrated quality assurance system that enables a cost-effective automated manufacturing route. Beside upcoming releases of numerous new reference guidelines based on well defined technical tolerances, it is necessary to look for non-destructive test techniques that are capable to monitor the different manufacturing steps and to detect defects and tolerance deviations within the processing route. For choosing reliable NDE techniques some key criteria as for example non-contact measurement, imaging options, penetration depth, scanning speed, the maximum possible coverage area and others have to be considered. The decisive step for applying new NDE methods is the scale up from laboratory conditions to large component testing in an automated manufacturing environment. Beside the ability to find and evaluate small microstructural features within a large CFRP structure component, it is also necessary to establish an intelligent software infrastructure which allows to exchange, compare and merge data sets of different non-destructive scanning techniques in terms of a reliable signal interpretation and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion-weighted {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (DWI) is a well established method {{for the evaluation of}} intracranial diseases, such as acute stroke. DWI for extracranial application is more difficult due to physiological motion artifacts and the heterogeneous composition of the organs. However, thanks to the <b>newer</b> <b>technical</b> <b>development</b> of DWI, DWI has become increasingly used {{over the past few years}} in extracranial organs including the abdomen and pelvis. Most previous studies of DWI have been limited to the evaluation of diffuse parenchymal abnormalities and focal lesions in abdominal organs, whereas there are few studies about DWI for the evaluation of the biliopancreatic tract. Although further studies are needed to determine its performance in evaluating bile duct, gallbladder and pancreas diseases, DWI has potential in the assessment of the functional information on the biliopancreatic tract concerning the status of tissue cellularity, because increased cellularity is associated with impeded diffusion, as indicated by a reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient. The detection of malignant lesions and their differentiation from benign tumor-like lesions in the biliopancreatic tract could be improved using DWI in conjunction with findings obtained with conventional {{magnetic resonance}} cholagiopancreatography. Additionally, DWI can be useful for the assessment of the biliopancreatic tract in patients with renal impairment because contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans should be avoided in these patients...|$|R
