25|$|Delaware {{experienced}} all {{the contention}} and bitterness of a border {{state in the}} Civil War and the {{events leading up to}} it, but because of its location and certain decisive military action, was spared much of the bloodshed of Kentucky and Missouri. Nevertheless, the divisions in communities and families, and their corresponding strong feelings were the same. A slave state with very few slaves or slaveholders, many in Delaware had an attitude they called “states rights,” which really meant, “Outsiders are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us what to do.” Given the close economic ties to Philadelphia, and the geographical separation from the Confederacy, there was little sentiment for actual secession. However, the opposition to the abolitionist and voting rights agenda of the Republican federal government were strong enough to create considerable contentiousness. These feeling were strongest in the two lower counties, which still had a majority of the population in 1860, and completely dominated the General Assembly, the real decision maker in the state.|$|E

[...] Responding to the audience's enthusiastic applause, she added [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> George ya clapped more for Ferris than ya clapped for George." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the college}} level, his coaches at the University of Michigan also {{accepted}} Robinson's practice. [...] After learning that Robinson could run the 100 meters in 10.4 seconds with his shoes untied, Michigan quarterbacks coach Rod Smith called it [...] "the damnedest thing I've ever seen" [...] and added, [...] "Anybody that runs that fast I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{him how to}} tie his shoes." [...] Robinson wears Adidas Reggie2 Superfly shoes with Velcro straps to secure them to his feet.|$|E
500|$|Professional female divers have {{performed}} as mermaids at Florida's Weeki Wachee Springs since 1947. The state park calls itself [...] "The Only City of Live Mermaids" [...] and was extremely {{popular in the}} 1960s, drawing almost one million tourists per year. Most of the current performers work part-time while attending college, and all are certified Scuba divers. [...] They wear fabric tails and perform aquatic ballet (while holding their breath) for an audience in an underwater stage with glass walls. Children often ask if the [...] "mermaids" [...] are real. The park's PR director says [...] "Just like with Santa Claus or any other mythical character, we always say yes. [...] We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them they're not real".|$|E
500|$|TV Guide {{referred}} to Todd as a breakout character. At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I think, right now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E

500|$|The {{day after}} the April 22, 2007 episode of The Sopranos titled [...] "Remember When" [...] aired, Losts co-creator Damon Lindelof met with fellow {{executive}} producer/writer/show runner Carlton Cuse and said that [...] "there's an actor on th show —I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you who he is—and I wonder if he has the same impression on you that he had on me". [...] Cuse correctly guessed Ken Leung, who had guest starred as one-time character Carter Chong, a young and angry mental patient. [...] In mid-May, they contacted Leung's agent and were informed in July that he was available and interested in working on Lost. [...] To limit the leak of spoilers, Lindelof and Cuse auditioned Leung with a character and scene created specifically for the audition {{that would not be}} used in the show but was [...] "analogous to the role [...] really want." [...] Leung believed that he was auditioning for the role of Russell, a [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] in his late thirties with immense knowledge across various scientific fields, limited social skills and broken personal relationships. [...] Leung was the only actor who tried out for this part, as writers had written the role of Miles for him; had he not accepted the job, the character would have been completely rewritten. [...] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writers thought that [...] "it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom' [...] ".|$|E
500|$|In June, a {{group of}} 132 {{supporters}} of Paul, demanding the freedom as delegates to the upcoming Republican party national convention to cast votes for Paul, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Republican National Committee and 55 state and territorial Republican party organizations for allegedly coercing delegates to choose Mitt Romney as the party’s presidential nominee. The suit alleged {{that there had been}} “a systematic campaign of election fraud at state conventions,” employing rigging of voting machines, ballot stuffing, and falsification of ballot totals. The suit further pointed to incidents at state conventions, including acts of violence and changes in procedural rules, allegedly intended to deny participation of Paul supporters in the party decision-making and to prevent votes from being cast for Paul. An attorney representing the complainants said that Paul campaign advisor Doug Wead had voiced support for the legal action. Paul himself told CNN that although the lawsuit was not a part of his campaign’s strategy and that he had not been advising his supporters to sue, he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his supporters not to sue, if they had a legitimate argument. “If they’re not following the rules, {{you have a right to}} stand up for the rules. I think for the most part these winning caucuses that we've been involved in we have followed the rules. And the other side has at times not followed the rules.” ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2016 Republican National Convention, Giuliani {{announced}} that Trump had made unspecified [...] "anonymous" [...] donations after the Sep 11 attacks, although such donations {{have not been}} identified.

2500|$|In an October {{election}} {{debate with}} Tester, regarding the Iraq War, Burns said that Tester [...] "says our president doesn't have a plan. I think he's got one. He's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{everyone in the}} world", and later told Tester, [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what our plan is, Jon, because you're {{just going to go}} out and blow it." [...] These comments were likened by critics to then presidential candidate Richard Nixon's unfulfilled 1968 promise of a [...] "secret plan" [...] to end the war in Vietnam. Burns was also hurt politically when he confronted a U.S. Forest Service Hotshot Crew from Virginia at an airport about a fire.|$|E

2500|$|When {{questioned}} on {{the importance}} that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically [...] "I know. But I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> because then other people would have to stop having to wonder and the thing about beauty is for other people to wonder at it. It's not very beautiful once you know." [...] Drummond's penchant for living by numbers has also been observed in his choosing to align the ages at which he undertook creative projects The Man and 45 with the standard revolution speeds of a turntable (33.3 and 45 rpm).|$|E

6000|$|... "Our liturgy," [...] {{observed}} Crawford, [...] "has beauties, {{which not}} even a careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; {{but it has also}} redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt. For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be" [...] (here was a glance at Fanny); [...] "that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to have it to read myself. Did you speak?" [...] stepping eagerly to Fanny, and addressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying [...] "No," [...] he added, [...] "Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move.

2500|$|Howarth {{went on to}} say Todd and Marty {{suddenly}} bonding did {{not make}} sense and that he could not, in good conscience, promote the story of Todd Lord, who had become a likeable character. [...] "If the rape had been an unrealistic, soapy thing, then it wouldn't matter. But because it was so in-depth and so brutal, to show Todd and Marty having drinks together in Rodi's [...] to show Marty feeling safe and comfortable with Todd [...] is bizarre," [...] he said. [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.'

2500|$|On October 11, the {{day after}} the hijackers had disembarked the ship, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak lied to the media when asked about them saying they had left within hours of coming ashore, [...] "They have {{actually}} left Egypt. I do not know exactly where they have gone. Perhaps they have left for Tunisia." [...] His foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid reiterated the same message [...] "They left Egypt. I know where they are, but I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you." [...] Mubarak would also falsely insist that the hijackers had left Egypt before he had information about Captain De Rosa's correction, [...] "If the captain had told us that a passenger had been killed, we would have changed our position toward the whole operation. But when this [...] emerged, we already had sent the hijackers out of the country." [...] Mubarak also repeated the suggestion that no one had been killed [...] "There is no body and no proof he has been murdered. Maybe the man is hiding or did not board the ship at all." [...] At the time of Mubarak's statements to the news media, the U.S. Administration had already received intelligence information that the hijackers were still in Egypt.|$|E

5000|$|If Adam tells Bob, [...] "Chris is {{a fascist}} so do {{not listen to}} him", then Adam has {{committed}} the fallacy of poisoning the well, as fascism {{is seen as a}} [...] "bad" [...] ideology in modern Western civilization; if Bob takes Adam''''s advice then he is a victim of the fallacy of poisoning the well. Assuming that Chris is <b>not</b> merely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Bob that he is not a fascist then there is a fallacy because it is irrelevant to the cogency of Chris'''' argument(s) whether he is or is not a fascist. It is possible to be a fascist and also to have cogent arguments on some arbitrary matter, e.g. Chris may wish to persuade Bob that the [...] Earth is not flat; being a fascist does not preclude the possibility of having a cogent argument that the Earth is not flat.|$|R

You were disappointed because Uncle Ira had not left you his money, and I suppose that was your way of working it off. If you had just run away and come back again with a headache, I'd have treated you like the Prodigal Son. But there are some things which are too much, and bringing a perfect stranger back with you for an indefinite period is one of them. I'm not saying anything against Mr Chalmers personally.

5000|$|Sciamma's {{inspiration}} for the film came from the different gangs of girls she saw around Paris, especially around the Les Halles shopping center and the Metro. Girlhood is her last coming of age film and her goal was to focus on friendship, sorority, and the special bond that is formed between girls. [...] Sciamma is frequently asked why she wrote and directed a film about a gang of young French black girls, seeing that she is white. Celine stated, [...] "I had {{a strong sense of}} having lived on the outskirts-even if I am middle-class white girl. I didn't feel I was making the film about black women but with black women-it's not the same. I'm <b>not</b> saying, 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what it's like being black in France today'; I just want to give a face to the French youth I'm looking at".|$|R
500|$|Over 20 Labour MPs {{called for}} Livingstone's suspension, whilst Sadiq Khan called for his {{expulsion}} {{from the party}} and Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group, called for Livingstone to leave politics altogether.

In a subsequent interview, Livingstone expressed regret both for mentioning Hitler and for offending Jews but added that [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> apologise for <b>telling</b> the truth". Corbyn announced that the decision whether to expel Livingstone would be made by a National Executive Committee internal inquiry, whilst Livingstone insisted that he would be exonerated on the basis of Brenner's book, saying [...] "how can the truth be an offence?"
