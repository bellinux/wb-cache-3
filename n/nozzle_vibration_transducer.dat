A computer simulation and modelling using finite element analysis for the proposed motor is discussed and used in the motor design development process. Finite element analysis has been used to evaluate the motor structure by performing an algebraic solution of a set of equations, describing an ideal model structure, with a finite number of variables.

50|$|Simple {{atomization}} {{techniques are}} available in which liquid metal is forced through an orifice at a sufficiently high velocity to ensure turbulent flow. The usual performance index used is the Reynolds number R = fvd/n, where f = fluid density, v = velocity of the exit stream, d = diameter of the opening, and n = absolute viscosity. At low R the liquid jet oscillates, but at higher velocities the stream becomes turbulent and breaks into droplets. Pumping energy is applied to droplet formation with very low efficiency (on the order of 1%) and control over the size distribution of the metal particles produced is rather poor. Other techniques such as <b>nozzle</b> <b>vibration,</b> <b>nozzle</b> asymmetry, multiple impinging streams, or molten-metal injection into ambient gas are all available to increase atomization efficiency, produce finer grains, and to narrow the particle size distribution. Unfortunately, {{it is difficult to}} eject metals through orifices smaller than a few millimeters in diameter, which in practice limits the minimum size of powder grains to approximately 10 μm. Atomization also produces a wide spectrum of particle sizes, necessitating downstream classification by screening and remelting a significant fraction of the grain boundary.|$|R
