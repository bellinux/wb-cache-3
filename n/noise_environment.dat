5000|$|The OSHA {{training}} manual for inspectors says {{the adequacy of}} hearing protection {{for use in a}} hazardous <b>noise</b> <b>environment</b> should be derated to account for how workers typically wear protection relative to how manufacturers test the protector's attenuation in the laboratory. For all types of hearing protection, OSHA’s derating factor is 50%. If used with C-weighted noise, the derated NRR will become NRR/2. If used with A-weighted noise, OSHA applies the 7-dB adjustment for C-A weighting first then derates the remainder. For example, a protector with 33-dB attenuation would have this derating: ...|$|E
5000|$|Building upon {{work from}} the U.S. Air Force and the ISO 4869-2 standard, the protector's {{attenuation}} {{as a function of}} the difference in C and A-weighted noise level is used to predict typical performance in that <b>noise</b> <b>environment.</b> The derating may be quite severe (10 to 15 decibels) for protectors that have significant differences between low and high frequency attenuation. For [...] "flat" [...] attenuation protectors, the effect of C-A is less. This new system eliminates the need for calculators, relies on graphs and databases of empirical data, and is believed to be a more accurate system for determining NRRs.|$|E

What cannot be seen from the graphs is that the rectangular window has the best noise bandwidth, which makes it a good candidate for detecting low-level sinusoids in an otherwise white <b>noise</b> <b>environment.</b> Interpolation techniques, such as zero-padding and frequency-shifting, are available to mitigate its potential scalloping loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{vertical}} {{range of}} sodars is approximately 0.2 to 2 kilometers (km) {{and is a}} function of frequency, power output, atmospheric stability, turbulence, and, most importantly, the <b>noise</b> <b>environment</b> in which a sodar is operated. Operating frequencies range from less than 1000 Hz to over 4000 Hz, with power levels up to several hundred watts. Due to the attenuation characteristics of the atmosphere, high power, lower frequency sodars will generally produce greater height coverage. Some sodars can be operated in different modes to better match vertical resolution and range to the application. This is accomplished through a relaxation between pulse length and maximum altitude.|$|E

5000|$|When {{looking at}} data related to {{individual}} molecules, one usually can construct propagators, and jumping time probability density functions, {{of the first}} order, the second order and so on, whereas from bulk experiments, one usually obtains the decay of a correlation function. From {{the information contained in}} these unique functions (obtained from individual molecules), one can extract a relatively clear picture on the way the system behaves; e.g. its kinetic scheme, or its potential of activity, or its reduced dimensions form. In particular, one can construct (many properties of) the reaction pathway of an enzyme when monitoring the activity of an individual enzyme. Additionally, significant aspects regarding the analysis of single molecule data—such as fitting methods and tests for homogeneous populations—have been described by several authors. [...] On the other hand, there are several issues with the analysis of single molecule data including construction of a low <b>noise</b> <b>environment</b> and insulated pipet tips, filtering some of the remaining unwanted components (noise) found in recordings, and the length of time required for data analysis (pre-processing, unambiguous event detection, plotting data, fitting kinetic schemes, etc.).|$|E

40|$|An Empirical Mode Decomposition based {{filtering}} (EMDF) {{approach is}} presented as a post-processing stage for speech enhancement. This method is particularly effective in low frequency <b>noise</b> <b>environments.</b> Unlike previous EMD based denoising methods, this approach does not make the assumption that the contaminating noise signal is fractional Gaussian Noise. An adaptive method is developed to select the IMF index for separating the noise components from the speech based on the second-order IMF statistics. The low frequency noise components are then separated by a partial reconstruction from the IMFs. It is shown that the proposed EMDF technique is able to suppress residual noise from speech signals that were enhanced by the conventional optimallymodified log-spectral amplitude approach which uses a minimum statistics based noise estimate. A comparative performance study is included that demonstrates the effectiveness of the EMDF system in various <b>noise</b> <b>environments,</b> such as car interior noise, military vehicle noise and babble noise.
