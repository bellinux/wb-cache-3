5|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in August 1914, Lady (Rachel) Dudley, {{the wife of the}} former Governor-General of Australia, the Lord Dudley, decided to create a {{hospital}} from Australian doctors and <b>nurses</b> <b>who</b> were in the United Kingdom. There were relatively large numbers of these; while doctors and nurses could be trained in Australia, advanced qualifications still required a trip overseas.|$|E
5|$|The Cadet Nurses Corps was {{the largest}} of the federal nurse-training programs; it allowed young women to serve their country in uniform and without discrimination. It also {{influenced}} the way in which nurses would be educated and trained in the United States.

5|$|The Winkler County nurse {{whistleblower}} {{case was}} a series of legal proceedings in West Texas that centered on the retaliation upon two <b>nurses</b> <b>who</b> submitted an anonymous state medical board complaint against a physician in 2009.

After witnessing what they believed to be unsafe medical care, nurses Anne Mitchell and Vicki Galle submitted an anonymous complaint against Dr. Rolando Arafiles to the Texas Medical Board (TMB).|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and <b>nurses</b> <b>who</b> were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the <b>nurses,</b> <b>who</b> feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
