500|$|Cardozo {{has been}} praised for {{his style of}} writing in Palsgraf. Posner noted that in {{the facts of the}} case Cardozo [...] "saw {{instantiated}} the basic principles of <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> and was able to articulate them in prose of striking freshness, clarity, and vividness", in an opinion mostly written in short sentences and lacking footnotes or block quotes. University of Pennsylvania Law School Professor Kim Lane Scheppele noted that the opinion was [...] "written by Judge Benjamin Cardozo at the height of his formidable powers". Richard Polenberg, in his study of that jurist, stated, [...] "Cardozo had a genius for making it seem that the results he reached were logical, inevitable, and legally unassailable". Prosser stated, [...] "with due respect to the superlative style in which both [...] are written, neither of them wears well on long acquaintance. Both of them beg the question shamelessly, stating dogmatic propositions without reason or explanation." [...] Herzog was also less enthusiastic, noting that [...] "the majority opinion is unfortunately written in the curious idiolect I sometimes call Cardozo-speak." ...|$|E
2500|$|Representative {{government}} {{emerged in}} the 1840s and 1850s, and a considerable measure of autonomy was given to local legislatures {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century. Colonial Parliaments introduced certain reforms such as secret ballots and female suffrage, which were not to occur in Britain until many years later. Nevertheless, Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament extending to the colonies could override contrary colonial legislation and would apply by [...] "paramount force". New doctrines of English common law continued to be treated as representing the common law of Australia.

40|$|Common <b>law</b> <b>negligence</b> claims {{persist in}} check fraud cases despite the Uniform Commercial Code’s loss {{allocation}} provisions in Articles 3 and 4. Absent an explicit preemption provision, courts disagree as to whether, when, {{and to what}} extent the Code preempts these common law claims. As a result, the courts’ varying analytical approaches to common <b>law</b> <b>negligence</b> claims often create seemingly conflicting results. This Note reviews the current loss allocation rules in check fraud scenarios and examines recent preemption case law. It argues in favor of the comprehensive rights and remedies analysis used by the majority of courts to determine the circumstances under which common <b>law</b> <b>negligence</b> claims should be allowed under the Code. It also makes recommendations for future Code revisions based on the recent case law. Finally, this Note suggests that the loss allocation scheme as presently constituted provides a latent benefit to the payment system by encouraging customers to move toward electronic payment...|$|R
40|$|Tort law {{has little}} {{patience}} for excuses. Criminal law is more forgiving. It recognizes complete excuses such as duress and provocation, {{as well as}} excuses that temper punishment. Excuses are also commonplace in ordinary morality. Like criminal law and morality, tort law seems concerned with holding persons accountable for their wrongs, and excuses seem to go hand-in-hand with accountability. So why—or in what sense—are torts inexcusable wrongs? This Article explains how tort law, understood as law that enables victims to hold wrongdoers answerable to them, cogently can refuse to recognize excuses. In doing so, it offers a unified account of many of tort law’s core features, including the objectivity of <b>negligence</b> <b>law’s</b> ordinary care standard, the courts’ insistence on injury {{as a condition of}} liability, and the strictness of certain forms of tort liability. More generally, it invites us to broaden our understanding of what it means for law to identify conduct as wrongful, and for law to set up schemes for holding wrongdoers accountable...|$|R

50|$|While Ordon {{held that}} interjurisdictional {{immunity}} applies where a provincial statute of general application {{has the effect}} of indirectly regulating a maritime <b>negligence</b> <b>law</b> issue, it predates Canadian Western Bank and COPA, which clarified the two-step test for interjurisdictional immunity and set the necessary level of intrusion into the relevant core at “impairs” instead of “affects”. Accordingly, Ordon does not apply the two-step test for interjurisdictional immunity developed in Western Bank and COPA nor the notion of impairment of the federal core which is now necessary to trigger the application of interjurisdictional immunity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} opinion, {{written by}} Chief Justice Antonio Lamer, addressed {{the definition of}} a person under the Criminal Code.

Lamer said that there was no proof of this interpretation. Furthermore, the <b>negligence</b> <b>law,</b> enacted in 1954, seemed to have been developed with no debate regarding the difference between a person and a human being. A person and a human being would be the same thing. With this evidence of legislative history favouring the view that the fetus is not a person, the Court declined to decide that the fetus is not a person on the sole basis of sexual equality, as argued by LEAF. Instead, Lamer briefly wrote that [...] "The result reached above is consistent with the 'equality approach' taken by L.E.A.F." ...|$|E
