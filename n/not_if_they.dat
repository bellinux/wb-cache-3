However, Pliny's placement of the Frisiavones in northern Gaul is not near the known location of the Frisii, which is acceptable if the Frisavones are a separate people, but <b>not</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are a part of a greater Frisian tribe.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{eventual}} hit game Family Feud ran against As The World Turns from July 12, 1976, until April 22, 1977, {{it did not}} become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings. Only when ABC made its first move to a one-hour soap with All My Children did trouble really began for As the World Turns (and Days of our Lives), since ABC kept that serial's starting time at 1:00/noon, meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss {{the last half of}} that day's storyline (or, contrariwise, would <b>not,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> watched until the mid-program commercial break and then changed channels, pick up the As The World Turns or Days of Our Lives activities from the episode's beginning, since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after the bottom of the hour). Further, All My Children's emphasis on youth-oriented, sexier story lines provided a sharp contrast to the domestic, almost quaint tone of As the World Turns (and to a lesser degree, the melodramatic, somewhat topical Days). On January 16, 1978, ABC ballooned its decade-old One Life to Live to the 2:00 PM/1:00 PM starting time, compounding the other networks' headaches. These factors helped contribute to the fall of As The World Turns from the top spot in the ratings {{at the end of the}} 1978-79 season. After finishing the previous season tied with Another World for number one in the Nielsens, As the World Turns fell to fourth behind All My Children, General Hospital, and The Young and the Restless.|$|E
500|$|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} a unanimous court. [...] O'Connor stated that Oklahoma's argument that a tribal member must live on a reservation to be exempt from state taxes was incorrect. [...] All that is required is that the member live in [...] "Indian country", which Congress has defined to [...] "include [...] formal and informal reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments, whether restricted or held in trust by the United States." [...] O'Connor noted that the Tenth Circuit should have determined the residence of the tribal members as inside or outside of Indian country, <b>not</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were within the reservation.
