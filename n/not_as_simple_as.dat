This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E

Arthur Danto also argued that morality is at least incompatible with Indian mystical beliefs. Walter Stace, on the other hand, argued not only are mysticism and morality compatible, but that mysticism is the source and justification of morality. Others studying multiple mystical traditions have concluded that the relation of mysticism and morality is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> that.|$|E
25|$|When overs are lost, {{setting an}} {{adjusted}} {{target for the}} team batting second is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> reducing the run target proportionally to the loss in overs, because a team with ten wickets in hand and 25 overs to bat can play more aggressively than if they had ten wickets and a full 50 overs, for example, and can consequently achieve a higher run rate. The D/L method {{is an attempt to}} set a statistically fair target for the second team's innings, which is the same difficulty as the original target. The basic principle is that each team in a limited-overs match has two resources available with which to score runs (overs to play and wickets remaining), and the target is adjusted proportionally to the change in the combination of these two resources.|$|E

Horrified that her daughter would be robbed of everything, Hańska insisted that she must end her relationship with Balzac. [...] "You are free", she wrote to him. As she made plans to protest the uncle's interference in St. Petersburg, Balzac wrote back to offer his help.

McNally), the Science Minister on Kaelon II, is outraged after learning of Timicin's request for asylum, and he sends up two warships to ensure that the Enterprise does not leave the system with Timicin on board. As Picard orders the bridge crew to analyze the offensive capabilities of the Kaelonian ships, Timicin realizes that his situation is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> he had hoped, for his home planet will not accept any further reports from him, and he is told that even if he does find a solution, they will not accept it.|$|E

Interpreting the results of an LCA starts with understanding the accuracy of the results, and ensuring they meet the goal of the study. This is accomplished by identifying the data elements that contribute significantly to each impact category, evaluating the sensitivity of these significant data elements, assessing the completeness and consistency of the study, and drawing conclusions and recommendations based on a clear understanding of how the LCA was conducted and the results were developed.|$|E

In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter {{could be construed as}} a contract. The case of Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward involved Dartmouth College, which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King George III. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, New Hampshire passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred [...] "vested rights" [...] on the trustees.|$|E

2500|$|The dual covector {{field of}} the timelike unit vector field in any frame field {{represents}} infinitesimal spatial hyperslices. [...] However, the Frobenius integrability theorem gives a strong restriction {{on whether or not}} these spatial hyperplane elements can be [...] "knit together" [...] to form a family of spatial hypersurfaces which are everywhere orthogonal to the world lines of the congruence. [...] Indeed, it turns out that this is possible, in which case we say the congruence is hypersurface orthogonal, if and only if the vorticity vector vanishes identically. [...] Thus, while the static observers in the cylindrical chart admits a unique family of orthogonal hyperslices , the Langevin observers admit no such hyperslices. [...] In particular, the spatial surfaces [...] in the Born chart are orthogonal to the static observers, not to the Langevin observers. [...] This is our second (and much more pointed) indication that defining [...] "the spatial geometry of a rotating disk" [...] is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> one might expect.|$|E
2500|$|The spell is {{explained}} as a complicated memory-altering magic. But it is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> erasing {{the memory of}} everyone directly, as this is merely Subtractive Magic. Also, simply attempting to erase the memory because it uses Subtractive Magic, has a strong probability of destroying portions of the mind, thus killing the subject. A death spell, can for instance, {{make it seem like}} a person is dead, but everyone still remembers the person existed. [...] Also, if you tried to erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality would be such that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled. For this reason, some wizards came up with a workaround, using some energy to warp reality itself or at least human perception of it. [...] False memories are automatically created to fill the gaps in reality, almost as if someone went back in time and changed them.|$|E
2500|$|The statues were {{destroyed}} by dynamite over several weeks, starting on 2 March 2001. The destruction {{was carried out in}} stages. Initially, the statues were fired at for several days using anti-aircraft guns and artillery. This caused severe damage, but did not obliterate them. During the destruction, Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal lamented that, [...] "This work of destruction is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> people might think. You can't knock down the statues by shelling as both are carved into a cliff; they are firmly attached to the mountain". Later, the Taliban placed anti-tank mines {{at the bottom of the}} niches, so that when fragments of rock broke off from artillery fire, the statues would receive additional destruction from particles that set off the mines. In the end, the Taliban lowered men down the cliff face and placed explosives into holes in the Buddhas. After one of the explosions failed to completely obliterate the face of one of the Buddhas, a rocket was launched that left a hole in the remains of the stone head.|$|E

2500|$|Difficulties {{arise when}} {{transliteration}} or transcription between writing systems is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as Russia or Rußland for Росси́я, {{but in other}} cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno only as [...] "Leghorn" [...] when road signs and railway timetables show it as [...] "Livorno". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the Cyrillic letter Р is usually written as R in the Latin script, although in many cases it is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of Arabic, but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of Mocha is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukhā, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the Pinyin phonetic transcription systems. Other systems {{were used in the}} past, such as Wade-Giles, resulting in the city being spelled Beijing on newer English maps and Peking on older ones.|$|E
