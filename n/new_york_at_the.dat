5|$|Although {{the portion}} {{of what is now}} NY370 from Cato to Liverpool was state-maintained by 1926, it {{remained}} unnumbered until the late 1920s. At that time, the section west of then-NY31 (now NY48) in Baldwinsville became NY37. The designation proved to be short-lived as it was renumbered to NY370 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, NY40 was split into several different routes. From Cato to just east of Red Creek, old NY40 became part of the new NY370, which also extended southeastward to NY57 in Liverpool. The small segment of former NY40 from NY3 to Upton Road was included in NY3E (later US104).|$|E

5|$|Following {{this decline}} in her career, Hepburn took action to create her own {{comeback}} vehicle. She left Hollywood {{to look for}} a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Schubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but {{the illness}} recurred the {{following}} year, {{and she became}} an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to Savannah, Georgia, in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and warmth would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was {{able to return to}} Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years.

In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.|$|E
