Increased <b>NT</b> is <b>seen</b> in a diversity of fetal malformations. The mechanism explaining the abnormal fluid accumulation and the transient nature of NT remains unexplained. METHODS: The nuchal regions of normal and trisomy 16 mouse embryos were examined for (lympho) vascular abnormalities using immunohistochemical markers against lymphatic vessels (LYVE- 1) and smooth muscle (1 A 4) and endothelial (CD 34) cells. Additionally, an ultrasonographic study was carried out on 17 human fetuses with an increased NT. Two of these fetuses were examined morphologically. RESULTS: In both abnormal human and mouse specimens, we found a mesenchyme lined cavity within the posterior nuchal region as well as bilaterally enlarged jugular LYVE- 1 positive lymphatic sacs. The persistence of jugular lymphatic sacs was also confirmed by ultrasound in 14 human fetuses with increased NT. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify the cause of increased NT as mesenchymal oedema {{in the presence of}} distended jugular lymphatic sacs, detected by the hyaluronan receptor LYVE- 1. The delayed organization and connection of these lymphatic sacs to the venous circulation might explain the transient nature of NT.

In all trypanosomatids examined to date, the first exon (mini-exon) is encoded by approximately 200 tandemly reiterated genes. In characterizing the mini-exon genes of Leptomonas seymouri, we identified two predominant size classes of repetitive sequences that hybridized strongly to the L. seymouri mini-exon sequence. These two sequences are arranged as interspersed clusters. DNA sequence analysis of a clone representing the smaller size class demonstrated that these sequences have the capacity to encode a mini-exon donor (med) RNA corresponding to the 86 <b>nt</b> component <b>seen</b> in Northern blots of L. seymouri RNA. The larger size class comprises a family of related sequences, some of which contain DNA inserted into the mini-exon portion of the medRNA gene. The specific insert identified here (LINS 1) is exclusively associated with medRNA sequences, and is present in approximately 20 % of the larger size class of L. seymouri medRNA genes. Disregarding the insertion, the sequences of the smaller bona fide mini-exon genes and the gene copy containing the insert were almost identical. The insert sequence is transcribed {{in the same direction as}} medRNA to yield at least four small non-polyadenylated RNAs, which appeared not to be linked to medRNA sequences...|$|R
40|$|In {{a number}} of {{neurological}} and neuropsychiatric disorders, a worsening of the disease phenotype {{from one generation to}} the next has been linked to expanded trinucleotide repeat sequences that increase in size upon transmission. The clinical phenomenon of an earlier age of onset or a more severe phenotype in later generations of a family has been termed anticipation. The focus of this thesis has been to study expanded repeat sequences at the genomic level and to identify new expanded repeats that may cause disease. The first method developed for direct detection of expanded repeat sequences was the repeat expansion detection (RED) technique. This method detects expanded repeats with no prior knowledge of the flanking sequence or the genomic location of the repeat. RED was onginally used to detect expanded CAG/CTG repeats, and the method was subsequently optimised to include detection of short repeats of other motifs in the genome. Eight out of the ten trinucleotide repeat sequence motifs were optimised successfully to permit screening for expanded repeats in disorders showing anticipation (paper I and summary). Expanded repeats were found in five novel motifs, ATG/CAT, CTT/AAG, TGG/CCA, CCT/AGG and GTT/AAC. Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA 3) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA 7) belong to a group of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias showing progressive degeneration of cerebellar pathways as well as anticipation. CAG/CTG RED products of 180 - 270 nt were associated with disease in five families with MJD/SCA 3 (p 120 nt and disease. Anticipation has also been observed in affective disorder. In two independent large samples of bipolar affective disorder patients, CAG/CTG RED products > = 180 nt were associated with disease (p = 180 nt as compared to 29 % of controls.

A combination of RED analysis and PCR analysis of the ERDA 1 and CTG 18. 1 loci thus markedly increases the sensitivity of the RED method in the search for pathogenic repeats. A novel isolation strategy for sequences flanking expanded repeats has been developed to enable isolation of disease genes. The isolation of expanded repeat sequences is complicated by the instability of large repeats in prokaryotic hosts. The new strategy is based on the ability of RED to identify pools or fractions of DNA containing the expanded repeat in each of a series of physical purification steps. Cloning is facilitated by the enrichment of repeat-containing fragments prior to cloning as well as by careful selection of prokaryotic hosts and procedures...|$|R

We {{have developed}} a statistical approach for the partitioning of such sequences, by analyzing the distribution of point mutations between a determined V gene segment and putative Ig regions. The establishment of objective criteria for the partitioning of sequences between V(H), D, and J(H) gene segments has allowed us to more carefully analyze intervening putative nontemplated (N) nucleotides. An analysis of 225 IgM H chain sequences, with five or fewer V mutations, led to the alignment of 199 sequences. Only 5. 0 % of sequences lacked N nucleotides at the V(H) D junction (N 1), and 10. 6 % at the DJ(H) junction (N 2). Long N regions (> 9 <b>nt)</b> were <b>seen</b> in 20. 6 % of N 1 regions and 17. 1 % of N 2 regions. Using a statistical analysis based upon known features of N addition, and mutation analysis, two of these N regions aligned with D gene segments, and a third aligned with an inverted D gene segment. Nine additional sequences included possible alignments with a second D segment. Four of the remaining 40 long N 1 regions included 5 ` sequences having six or more matches to V gene end motifs, {{which may be the}} result of V gene replacement. Such sequences were not seen in long N 2 regions. The long N regions frequently seen in the expressed repertoire of human Ig gene rearrangements can therefore only partly be explained by V gene replacement and D-D fusion...|$|R

Because fluxgate and search-coil magnetometer have a different frequency response, we differentiated the fluxgate time series before computing the spectra {{in order to reduce the}} spectral slope. After the smoothing procedure, the fluxgate spectra were corrected for the frequency response of the differential filter, while the search-coil spectra were corrected for their transfer function in order to convert the power spectral densities from V 2 /Hz to <b>nT</b> 2 /Hz (<b>see,</b> for example, De Lauretis et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{index of}} synchrotron emission {{is an important}} parameter in understanding the properties of cosmic ray electrons (CREs) and the interstellar medium (ISM). We determine the synchrotron spectral index (α_ nt) of four nearby star-forming galaxies, namely NGC 4736, NGC 5055, NGC 5236 and NGC 6946 at sub-kpc linear scales. The α_ nt was determined between 0. 33 and 1. 4 GHz for all the galaxies. We find the spectral index to be flatter (≳ - 0. 7) in regions with total neutral (atomic + molecular) gas surface density, Σ_ gas≳ 50 M_ pc^- 2, typically in the arms and inner parts of the galaxies. In regions with Σ_ gas≲ 50 M_ pc^- 2, especially in the interarm and outer regions of the galaxies, the spectral index steepens sharply to <- 1. 0. The flattening of α_ nt {{is unlikely to be}} caused due to thermal free [...] free absorption at 0. 33 GHz. Our result is consistent with the scenario where the CREs emitting at frequencies below ∼ 0. 3 GHz are dominated by bremsstrahlung and/or ionization losses. For denser medium (Σ_ gas≳ 200 M_ pc^- 2), having strong magnetic fields (∼ 30 μG), α_ <b>nt</b> is <b>seen</b> to be flatter than - 0. 5, perhaps caused due to ionization losses.

It is also not plausible that the oscillation comes from the sensor oscillation caused by low-frequency seismic waves, such as the Rayleigh or Love waves, because of the much longer period (i.e. about 4 minutes) than that of the Rayleigh or Love waves (i.e., their major period is normally shorter than 30 seconds or at most 1 minute or so—e.g. Selby et al., 2005).

Some of the anomalies correlate with known or suspected karst, or with apparent conductivity anomalies calculated from electromagnetic data acquired contemporaneously with the magnetic data. Some of the anomalies have a strong correlation with topographic lows or closed depressions. Surface magnetic data have been acquired over some of these sites and have confirmed the existence of the anomalies. Ground inspections in the vicinity of several of the anomalies has not led to any discoveries of manmade surface materials of sufficient size to generate the observed anomalies. One would expect an anomaly of approximately 1 nT for a pickup truck from 200 ft altitude. Typical residual magnetic anomalies have magnitudes of 5 [...] 10 nT, and some are as large as 25 nT. The absence of roads or other indications of culture (past or present) near the anomalies and the modeling of anomalies in data acquired with surface instruments indicate that man-made metallic objects are unlikely to be responsible for the anomaly. The authors show that observed anomalies in the CRD can reasonably be associated with thickening of the soil layer. The occurrence of the anomalies in areas where evidences of karstification are seen would follow because sediment deposition would occur in topographic lows. Linear groups of anomalies on the maps may be associated with fracture zones which were eroded more than adjacent rocks and were subsequently covered with a thicker blanket of sediment. This study indicates that airborne magnetic data may be of use in other sites where fracture zones or buried collapse structures are of interest...|$|R

MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Estudou-se de forma {{transversal}} 853 fetos, consecutivamente, que apresentaram cariótipos ou fenótipos normais. Todos os fetos foram submetidos, durante a ultra-sonografia de rotina, à medida da TN. A análise estatística utilizou o teste "t" de Student e ANOVA. O teste de regressão ajustou o melhor modelo matemático para traduzir o comportamento da TN. RESULTADOS: A idade materna variou de 14 a 49 anos (média de 30, 2 anos), sendo que 22, 1 % encontravam-se com mais de 35 anos.

OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} behavior of nuchal translucency (NT) in {{the population of the}} State of Espírito Santo, Brazil, during weeks 10 to 14 of pregnancy and to establish a reference range for this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A transversal study was performed in 853 fetuses which presented normal cariotype or phenotype. All the fetuses were submitted to ultrasound analysis for NT measurement, during routine ultrasound examinations. The Student's "t" test and ANOVA were used in the statistical analysis. The regression test was used to adjust the better mathematical model to translate the NT behavior. RESULTS: Maternal age varied between 14 to 49 years (mean 30. 2 %), and 22. 1 % were above 35 years of age. The NT measurement increased with gestational age and the crown-rump length (CRL). In 73 normal fetuses (6. 46 %) the NT was thicker than 2. 5 mm. The better mathematical model was the linear correlation (NT = 0. 414 + 0. 020 × CRL) which allowed to establish the reference range (percentiles 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90 and 95).

Presently, with a family of genetically manipulated derivatives especially developed for this study and tested on permeabilized isolated single skeletal muscle fiber segments, we explored the specificities of the amino acid residues within the N-helix and the KGK-triplet in TnC. Noticeably, the amino acid compositions vary between the N-helices of the cardiac and skeletal TnC isoforms. On the other hand, the KGK-triplet is located similarly in both TnC isoforms. We previously indicated that deletion of the N-helix (mutant delta Nt) diminishes the tension obtained on activation with maximal calcium, but the contractile function is revived by the superimposed deletion of the 88 KGK 90 -triplet (mutant delta <b>Nt</b> delta KGK; <b>see</b> Gulati J, Babu A, Su H, Zhang YF, 1993, J Biol Chem 268 : 11685 - 11690). Using this functional test, we find that replacement of Gly- 89 with a Leu or an Ala could also overcome the contractile defect associated with N-helix deletion. On the other hand, replacement of the skeletal TnC N-helix with cardiac type N-helix was unable to restore contractile function. The findings indicate a destabilizing influence of Gly- 89 residue in skeletal TnC and suggest that the N-terminal arm in normal TnC serves to moderate this effect. Moreover, specificity of the N-helix between cardiac and skeletal TnCs {{raises the possibility that}} resultant structural disparities are also important for the functional distinctions of the TnC isoforms...|$|R
40|$|Background: The exosome complex plays {{key roles}} in RNA {{processing}} and degradation in Eukaryotes and Archaea. Outstanding structural studies identified multiple pathways for RNA substrates into the exosome in vitro, but identifying the pathway followed by individual RNA species in vivo remains challenging. Methods: We attempted {{to address this}} question using RNase protection. In vivo RNA-protein crosslinking (CRAC) was applied to the exosome component Rrp 44 /Dis 3, which has both endonuclease and exonuclease activity. During CRAC, the exosome was purified under native conditions and subjected to RNase digestion, prior to protein denaturation and cDNA cloning. The resulting high-throughput sequence reads were stratified by length of the cDNA sequence. This should reflect RNA fragment lengths, and therefore the RNA region that was protected by exosome binding. We anticipated major read lengths of ~ 30 nt and ~ 10 nt, reflecting the “central channel” and “direct access” routes to the Rrp 44 exonuclease active site observed in vitro. Results: Unexpectedly, no clear peak was observed at 30 nt, whereas a broad peak was <b>seen</b> around 20 <b>nt.</b> The expected ~ 10 <b>nt</b> peak was <b>seen,</b> and showed strong elevation in strains lacking exonuclease activity. Unexpectedly, this peak was suppressed by point mutations in the Rrp 44 endonuclease active site. This indicates that the short fragments are degraded by the exonuclease activity of Rrp 44, but also suggests that at least some may be generated by endonuclease activity. Conclusions: The absence of 30 nt protected fragments may reflect obligatory binding of cofactors {{at the entrance to the}} exosome central channel in vivo. The presence of ~ 20 nt fragments apparently indicates an access route not yet reported from in vitro studies. Confident mapping of 10 nt reads is challenging, but they are clearly derived from a subset of exosome targets. In particular, pre-rRNA species, which are major exosome targets, are strongly disfavored for the generation of short reads...|$|R

Oxidative and nitrosative stress occurs when the damaging action of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) targets key cellular molecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA. This phenomenon is usually kept in check by the body???s natural antioxidant defense system. However, under certain biomolecular or environmental factors, this defense system can be overwhelmed and shuts down, leading to a degenerative state. Growing data from experimental models and human brain studies suggest that oxidative stress {{plays an important role in}} degeneration in neurologic diseases. To determine whether ROS or RNS is occurring in the brains of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, various oxidative stress markers have been utilized, including 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) formed during DNA damage, and nitrotyrosine (NT) a marker of oxidative damage to proteins. My project utilized the mutant spastic Han-Wistar (sHW) rat, an acknowledged model of ataxia. Previous morphological examination of mutant animals indicated progressive losses of cerebellar Purkinje cells correlated with ataxia-like symptoms. Immunohistochemical analyses of expression of 8 -OHdG showed increased staining intensity in the Purkinje cells of 55 day old mutant rats compared to littermate controls; while expression of <b>NT</b> was not <b>seen</b> in either mutant or normal siblings.

Specifically, mutant sHW rats showed much greater staining intensity within the Purkinje cells and within the deep cerebellar nuclei. Cerebellar sagittal sections were stained with NT antibody from 50 - 55 day old mutant and normal sHW rats.

(New Testament)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2002 This work {{begins by}} {{providing}} an historical overview of Mariology, tracing Marian {{issues from the}} early fathers, to the Mariology of the Middle Age, to the apex of Mariology {{during the time of}} the Reformation and beyond. A contrast is then noted between pre-Vatican II Mariology and post-Vatican II Mariology. Matthew 1 : 18 - 25 is our first treatment of the biblical text. Here the work surveys the various views of issues related to Mary, including the meaning of Joseph's "righteousness," the meaning of "before they came together" (v. 18) and the meaning of "until" (v. 25). An indepth study is provided on the use of the phrase ("until") in the <b>NT</b> to <b>see</b> whether there are any implications for the Roman Catholic teaching of Mary's perpetual virginity. The work continues its investigation of the phrase in the LXX and in the Hellenistic literature of the two centuries surrounding the birth of Christ to see whether any clear examples of this phrase can be adduced in support of the Roman Catholic understanding of Matt 1 : 25. Since much of the literature examined is not available in English translation, the author has done the primary translation work himself. Equally important in this regard is the identity of the "brothers" of Jesus in the NT. A survey is provided of the three major views on the identity of those called the brothers of Jesus in the NT, listing each one's strengths and weaknesses. The work also investigates the semantic range of the words in the LXX, the NT, and the surrounding Hellenistic literature. Again, Mary's perpetual virginity is at issue. Next, we begin our examination of the status of Mary in the New Testament, starting with the Synoptic Gospels. The work surveys the common Marian accounts found in the Synoptic Gospels, and examines their impact on our understanding of the relationship between Jesus and his mother vis-a-vis her status as mother. Special considerations are given to Luke's account, which includes Marian episodes not found in the other gospels. This intent is to determine whether Luke views Mary in a different way than the other Gospel writers, and what status he gives to Mary. The work also examines the evidence for seeing special Marian symbolism in Luke. It investigates the common understanding among Roman Catholic interpreters that Luke, in his Annunciation and Infancy narratives, intends for us to see in Mary OT allusions to the Ark of the Covenant, the daughter of Zion, the Ana win, and the like. Once our investigation of the Synoptics is over, we turn our attention to John's gospel, which contains two passages of particularly Marian significance. We first examine the issues surrounding the encounter between Jesus and his mother in John 2 : 1 - 6 to see what impact, if any, this passage has on our overall understanding of Mary's role and status in the church, particularly in regard to her role in Roman Catholicism as Mediat 1 :ix. Next, we examine the issues surrounding the encounter between Jesus and his mother in John 19 : 25 - 27 (at the foot of the cross) to see what impact, if any, this passage has on our overall understanding of Mary's role and status in the church, particularly in regard to her role in Roman Catholicism as Mother of the church. Our inquiry reaches its conclusion with an investigation of the possible Marian significance in Revelation 12. Here we examine the meaning of the "woman clothed with the sun," to see whether there is an allusion to Mary, as well as to the Roman Catholic understanding of her Assumption. A survey of the various views is included, as well as a survey of views throughout the history of the church. Once finished, we propose a Mario logy that is at once biblical and honouring to the woman of whom it is said, "all generations will call [her] blessed. "Doctora...|$|R

O estudo empreendido buscou compreender e analisar, em sua narrativa, as vivências das crianças na cibercultura, em especial, no que se refere ao brincar, ao consumo e às práticas de cuidados corporais. Transitando entre infância e cibercultura enquanto campos teóricos, abordam-se questões do lúdico, do consumismo e do corpo. A pesquisa caracteriza-se pela abordagem qualitativa de cunho descritivo. Foram {{realizadas}} observações, entrevistas e questionários com crianças de 08 - 11 anos de uma escola da rede privada do município de Aracaju, no intuito de produzir dados, problematizar, discutir e investigar o problema de pesquisa apontado. O estudo suscitou a compreensão de que a forma de nos tornarmos humanos tem sido radicalmente modificada, no qual as identidades e as subjetividades dos infantis são forjadas em um cenário das tecnologias digitais em rede, do consumo, do espetáculo, das visibilidades, das mídias, dentre tantas outras dimensões. As crianças envolvidas na pesquisa vivem intensamente o mundo do ciberespaço e, por isso, elas não têm ideia do que seria a falta de acesso à internet. As manifestações de divertimento das crianças acontecem através dos jogos e da interação com o outro no ciberespaço. Embora os jogos representem o grande destaque da manifestação lúdica, quando se fala da relação criança-internet, pude perceber que a própria interação com o outro se revela um momento de grande prazer e divertimento. A sociedade da cibercultura aponta para uma realidade fluídica de espaços concretos e virtuais coexistindo modos de diversão. Quanto às formas de consumo, diante dos estímulos da web, as crianças aumentaram sua participação inclusive opinam cada vez mais nas compras da família. As crianças escolhem o que querem ver, jogar, vestir, comprar e assim por diante. No tocante aos cuidados corporais, as leituras e observações evidenciaram que a cultura do consumo na qual as crianças estão mergulhadas é indissociável dos corpos das crianças, que incansavelmente tentam a transformação de si próprio. Assumindo esse novo lugar de onde a criança vê e é vista, acredito que na sociedade da cibercultura inauguram-se modos outros de viver a infância, modos reveladores de que as crianças são produtoras de cultura. Isto é, elas são criadoras legítimas de suas interações, promovendo a ressignificação de suas práticas e saberes e redefinindo, no contexto da cibercultura, sua dimensão de sujeitos ativos e de atores sociais. Por fim, e para além dos matizes e das contradições que sem dúvida existem, a problemática de que tratamos aqui é fruto da situação histórica em que nos encontramos, imersos nesta sociedade globalizada do começo do século XXI, e, portanto, é a partir dela que devemos pensar e agir. ABSTRACT The {{present study}} entitled Children in cyberculture: {{the act of}} playing, consuming and the cares with their bodies, develope d in the research line curriculum and (in) formation of PGDE of FACED/UFBA had as its main focus children {{in the beginning of}} 21 st century, those who were born along with digital technologies and are immers e d in cyberculture. I n its narrative, t he study t ried to understand and analyse children’ s relationship with cyberculture, especially regarding the act of playing, consuming and practices related to body cares. Working with childhood and cyberculture as t heoretical fields, ques tions such as ludic, consumption and body were approached. The research is characterised by a qualitative approach focused on a descriptive method. In this sense, o bservations, interviews and questionnaires were carried out with chil dren from 8 to 11 years old in a private school located in Aracaju in order to provide data as well as discuss and examine the question brought by the research. Furthermore, the research shed light on how the way we are human beings has been radically chan ged, in a sense that children’s identities and subjectivities are developed in a scenario of digital technologies network, consummation, spectacle, visibilities, media, among others dimen sions. In this research, the children involved intensively live the cyberspace world, a nd they do not imagine how the world would be without internet. They have fun when they are in touch with games and interacting with one another in cyberspace. Although those games are highlighted in their ludic manifestation, when it is discusse d the relationship between children - internet, it could be perceive d that their interaction with one another reveals a moment of great pleasure and fun. Cyber culture society points towards a fluid reality of concrete and virtual coexisting spaces, therefore, different forms of fun. Concerning the forms of consump tion, taking into account internet’s stimuli, children in creased their participation, including moments such as giving their opinion in their families purchase s. Children choose what they wa <b>nt</b> to <b>see,</b> play, dress, buy, and so forth. Moreover, regarding body cares, the readings and observations evidenced that children are immersed in a consumption culture which is indissociable from children’s bodies, who restlessly try t o change their own bod ies. From this new perspective, wh ich children see and are seen, I believe that cyber culture society ha s inaugurated other forms of living the childhood, revealing ways which children are producing culture. In other words, they are legitimate creators, pro moting re signification of their practices an d knowledge, redefining cyberculture context as well as their dimension as active subjects and social actors. At last, beyond those nuances and contradictions which undoubtedly exist, the problematic which we dea lt here {{is the result of a}} historical situation where we live, immersed in a globalised society of the beginning of the 21 st century and, hence, it is through it we have to think and act...|$|R
