25|$|If metal nitrates are {{prepared}} from N2O4 in completely anhydrous conditions, {{a range of}} covalent metal nitrates can be formed with many transition metals. This is {{because there is a}} thermodynamic preference for the nitrate ion to bond covalently with such metals rather than form an ionic structure. Such compounds must be prepared in anhydrous conditions, since the nitrate ion is a much weaker ligand than water, and if water is present the simple hydrated nitrate will form. The anhydrous nitrates concerned are themselves covalent, and many, e.g. anhydrous copper nitrate, are volatile at room temperature. Anhydrous titanium nitrate sublimes in vacuum at only 40°C. Many of the anhydrous transition metal nitrates have striking colours. This branch of chemistry was developed by Clifford Addisson and Noramn Logan at <b>Nottingham</b> <b>University</b> in the UK during the 1960s and 1970s when highly efficient desiccants and dry boxes started to become available.|$|E
