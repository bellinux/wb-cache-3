2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, Oroonoko possesses a magnificence that surpasses the character of any man or woman within the novel. Even while he is subjected to a gruesome death, he never loses his composure and dignity. In addition to the content of his character, the speaker demonstrates the prince’s greatness through his physical characteristics. In her text, Laura Brown elaborates on Aphra Behn's analysis of Oroonoko's physical characteristics and distinguishes him from the other slaves. The speaker describes Oroonoko as having European features “by which the native ‘other’ is naturalized as a European aristocrat… [...] in physical appearance, the narrator can barely distinguish her native prince from those of England”.. In Aphra Bhen's personal account of Oroonoko, she points out that [...] "His face was not of that brown, rusty Black which most of that Nation are, but a perfect Ebony, or polish'd Jett" [...] and [...] "His Nose was rising and Roman, instead of African and flat" [...] Instead of identifying Oroonoko with physical features that are native to Africa, Behn describes Oroonoko as better than his <b>native</b> <b>counterparts</b> who looks and acts like a European-English aristocrat. He is respected as a decisive leader among his people, which is especially seen when he and his people are captured into slavery and the other slaves refuse to eat while Oroonoko is chained. Furthermore, his leadership is reinforced when the slaves support him in rebellions.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to overcome the disadvantages associated with the poor water solubility and low bioavailability of curcumin by synthesizing nanotized curcumin and demonstrating its efficacy in treating malaria. Materials and methods: Nanotized curcumin was prepared by a modified emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method and was characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, dynamic light scattering, Zetasizer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential thermal analysis. The novelty of the prepared nanoformulation {{lies in the fact that}} it was devoid of any polymeric matrices used in conventional carriers. The antimalarial efficacy of the prepared nanotized curcumin was then checked both in vitro and in vivo. Results: The nanopreparation was found to be non-toxic and had a particle size distribution of 20 - 50 nm along with improved aqueous dispersibility and an entrapment efficiency of 45 %. Nanotized curcumin (half maximal inhibitory concentration IC 50]: 0. 5 mu M) was also found to be ten-fold more effective for growth inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro as compared to its <b>native</b> <b>counterpart</b> (IC 50 : 5 mu M). Oral bioavailability of nanotized curcumin was found to be superior to that of its <b>native</b> <b>counterpart.</b> Moreover, when Plasmodium berghei-infected mice were orally treated with nanotized curcumin, it prolonged their survival by more than 2 months with complete clearance of parasites in comparison to the untreated animals, which survived for 8 days only.

5000|$|Institutional {{arrangements}} {{contribute to}} making migrant domestic workers cost less to employers than their <b>native</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Due to the largely undocumented or informal {{nature of their}} employment, migrants are not automatically entitled to social benefits(health care, etc.), reproductive, and family rights (e.g., family unification).

[...] In terms of working conditions, research on the perception of employers in the UK found that migrants were seen to be more likely to live in and perceived as more ‘flexible’ both in terms of tasks performed and of working hours, another motive for hiring this type of worker.

5000|$|Privet is a {{successful}} invasive species because {{of its ability to}} outcompete and therefore displace native vegetation. [...] This competitive superiority to native vegetation is connected with the plant's ability to adapt to different light conditions. For example, in low light environments, privet is able to produce fewer and larger ramets than its competitors. [...] These larger ramets make privet more tree-like, making privet better able to compete for light than its more shrub-like <b>native</b> <b>counterparts.</b> Privet is an ideal invasive species because it reproduces both sexually and asexually. Through sexual reproduction, privet produces seeds that are easily dispersed by wind and animals. These seeds can rapidly colonize disturbed soil such as that perturbed by fires, forest clearings, erosion, or abandoned agricultural land. Privet matures quickly, which allows for a short generation cycle and even greater dispersal. The roots of privet can reproduce asexually through root suckers. This vegetative reproduction makes privet difficult and costly to control because root fragments left in the soil can sprout and grow new plants.|$|E

5000|$|Financing combatants {{is crucial}} to the success of any rebellion. Extortion and {{donations}} from diasporas are two possible financial sources used by rebellion groups. The extortion of primary commodity resources is especially suited to the operations of rebel groups, as they are often made up of unskilled labor and given whatever weapons are available. As rebel organizations need to be fairly large to have a significant impact and incite a civil war, the looting of primary commodity resources is the best way for them to maintain financial viability. Examples of this include diamonds in Sierra Leone and Angola, timber in Cambodia, coca in Colombia, and poppy in Afghanistan. Another factor that relates to lower constraints on rebellion is that primary resources are often found in rural locales. Thus, they often require an army to defend a large area, something that is much less likely in weak states that cannot sustain a military apparatus. Diaspora populations are also likely funding sources for rebel groups, {{as was the case with}} the Tamil population in North America funding the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka. Diaspora populations, who are usually wealthier than their <b>native</b> <b>counterparts,</b> are able to mobilize for collective action, and do not directly suffer the consequences of a conflict. While the potential for diasporas to be financial backers of rebel groups was noted, Collier and Hoeffler found that diasporas themselves do not increase the risk of conflict. Overall, Collier and Hoeffler's study drew multiple conclusions in support of the greed model. Faster economic growth reduces risk, likely because it raises the opportunity costs of joining a rebellion. The higher a state's dependence on primary commodities, the greater the risk of conflict; this is due to the resources being a main financial component of rebel groups and a weak governmental structure. However, they observed that if there is a particularly high dependence on primary commodity resources, conflict risk declines as states find ways to protect their resources and deter looting. David Keen elaborates on the economic incentives for warfare and argues that there is more to war than simply [...] "winning." [...] In some instances, it could be more beneficial for certain parties to prolong war, so long as they are in control of economic resources or power positions. This can become common in states with weak rule of law where violence becomes privatized. Elite groups within weak states attempt to harness economic agendas and resources within a given civil society and are motivated to create private profit by mobilizing violent means. Keen continues by citing various possible economic functions of violence. His first example of violent means to promote economic gain is pillaging, whether to gain resources or to supplement or supply wages of soldiers. Another function is extortion of protection money from people who can afford it so they can be spared violence inflicted upon them. A third economic function is the monopolistic control of trade. When state control breaks down, trade that was previously prohibited is more easily facilitated and has the potential to generate substantial amounts of profit for those involved. Primary examples of this are weapons and drugs. A fourth function of conflict is the possible exploitation of labor. The threat of violence can be used to coerce cheap or free labor, with extreme cases resulting in forms of slavery. A fifth short-term function is the ability to stake a claim to land and its resources. Similar to Collier and Hoeffler's argument that weak states cannot easily maintain control over their natural resources due to their rural location and potentially wide dispersion, it is economically beneficial to assert control over minimally defended, resource-rich areas. Extracting benefits from aid that is sent to a conflict area is also beneficial for rebel groups as there are often possibilities to raid resources sent from abroad. Appropriation of aid becomes difficult in a weak state. [...] Unlike Collier, Keen does not attribute conflict to be driven more by greed than by grievance; he stresses how the two forces interact so that greed generates grievances and rebellion, which in turn legitimizes further greed. Keen uses the conflict perpetuated by Milosevic in Serbia as an example of how an extended, endless conflict is preferable to one with a definitive end and a clear winner. Milosevic controlled the media to create grievances among the Serbian population, rally them together, and create a common enemy following NATO bombing. The small group of elites surrounding Milosevic perpetuated conditions that warranted international sanctions in order to better control trade and loot resources. Milosevic realized sanctions were necessary to facilitate the profitable black market transactions that were being made by those closest to him. Had he demobilized or embraced a more peaceful policy, the sanctions would have been lifted and his economic advantage would have disintegrated. This is what Keen was referring to in his argument that greed and grievance are often tied together and interact with one another. In this way, Milosevic's initial desire for power spurred him to create grievances amongst the Serbs that created the popular support for his sanction-warranting policies to further his economic and political power - the use of grievances to produce further greed.|$|E

Additional studies revealed that barnase accommodates a range of substrates with various chiralities, but the prime requirement for guanosine remains. These studies point toward using mirror image enzymes as modern agents in biotechnology. United States. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (023504 - 001...|$|R
