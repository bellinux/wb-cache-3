40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effect of the bandwidth and center frequency of narrowband <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors</b> presented in a forward masking paradigm on distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) level. Young adult female listeners with normal hearing participated. DPOAEs were recorded for two different pairs of primary frequencies (f 1 = 1666 Hz, f 2 = 2000 Hz and f 1 = 3333 Hz, f 2 = 4000 Hz) in an unsuppressed condition and three suppressed conditions for each of two experiments. In Experiment 1, the three <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors</b> were centered at the f 2 frequency and had bandwidths selected to be equal to, narrower than, and wider than the estimated equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) at that frequency. It was hypothesized that increasing the suppressor bandwidth from less than the estimated ERB to equal to the ERB would provide a significant increase in magnitude of suppression, but that a further increase in suppressor bandwidth beyond the estimated ERB would provide little if any additional suppression. In Experiment 2, the three <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors</b> had a constant bandwidth and were centered at the f 2 frequency, ½ octave below the f 2 frequency, and ½ octave above the f 2 frequency. It was hypothesized that suppressors centered at the f 2 frequency would cause greater suppression than suppressors centered above and below the f 2 frequency. Results of Experiment 1 revealed a significant effect of the suppressors compared to the unsuppressed condition, but {{there were no significant differences}} between the suppressor bandwidths. Results of Experiment 2 support the hypothesis that a narrowband suppressor centered at the f 2 frequency would have a greater suppressive effect than suppressors centered above or below the f 2 frequency, at least for f 2 = 2000 Hz. These results demonstrate that significant DPOAE suppression can be recorded using <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors</b> presented in a forward masking paradigm. Implications of these results for advancing understanding of the frequency tuning of the cochlea and the medial olivocochlear system are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has {{investigated}} engineering noise controls to reduce sound levels in cabs on air-rotary drill rigs. A recent investigation revealed that some drillers {{are exposed to}} A-weighted sound levels exceeding 85 dB even though a cab is used. NIOSH studied the in-cab sound levels of one such rig. First, preliminary tests were conducted in a controlled environment using accelerometers and microphones with spectral analysis to identify the dominant noise sources for in-cab sound levels. The results indicate that vibration transmitted from multiple hydraulic pumps to the control panel produces a dominant spike in the sound level spectrum in the 400 Hz 1 / 3 -octave band. Next, field tests were performed in a production environment to evaluate noise controls to reduce in-cab sound levels. It was found that utilizing hydraulic <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors</b> reduces the structure-borne noise transmitted to the control panel. Further, using hydraulic <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors</b> and enhancing soundproofing reduced the in-cab A-weighted sound levels {{by as much as}} 4 dB...|$|R

40|$|A liner {{design for}} <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors</b> with outer wall {{treatment}} {{such as in}} an engine inlet is presented which potentially circumvents the problems of resolution in modal measurement. The method {{is based on the}} fact that the modal optimum impedance and the maximum possible sound power attenuation at this optimum can be expressed as functions of cutoff ratio alone. Modes with similar cutoff ratios propagate similarly in the duct and in addition propagate similarly to the far field. Thus there is no need to determine the acoustic power carried by these modes individually, and they can be grouped together as one entity. With the optimum impedance and maximum attenuation specified as functions of cutoff ratio, the off-optimum liner performance can be estimated using an approximate attenuation equation...|$|R
40|$|Jet peak-velocity decay {{data were}} {{obtained}} {{for a variety of}} circular and noncircular single-element and multi-element nozzles for application to externally-blown-flap (EBF) STOL aircraft. These data permit a rational approach, in terms of element type and element spacing, to nozzles designed to promote mixing of the jet exhaust with the surrounding air. Rapid mixing and the resulting lower axial jet velocity decreases the noise caused by the interaction of jet impingement on the flap assembly of EBF STOL aircraft. Empirical relationships are presented that permit the prediction of peak axial-velocity decay curves for a wide spectrum of mixer-type nozzles. The data are useful also in the design of ejector-type <b>noise</b> <b>suppressors</b> and for the suppression of VTOL downwash velocities caused by vertically oriented exhaust nozzles...|$|R
