40|$|Growing cells on {{surfaces}} bearing nanotopography signals makes many changes in cell gene expression and downstream changes in phenotype but the mechanisms for this have, so far, been obscure. We consider {{the question of}} whether the topography directly nanoimprints onto the cell as a component of the signal transduction system. Evidence we present from SEM, TEM and fluorescence detection of the arrangements of cytoskeletal components is consistent with the possibility that cells are nanoimprinted by the substrate. The <b>nanoprinting</b> does not interfere with integrin-mediated adhesion processes and may perhaps work through them. Time-lapse video studies of cells moving from areas bearing nanotopography to flat areas and vice versa suggests that the nanoimprinting takes 1 – 6  h to appear on the cell and a similar time to disappear when the cell moves from a flat surface to a nanotopographic one and back.

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} recovers {{an original}} function of tissue by replacing the damaged part {{with a new}} tissue or organ regenerated using various engineering technologies. This technology uses a scaffold to support three-dimensional (3 D) tissue formation. Conventional scaffold fabrication methods do not control the architecture, pore shape, porosity, or interconnectivity of the scaffold, so it has limited ability to stimulate cell growth and to generate new tissue. 3 D printing technologies may overcome these disadvantages of traditional fabrication methods. These technologies use computers to assist in design and fabrication, so the 3 D scaffolds can be fabricated as designed and standardized. Particularly, because nanofabrication technology based on two-photon absorption (2 PA) and on controlled electrospinning can generate structures with submicron resolution, these methods have been evaluated in various areas of tissue engineering. Recent combinations of 3 D <b>nanoprinting</b> technologies with methods from molecular biology and cell dynamics have suggested new possibilities for improved tissue regeneration. If the interaction between cells and scaffold system with biomolecules can be understood and controlled and if an optimal 3 D environment for tissue regeneration can be realized, 3 D <b>nanoprinting</b> will become an important tool in tissue engineering...|$|R

40|$|Many {{important}} biomedical {{and clinical}} applications, such as early-stage cancer diagnosis, autoimmune disease treatment, and real-time monitoring of patients’ immune status, demand new integrated multiplexing nanoelectronic/microfluidic biosensors. These biosensors are anticipated to enable fast (minute-scale) quantification of illness-related biomarkers, unprecedented detection sensitivity, fM-level limit-of-detection (LOD), and point-of-care capability. However, these new highly desirable biosensing capabilities {{have not been}} realized yet. Atomically layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained {{a lot of attention}} because of their excellent electronic and structural properties. Especially, semiconducting TMDCs can serve as an essential complement to zero-band-gap graphene and enable novel semiconductor-related applications, such as thin-film transistors, phototransistors, and various types of sensors. More importantly, such TMDCs hold significant potential to be exploited for making new electronic biosensors and realize the highly desirable biosensing capabilities mentioned above. The research presented in this thesis sought to advance the scientific and technical knowledge for fabricating and operating new TMDC-based electronic/microfluidic-integrated biosensors and realizing rapid fM-level quantification of biomarkers. The first part (i. e., the second chapter) is mainly focused on developing a top-down nanofabrication approach for producing orderly arranged, pristine few-layer MoS 2 flakes, which holds significant potential to be developed into a upscalable nanomanufacturing technology. The second part (i. e., the third-to-fifth chapters) presents a systematic study on the biosensing characteristics of the TMDC-based transistor sensors fabricated using our <b>nanoprinting</b> techniques. First, multiple sets of MoS 2 -based transistor biosensors were fabricated using our plasma-assisted <b>nanoprinting</b> method. Second, we studied the underlying device physics governing the response characteristics of TDMC transistor biosensors. Third, we further studied a cycle-wise method for operating MoS 2 /WSe 2 -based transistor biosensors to enable rapid, low-noise, highly specific biomolecule quantification at femtomolar levels.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the high-resolution production of polymer nanopatterns with controllable geometrical parameters {{by means of a}} single-spot electron-beam lithography technique. The essence of the method entails the overexposure of a positive-tone resist, spin-coated onto a substrate where nanoscale spots are exposed to an electron beam with a dose greater than 0. 1 pC per dot. A single-spot enables the fabrication of a nanoring, while a chain of spots placed at distance of 5 – 30 nm from each other allows the production of a polymer pattern of complex geometry of sub- 10 nm resolution. We demonstrate that in addition to the naturally oxidized silicon substrates, gold-coated substrates can also successfully be used for the single-spot nanopattering technique. An explanation of the results related to the resist overexposure was demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations. Our nanofabrication method significantly accelerates (up to 10 times) the fabrication rate as compared to conventional lithography on positive-tone resist. This technique can be potentially employed in the electronics industry for the production of <b>nanoprinted</b> lithography molds, etching masks, nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, NEMS and MEMS devices...|$|R

Unfortunately, the advance of printed electronics has been held back by the limited minimum resolution, aspect ratio, and feature fidelity of present printing techniques such as gravure, screen printing and inkjet printing. Templated dry printing offers a solution to these problems by patterning nanoparticle inks into templates before drying. This dissertation shows advancements in two varieties of templated dry <b>nanoprinting.</b> The first, advective micromolding in vapor-permeable templates (AMPT) is a microfluidic approach that uses evaporation-driven mold filling to create submicron features with a 1 : 1 aspect ratio. We will discuss submicron surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators made through this process, and the refinement process in the template manufacturing process necessary to make these devices. We also present modeling techniques {{that can be applied}} to future AMPT templates. We conclude with a modified templated dry printing that improves throughput and isolated feature patterning by transferring dry-templated features with laser ablation. This method utilizes surface energy-defined templates to pattern features via doctor blade coating.

Especially for critical size bone defects, tissue engineering with mesenchymal stem cells is extensively studied because these cells are functioning as precursors for osteoblast in vivo. Nevertheless to reproduce the complex interaction of various factors in vitro {{is not an easy}} approach and further investigations have to be done. The status quo is summarized. A variety of growth and transcription factors are known to be involved in osteogenesis with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and the transcription factor Runx 2 being the most extensively studied ones. But also PPAR γ and Osterix are generally regarded as the master regulators of osteoblast differentiation. Recently the large family of purinergic receptors has proven to be essential molecules in osteogenesis as well. In addition, scaffolding is needed to create a three-dimensional tissue.

Planar metamaterials with subwavelength thickness, or metasurfaces, consisting of single-layer or few-layer stacks of planar structures, can be readily fabricated using lithography and <b>nanoprinting</b> methods, and the ultrathin thickness in the wave propagation direction can greatly suppress the undesirable losses. Metasurfaces enable a spatially varying optical response, mold optical wavefronts into shapes that can be designed at will, and facilitate the integration of functional materials to accomplish active control and greatly enhanced nonlinear response. This paper reviews recent progress in the physics of metasurfaces operating at wavelengths ranging from microwave to visible.

An overview of dielectric metasurfaces reveals their ability to realize unique functionalities coupled with Mie resonances and their low ohmic losses.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis was to combine top-down and bottom-up techniques to develop a nanofabrication method that would allow for the highly parallel and repetitive production of any desired nanostructure. This was realised by (1) immobilising gold nanoparticle (AuNP) building blocks onto lithographically produced nanopatterns (stamps) by electrostatic self-assembly, followed by (2) transfer of the surface-confined AuNP assemblies from the stamps to non-patterned capture substrates by a DNA-directed <b>nanoprinting</b> technique. A surfactant Tween 20 mediated AuNP surface modification was developed as a rapid synthesis of highly stable negatively charged AuNP conjugates. Three different types of AuNP conjugates bearing different surface ligands - deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), SH-PEG-COOH, and a mixture of DNA and SH-PEG-COOH (denoted AuNP/DNA, AuNP/SH-PEG-COOH and AuNP/DNA/SH-PEG-COOH) - were successfully synthesised at salt concentration of 0. 5 M using this approach. The AuNP/DNA conjugates showed high colloidal stability in environments of high ionic strength (up to 1. 5 M NaCl {{in the presence of}} Tween 20). The DNA loading densities on different sized AuNPs were investigated and found to be approximately 37, 102 and 231 DNA strands per NP for 20, 30 and 40 nm AuNP/DNA conjugates, respectively. The AuNP/SH-PEG-COOH conjugates showed sharp size-dependent colloidal stability thresholds as a function of ionic strength. A size-selective AuNP separation method was developed based on the colloidal stability of AuNP/SH-PEG-COOH conjugates of different sizes. A colloidal AuNP solution with bimodal size distribution (20 and 40 nm) was successfully separated using this approach, with more than 99. 4 % accuracy. Templating nanopatterns onto which the AuNP building blocks were immobilised comprised of elevated and recessed gold features on silica-coated silicon substrates were fabricated by means of electron beam lithography (EBL). Various geometries of the templating nanostructures, including nanolines, nanocrosses, nanotriangles, and nanodisks, were produced. Plain gold substrates were fabricated by evaporating chromium (Cr) and gold (Au) onto planar silicon wafers. The gold nanopatterns and the plain gold substrates were used as stamps and capture substrates for the DNA-directed AuNP printing, respectively. Protocols for surface modification of the stamps and capture substrates were developed; the former were surface-selectively modified with PEG-silane and SH-PEG-NH 2 and the latter modified with DNA strands. The negatively charged AuNP conjugates were electrostatically assembled onto the EBL produced nanopatterns. When using AuNP/DNA conjugates as building blocks, the NPs were specifically immobilised onto positively charged gold nanopatterns, with high NP loadings. The EBL defined nanopatterns were well replicated by the self-assembled AuNP/DNA conjugates and non-specific adsorption was found to be extraordinarily low. When using AuNP/SH-PEG-COOH conjugates as building blocks, hexagonal close-packed (hcp) ordered AuNP superstructures and significant non-specific adsorption of AuNPs were observed. This is believed to be caused by AuNP agglomeration and precipitation during the self-assembly process. When AuNP/DNA/SH-PEG-COOH conjugates were used as NP building blocks, the NPs were specifically adsorbed onto the nanopatterns, forming closely packed AuNP assemblies on the nanopatterns. A two-step self-assembly strategy, that made use of electrostatic and DNA-directed AuNP immobilisation, was furthermore developed, enabling the fabrication of core-satellite AuNP assemblies (one 30 nm NP surrounded by six to nine 20 nm NPs). An affinity-based <b>nanoprinting</b> technique that exploits electrostatic AuNP assembly and DNA-directed replication of lithographically defined nanostructures was developed. The negatively charged AuNP/DNA conjugates were electrostatically immobilised onto SH-PEG-NH 2 modified templating nanostructures and then printed onto non-patterned capture substrates, functionalised with DNA complementary to the AuNP-confined DNA, through DNA-DNA interaction. Single lines of AuNPs and regular NP patterns with close to single-particle resolution could be printed. Dense AuNP loading and high transfer yields were observed over three consecutive printing cycles. A UV-ozone surface cleaning method was developed to remove the AuNP-bound DNA strands, which could make the replicated AuNP nanopatterns applicable {{to a wide range of}} applications that require pristine metal NP arrays, e. g. plasmonic biosensors. The core-satellite assemblies were studied as substrates for Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). The SERS signals of benzenethiol on the core-satellite AuNP assemblies were shown to be dependent on the excitation wavelength: the SERS effect was negligible when excited at 514 nm, while the SERS signals were significantly enhanced compared with the widely spaced core AuNPs and planar gold substrates when excited at 633 nm and 782 nm, respectively. The larger SERS enhancements for the core-satellite AuNP assemblies could be due to the formation of “hot spots” between core and satellite AuNPs. The detection limit of benzenethiol was found to be between 1 - 10 nM when using the core-satellite AuNP assemblies as SERS substrates...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} method to place individual building- blocks onto pre-ordinate positions on a templating nanopattern so that the building- blocks replicated the templating structures. The templating substrate was fabricated by a series of different processes conducted in the following sequence: electron-beam lithography, etching, chromium/gold evaporation and resist lift-off. The gold nanopatterns were functionalised with oligonucleotides (DNA) using thiol-gold chemistry and the building-blocks (DNA modified gold nanoparticles) were assembled onto the templating nanostructure by DNA-DNA interaction. The templating nanopattern consisted of gold features on a silicon substrate. A method to passivate the surrounding silicon surface was developed and the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) hybridisation conditions were optimised. An assessment of the DNA-directed self-assembly of AuNPs was conducted. The hybridisation efficiency onto each adsorption site was 80 % while the non-specific adsorption was 0. 7 %. Approximately 50 % of all the six-dot lines had five AuNPs immobilised, while roughly 20 % had six particles. The occurrence of defects could be repressed by modifying the geometry of the templating nanostructures. An additional objective was to develop a method to assemble AuNP structures into more complex structures that potentially could be used as building-blocks for additional self-assembly. For the nanostructures to be used as building-blocks they would have to be covalently interconnected (e. g. by cross-linking) prior to being released from the templating substrate, to ensure that their configuration remained intact upon release. Following the release, the templating substrate could be reused for additional AuNP self-assembly cycles. The release of the AuNPs and the reusability of DNA functionalised substrates was investigated on non-patterned substrates. It was found that AuNPs could be immobilised and released ten times without a statistically significant {{decrease in the number of}} particles immobilised per μm 2. A covalent cross-linking concept was developed and investigated for AuNPs im- mobilised onto non-patterned substrates. A clear difference in the release behaviour between AuNPs immobilised on substrates subjected to and not subjected to the cross- linking conditions was observed, which suggested that the cross-linking strategy was successful. When released AuNPs were recollected on capture substrates, no difference in the configuration of the released AuNPs was established between nanopatterns subject to and not subjected to the cross-linking conditions. It was found that the AuNPs were not stable at the temperatures required to drive the AuNPs release from the templating substrate and thus the temperature induced release of assembled nanostructures was not a viable option. Alternative systems, in which temperature is not used to drive the release of cross- linked nanostructures, could potentially circumvent the thermal instability of the particles. For example by using fuel-DNA to drive the desorption of cross-linked nanostructures, according to the work of Hazarika et al., or by using <b>nanoprinting</b> techniques to directly transfer the nanoparticle assemblies onto a capture substrate...|$|R

Spin coat for 10 sec at 100 rpm (to coat the coverslip), then for 20 sec at 1000 rpm (to form a thin layer of polystyrene). - iii. After the spin coating, dry the polystyrene layer. - *If a spin coater is not available for use in Steps 14 and 15, spread the drops manually by handling the coverslip with tweezers and displacing the drop with an orbital rotation of the coverslip. After coating the coverslip, remove excess liquid with a tissue. If this alternative method is used, reduce the polystyrene to 0. 5 % so that the polystyrene layer will not be too thick*. - *Glass coverslips covered with polystyrene can be stored at room temperature for days. Oxidation of the substrate (Step 17) should be carried out immediately before the substrate is stamped (Step 20) *. *Microcontact Printing* *See Figure 4 for an overview of stamping fibronectin and backfilling with PLL-g-PEG*. ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. Stamping fibronectin and backfilling with PLL-g-PEG. 16. Place a 20 -μL drop of 50 μg/mL fibronectin in PBS onto the microstructured surface of a 1 -cm 2 stamp. Spread the fibronectin solution across the stamp surface with the tip of the pipette by moving it toward each corner of the stamp. Leave the inked stamp for ~ 30 min to allow the fibronectin to adsorb to the PDMS. - *Spreading the fibronectin is necessary because the PDMS is hydrophobic. The surface of the stamp can be gently touched without damaging it*. 17. Transfer the polystyrene-coated coverslip (from Step 15) into a plasma cleaner. Turn on the pump to create a vacuum in the chamber. Allow a low flow of oxygen into the chamber and apply an oscillating electric field at 30 W for 10 sec. - *Tissue culture polystyrene dish substrates can be printed on without plasma oxidation, but plasma treatment (as described here) significantly improves printing and passivation efficiencies. Polystyrene Petri dishes (not activated for tissue culture) can also be used, provided they are activated by plasma treatment*. - *Stamp oxidized substrates (Step 20) within 15 min of activating them*. - *Substrate activation can also be performed in a UV/ozone cleaner (λ < 200 nm) *. 18. Aspirate off the fibronectin drop and immediately add a large drop of PBS to the surface before it dries. Repeat the PBS wash two more times to remove all of the unadsorbed fibronectin. 19. Remove the PBS drop and let the stamp dry in the airflow of a hood (it will take from a few seconds up to 1 min). The stamp is ready for printing when the surface appears dry while looking at light reflecting from it. *See Troubleshooting*. 20. Grasp the dry stamp with tweezers, invert the stamp, and place the microstructured surface in contact with the activated substrate (from Step 17). Briefly apply gentle pressure with the tweezers to ensure good contact between the stamp and the substrate. Leave the stamp in contact with the substrate for 1 min. - *This step is absolutely critical for success and requires practice to achieve satisfactory results*. 21. Remove the stamp and immerse it into H 2 O in a 50 -mL culture tube. 22. Prepare 0. 1 mg/mL PLL-g-PEG solution in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7. 4). Immerse the printed substrate in this solution for 30 min. To minimize the amount of PLL-g-PEG used, place a 100 -μL drop on the substrate and cover it with a piece of Parafilm. - *The PLL-g-PEG renders the nonprinted areas resistant to cell adhesion. See Troubleshooting*. 23. During PLL-g-PEG adsorption, clean the stamp. Heat the culture tube containing the stamp at 60 °C and sonicate it in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. Then sonicate the stamp in ethanol for 15 min. - *This cleaning procedure might not remove all the protein from the stamp. If another type of protein is to be stamped, it is better to use a new stamp*. 24. Dry the clean stamp under a hood for 1 h. Return the stamp to its storage container. 25. Wash the PLL-g-PEG-grafted substrate with PBS for 2 min and then for 10 min. - *The substrate is now ready for cell deposition. If not used immediately, it can be stored immersed in PBS or dried and stored under argon at 4 °C for up to 1 wk*. **Cell Deposition** *Micropatterned substrates prepared using this protocol have been used successfully with the following cells: HeLa-B, RPE 1, MCF 10 A, MCF 7, NIH 3 T 3, HepaRG, MDCK, and human mesenchymal stem cells, as well as dendritic cells derived from murine bone marrow*. 26.

Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in complete culture medium at 50, 000 cells/mL. 29. Add the cell solution to the micropatterned substrate (from Step 25). The final cell density should be ~ 10, 000 cells/cm 2. Place the cell-covered substrate into a tissue culture incubator. - *The incubation time depends upon the cell line (e. g., 15 - 30 min for RPE 1 and 30 - 60 min for HeLa-B) *. 30. Check the cells under a microscope to determine if a sufficiently large proportion of cells have attached to the micropatterns. 31. Remove unattached cells with a gentle flow of medium added {{to one side of the}} dish and aspirated from the other side. - *Keep the cells moist; do not allow them to become exposed to the air. The physicochemical properties of PEG can cause dewetting, leading the attached cells to quickly dry out*. 32. Return the attached cells to the incubator. Let them spread fully (1 - 5 h, depending on the cell type). 33. Fix or video-record the cells. *See Figure 5 for examples of cells attached to micropatterns*. ![Figure 5]([URL] "Figure 5 ") **Figure 5 **. Images of cells on micropatterns.

Scale bar, 100 μm. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Separating the PDMS layer from the photoresist master destroys the master. **[Step 11]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Curing the PDMS mixture (Step 10) for more than 2 h at 60 °C can induce PDMS binding to the photoresist, which weakens the resist layer and results in destruction of the photoresist master when the two layers are separated. Avoid curing for more than 2 h. - 2. Silanization of the resist master (Steps 6 and 7) might have failed. This will result in strong binding of the cured PDMS to the master. Before making a new master, check on a blank one that the silane used for the coating is still functional. Silanes tend to degrade, and the silane solution should be renewed regularly. - **Problem**: Salt crystals form on the surface of the elastomeric stamp as the PBS dries. **[Step 19]** - **Solution**: This may happen if an excess of PBS is left to dry on the stamp. Avoid this by washing the stamp once with H 2 O before drying. - **Problem**: The polystyrene layer detaches and floats at the surface when the coverslip is placed in aqueous solution. **[Step 22]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Treat the coverslip with adhesion promoter (Step 14) prior to applying the polystyrene. - 2. Affix the polystyrene to the coverslip by placing the polystyrene-coated coverslip under a UV lamp for 5 min at λ = 185 nm and 4 × 60 W (Yan and Harnish 2003). - **Problem**: Cells do not grow uniformly and/or they grow significantly beyond the boundaries of the microfeatures. **[Step 33]** - **Solution**: Consider the following when stamping the substrate in Step 20 : - 1. Insufficient pressure might result in poor printing. Apply pressure with the tweezers both uniformly and for a longer period of time. - 2. Excessive pressure will induce sagging of the stamp, causing proteins to print outside of the features. Apply pressure more gently. - 3. Do not move the stamp once it has touched the surface. Both application and removal of the stamp should be done with precision and great care. ### DISCUSSION Microfabrication techniques as applied to cell biology now have a long and successful history (see Folch and Toner [2000] and Whitesides et al. [2001] for reviews of many micropatterning techniques developed from the 1970 s to the 1990 s). Accompanying the rapid development of biological applications (in cell biology, tissue engineering, cell co-cultures, bioassays, and biosensors, among other fields), there has been a huge burst of technical papers in the last 10 years that expand the utility of micropatterning techniques to new substrates (glass, plastics, hydrogels, and elastomers), additional molecules, cell types, and into three dimensions. There are many alternative techniques, but five main processes dominate the field of micropatterning: 1. Photolithography and lift-off (as well as other stencil-type methods) - Laser/electron beam etching - Micro- and <b>nanoprinting</b> - UV-based chemistry - Microcontact printing Each method has drawbacks and advantages, so that the method chosen will depend upon the application.
