40|$|Document complet disponible sur OLIS dans son format d'origine Complete {{document}} {{available on}} OLIS {{in its original}} formatSUMMARY Over {{the last few years}} numbering arrangements for telecommunication services have become a key issue for discussion among policy-makers, regulators and telecommunication operators in a number of countries. Historically, the allocation of numbers has been seen primarily as a technical issue. Engineers at the Public Telecommunication Operators (PTOs) have had complete control over number allocation functions. In many countries, PTOs themselves have been designated as the legal entities authorised to control and manage <b>national</b> <b>numbering</b> <b>plans</b> {{and to make sure that}} they comply with national and international rules. Indeed, they themselves have been setting the national rules, if any, regarding number allocation. With the advent of liberalisation, however, and the rise of competition in service provision, the issue of numbering acquired important economic, political and commercial dimensions. A major concern expressed by competitive service providers in countries where competition is being introduced, is that the continuing control of <b>national</b> <b>numbering</b> schemes by incumbent operators may increase barriers to entry to new entrants in a market and thus hinder competition. Current discussions at the national level focus o...|$|R
50|$|As from August 29, 2010, all {{phone numbers}} have 8 digits, {{according}} to the new <b>National</b> <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan.</b> Zero prior to area code was eliminated. Therefore, to make a call to any city in the country you have to dial 8 digits. This plan was implemented by URSEC (Spanish abbreviation for Regulator Unit of Services of Communications).|$|E
5000|$|The {{area code}} +1 246 is a {{composite}} part of the telephone numbering plan for Barbados, {{also known as the}} <b>National</b> <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan.</b> [...] It is part of a system used for assigning telephone numbers in Barbados, and functions {{as a part of the}} North American Numbering Plan (NANP). It is regulated by the government's Telecommunications Unit, which holds responsibility for telecommunications.|$|E
50|$|The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has {{established}} a comprehensive numbering plan, designated E.164, for uniform interoperability of the networks of its member state or regional administrations. It is an open numbering plan, however, imposing a maximum length of 15 digits to telephone numbers. The standard defines a country calling code (country code) for each state or region which is prefixed to each <b>national</b> <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> telephone number for international destination routing.|$|E
50|$|The North American <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> {{does not}} set aside special non-geographic area codes {{exclusively}} for cellular phones. Only one regional exception exists in area code 600 in Canada.In many other <b>national</b> <b>numbering</b> <b>plans</b> outside the NANP, mobile services are assigned separate prefixes. Cell phone {{numbers in the}} NANP are allocated within each area code from special central office prefixes and calls to them are billed {{at the same rate}} as any other call. Consequently, the caller pays pricing model adopted in other countries, in which calls to cellular phones are charged at a higher nationwide rate, but incoming mobile calls are not charged to the mobile user, could not be implemented. Instead, North American cellular telephone subscribers are also generally charged for receiving calls (subscriber pays). This has discouraged mobile users from publishing their telephone number. However, price competition among carriers has reduced the average price per call minute for contract customers for both inbound and outbound calls, which compare favorably to those in caller-pays countries. Most users select bundle pricing plans that include an allotment of minutes expected to be used in the billing period. Of the four major national carriers in the United States, all four (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon) offer free calling between mobile phones on the carrier's network, and Sprint also offers its customers free calling to mobile phones on other networks.|$|R
50|$|In one {{background}} document from 2004, Ofcom {{states that}} In order {{to conform to}} the <b>National</b> Telephone <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> (NTNP), the names of the following Geographic Area Codes have changed - 1248, 1268, 1275, 1276, 1291, 1293, 1306, 1322, 1327, 1334, 1344, 1354, 1356, 1375, 1384, 1394, 1425, 1438, 1442, 1451, 1454, 1461, 1470, 1471, 1477, 1478, 1485, 1488, 1489, 1491, 1543, 1561, 1562, 1582, 1588, 1598, 1661, 1668, 1675, 1680, 1681, 1684, 1688, 1689, 1695, 1707, 1720, 1727, 1737, 1744, 1753, 1770, 1784, 1806, 1821, 1856, 1870, 1877, 1883, 1885, 1889, 1895, 1908, 1920, 1922, 1926, 1928, 1932, 1952, 1953, 1963, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1992.|$|R
50|$|Premium-rate {{telephone}} numbers are {{telephone numbers}} for telephone calls during which certain services are provided, {{and for which}} prices higher than normal are charged. Unlike a normal call, part of the call charge is paid to the service provider, thus enabling businesses to be funded via the calls. While the billing is different, calls are usually routed {{the same way they}} are for a toll-free telephone number, being anywhere despite the area code used. These telephone numbers are usually allocated from a <b>national</b> telephone <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> {{in such a way that}} they are easily distinguished from other numbers. Telephone companies typically offer blocking services to allow telephone customers to prevent access to these number ranges from their telephones. In some jurisdictions, telephone companies are required by law to offer such blocking.|$|R

50|$|Telephone {{numbers in}} Singapore, {{also known as}} the <b>National</b> <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan,</b> are {{regulated}} by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). Due to the small geographical size of Singapore, there are no area or trunk codes, with the Public Switched Telephone Network, Radio Network and IP Telephony all belonging to one numbering area, and thus comes in the same 8-digit numbering format. Numbers are categorised based on the first digit, thus providing ten possible categories, of which six are currently in use and the remaining four reserved for future usage.|$|E

50|$|The E.164 {{standard}} of the International Telecommunications Union {{is an international}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> and establishes a country calling code (country code) for each member organization. Country codes are prefixes to <b>national</b> telephone <b>numbers</b> that denote call routing to the network of a subordinate <b>number</b> <b>plan</b> administration, typically a country, or group of countries with a uniform <b>numbering</b> <b>plan,</b> such as the NANP. E.164 permits a maximum length of 15 digits for the complete international phone number consisting of the country code, the national routing code (area code), and the subscriber number. E.164 does not define regional <b>numbering</b> <b>plans,</b> however, it does provide recommendations for new implementations and uniform representation of all telephone numbers.|$|R
