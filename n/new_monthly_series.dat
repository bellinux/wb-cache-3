2500|$|From {{the middle}} {{years of the}} 1890s, Unitarian book and {{magazine}} publisher Charles H. Kerr of Chicago became attracted to the ideas of first populism and then Marxist socialism. Just as Simons and Section Chicago of the SLP were launching The Workers' Call, so too was Kerr changing {{the direction of his}} publishing house, launching a <b>new</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>series</b> of small pamphlets in red glassine covers called the [...] "Pocket Library of Socialism" [...] on May 15, 1899. The first number of the series was by May Wood Simons, Woman and the Social Problem, while husband Algie chipped in title number 4, Packingtown: A Study of the Union Stock Yards, Chicago.|$|E

Both short-run and long-run reallocations occur mostly without an intervening spell of non-employment, and therefore cannot be uncovered without splitting employment into finer categories.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the construction and}} main features of a <b>new</b> <b>monthly</b> time <b>series</b> for the {{mean and standard deviation}} of consumer inflation expectations in the United Kingdom in the years 1961 - 85, based on a number of consumer surveys. This involves generalizing to four- and five-category tendency survey data the method used by J. A. Carlson and M. Parkin (1975) to quantify the results of a three-category tendency survey of inflation expectations. The new series exhibit very different time series properties from the original Carlson-Parkin data. Copyright 1988 by The London School of Economics and Political Science. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} analyze <b>new</b> <b>monthly</b> index <b>series</b> for U. K. {{financial}} assets, covering equities, bonds, bills, and inflation. The data {{are consistent with}} the CRSP/Ibbotson series for the United States. We use our indices to estimate equity and bond premia and to make international comparisons, especially with the United States, Germany, and Japan. We illustrate potential uses of the new series by investigating stock market seasonality, inflation-linked bonds, real dividend growth rates, and the small-firm effect. While some of our findings resemble U. S. results, we also report differences between U. K. and U. S. stock market behavior. Copyright 2001 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of Gross' run, there were tentative plans for the comic to rest after it reached its 75th issue. Such a break {{would be used to}} allow the character of Tim Hunter to grow up a little before resuming his story - Gross had ideas for this later run to explore the character's relationship with the women in his life, through his relationship with his late mother. However, when the 75th issue was reached, Gross decided {{to move away from the}} book, and instead DC announced that Dylan Horrocks would continue Tim's story in a five-issue mini-series called Names of Magic after a short break symbolizing Tim's readiness to face his destiny. It was also announced that the new mini-series would be followed by an unnamed <b>new</b> ongoing <b>monthly</b> <b>series,</b> which was eventually announced as Hunter: The Age of Magic.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to estimate the}} amount of U. S. currency held abroad. The method exploits the fact the Federal Reserve System is the major processor of currency for depository institutions. The method exploits differentials across denominations in the ratios of shipments to receipts of currency at Federal Reserve cash offices in New York City and nationwide. The method permits us to construct a <b>new</b> <b>monthly</b> time <b>series</b> on the domestic monetary base, M 1 and M 2. The method has several advantages over previous methods, including an earlier starting date (1965) {{and the ability to}} be updated easily each month from Federal Reserve currency processing data. Relative to previous studies, our estimates suggest larger currency exports during the 1970 s and early 1980 s, and a sharp slowing of exports since 1995.; This paper has been replaced with working paper 2000 - 002, "The Domestic Adjusted Monetary Base".

5000|$|A <b>new</b> <b>monthly</b> Jonah Hex <b>series</b> {{debuted in}} January 2006 [...] (cover date November 2005), written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti with {{interior}} art by varying (and occasionally recurring) artists. In assorted postings on their message board, Grey and Palmiotti have stated their intent to depict various adventures {{from across the}} full length of Hex's life and career. The main artistic difference is that the series is published without the external restraints of the Comics Code Authority which allows for harder edged stories without having to keep with the Vertigo imprint's dark fantasy themes. Tony DeZuniga, the original Hex artist, returned to pencil two issues of the book (#5 and #9). John Higgins drew issue #28 and J. H. Williams III provided the art for Jonah Hex #35, expressing an interest in doing more: [...] "I certainly want to do more issues myself or even a graphic novel if the opportunity and schedule presented itself." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>New,</b> long <b>monthly</b> <b>series</b> of Icelandic air pressure, temperature, {{precipitation}} and sunshine {{data are}} presented and analysed to determine possible evidence of recent climatic changes in Iceland. Climatic series are {{compared with the}} North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) indices; Icelandic temperature and precipitation are moderately but significantly correlated with the NAO. An updated south–north Iceland temperature index is discussed in relation to 20 th century reductions in sea-ice coverage. Net warming over Iceland occurred over all long-term records from the mid 19 th century to the present, consistent with observed global warming trends, but superimposed on this was a marked cooling between the 1940 s and early 1980 s; Icelandic warming resumed around 1985. The mid–late 20 th century cooling is in agreement with observed cooling in southern Greenland, suggesting that large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation were probably responsible. The 1930 s was the warmest decade of the 20 th century in Iceland, {{in contrast to the}} Northern Hemisphere land average. There was a distinct 20 th century dipole in temperatures between Iceland and northwestern Europe, with 1941 serving as an extreme year, i. e. cold Europe and warm Iceland and Greenland. There are also signs of a precipitation increase since the late 19 th century, although this is significant for only one out of three stations. Moreover, precipitation rates exhibit a positive correlation with temperature. There were no statistically significant overall long-term changes in pressure or sunshine duration. However, there are statistically significant negative correlations of precipitation wit...|$|R
