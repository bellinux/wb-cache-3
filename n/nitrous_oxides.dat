5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxides.</b> These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E

For example, air concentrations of volatile organic compounds declined by a factor of 50 between 1962 and 2012.

40|$|<b>Nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> is {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas that is released by microorganisms in soil. However, the production of <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> in soil is highly variable and difficult to predict. Future climate change may have large impacts on <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> release through alteration of precipitation patterns. We analyzed DNA extracted from soil in order to uncover relationships between microbial processes, abundance of particular DNA sequences and net <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> fluxes from soil. Denitrification, a microbial process in which nitrate is used as an electron acceptor, correlated with <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> flux from soil. The abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaea correlated positively, but weakly, with <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> production in soil. The abundance of bacterial genes in soil was negatively correlated with gross nitrogen mineralization rates and <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> release from soil.

The reduction of oxygen concentration, on its own, increased heart rate and cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Although these changes were noted only with 9 per cent fluroxene, <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> produced an alpha-adrenergic sympathomimetic response with 5 per cent fluroxene, but at 9 per cent a mixed alpha and beta response was obtained. Adding <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> and subtracting an equivalent amount of fluroxene produced a response similar to that seen when <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> was simply added to 5 per cent fluroxene. Comparing the response of <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> substituted for nitrogen eliminated {{some of the differences}} between the responses at light and deep levels. Since the response to adding <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> to fluroxene differed considerably from that seen with halothane or ether we can draw no conclusions concerning the circulatory action of <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide,</b> and it would appear that we have observed an interaction between <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> and fluroxene. <b>Nitrous</b> <b>oxide,</b> when added to halothane-oxygen or ether-oxygen anaesthesia, produces vasoconstriction and other signs of sympathetic activation (Smith et al., 1970; Gregory et al., 1971).

Since <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> is frequently used with fluroxene, we elected to study the combination. The response to <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> with halothane or ether was concentration-dependent. Therefore, we investigated the response to <b>nitrous</b> <b>oxide</b> at end-tidal concentrations of fluroxene of 5 % and 9 %.
