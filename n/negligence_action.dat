40|$|Tort {{law reform}} has {{resulted}} in legislation being passed by all Australian jurisdictions {{in the past decade}} implementing the recommendations contained in the Ipp Report. The report was in response to a perceived crisis in medical indemnity insurance. The objective was to restrict and limit liability in <b>negligence</b> <b>actions.</b> This paper will consider to what extent the reforms have impacted on the liability of health professionals in medical <b>negligence</b> <b>actions.</b> After an analysis of the legislation, it will be argued in this paper that while there has been some limitation and restriction, courts have generally interpreted the civil liability reforms in compliance with the common law. It has been the impact of statutory limits on the assessment of damages through thresholds and caps which has limited the liability of health professionals in medical <b>negligence</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R
50|$|MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916) is {{a famous}} New York Court of Appeals opinion by Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo which removed the {{requirement}} of privity of contract for duty in <b>negligence</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Drawing {{upon the}} work of {{scholars}} such as Fowler V.

5000|$|Punitive damages - Punitive damages are {{to punish}} a defendant, {{rather than to}} {{compensate}} plaintiffs, in negligence cases. In most jurisdictions punitive damages are recoverable in a <b>negligence</b> <b>action,</b> {{but only if the}} plaintiff shows that the defendant’s conduct was more than ordinary negligence (i.e., wanton and willful or reckless).|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{action in}} tort is negligence. [...] The {{tort of negligence}} provides a cause of action leading to damages, or to relief, in each case designed to protect legal rights, including those of personal safety, property, and, in some cases, intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the United States. <b>Negligence</b> <b>actions</b> include claims coming primarily from car accidents and personal injury accidents of many kinds, including clinical negligence, worker's negligence and so forth. Product liability cases, such as those involving warranties, may also be considered <b>negligence</b> <b>actions</b> or, particularly in the United States, may apply regardless of negligence or intention through strict liability.|$|R
50|$|Under the 2000 Act, such {{partnerships}} {{are deemed}} to have legal personality.

50|$|The {{plaintiff}} sued Wal-Mart {{in state}} court for a state law <b>negligence</b> <b>action,</b> seeking $950,000 in damages. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1441, the defendant removed to federal court {{on the basis of}} diversity jurisdiction. The plaintiff reduced the damages sought to less than $75,000 and petitioned for remand to state court because the amount in controversy requirement was no longer met. The 6th Circuit upheld a denial of the petition for remand, holding that the amount in controversy at the time of removal was what mattered.|$|E

The surviving deputy Joseph Singer claimed McGivern shot Fitzgerald and that the escape attempt involved all three prisoners. Culhane and McGivern were indicted for felony murder, with attempted escape in the second degree as the underlying felony. The Ulster County Legislature passed a resolution on June 3, 1971 (Resolution 129) “that the office of the Ulster County Attorney be empowered to conduct a detailed legal investigation of the facts surrounding this crime to determine if there is sufficient grounds for instituting a <b>negligence</b> <b>action</b> against Westchester County, the Westchester County Sheriff and the State of New York for its statutory obligation.” ...|$|E

40|$|Tort {{law reform}} has {{resulted}} in legislation being passed by all Australian jurisdictions {{in the past decade}} implementing the recommendations contained in the Ipp Report. The report was in response to a perceived crisis in medical indemnity insurance. The objective was to restrict and limit liability in <b>negligence</b> <b>actions.</b> This paper will consider to what extent the reforms have impacted on the liability of health professionals in medical <b>negligence</b> <b>actions.</b> The reversal of the onus of proof through the obvious risk sections has attempted to extend the scope of the defence of voluntary assumption of risk. There is no liability for the materialisation of an inherent risk. Presumptions and mandatory reductions for contributory negligence have attempted to reduce the liability of defendants. It is now possible for reductions of 100 % for contributory negligence. Apologies can be made with no admission of legal liability to encourage them being made and thereby reduce the number of actions being commenced. The peer acceptance defence has been introduced and enacted by legislation. There is protection for good samaritans even though the Ipp Report recommended against such protection. Limitation periods have been amended. Provisions relating to mental harm have been introduced re-instating the requirement of normal fortitude and direct perception. After an analysis of the legislation, it will be argued in this paper that while there has been some limitation and restriction, courts have generally interpreted the civil liability reforms in compliance with the common law. It has been the impact of statutory limits on the assessment of damages which has limited the liability of health professionals in medical <b>negligence</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Merchant Marine Act of 1915 (Seamen's Act) was in {{response}} to the ruling in The Osceola. It attempted to create a <b>negligence</b> <b>action</b> for seamen. §20 of the 1915 Act provided: [...] "That in any suit to recover damages for any injury sustained on board vessel or in its service seamen having command shall not be held to be fellow-servants with those under their authority." [...] In 1920, Congress passed the Jones Act, which provides a cause of action in negligence for [...] "any seaman" [...] injured [...] "in the course of his employment." [...] The Act was passed in part {{in response}} to the Supreme Court's prior ruling in Chelentis v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., that did not provide remedies for an injured fireman because it was caused by a superior officer who was considered a member of the crew and not a fellow servant.|$|E
50|$|By {{the age of}} 30, Cracken was {{respected}} as a Texas trial lawyer. Between 1987 and 1997, Cracken {{won more}} than 30 verdicts and/or settlements in excess of $1 million for his clients. Between 1994 and 1995, he won approximately $9.5 million in an aviation-negligence action, $9.2 million in a medical-negligence action, $8.2 million in a well-publicized premises-liability action against Taco Bell Corp., $7.8 million in an aviation-negligence action, $5.4 million in an insurance-agent <b>negligence</b> <b>action</b> and $3 million, $1.5 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, in three product-liability actions. In 1996 Cracken {{went on to win}} a settlement for approximately $35.7 million in a class-action against Allstate Insurance Co and Farmers Insurance Group. The settlement was mediated by “pay czar” Ken Feinberg and included an appearance on key contested First Amendment issues by noted legal scholar Alan M. Dershowitz. A Texas state court approved the settlement, and at the related hearing Cracken presented the live testimony of noted legal scholars Samuel Issacharoff, Arthur R. Miller, and Charles M. Silver. The two insurers were accused of overcharging their policyholders by rounding up each policyholder’s premium from the state-mandated rate to the nearest whole dollar. The settlement meant that up to 4.5 million past and present policyholders were eligible for a partial refund.|$|E

50|$|Once a duty exists, the {{plaintiff}} must {{show that the}} defendant breached it. This is generally treated as the second element of negligence in the United States. Breach involves testing the defendant's actions against the standard of a reasonable person, which varies depending on {{the facts of the}} case. For example, physicians will be held to reasonable standards for members of their profession, rather than those of the general public, in <b>negligence</b> <b>actions</b> for medical malpractice.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the interface between}} the standard setting activity of the NHS Litigation Authority, and the courts and uses the clinical <b>negligence</b> <b>action</b> as a prism through which to examine it.

More specifically, it explores {{the ways in which}} attitudes about the usefulness of the data contained in claims against the NHS have changed {{in the aftermath of a}} number of high profile inquiries which have focused on issues of poor performance. The article concludes that while much greater use is now been made of the data contained in claims when setting standards, strategies for prompting judicial precedent as an alternative way of mobilising standard setting behaviour remain under developed...|$|E

40|$|The file {{associated}} with this record is embargoed until 24 months after the date of publication. The final published version may be available through the links above. Applying the Fairchild exception in Barker, Lord Hoffmann sought to justify apportionment of liability by reformulating {{the gist of the}} <b>negligence</b> <b>action</b> as the risk of mesothelioma rather than the mesothelioma itself. This paper examines the notion of risk to show that it cannot coherently be recognised as damage. By distinguishing risk from the related concept of probability, it is apparent that risk is a forward-looking concept that is incompatible with the role in which it is cast in the backward-looking causation inquiry when mesothelioma is an essential ingredient of liability. This paper goes on to consider whether 'pure' risk could form the gist of a <b>negligence</b> <b>action</b> and suggests that it lacks the moral significance to constitute damage. Furthermore, the damage requirement would be subsumed into the breach inquiry, effectively being lost as a distinct element of the negligence inquiry. This is incompatible with the traditional loss-based model of negligence. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|E

2500|$|While <b>negligence</b> <b>actions</b> set {{a general}} groundwork, many further fields of tort have {{developed}} their own identity or, where judicial decision-making was seen as insufficient by Parliament, through statutory reform.
