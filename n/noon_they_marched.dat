25|$|In Manchester, 300 (eye-witness Stop the War estimate) {{secondary}} school children, Further Education students and university students met at Albert Square at 12 <b>noon.</b> <b>They</b> <b>marched</b> to the BBC studios where {{they sat down}} in the road at around 1pm and blocked the traffic for over an hour where their numbers grew to around 1000 demonstrators. They were filmed by anti-war activists and video clips were distributed. The students then marched around the city centre and ended up back at Albert Square at about 4pm where they remained demonstrating in front of the Town Hall for some hours. The whole of this event was filmed by anti-war activists accumulating two hours of footage.|$|E
60|$|Long before <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{reached the}} hills, and here stopped for lunch.|$|R
60|$|Just before <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{came to a}} {{point in}} the river where it divided into several branches.|$|R
60|$|At <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{started for}} Périgord and Carcassonne, Nismes, Arles, {{and so on}} to the Riviera full of kind things at our parting.|$|R
60|$|The boys went to {{the house}} and were speedily given {{something}} to eat,--for they had had nothing since <b>noon.</b> <b>They</b> also donned some dry clothing.|$|R
50|$|The {{law also}} changed for liquor stores. They may now open on Sundays. (although not before <b>noon)</b> <b>They</b> must still remain closed on Christmas, all day.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} the boys felt tired {{and they did not}} rouse up until nearly <b>noon.</b> <b>They</b> found old Jerry at the beach, {{inspecting}} the wreckage.|$|R
60|$|About <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> became hungry, but hunger {{was an old}} foe {{whom they}} had been well trained to defy, so they worked on utterly {{regardless}} of him.|$|R
6000|$|At dawn <b>they</b> fished, at <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> snared [...] Young foxes in the dells, [...] At even on dew-berries they fared, [...] And blew {{in their}} twisted shells.|$|R
60|$|About <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{all seemed}} to wake up from their {{lethargic}} state. Van der Kemp laid down his paddle, and, looking round, asked Nigel if he felt tired.|$|R
60|$|At <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{had little}} more than a rabbit lunch--something that made Whopper sigh as he thought of the big Christmas dinner he had thought to feast upon.|$|R
60|$|After {{that the}} picked horses came faster, until by <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> had ten hobbled {{in the open}} pasture. Two of these were Pan's. He had been hard to please.|$|R
60|$|By <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{had a good}} mess of fish {{to their}} credit, and then Sam {{proposed}} that they go ashore and build a fire and cook some for dinner.|$|R
60|$|The boy {{told them}} how to go and they made the best time possible, {{arriving}} at the Junction some time after <b>noon.</b> <b>They</b> found the depot master on the platform.|$|R
60|$|About <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> halted. A few {{scraps of}} the dried meat still remained, and on these they dined, {{sitting on a}} grassy slope, while they {{consulted}} as to their future proceedings.|$|R
60|$|Several {{times they}} halted for brief rests, which Tarzan did not need, and at <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> stopped {{for an hour}} at a little brook, where they {{quenched}} their thirst, and ate.|$|R
60|$|When the work-gangs {{came in at}} <b>noon,</b> <b>they</b> found decently cooked dinners {{awaiting}} them, {{prepared by}} the weaker members of their cabins under the tutelage and drive of Smoke and Shorty.|$|R
60|$|At <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{sat down}} by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he refused.|$|R
25|$|In 1967, the Uruguayan Nelson Nelson {{directed}} several teletreatros live, {{in hours}} of the <b>noon.</b> <b>They</b> had the performance of Armando Rubin, Carla Fabri, Zuny Joy, Patricia Blasco, Juan Angel Gómez and others.|$|R
60|$|When, about <b>noon,</b> <b>they</b> {{came to a}} clear {{spring of}} water, they were glad enough {{to sit down and}} rest and partake of their noonday lunch, washing it down with copious {{draughts}} of water.|$|R
6000|$|Before <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{came upon}} {{the edge of a}} forest, where a poor man was {{chopping}} logs into firewood. Seeing Prince Marvel's party approach, this man ran toward them waving his hands and shouting excitedly: ...|$|R
60|$|At <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{rested in}} a glade that {{commanded}} a fine {{view of the}} surrounding country {{and each of the}} boys took several time pictures with small lens openings, so as to get sharp outlines.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} they started westward for the hills. The {{greatest}} care was observed on the <b>march.</b> <b>They</b> {{took advantage of}} every depression, and when obliged to pass over level ground moved at a distance apart, as a clump or string of moving animals would be made out {{at a distance from}} which a solitary one would be unnoticed. By <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> had left the bare rock, and were travelling up a valley clothed with grass and dotted with clumps of trees. In the first of these they halted.|$|R
60|$|The hours dragged by slowly. At <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{took their}} time eating a meal that all hands prepared. Fortunately they had {{with them a}} few canned goods, which gave them {{something}} {{of a change in}} their diet.|$|R
60|$|Once over, {{the upward}} climb was again begun. By <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{reckoned}} {{that they were}} within half a mile of the top. But all were exhausted, and glad enough to rest and take a bite to eat.|$|R
60|$|By <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{had covered}} five miles, {{and then they}} stopped to rest at a village where all {{procured}} a good hot dinner. Then they went forward once again, this time through a long patch of timber.|$|R
6000|$|About <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{stopped to}} allow Jim {{to rest in}} the shade of a pretty orchard, and while they plucked and ate some of the {{cherries}} and plums that grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them: ...|$|R
60|$|By <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> {{had made}} their way {{directly}} through the woods and had eleven rabbits and three squirrels to their credit. Then Tom suggested they build a campfire and rest while eating their lunch and this was done.|$|R
6000|$|And hour by hour, {{when the}} air was still, [...] 70 The vapours arose which have {{strength}} to kill; At morn they were seen, at <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> were felt, At night they were darkness no star could melt.|$|R
60|$|Nothing is now left {{which by}} any flattery {{can be called}} food. But they must manage somehow for five days more, for at <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> have still eight hundred miles to go. It is a race for life now.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately {{a passage}} among the ridges of broken ice was found, {{through which the}} sledge was hauled with {{comparative}} ease, and before <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> had reached the open sea-ice beyond, over which they again set forth at full swing.|$|R
6000|$|... 234 {{disappeared}} altogether. Next {{came the}} wide, sandy desert separating {{the rest of}} the world from the Land of Oz, and before <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> saw the dome-shaped houses that proved they were once more within the borders of their native land.|$|R
60|$|All {{the balance}} of the day Abdul caught glimpses of the {{horsemen}} in their rear. They remained always at about the same distance. During the occasional halts for rest, and at the longer halt at <b>noon,</b> <b>they</b> approached no closer.|$|R
60|$|At <b>noon</b> <b>they</b> neared Dresden, and an {{hour later}} Fergus stepped ashore. He paid the men the sum arranged, and handed over to them {{the rest of his}} provisions, which would be {{sufficient}} to carry them far on their way back.|$|R
5000|$|Blooming lasts {{from late}} spring to late summer. The flowers are hermaphrodite, {{produced}} on a tall spike and only last {{until the following}} <b>noon.</b> <b>They</b> open visibly fast every evening producing an interesting spectacle, hence the name [...] "evening primrose." ...|$|R
60|$|Taking two cameras with them, the {{photographer}} {{and the boys}} started off, to be gone until <b>noon.</b> <b>They</b> walked across the city and along the river, and at the latter locality took half a dozen pictures, Mr. Jally instructing them all the while.|$|R
