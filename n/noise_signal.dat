Autocorrelation and spectral methods of processing received ultra-wideband <b>noise</b> <b>signals</b> with coded spectral modulation are considered.

This proposed power amplifier, contains two loops-TX band intermodulation distortion signals cancellation loop and RX band <b>noise</b> <b>signals</b> cancellation loop, can provide duplexer with low TX path insertion loss for various wireless communication systems due to choice of loose RX attenuation characteristic. The proposed amplifier is implemented for IMT- 2000 base station frequency band.

25|$|Evoked {{potential}} amplitudes {{tend to be}} low, {{ranging from}} less than a microvolt to several microvolts, compared to tens of microvolts for EEG, millivolts for EMG, and often close to a volt for ECG. To resolve these low-amplitude potentials {{against the background of}} ongoing EEG, ECG, EMG, and other biological signals and ambient <b>noise,</b> <b>signal</b> averaging is usually required. The signal is time-locked to the stimulus and most of the noise occurs randomly, allowing the noise to be averaged out with averaging of repeated responses.|$|E
25|$|Each {{component}} (or node) of a {{signaling pathway}} is classified according to the role it plays {{with respect to the}} initial stimulus. Ligands are termed first messengers, while receptors are the signal transducers, which then activate primary effectors. Such effectors are often linked to second messengers, which can activate secondary effectors, and so on. Depending on the efficiency of the nodes, a signal can be amplified (a concept known as signal gain), so that one signaling molecule can generate a response involving hundreds to millions of molecules. As with other signals, the transduction of biological signals is characterised by delay, <b>noise,</b> <b>signal</b> feedback and feedforward and interference, which can range from negligible to pathological. With the advent of computational biology, the analysis of signaling pathways and networks has become an essential tool to understand cellular functions and disease, including signaling rewiring mechanisms underlying responses to acquired drug resistance.|$|E

2500|$|In audio engineering, electronics, physics, {{and many}} other fields, the color of noise refers to the power {{spectrum}} of a <b>noise</b> <b>signal</b> (a signal produced by a stochastic process). Different colors of noise have significantly different properties: for example, as audio signals they will sound different to human ears, and as images {{they will have a}} visibly different texture. Therefore, each application typically requires noise of a specific color. This sense of 'color' for noise signals is similar to the concept of timbre in music (which is also called [...] "tone color"); however the latter is almost always used for sound, and may consider very detailed features of the spectrum.|$|E

30|$|The {{basic process}} of noisy {{training}} for DNNs is as follows: first of all, sample some <b>noise</b> <b>signals</b> from some real-world recordings and then mix these <b>noise</b> <b>signals</b> {{with the original}} training data. This operation is {{also referred to as}} ‘noise injection’ or ‘noise corruption’ in this paper. The noise-corrupted speech data are then used to train DNNs as usual. The rationale of this approach is twofold: firstly, the noise patterns within the introduced <b>noise</b> <b>signals</b> can be learned and thus compensated for in the inference phase, which is straightforward and shares the same idea as the multi-condition training approach; secondly, the perturbation introduced by the injected noise can improve generalization capability of the resulting DNN, which is supported by the noise injection theory. We discuss these two aspects sequentially in this section.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{identify}} noise sources of an excavator in non-library environment, a complex-valued algorithm in frequency domain was applied. Firstly, an acoustic camera was used to acquire excavator’s <b>noise</b> <b>signals,</b> which were convolutive mixtures in time domain interfered by echo. Secondly, signals in time domain transformed into frequency domain by FT, turned to be complex-valued mixtures. Then, independent components of <b>noise</b> <b>signals</b> were obtained through separation of complex-valued mixtures using complex-valued algorithm based on independent component analysis. Finally, according to noise of diesel with muffler was mainly consist of surface noise, the relationship between principal frequencies and structrual parts was founded by comparing frequency-amplitude spectra and modal analysis in Ansys. Research shows that complex-valued algorithm based on fast fixed-point independent component analysis can effectively separate <b>noise</b> <b>signals</b> from an excavator in time domain, and noise sources can be well ascertained by comparing the modal analysis with blind separation components...|$|R
