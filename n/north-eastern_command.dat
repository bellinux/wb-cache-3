500|$|<b>North-Eastern</b> Area <b>Command</b> was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. For most of its existence it covered central and northern Queensland, and Papua New Guinea. It was formed in January 1942 from {{the eastern part of the}} former Northern Area Command, which had covered the whole of northern Australia and Papua. Headquartered at Townsville, Queensland, <b>North-Eastern</b> Area <b>Command</b> was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. [...] Aircraft under its control took part in the battles of Rabaul, Port Moresby and Milne Bay in 1942, and the landings at Hollandia and Aitape in 1944. [...] The command continued to operate following the end of the war, before its responsibilities were subsumed in 1954 by the RAAF's new functional command-and-control system; the headquarters was disbanded two years later.|$|R
5|$|On 15January 1942, Northern Area {{was split}} into North-Western Area and North-Eastern Area, to counter {{distinct}} Japanese threats to Ambon and Darwin {{in the former}} case, and Rabaul and Port Moresby in the latter. Lukis remained at Townsville as AOC of the new <b>North-Eastern</b> Area <b>Command.</b> North-Western Area Command was headquartered at Darwin, Northern Territory; its inaugural AOC was Air Commodore Douglas Wilson.|$|R
500|$|Home Command {{was formed}} from the {{existing}} Eastern Area Command, which was considered a de facto operational organisation owing to the preponderance of such forces within its boundaries. Training Command was formed from Southern Area Command, as it was already the hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. Maintenance Command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group—as No.4 (Maintenance) Group had been known since July 1947—headquartered in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of all operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and <b>North-Eastern</b> Area <b>Commands.</b> The headquarters of these three area commands remained in existence but only, according to the Melbourne Argus, as [...] "remote control points" [...] for Home Command. North-Western Area Command was disbanded in June 1955, Western Area Command in November 1956, and <b>North-Eastern</b> Area <b>Command</b> in December 1956.|$|R

The only Australian air combat {{units in the}} SWPA not under RAAF Command were those based in New Guinea as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, which was {{controlled}} by Fifth Air Force.

No.72 Wing {{took part in the}} defence of Torres Strait, undertaking interception, patrol and occasional ground-attack and anti-shipping duties. By July 1944, its original squadrons had all been disbanded or transferred to other operational formations.

Eaton's relations with <b>North-Eastern</b> Area <b>Command</b> in Townsville had meanwhile became strained. In his opinion, [...] "the problems of Merauke were not understood from there... mountains were made out of molehills", and he was posted that July to lead a bombing and gunnery establishment in South Australia.

As accommodation at East Sale would not be available until October 1942, the school's 1,630 personnel were relocated to Bairnsdale in June and July. The base's living quarters, recreational buildings and 88 tents could not fully accommodate this influx, so the RAAF rented hotels in Bairnsdale for 320 airmen. On 10December 1942, No.1 OTU Detached Flight, consisting of 15 Hudsons and 108 personnel including air and maintenance crews, was sent to <b>North-Eastern</b> Area <b>Command</b> to help fulfill urgent transport requirements in New Guinea. This force joined a military Douglas DC-2 and eleven civil aircraft pressed into service to form RAAF Special Transport Flight, which operated out of Wards Airfield from 14December 1942 to 11January 1943. The Hudsons flew 645 sorties, carrying some 1,100 troops and almost 800 tons of equipment. Two of the Hudsons were lost, one to enemy action and one to friendly fire, and several were damaged.|$|R

500|$|The CO of RAAF Station Laverton from December 1939, Lukis {{was made}} acting air {{commodore}} and posted to Townsville, Queensland, on 8May 1941 as the inaugural Air Officer Commanding Northern Area.

The following month, he warned higher command of the poor state of preparedness and low morale of Australian Army troops at Port Moresby, New Guinea, due to lack of air cover and apparent lack of interest from government echelons.
