40|$|Environmental <b>noise</b> {{is known}} to cause <b>noise</b> {{annoyance}}. Since <b>noise</b> annoyance is a subjective indicator, other mediators—such as <b>noise</b> sensitivity—may influence its perception. However, few studies have thus far been conducted on <b>noise</b> annoyance in South Korea that consider <b>noise</b> sensitivity and <b>noise</b> level simultaneously. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the correlations between <b>noise</b> sensitivity or <b>noise</b> level and <b>noise</b> annoyance on a large scale in South Korea. This study estimated the level of <b>noise</b> exposure based on a <b>noise</b> map created in 2014; identified and surveyed 1836 subjects using a questionnaire; and assessed the impact of transportation <b>noise</b> and <b>noise</b> sensitivity on <b>noise</b> annoyance. The result showed that <b>noise</b> exposure level and <b>noise</b> sensitivity simultaneously affect <b>noise</b> annoyance, and <b>noise</b> sensitivity has a relatively larger impact on <b>noise</b> annoyance. In conclusion, when study subjects were exposed to a similar level of <b>noise,</b> the level of <b>noise</b> annoyance differed depending on the <b>noise</b> sensitivity of the individual...|$|R

5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as <b>noises</b> coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental <b>noises</b> such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.|$|E
40|$|Shinkansen <b>noise</b> can be {{classified}} into four categories; pantograph <b>noise,</b> aerodynamic <b>noise</b> from the train nose, aerodynamic <b>noise</b> from the upper parts of cars, and <b>noise</b> from the lower parts of cars and structure-borne <b>noise</b> as shown Fig. 1. Pantograph <b>noise</b> is one of main sources of <b>noise.</b> Pantograph <b>noise</b> is composed of aerodynamic <b>noise</b> from the pantograph itself, spark <b>noise</b> caused by contact loss, and sliding <b>noise</b> generated between the contact strips and the overhead contact line. If there is a decreased amount of contact loss, most of the pantograph <b>noise</b> is due to aerodynamic <b>noise</b> from the pantograph itself (including insulators). Therefore, the <b>noise</b> sources of the PS 207 type pantograph (Fig. 2) were investigated in detail, and two types of low-noise pantograph were developed; a<-shaped arm type pantograph, which is an improve...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} theory of phase <b>noise</b> {{mechanism}} of NEMS. We examine both fundamental and nonfundamental <b>noise</b> processes to obtain expressons for phase <b>noise</b> density, Allan deviation, and mass sensitivity. Fundamental <b>noise</b> processes considered here include thermomechanical <b>noise,</b> momentum exchange <b>noise,</b> adsorption-desorption <b>noise,</b> diffusion <b>noise,</b> and temperature fluctuation <b>noise.</b> For nonfundamental <b>noise</b> processes, we develop a formalism to consider the Nyquist-Johnson <b>noise</b> from transducer amplifier implementations. The detailed analysis here not only reveals the achievable frequency stability of NEMS devices, but also provides a theoretical framework to fully optimize <b>noise</b> performance and the mass sensitivity for sensing applications. So far we have considered how physical fluctuations convert into the <b>noise</b> sidebands of the carrier and give the conventional definition of phase <b>noise,</b> frequency <b>noise,</b> and Allan deviation, all commonly used to characterize the frequency stability of an oscillator.

40|$|What is a <b>Noise</b> Wall? <b>Noise</b> {{walls are}} the {{structures}} often built along highways to reduce overall <b>noise</b> levels generated by traffic.

5|$|On 20 January 2017, {{after the}} 1–1 Ligue 1 away draw against SC Bastia, Balotelli claimed on Instagram {{that he was}} a victim of racist abuse when fans of the Corsican club {{allegedly}} made monkey <b>noises</b> directed at him during the match and just {{prior to the start of}} the match. On the following day, Alassane Pléa (Balotelli's Nice teammate) confirmed that he had heard the monkey <b>noises</b> directed at Balotelli. The Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) announced an investigation into Balotelli's allegations. On 18 February 2017, Balotelli was sent off once again, in his fourteenth Ligue 1 appearance, a 1–0 win at Lorient; he received a straight red card in the second half for insulting referee Tony Chapron in English. He was given a two-match ban (the second match was a suspended ban that would be triggered in the event of any further misconduct by Balotelli) by the Ligue 1’s disciplinary committee on 23 February.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} assess the effects of combined community <b>noise</b> sources on annoyance. The first experiment baseline relationships between annoyance and <b>noise</b> level for three community <b>noise</b> sources (jet aircraft flyovers, traffic and air conditioners) presented individually.

Results indicated {{the slope of the}} linear relationship between annoyance and <b>noise</b> level for the traffic <b>noise</b> was significantly different from that of aircraft and of air conditioner <b>noise,</b> which had equal slopes.

Effects on annoyance of <b>noise</b> level differences between aircraft and background <b>noise</b> for three total <b>noise</b> levels and for both background <b>noise</b> sources were determined.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The effect modifying {{impact of}} {{annoyance}} due to aircraft <b>noise</b> and road traffic <b>noise</b> on {{the relationships between}} the aircraft <b>noise</b> level and road traffic <b>noise</b> level on the prevalence of hypertension was investigated in 4861 subjects of the HYENA study (HYpertension and Exposure to <b>Noise</b> near Airports). METHODS: Different models were investigated either including the <b>noise</b> level and <b>noise</b> annoyance variables separately, or simultaneously, or together with an interaction term referring to the same <b>noise</b> source for the <b>noise</b> level and the <b>noise</b> annoyance. RESULTS: Significant effect modification was found with respect to the association between aircraft <b>noise</b> and hypertension. The association was stronger in more annoyed subjects. No clear interaction was found with respect to road traffic <b>noise.</b> The comparison of the magnitude of the main effects (per standard deviation or inter-quartile range) of <b>noise</b> level and <b>noise</b> annoyance variables revealed stronger associations with hypertension for the <b>noise</b> levels. CONCLUSION: There is some indication that the <b>noise</b> level has a stronger predictive meaning for the relationship between <b>noise</b> exposure and hypertension than the reported <b>noise</b> annoyance (main effects). The results from the Hyena study support the hypothesis that <b>noise</b> annoyance acts as an effect modifier {{of the relationship between the}} <b>noise</b> level and hypertension...|$|R
