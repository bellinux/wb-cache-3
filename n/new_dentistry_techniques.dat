40|$|Background: Gingival {{recession}} involves both {{soft tissue}} and hard tissue loss. In this evolutionary era of <b>dentistry,</b> <b>newer</b> <b>techniques</b> have evolved for complete coverage of isolated recession defects. Since 2012, vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA) technique was used with various regenerative membranes to treat multiple recession defects (MRDs). Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane, {{a pool of}} growth factors but have any added advantage to recession coverage techniques is controversial. Thus, in this case series, we compare the effect of VISTA with or without PRF-membrane {{for the treatment of}} Classes I and III MRDs. Subjects and Methods: Four patients between of age 30 and 40 years (two patients having bilateral Class I and another two having bilateral Class III MRDs) were selected from the Department of Periodontics, ITS Dental College, Greater Noida and designated as Case I–IV simultaneously. Recession defects at antagonist sites in each patient were corrected by VISTA approach with or without PRF-membrane. Recorded clinical parameters included recession depth, recession width, pocket probing depth, and clinical attachment level (CAL) at baseline and 6 months postoperatively. Results: Patients having Class I recession defects showed almost complete root coverage with VISTA technique alone and reflected no added advantage of PRF-membrane. However, patients with Class III recession defects treated with VISTA + PRF-membrane showed more reduction in recession depth and gain in CAL as compared to sites treated with VISTA only. Conclusion: VISTA alone is a convenient technique for treatment of Class I MRDs. Addition of PRF-membrane for Class III recession defects give better outcome in term of reduction of recession depth and gain in CAL 6 month postoperatively...|$|R

50|$|In the 1840s the world's first dental {{school and}} {{national}} dental organization were established. Along {{with the first}} dental school came {{the establishment of the}} Doctor of Dental Surgery degree, often referred to as a DDS degree. In response to the rise in new dentists as well as <b>dentistry</b> <b>techniques,</b> the first dental practice act was established to regulate dentistry. In the United States, the First Dental Practice Act required dentists to pass each specific states medical board exam in order to practice dentistry in that particular state. However, because the dental act was rarely enforced, some dentists did not obey the act. From 1846-1855 new dental techniques were being invented {{such as the use of}} ester anesthesia for surgery, and the cohesive gold foil method which enabled gold to be applied to a cavity. The American Dental Association was established in 1859 after a meeting with 26 dentists. Around 1867, the first university associated dental school was established, Harvard Dental School. Lucy Hobbs Taylor was the first woman to earn a dental degree. In the 1880s, tube toothpaste was created which replaced the original forms of powder or liquid toothpaste. New dental boards, such as the National Association of Dental Examiners, were created to establish standards and uniformity among dentist. In 1887 the first dental laboratory was established; dental laborites are used to create dentures and crowns that are specific to each patient. In 1895 the dental X-ray was discovered by a German physicist, Wilhelm Rontgen.|$|R

Despite {{on the one hand}} the influences of tribal rituals upon early tooth loos in primitive man and on the other effects of the dental caries and more recently the increase in traumatic injuries in civilized communities, the trend towards preservation continues. Teeth which were once doomed because of excessive loss of coronal tooth substance may now be restored due to advances in both materials technology and operative <b>dentistry</b> <b>techniques</b> particularly throughout the last two decades. Likewise those with endodontic involvement may in the majority of cases now be restored to biological compatibility with the supporting tissues. This has been achieved due to the scientific and technological advances which have taken place in the science of endontology in a like period. The role played by the endontist in conservative dental therapy has increased markedly in recent years. The majority of large population centres in the western world contain practitioners who have attained specialist skills in the science and who thus provide a specialist service to their colleagues. Throughout the same period, the interest shown by the dental profession at large is demonstrated by the growth of societies and study clubs devoted to the exclusive study of endontology. Parallel with this, dental schools throughout the world have included the study of endontics within their curriculae both at the undergraduate and at the graduate level and learned societies and dental associations continue to make provision for courses of lectures in endontics at dental meetings and congresses...|$|R
