40|$|Different {{carboxylic}} acid derivatives of 2, 2 -dinitropropane- 1, 3 -diol (DNPD) and 2, 2 -bis(azidomethyl) propane- 1, 3 -diol (BAMP) were synthesized to investigate their suitability as energetic plasticizers. The syntheses {{were carried out}} using acyl chlorides of acetic, propionic, and butyric acid. The obtained products were characterized by elemental analysis, NMR, and IR spectroscopy. The energetic properties of the synthesized compounds were calculated {{on the basis of}} the computed heats of formation at the CBS- 4 M level of theory using the EXPLO 5 version 6. 02 computer code. Investigations of physical stabilities were carried out using BAM drop hammer and friction tester. Low and high temperature behavior was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The energetic and physical properties of the synthesized compounds were compared to the literature known energetic plasticizers N-butyl <b>nitratoethylnitramine</b> (BuNENA) and diethylene glycol bis(azidoacetate) ester (DEGBAA) ...|$|E
