25|$|When {{the rest}} of the UK {{generating}} industry was privatised, the Government introduced the <b>Non-Fossil</b> <b>Fuel</b> Obligation, initially as a means of supporting the nuclear generators, which remained under state ownership until the formation of British Energy. British Energy, the private sector company that now operates the UK's more modern nuclear plants, came close to bankruptcy and in 2004 was restructured with UK government investment of over £3 billion, although this has since been paid back in full. In January 2009, British Energy was bought for approximately £12 billion by EDF Energy (a subsidiary of Électricité de France (EDF)) and Centrica (a major operator of CCGT power stations and renewable sources in the UK and parent company of British Gas) in an 80/20 split.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{hydrogen}} energy strategies and discusses the key role of hydrogen as an energy carrier in this century and beyond. Two important empirical relations that describe the effects of fossil fuels on world peace and global unrest are developed. These relations incorporate predicted utilization ratios for hydrogen energy from <b>non-fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> and are used to investigate whether hydrogen utilization can reduce the negative global effects related to fossil fuel use, eliminate or reduce the possibilities of global energy conflicts, and contribute to achieving world peace and stability. Consequently, {{the highest levels of}} global peace and global unrest can be estimated. If hydrogen use from <b>non-fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> increases, for a fixed usage of petroleum, coal and natural gas, the level of global unrest decreases. However, if the utilization ratio of hydrogen energy from <b>non-fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> is lower than 100 %, the level of global peace decreases as the symptoms of global unrest increase. Thus, to reduce the causes of global unrest and increase the likelihood of global peace in the future, it is suggested that hydrogen energy be widely and efficiently used as part of sustainable technologies and systems. It is expected that {{the results of this study}} will be of use to decision makers and scholars who want to develop and promote the use of hydrogen-based technologies and solve future energy and environment related problems globally.

40|$|The {{electricity}} {{power sector}} {{plays an important}} role in both CO 2 emissions as well as the target contribution of non-fossil energy. Although the target for the reduction of CO 2 emission intensity in Guangdong (GD) has not been released by the central government, GD has set a goal for increasing the share of non-fossil energy in total energy consumption to 25 % in the provincial 13 th Five-Year Plan. In this study, the CO 2 emissions from the electric power sector and the corresponding share of <b>non-fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> in total energy consumption between 2005 and 2014 were analyzed. The logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) technique was applied for investigating the factors affecting the changes in CO 2 emissions. The main results are as follows: in 2014, the CO 2 emissions from the electric power sector were 286. 54 Mt, of which the net purchased electricity accounted for 22. 4 %. Economic growth is the main contributor for the increase in CO 2 emissions from the electric power sector. Electricity intensity, thermal generation efficiency, CO 2 emission coefficient, and electricity supply mix slowed the growth of CO 2 emissions. Several energy scenarios were developed, and results showed that the provincial target for the share of <b>non-fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> by 2020 would be achieved by all of the scenarios...|$|R

Similar mechanisms operate in Scotland (the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation) and Northern Ireland (the Northern Ireland <b>Non-Fossil</b> <b>Fuel</b> Obligation). In the USA, Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), use a similar approach. German Energiewende is using fed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare Tilbury power stations) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe’s renewable-energy consumption.|$|E

The book discusses broad aspects of present and future supplies of nature made oil and gas, and brings out the increasing necessity of international cooperation in the field of energy resources.

30|$|At present, CO 2 {{emissions}} of oil refineries {{can be reduced}} in three ways. The first option requires energy conservation. The second option requires energy consumption switching to <b>non-fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> such as hydrogen, nuclear, biomass, and solar energy. The third option involves CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). However, the nature of oil refining implies that even if a refinery is highly energy efficient, it will consume considerable amounts of energy, and therefore produce considerable amounts of CO 2. The first two measures could reduce the current CO 2 emissions by 9 – 20 Mt/year, yet a 13 – 80  % reduction of CO 2 emissions could be achieved by implementing carbon capture (Johansson et al. 2012). Thus, to meet mid- to long-term CO 2 reduction, cost-effective CO 2 separation technologies are the key issue for oil refineries.|$|R
