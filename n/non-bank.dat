40|$|The article {{describes}} main results of study of <b>non-banking</b> financial institutions as creditors of innovation projects. Based on {{the analysis of}} their investment activity, the article identifies their place and role in financing innovations. The article also compares banks and <b>non-banking</b> financial institutions as participants of innovation projects. On the basis of statistical data it characterises the modern state of <b>non-banking</b> financial institutions in the market of crediting innovation projects and forecasts their further functioning and status by pessimistic, realistic and optimistic scenarios. In order to achieve the level of realistic scenario of development of the <b>non-banking</b> financial institutions in innovation projects, the article offers a plan of organisation of participation of <b>non-banking</b> financial institutions in innovation projects. Crediting innovation projects by <b>non-banking</b> intermediaries has not only commercial but mostly social effect, since their realisation gradually brings the country’s economy to a qualitatively new technical and technological level. Earlier, scientists paid significant attention to banks as main creditors, leaving <b>non-banks</b> aside. The article shows advantages of participation of <b>non-banking</b> financial institutions compared to banks, which seems valuable {{from the point of}} view of development of this issue in the financial science environment. The prospective direction here is a study of banks and <b>non-banking</b> financial institutions as competitors in the market of crediting innovation projects...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between domestic financial regulation and the incentive of <b>non-banks</b> to borrow from banks abroad using BIS banking data in a gravity framework. Conditional on a large set of macroeconomic controls, we find that under tighter domestic financial regulation <b>non-banks</b> borrow more abroad. <b>Non-banks</b> in a country on the upper quartile of a financial deregulation index borrow 21 %– 28 % more than <b>non-banks</b> {{in a country with}} minimum regulation. The finding also holds for more disaggregated regulation measures. Interest rate controls and entry barriers to the banking sector are the most relevant types of regulation. The results in this paper indicate that international borrowing and lending is a prominent element {{to be taken into account}} in designing financial stability tools.

25|$|Furthermore, as {{a result}} of social workers' {{training}} in counseling and their experience in helping their clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, they are particularly well-suited to help individuals and families learn how to become financially self-sufficient. That said, {{there is a need for}} additional training vis a vis social workers in the financial household management arena. Under some conditions, a raise may trigger reductions in several benefits; therefore, it would be beneficial for social workers to study a financial education curriculum tailored for social workers such as financial social work to fully understand and explain the possible ramifications to clients. In addition, social workers often work with low-income or low to middle-income people who are either unbanked (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost <b>non-bank</b> providers for their financial transactions). Social workers who have an understanding of financial institutions would be able to guide individuals and families to use mainstream financial institutions and thereby hold onto more of their income and spend less on high cost <b>non-bank</b> financial services.|$|E
