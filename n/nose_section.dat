5|$|Premium Laurel class seating is in a 2–2–2 abreast {{arrangement}} on the Boeing 777, Boeing 747 (2–2 in {{the forward}} <b>nose</b> <b>section),</b> and A330. In 2016, Premium Laurel was upgraded to the new B/E Aerospace seats in a 2-2-2 configuration.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} the same flight deck design as the 767, the 757 {{has a more}} rounded <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> than previous narrow-body aircraft. The resulting space has unobstructed panel visibility and room for an observer seat. Similar pilot viewing angles as the 767 result from a downward sloped cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 {{the airline}} took {{delivery}} {{of its first}} jet, a Douglas DC-8 named Fuji, introducing jet service on the Tokyo-Honolulu-San Francisco route. JAL went on to operate a fleet of 51 DC-8s, retiring {{the last of the}} type in 1987. Fuji flew until 1974 and was then used as a maintenance training platform until 1989; its <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> was stored at Haneda Airport and eventually put on public display at the JAL Sky Museum in March 2014.|$|E

50|$|Midget {{submarines}} {{are commonly}} armed with torpedoes and mines {{in the form}} of, for example, detachable side loads and <b>nose</b> <b>sections.</b> Alternatively they may function as swimmer delivery vehicles to deliver frogmen to the vicinity of their targets, which are then attacked with limpet mines.|$|R
5000|$|However, at {{the start}} of the century, Boeing-Wichita {{remained}} the city's (and the state's) largest single private-sector employer, with about 12,000 workers. The factory built Boeing jetliner subassemblies (including whole fuselages of Boeing's most popular plane, the 737, and <b>nose</b> <b>sections</b> of all other Boeing planes). Labor unrest, however, created friction.|$|R
5|$|Boeing built a final {{assembly}} line in Washington at its Renton factory, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757. Early in the development program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, {{about half of the}} aircraft's components, including the wings, <b>nose</b> <b>section,</b> and empennage, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge slats, Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage. Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program, and {{final assembly}} of the first aircraft began in January 1981.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{veterans}} groups {{engaged in}} a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> of the aircraft were exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The last survivor of its crew, Theodore Van Kirk, died on July 28, 2014, {{at the age of}} 93.|$|E
5|$|The He 111P {{incorporated}} the updated Daimler-Benz DB 601A-1 liquid-cooled engine and featured a newly designed <b>nose</b> <b>section,</b> including an asymmetric mounting for an MG 15 machine gun that replaced the 'stepped' cockpit with a roomier and more aerodynamic glazed stepless cockpit {{over the entire}} front of the aircraft. This smooth glazed nose was first tested on the He 111 V8 in January 1938. These improvements allowed the aircraft to reach 475km/h (295mph) at 5,000m (16,400ft) and a cruise speed of 370km/h (230mph), although a full bomb load reduced this figure to 300km/h (190mph). The design was implemented in 1937 because pilot reports indicated problems with visibility.|$|E
50|$|During launch, {{the support}} booms track the {{movement}} of the rocket. After the support boom heads emerge from the special support recess in the <b>nose</b> <b>sections</b> of the strapons, the support booms and trusses disconnect from the rocket airframe, swiveling on the support axes and freeing the way for the rocket to lift off. During launch, the rocket and the launch facility form a single dynamic system.|$|R
50|$|The entire rocket is {{suspended}} in the launch system by the load-bearing mechanisms on the strap-on boosters where they {{are attached to the}} central core. The latter rests on the <b>nose</b> <b>sections</b> of the strap-on boosters. This scheme resembles flight conditions when the strap-on boosters push the central core forward. The concept of suspending the rocket was one of the novelties introduced with the R-7/Soyuz.|$|R
50|$|China Airlines has {{terminated}} First Class services since 1 July 2015. However, {{it still}} offers the hardware {{product on the}} Boeing 747 aircraft and markets the seats as Business Class ones. There are 12 flat-bed First Class seats located {{in each of the}} three-class Boeing 747s <b>nose</b> <b>sections.</b> Each seat features a 15.1-inch personal screen with Audio and Video On Demand (AVOD), USB port, universal power outlet, and noise cancelling headphone. Turndown service is offered by cabin crew upon request.|$|R
5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the <b>nose</b> <b>section.</b> In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the upper section of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, the cars' cockpit opening {{was made}} larger and the sides {{were raised in}} order to provide better head {{protection}} for the driver; these sides were raised even higher (to mid-helmet height) for 1996, along with a wraparound head restraint made of foam to prevent head injuries such as those suffered by Mika Häkkinen during qualifying for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. Needle-like nosecone designs with a sharp point, such as the 1995 McLaren MP4/10, were also banned in favour of more blunt <b>nose</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the design, {{evaluation}} and certification qualification of Bird Strike resistant external stores and scientific sensors for the new research aircraft HALO. The structural performance of the external stores was demonstrated by static limit and ultimate load tests. In order to perform the structural design, sizing and the damage modelling of the structures, a comprehensive material test programme had to be carried out. For the <b>nose</b> <b>sections</b> of the external pods of the HALO, bird strike protections concepts had to be developed, realized and validated for certification...|$|R
50|$|Recognizing {{this market}} {{a number of}} {{suppliers}} provide ready to go desktop simulation products. Radio stacks, instruments, yokes, pedals, throttle quadrants, and seats are readily available from pilot shops. This allows a highly realistic GA cockpit to be put together {{in a matter of}} minutes. However an enthusiast is likely to extend well beyond the functional cockpit a trainee would require, adding in items to enhance the suspension of disbelief. Enclosures, projectors, even real aircraft components or <b>nose</b> <b>sections</b> are commonly incorporated in the drive to make the experience as 'real' as possible.|$|R
25|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> can be removed, {{and there}} is also a hatch below the rear windows on the left side. Crew ingress and egress is {{possible}} by either route.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{responsibility}} for production, Fokker designed and built the <b>nose</b> <b>section,</b> centre fuselage and inner wing; MBB/Fokker-VFW constructed the forward fuselage, rear fuselage and tail assembly; and Shorts designed and built the outer wings.|$|E
25|$|A {{radial engine}} was mounted on each wing, and the {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} carrying 23 personnel or a cargo payload. The Caravan had a <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> that swung out {{to the right to}} enable outsize loading, including a jeep or small artillery pieces.|$|E
25|$|Middle {{third section}} – the skin {{overlying}} {{the bridge of}} the <b>nose</b> (mid-dorsal <b>section)</b> is the thinnest, least distensible, nasal skin, because it most adheres to the support framework.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{body was}} a cowl unit design, consisting of structural longitudinal members, with cross stretchers forming the supports for the internal equipment including the engine-generator. The locomotive superstructure was mechanically {{separated from the}} load bearing structures by pivots {{at either end of}} the body and incorporated roof doors for access to the diesel engine. The driving cabs incorporating <b>nose</b> <b>sections</b> were also separate structures; each cab was accessible from the other via an inner walkway, and passage between locomotives was enabled by end corridor connections. Each cab 'nose' contained a traction motor cooling fan, and an air compressor.|$|R
40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{it was found}} that the instability failure of curved sheet is nearly independent of the type of loading and is primarily a function of the maximum stress, radius-thickness ration and modulus of elasticity. A method of correlating the critical stress of thin sheet under several different types of loading is given. An explanation for the experimental critical stress of thin walled cylinders under bending being greater than that for pure compression is given. The strength of unstiffened thin walled circular <b>nose</b> <b>sections</b> under pure bending was found to be controlled by local instability of the section, rather than a large scale instability. The equation of local instability of curved sheet gives values which are in fair agreement with those found experimentally. The strength of elliptical cylinders supported at the minor axis under bending plus shear loads is governed primarily by the bending strength, and is little effected by the sheer force unless the amount of shear is quite large with respect to the moment. The effect of increasing the amount of elliptically greatly reduces the bending and shear strength of <b>nose</b> <b>sections.</b> Under torsional loads the stress at buckling falls off as the ration of the major to minor axis increases but the failure stress decreases at a slower rate than the buckling stress. The length effect of semi-circular sections under torsion is similar to that of a circular tube, and can be obtained by Donnell's theoretical equation. ...|$|R
25|$|The XWB's <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> {{will adopt}} a {{configuration}} {{derived from the}} A380 with a forward-mounted nosegear bay and a six-panel flightdeck windscreen. This differs substantially from the four-window arrangement in the original design. The new nose will improve aerodynamics and enable overhead crew rest areas to be installed further forward and eliminate any encroachment in the passenger cabin. The new windscreen has been revised to improve vision by reducing {{the width of the}} centre post. The upper shell radius of the <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> has been increased. The nose is likely to be constructed from aluminium but Airbus is currently running trade-off studies considering a one-piece carbon fibre structure. According to Gordon McConnell, A350 Chief Engineer, a carbon fibre structure would need titanium reinforcements for birdstrike protection, thus the aluminium structure is the best cost-wise.|$|E
25|$|The CG-4A {{could carry}} 13 troops and their equipment. Cargo loads {{could be a}} ton truck (i.e. a Jeep), a 75mm howitzer, or a ton trailer, loaded through the upward-hinged <b>nose</b> <b>section.</b> C-47s were usually used as tow aircraft. A few C-46 tugs were used during and after Operation Plunder.|$|E
25|$|The J-20 has a {{long and}} wide fuselage, with the chiseled <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> and a {{frameless}} canopy resembling that of the F-22 Raptor. Immediately behind the cockpit are low observable intakes. All-moving canard surfaces with pronounced dihedral are placed behind the intakes, followed by leading edge extensions merging into delta wing with forward-swept trailing edges. The aft section features twin, outward canted all-moving fins, short but deep ventral strakes, and conventional round engine exhausts.|$|E
25|$|The park is most {{frequently}} entered from its western side. NY 9D runs near or along its boundaries, particularly between Cold Spring and Breakneck Ridge, {{and two of}} its major trailheads are along that section at Little Stony and Breakneck points. The Osborn Preserve and Anthony's <b>Nose</b> <b>sections</b> have trailheads along the Bear Mountain Highway and at the Appalachian Trail crossing at South Mountain Pass Road south of Canada Hill. The AT's junction with US 9 and NY 403 allows access from the east. In Garrison {{it is also possible}} to use the trails from Manitoga and the Castle Rock Unique Area to reach the park parcels on the ridgetops.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{people who}} use {{simulator}} software, especially flight simulator software, build their own simulator at home.

Some are so serious about realistic simulation that they will buy real aircraft parts, like complete <b>nose</b> <b>sections</b> of written-off aircraft, at aircraft boneyards.

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 727-21 with registration number HK-1803, purchased from Pan Am. It took off as scheduled at 7:13a.m. Five {{minutes into the}} flight, a bomb placed near the fuel tank exploded at 13,000 feet. The blast ripped the airliner apart: The <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> separated from the tail section, which went down in flames. All 107 people on board were killed, as well as three {{people on the ground}} who were killed by falling debris.|$|E
25|$|The Jetliner {{was later}} {{used as the}} aerial photo {{platform}} for the CF-100 project. On 10 December 1956, the Jetliner was ordered surplused, and although it was donated to the National Research Council, they had no room for it in storage and took only the <b>nose</b> <b>section</b> for cockpit layout design. The rest of the Jetliner was cut up on 13 December 1956. The only surviving parts are the nose and cockpit section in the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, Ontario.|$|E
25|$|The new {{fuselage}} section is constructed {{as a single}} large component, including the vertical stabilizer. When attached to the existing <b>nose</b> <b>section,</b> the fuselage is 55 feet (16.8 m) long and 9 feet (2.74 m) diameter. The fuselage has upper and lower halves, each with a roughly-oval shape similar to a canoe. The halves are bonded to circular frames. The {{fuselage section}} ahead of the entrance door consists of the existing (metal) 328J component, with fasteners used to bring the forward and new aft sections together.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. It was still uncertain whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, so three prototypes were built: W4052, W4053 and W4073. The second and third, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer. This caused some delays since half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the required higher combat loading. The <b>nose</b> <b>sections</b> also had to be changed from a design with a clear perspex bomb-aimer's position, to one with a solid nose housing four [...]303 machine guns and their ammunition.|$|R
