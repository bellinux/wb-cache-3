50|$|In 1984, {{a four-year-old}} {{student at the}} Fells Acres Day School wet himself while taking a <b>nap.</b> Upon <b>direction</b> by the child’s teacher, Gerald Amirault changed the boy into spare clothing. Later that year the boy was {{discovered}} playing sexually-suggestive games with his cousin. After being questioned about this by his mother and uncle, who himself had been molested as a child, the boy said that Amirault had sexually abused him. Shortly thereafter, Amirault was arrested on charges of raping the boy.|$|R

40|$|Speaker {{recognition}} using high-level features {{has been}} a successful area of exploration. Features obtained from many different levels—phones, words, prosodic events, etc. —are used to characterize the speaker. A good modeling technique for these features is the support vector machine (SVM). SVMs model the n-gram frequencies from speaker utterances in a high-dimensional SVM feature space and have shown excellent performance over {{a wide variety of}} high-level features. A complimentary method of recent exploration in SVM speaker recognition is the use of nuisance attribute projection (<b>NAP).</b> <b>NAP</b> removes <b>directions</b> from SVM feature space that are superfluous to the task of speaker recognition—channel information, session variability, etc. In this paper, we consider the application of NAP to high-level speaker recognition. We describe the difficulties in applying this method and propose solutions. We also conduct experiments showing that NAP can reduce variability in SVM feature space leading to improved performance. 1...|$|R

The Noyautage des administrations publiques (infiltration of public services) was also established, with the original aim of recruiting public figures who {{would be able to}} assure the return of the republic after the Vichy regime fell. However, the <b>NAP</b> gradually changed <b>direction</b> and allowing itself necessary cooperation with public services and the ability to obtain basic information about German army movements. The NAP-police were created, whose members would warn their comrades about forthcoming arrests. Another branch, the NAP-fer led by René Hardy, provided the Groupes Francs with schedules of German supply trains from 1943. The NAP also operated within the customs service.|$|R
