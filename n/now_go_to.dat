5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the mothballing of the smelter, all exports <b>now</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the grid.|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} he was {{appointed}} captain of the 64-gun [...] on 20 August, still in an acting capacity. Monmouth {{had been one of}} the most mutinous ships of the whole fleet, and was heavily involved in the Nore mutiny. Walker took her to join Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet in the North Sea. Within a short time he was able to restore good order aboard her, and was able to play a significant role in the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October. As she approached the Dutch fleet Walker gathered the crew and addressed them saying 'My lads, you see your enemy; I shall lay you close aboard and give you an opportunity of washing the stain off your characters in the blood of your foes. <b>Now,</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> your quarters and do your duty.' During the battle Monmouth engaged the Dutch ships Delft and Alkmaar for an hour and a half, forcing both of them to surrender. Monmouth, which had lost five men killed and 22 wounded, took Alkmaar in tow, and despite sailing through a strong gale, reached the shelter of Yarmouth roads five days later. The battle was a decisive victory for the British over the Dutch, and Walker was among those captains rewarded, having his post rank confirmed on 17 October, and receiving the Naval Gold Medal and the thanks of parliament. He attended the service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on 19 December, and assisted in depositing the captured enemy colours.|$|E

[...] Kay {{also noted that the}} tribunal did not accept Chopra's argument that he was passed over for a promotion because of discrimination (and not because he lacked sufficient experience). Kay also noted that one of Chopra's colleagues had complained he was [...] "authoritarian and confrontational." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{there was}} {{decreased}} minority language education in Quebec {{at the time}} when the Charter was adopted, several other provinces (where English Canadians were the majority) had no French language schools at all. [...] In contrast, in 2005 all provinces had minority language education schools. [...] In 1986, 152,225 French Canadian students were going to French-language schools in accordance with section 23, and in 2001 the number was 149,042. There would be various problems, such as a need for more French-speaking teachers and less opportunity for quality English-language education in rural Quebec. [...] Some French Canadian students also switched to English language instruction because there were few ways to get a French language university education outside Quebec. Still, minority language groups can <b>now</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the courts if their minority language rights are not met, and they have received funding for the legal costs incurred through these court actions through the federal government's Court Challenges Program.|$|E

2500|$|The United States, {{observed}} in 1940 that [...] "many thousands of black cotton farmers each year <b>now</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the polls, {{stand in line}} with their white neighbors, and mark their ballots independently without protest or intimidation, {{in order to determine}} government policy toward cotton production control." [...] However, discrimination towards blacks continued {{as it did in the}} rest of society, and isolated incidents often broke out. On September 25, 1961, Herbert Lee, a black cotton farmer and voter-registration organizer, was shot in the head by a white state legislator in Liberty, Missouri. Yet the cotton industry continued to be very important for blacks in the southern United States, much more so than for whites. By the late 1920s around two-thirds of all African-American tenants and almost three-fourths of the croppers worked on cotton farms. Three out of four black farm operators earned at least 40% of their income from cotton farming during this period. Studies conducted during the same period indicated that two in three black women from black landowning families were involved in cotton farming.|$|E
