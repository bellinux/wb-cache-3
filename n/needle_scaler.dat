40|$|United States (U. S.) Navy sailors {{are exposed}} to {{a very large number}} of hazards, both {{chemical}} and physical. Occupational vibration from pneumatic air tools is one of the potential exposure hazards. There are very limited data as to the exposures to one type of tool, a needle gun or <b>needle</b> <b>scaler,</b> used by the sailors. The purpose of this study was to characterize the vibration levels generated by a needle gun used in the U. S. Navy. The design of the study evaluated the difference pressure had on the acceleration levels generated from the <b>needle</b> <b>scaler.</b> Five subjects were used in the evaluation of the tool. Each subject was required to hold the tool for twenty seconds activated without contact and activated on a surface and at two different pressures, 60 and 80 pound per square inch (psi). Each subject repeated each of the conditions three times for a total of 12 measurements. Each subject was also required to hold the tool in hand without the tool activated. The measurements were collected from an accelerometer on the needle gun following ISO 5349 - 1 : 2001 and ISO 5349 - 2 : 2001 methods. Significant differences were observed individually in pressure (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001), contact (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001)), and subjects (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). In addition, there was a significant interaction between contact and pressure (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). It was concluded that U. S. Navy sailors are not likely at significant risk to Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome for lifetime exposures to hand transmitted vibration...|$|E

The effectiveness of vibration-reducing (VR) gloves for reducing hand transmitted vibration to the fingers {{has not been}} sufficiently examined. OBJECTIVEThe objective {{of this study is}} to examine tool-specific performance of VR gloves for reducing finger-transmitted vibrations in three orthogonal directions (3 D) from powered hand tools. METHODSA transfer function method was used to estimate the tool-specific effectiveness of four typical VR gloves. The transfer functions of the VR glove fingers in three directions were either measured in this study or during a previous study using a 3 D laser vibrometer. More than seventy vibration spectra of various tools or machines were used in the estimations. RESULTSWhen assessed based on frequency-weighted acceleration, the gloves provided little vibration reduction. In some cases, the gloves amplified the vibration by more than 10 %, especially the neoprene glove. However, the neoprene glove did the best when the assessment was based on unweighted acceleration. The neoprene glove was able to reduce the vibration by 10 % or more of the unweighted vibration for 27 out of the 79 tools. If the dominant vibration of a tool handle or workpiece was in the shear direction relative to the fingers, as observed in the operation of <b>needle</b> <b>scalers,</b> hammer chisels, and bucking bars, the gloves did not reduce the vibration but increased it. CONCLUSIONSThis study confirmed that the effectiveness for reducing vibration varied with the gloves and the vibration reduction of each glove depended on tool, vibration direction to the fingers, and finger location. VR gloves, including certified anti-vibration gloves do not provide much vibration reduction when judged based on frequency-weighted acceleration. However, some of the VR gloves can provide more than 10 % reduction of the unweighted vibration for some tools or workpieces. Tools and gloves can be matched for better effectiveness for protecting the fingers. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 11 - 17 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 27867313 PMC 511302...|$|R
