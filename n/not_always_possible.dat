5|$|Another {{manner in}} which the proofs might be {{undermined}} is if 1−0.999... simply does not exist, because subtraction is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>possible.</b> Mathematical structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include commutative semigroups, commutative monoids and semirings. Richman considers two such systems, designed so that 0.999... < 1.|$|E
5|$|Pilgrims {{attempt to}} visit the {{confines}} of the area, for there is a tradition that supplications and prayers uttered here are never rejected.

5|$|At this time, the {{existing}} infantry battalions of the Citizens Force were redesignated {{to perpetuate the}} numerical designations of the AIF, and although {{an attempt was made}} to allocate these designations based on regional considerations, ultimately this was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> and ultimately when the 3rd Division was re-established, only two of its component battalions—the 37th and 39th Battalions—had previously been assigned to the division.|$|E

5|$|In {{practical}} terms, horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food steadily throughout the day, {{as they do in}} nature when grazing on pasture. Although this is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, {{it is important to remember}} the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of epilepsy is typically made based on {{observation of the}} seizure onset and the underlying cause. An electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging (CT scan or MRI) {{to look at the}} structure of the brain are also usually part of the workup. While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted, it is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>possible.</b> Video and EEG monitoring may be useful in difficult cases.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, the average lifespan {{for a male}} Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity was 278 days and for a female was 356 days. In a different experiment, hamsters kept in captivity born in the summer lived {{for an average of}} 2.0–2.5 years. Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.|$|E

5|$|Stefan Kieniewicz, {{in a more}} {{critical}} treatment in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, notes {{that a lot of}} her exploits are poorly documented, and it is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> to separate legend from facts. He notes it is not certain she ever commanded any unit, and that her role as the commander of the 25th Regiment was more honorary than real; he also notes that she is known to have fainted on the battlefield, distracting her comrades, and in at least one instance (at the battle of Šiauliai), she was purposefully held behind front lines, as her comrades tried to ensure she would not endanger herself.|$|E
5|$|Like most European nations the Scots in {{this period}} began to covert from the bow to {{gunpowder}} firearms. Handguns were present in Scottish armies in small numbers from the fifteenth century and there are increasingly frequent references to handguns and arquebus in records. An account of the Scottish vanguard at Haddon Rig in 1542 suggests that half the troops were missile men and half of those were arquebusiers. Equal proportions of missile to melee troops {{seems to have been}} an aim of Scottish commanders for most of the century, although it was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> in the field. The main source of firearms were the French, who seem to have extensively rearmed the Scottish after the English invasions of the Rough Wooing.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> to {{eliminate}} ion suppression by sample preparation and/or chromatographic resolution.

25|$|The {{measurement}} of visual acuity in infants, pre-verbal children and special populations (for instance, handicapped individuals) is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>possible</b> {{with a letter}} chart. For these populations, specialised testing is necessary. As a basic examination step, one must check whether visual stimuli can be fixated, centered and followed.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, we {{can promote}} {{one of the}} transaction's reads to a write. For instance, T2 could set V1 = V1, {{creating}} an artificial write-write conflict with T1 and, again, preventing the two from succeeding concurrently.

25|$|HandyDART users {{apply for}} a pass and pay for each trip. Each trip must be pre-booked, up to one week in advance, and is subject to {{availability}} at the desired time.

25|$|A sound {{reinforcement}} {{system should}} be able to accurately reproduce a signal from its input, through any processing, to its output without any coloration or distortion.

25|$|Another is the Hopi language's {{words for}} water, one {{indicating}} drinking {{water in a}} container and another indicating a natural body of water.

25|$|As {{has already}} been mentioned, {{indications}} of tense are often bound up with indications of other verbal categories, such as aspect and mood.
