5|$|The {{recognition}} of Beonna {{as a historical}} figure leaves the 'Hun' element in the word Hunbeanna detached. Beanna is itself a hypocoristic form of a two-part name, and the 'nn' in the <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> interpreted as representing a geminate consonant.|$|E

There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters.

Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of purges that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt in North Korea even today, though his <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Its <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{attributed}} to the Nativity of John the Baptist, when John Cabot was believed to have sailed into the harbour in 1497 and to a Basque fishing town with the same name.

5|$|Jaguar {{is widely}} used as a product name, most {{prominently}} for a British luxury car brand. The <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> adopted by sports franchises, including the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and the Mexican soccer club Chiapas F.C. The crest of Argentina's national federation in rugby union features a jaguar; however, because of a journalist error, the country's national team is nicknamed Los Pumas. In {{the spirit of the}} ancient Mayan culture, the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City adopted a red jaguar as the first official Olympic mascot.|$|E
5|$|Joppenbergh {{is named}} after Colonel Jacob Rutsen, born Jacobsen Rutger van Schoonderwoerdt.

The spelling of the mountain's <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> disputed, and has been rendered as Joppenberg and Joppenburgh. It has also been called Jacob's Nose, Jacob's Mount, and, in an early 18th-century deed, Jobsenbright.|$|E
5|$|King Henry's Mound, a Neolithic burial barrow, is {{the highest}} point within the park and is located within the public gardens of Pembroke Lodge.

5|$|On 30 April 2013, Queen's Day, Willem-Alexander succeeded {{his mother}} Beatrix {{and became the}} first King of the Netherlands in 123 years. Consequently, from 2014 onwards the <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> changed from Queen's Day to King's Day. The date has also changed from 30 April to 27 April, which is the {{birthday}} of Willem-Alexander. On the first King's Day – held on 26 April 2014 because 27 April 2014 was a Sunday – the king visited De Rijp and Amstelveen (originally planned to be visited by Queen Beatrix in 2013, but postponed due to her abdication).|$|E
5|$|Samuel Adams's <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{appropriated}} by commercial and non-profit ventures since his death.

Adams's name is also used {{by a pair of}} non-profit organizations, the Sam Adams Alliance and the Sam Adams Foundation. These groups take their names from Adams in homage to his ability to organize citizens at the local level in order to achieve a national goal.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{settlement}} of Durovernum Cantiacorum ("Kentish Durovernum") occupied {{the location of}} an earlier British town whose ancient British <b>name</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reconstructed as *Durou̯ernon ("Stronghold by the Alder Grove"), although the name is sometimes supposed to have derived from various British names for the Stour. (Medieval variants of the Roman name include Dorobernia and Dorovernia.) In Sub-Roman Britain, it was known in Old Welsh as Cair Ceint ("Fortress of Kent"). Occupied by the Jutes, it became known in Old English as Cantwareburh ("Kentish Stronghold"), which developed into its present name.|$|E
