5|$|In 1937, Garran {{was made}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), the third time he had been knighted. Shortly after the {{establishment}} of the ANU in 1946, Garran became its first graduate when he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws. He had already been awarded such an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1937 and later receiving one from his alma mater, the University of Sydney in 1952. Garran served on ANU's council from 1946 until 1951. Garran's influence on Canberra is remembered by the <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> the suburb of Garran, Australian Capital Territory, and his link with ANU is remembered by the <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> a chair in the university's School of Law, by the <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> the hall of residence Burton & Garran Hall and by the <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> Garran house at Canberra Grammar School for his work with that school.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{cultivated}} plant taxonomy {{can be traced}} from the first plant selections {{that occurred during the}} agrarian Neolithic Revolution to the first recorded <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> human plant selections by the Romans. The naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first Cultivated Plant Code in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar. Since that time the classification and <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> cultigens has followed its own path.|$|E

6000|$|... § 4. The second general {{division}} <b>of</b> <b>names</b> is into {{concrete and}} abstract. A concrete {{name is a}} name which stands for a thing; an abstract name is a name which stands for an attribute of a thing. Thus John, the sea, this table, are <b>names</b> <b>of</b> things. White, also, is a <b>name</b> <b>of</b> a thing, or rather of things. Whiteness, again, is the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> a quality or attribute of those things. Man is a <b>name</b> <b>of</b> many things; humanity is a <b>name</b> <b>of</b> an attribute of those things. Old is a <b>name</b> <b>of</b> things: old age is a <b>name</b> <b>of</b> one of their attributes.|$|R

5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure.

This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E

Although his sons William and James would continue running for public office into the 1830s, Garrard never indicated a desire to run again.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, a few {{atoms of}} {{seaborgium}} were produced in laboratories {{in the former}} Soviet Union and in the United States.
