30|$|A final {{remark about}} how to view Fig.  15 is worthwhile. The {{resistivity}} image comes directly from the TE response of a model with zero strike. However, this model comes from inverting data that may have different strikes. Thus, the resistivity image cannot {{be viewed as a}} <b>normal</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> whose properties don’t change in the direction perpendicular to the profile, which corresponds to strike zero. It is still a cross section, but now we have to specify the related azimuths. The fit to the data was done assuming a model with azimuth zero, but because the impedances are invariant this model can accommodate perfectly well other azimuths. The model is then incompletely characterized by the resistivity distribution, and requires to be fully differentiated to specify the corresponding distribution of strikes.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe enhancement of the {{radar cross section}} (RCS) of specific bodies above their <b>normal</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> has several military and civilian applications (e. g., sail boats and decoys). This enhancement is achieved {{by the use of}} retroreflectors. Retroreflectors are simple geometric conducting structures that concentrate the reflected wave back in the direction of incidence. They are capable of producing a high RCS over a wide range of aspect angles. This thesis examines the RCS performance of various common retroreflector geometries. The study is performed using two computational electromagnetic simulation codes: a method of moments code and a physical optics code. The contour plots of RCS are presented for different geometries as a function of frequency.

40|$|Film-like and thread-like systems are, respectively, {{defined by}} the {{property}} {{that one of the}} constituting homogenous phases has a constant thickness (δ) or a constant <b>normal</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> (of largest chord δ). The stick probability function of this phase, in the limit δ → 0, naturally leads to the definition of the correlation function (CF) of a surface or of a curve. This CF closely approximates the generating stick probability function in the range of distances larger than δ. The surface and the curve CFs, respectively, behave as 1 /r and as 1 /r 2 as r approaches zero. This result implies that the relevant small-angle scattering intensities behave as PS}/q^ 2 or as P C/ q in the intermediate range of the scattering vector magnitude (q) and as l Pq^ 4 in the outermost q range. Similarly to P, pre-factors PS and PC simply depend on some structural parameters. Depending on the scale resolution it may happen that a given sample looks thread like at large scale, film like at small scale and particulate at a finer scale. An explicit example is reported. As a practical illustration of the above results, the surface and the curve CFs of some simple geometrical shapes have been explicitly evaluated. In particular, the CF of the right circular cylinder is evaluated. Its limits, as the height or the diameter the cylinder approaches zero, are shown to coincide with the CFs of a circle and of a linear segment, respectively...|$|E
30|$|The {{recognition}} that TE and TM impedances {{can be treated}} in theory and in practice as invariants opens a new possibility for treating MT profiles that present inconsistent strikes. The current approach is to fix the strike and modify the impedances accordingly. The new option keeps the invariant impedances untouched in spite of multiple strikes. With the present computing power, {{there is no reason}} for not working with both options in routine 2 D interpretations. The present work completes earlier developments for removing 1) electro-galvanic distortions using the same quadratic equation as for the present problem, and 2) the static effects using a mimic of the EMAP method. The conclusion that the strike-free impedances are valuable assets for 2 D interpretations is presented in three progressive steps using the BC 87 dataset. First, they lead to more reasonable static factors than those of fixed strikes. Second, they predict much better an independent EMAP line over the Nelson Batholith. And third, their predicted image of the subsurface correlates very well with seismic refraction and reflection surveys, particularly in relation to the Slocan Lake Fault and the delineation of the Nelson Batholith. We conclude that this is because a model with strike zero can accommodate impedances with other strikes. The resulting resistivity image of the subsurface is no longer a <b>normal</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> It is still a cross section, but it requires the corresponding strikes to be specified because otherwise the resistivity image is strike ignorant. We hope that he gives a lift to the survival of 2 D MT profiles which come so naturally in many matter-of-fact applications.|$|E
40|$|Drilling and Blasting is {{a common}} {{technique}} of tunnel driving, either for mining or civil purposes, at least for lengths shorter than 3 - 4 km. The technology is surely "mature", hence it offers a huge variety of cases to be analyzed. The report deals with {{the subject of the}} compliance of the actual blasting results with the design requirements (contour and pull). Three factors are obviously involved: explosive, rock and drilling; the main objective of the report is to asses in some simple cases the relative importance of each of them, and to describe a simple methodology to do that. A number of rounds in mine drifting operations, covering a variety of rock-drilling system-explosive assortments have been carefully surveyed; rock shows important differences from one site to another with respect to the quality class; drilling is performed with manually steered jumbo in some drifts, with computerized jumbo in other drifts; the general blasting pattern is not different from one site to another, but at places pipe charges are used in contour holes, at places fully coupled charges. The evaluation of the influence of the rock on the excavation difficulty is another objective of the study. Difficulty can be inferred from specific drilling work consumption, specific explosive consumption or from both. Drilling consumption, which means the relative fineness of explosive distribution in the rock-mass required in order to obtain a satisfactory blast, has been assumed to be a reliable criterion {{on the basis of the}} narrower dispersion of the data, with respect to explosive consumption. Being the study aimed to classify by relative difficulty the rock types, rather than the operations, the effect of the cross section (whose influence on specific consumption by far exceeds the one of rock type) has to be accounted for by normalizing consumptions, i. e. by defining a <b>normal</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> v/ specific consumption correlation, to be used as a reference line. Rock classes are related to difficulty classes; a wide dispersion is still observable, which indicates that the rock designation criterion based on lithological type should be improved by adding at least a second descriptive element. Anyhow, the simple lithological designation provides a first approximation ranking of the rocks to the intended purpose. The sensitivity of the pattern performances to drilling precision is analyzed in the same way. Tolerance standards for drilling machinery related to drilling pattern features are proposed. Data collected to establish the quality of the results of the blasts are: the overbreak value, the efficiency (actual pull/design pull ratio), the half cast factor of the contour holes. The relationships linking these indicators of quality to the features of the rock, of the drilling system and of the charging are analyzed and discussed. The statistical basis of the study is provided by data collected from a large number of cases, obtained from technical literature and from on site inspections. Analysis has been carried out on rounds of variable cross sections (from few to 160 m 3), with either parallel or inclined hole cuts, blasted using a wide range of explosives and ignition systems. A general methodology to establish the main reasons of observed inaccuracies and to foresee the consequences of changes in the drilling and blasting practice is presented in the conclusion...|$|E

Hypothesis: Gross tissue abnormalities {{will be more}} obvious in those animals that survive longer. Methods: 8 anesthetized, ventilated dogs were hemorrhaged (H, 90 min mean arterial pressure [MAP]= 35 - 40 mmHg or MAP 10 min or MAP 1 min), hypotensively stabilized (S, 120 min enalaprilat 0. 01 mg/kg/hr + hemoglobin based oxygen carrier [HBOC] or 7. 8 % hypertonic saline dextran 70 [HSD] for MAP= 40 - 45 mmHg), resuscitated (60 min lactated Ringer’s for MAP= 75 - 80 mmHg), monitored (60 min no fluids), and euthanized. Every animal was necropsied, and the internal organs were examined for visible abnormalities. Results: There were 2 early non-survivors: 1 of 5 HBOC died 117 min into S and 1 of 3 HSD died 9 min into S. The rest survived to euthanasia (331 min). No damage to the heart was visible in any animal. No lungs looked <b>normal.</b> On <b>cross</b> <b>section,</b> some of the renal cortices were much darker than normal, {{but this was not}} restricted to treatment group or non-survivors. Gastric, small and large intestinal mucosae were not normal in any animal, but the 2 early non-survivors were among those with the least abnormal intestines. Conclusions: Grossly visible changes in appearance occurred in most organs. Similar abnormalities in organ appearances (except possibly the intestines) in the 2 non-survivors versus survivors suggest that damage developed during hemorrhage rather than during resuscitation. This suggests that improvements in strategies for resuscitation from severe, prolonged hemorrhage should target repair of already damaged tissues in addition to prevention of additional tissue damage.
