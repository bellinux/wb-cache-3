5|$|The battle {{resulted}} {{in the loss of}} the German torpedo boat squadron and prevented the mining of busy shipping lanes, such as the mouth of the River Thames.

5|$|Following the Battle of Dogger Bank, the Admiralty saw {{the need}} for {{dedicated}} battlecruiser squadrons in British waters, and earmarked Australia to lead one of them. On 11 January, while en route to Jamaica, Australia was diverted to Gibraltar. Reaching there on 20 January, the battlecruiser was ordered to proceed to Plymouth, where she arrived on 28 January and paid off for a short refit. The docking was completed on 12 February, and Australia reached Rosyth on 17 February after sailing through a gale. She was made flagship of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (2nd BCS) of the Battlecruiser Fleet, part of the British Grand Fleet, on 22 February. Vice Admiral Patey was appointed to command this squadron. In early March, to avoid a conflict of seniority between Patey {{and the leader of}} the Battlecruiser Fleet, Vice Admiral David Beatty, Patey was reassigned to the West Indies, and Rear Admiral William Pakenham raised his flag aboard Australia. British and Allied ships deployed to the North Sea were tasked with protecting the British Isles from German naval attack, and keeping the German High Seas Fleet penned in European waters through a distant blockade while trying to lure them into a decisive battle. During her time with the 2nd BCS, Australias operations primarily consisted of training exercises (either in isolation or with other ships), patrols of the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>area</b> in response to actual or perceived German movements, and some escort work. These duties were so monotonous, one sailor was driven insane.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2014 study, [...] "there was a ‘little divergence’ within Europe between 1300 and 1800: {{real wages}} in the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>area</b> {{more or less}} {{stabilized}} at the level attained after the Black Death, and remained relatively high (above subsistence) throughout the early modern period (and into the nineteenth century); whereas, on the other hand, real wages in the ‘periphery’ (in Germany, Italy, and Spain) began to fall after the fifteenth century and returned {{to some kind of}} subsistence minimum during the 1500–1800 period. This ‘little divergence’ in real wages mirrors a similar divergence in GDP per capita: in the ‘periphery’ of Europe there was almost no per capita growth (or even a decline) between 1500 and 1800, whereas in Holland and England real income continued to rise and more or less doubled in this period." ...|$|E

Time {{series of}} annual mean {{zooplankton}} abundance observed by the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey in the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> {{during the last}} three decades are compared with transports from a depth-averaged storm-surge model by means of multiple regression analysis. In the northern areas, more than half the variance of Calanus finmarchicus can be accounted for by the winter flows. There are no statistically significant relationships in other <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>areas</b> or by using the flows from other seasons. This is consistent with the accepted view that this copepod overwinters in the North Atlantic and enters the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> in the early spring. The model flows are strongly related to the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which may explain the recently reported association of C. finmarchicus with the NAO.

50|$|The Saxons (Saxones, Seaxe, Sahson, Sassen, Sachsen, Saksen, Saeson) were a {{group of}} Germanic tribes first {{mentioned}} as living near the <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> coast {{of what is now}} Germany (Old Saxony), in the late Roman empire. They were soon mentioned as raiding and settling in many <b>North</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>areas,</b> as well as pushing south inland towards the Franks. Significant numbers settled in large parts of Great Britain in the early Middle Ages and formed part of the merged group of Anglo-Saxons who eventually organised the first united Kingdom of England. Many Saxons however remained in Germania (Old Saxony c. 531-804), where they resisted the expanding Frankish Empire through the leadership of the semi-legendary Saxon hero, Widukind. Initially, Saxons of Britain and those of Old Saxony (Northern Germany) were both referred to as 'Saxons' in an indiscriminate manner. The term Anglo-Saxon, in turn, came into practice in the 8th century (probably by Paul the Deacon) to distinguish English Saxons from continental Saxons (Ealdseaxe, 'old Saxons').|$|R

Mean delta(13) C values differed significantly {{between male and}} female harbour porpoises suggesting a trophic segregation between sexes with a more coastal distribution for females at least during their gestation and nursing periods. Hepatic Hg was correlated to delta(13) C measurements, reflecting a different exposure linked to coastal vs offshore feeding habitats.
