500|$|... "Rose" [...] {{received}} average overnight {{ratings of}} 9.9million viewers, peaking at 10.5million, respectively 43.2% and 44.3% of all viewers at that time. The final {{figure for the}} episode, including video recordings watched {{within a week of}} transmission, was 10.81million, making it the third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels. The opening episode was the highest rated episode of the first series. The penultimate episode, [...] "Bad Wolf", received the lowest viewers of the series with just 6.81million viewers. The series also garners the highest audience Appreciation Index of any <b>non-soap</b> drama on television. Besides the second episode, [...] "The End of the World", which garnered a 79% rating, the lowest of the series, all episodes received an AI above 80%. The series finale [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] was the highest rated episode with an AI of 89%. The success of the launch saw the BBC's Head of Drama Jane Tranter confirming on 30 March that the series would return both for a Christmas Special in December 2005 and a full second series in 2006.|$|E

50|$|In October 1969, Fuji Television {{started an}} anime comedy series, {{which is still}} on the air today and {{currently}} in production, making it the longest-running anime and <b>non-soap</b> opera scripted TV series in history. It has been broadcast every Sunday from 6:30 to 7:00 p.m. and contains three vignettes. The anime series has some characters, like Katsuo's classmates, who have not appeared in Hasegawa's original works.|$|E
50|$|The {{company has}} been {{introducing}} new technologies into the country {{since the early days}} of its existence - margarine production in the 1930s, <b>non-soap</b> detergents, shampoos and toothpaste in the 1960s and 1970s and sulphonation technology and cogeneration power plant in the 1980s. The nineties has seen the company focusing on several improvements in the Environment front one of which was the introduction of the first 100% biodegradable detergent bar in the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|The latest criticisms {{came when}} Pink {{launched}} their reality program The Farm, which sometimes occupied {{up to ten}} hours of their schedule, thus resulting {{in the absence of}} previous successful shows, films and imported <b>non-soap</b> TV series (which were removed from unpopular late night airtime and transferred to cable only channel Pink Family). Pink still occasionally airs imported TV series, the latest one being Damages (TV-MA rated in the USA), at 8 am, before telenovela repeats.|$|E

5000|$|Actual ratings {{data shows}} both these numbers to be correct, if incomplete. The Broadcasters' Audience Research Board {{reported}} that the debut episode of the series was the 20th most popular programme in the United Kingdom for the week ending 9 January 2005, with 7.53 million initial viewers. It {{was one of only}} three <b>non-soap</b> operas in the top 20 that week. [...] From this high-water mark, however, the show's audience declined, hovering between 5.2 and 6.2 million viewers. Despite this slip, it usually won its 9pm time slot. In the last two weeks of the run, however, BBC1 managed to win the time slot due to special programming.|$|E
50|$|Soap is, by weight, {{relatively}} {{ineffective and}} it is highly sensitive to deactivation by hard water. By the 1950s, soap had almost been completely replaced by branched alkylbenzenesulfonates, but these detergents {{were found to be}} poorly biodegradable. Linear alkylbenzenesulfonates (LABs), however, proved to be both highly effective in cleaning and more biodegradable than the branched relatives. LABs remain the main detergents used domestically. Other detergents that have been developed include the linear alkylsulfonates and olefinsulfonates, which also resist deactivation by hard water. Both remain specialty products, for example only an estimated 60 million kilograms of the sodium alkylsulfonates are produced annually. During the early development of <b>non-soap</b> surfactants as commercial cleaning products, the term syndet, short for synthetic detergent, was promoted to indicate the distinction from so-called natural soaps.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Semantic web {{services}} achieve {{effects in the}} world through {{web services}}, so the connection to those services—the grounding—is of paramount importance. The established technique is to use XML-based translations between ontologies and the SOAP message formats of the services, but these mappings cannot address {{the growing number of}} <b>non-SOAP</b> services, and step outside the ontological world to describe the mapping. We present an approach which draws the service’s interface into the ontology: we define ontology objects which represent the whole HTTP message, and use backward-chaining rules to translate between semantic service invocation instances and the HTTP messages passed to and from the service. We present a case study using Amazon’s popular Simple Storage Service. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: PFPE (Perfluoropolyether) {{is a clear}} colorless {{fluorinated}} {{synthetic oil}} that is nonreactive, nonflammable, safe in chemical and oxygen service, and is long lasting. PFPE grease is made by mixing different types of <b>non-soap</b> thickeners with the PFPE base oil. This paper highlights the unique properties (physical and chemical) of the PFPE {{as well as its}} unique application in areas where other lubricants are deficient. This paper includes methods of applying PFPE in oil and grease form, manufacturing of PFPE, and the benefits of using PFPE lubricants. Also, it includes a general overview of a hybrid grease [...] a grease suitable for less severe applications than PFPE yet superior to conventional greases produced by combining fluorinated greases with mineral/synthetic oils. Key Words: Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); X-ray fluorescence (XRF), synthetic lubricant; lubricant degradation; lubricant properties, grease plating; vacuum impregnating, hybrid greases. Introduction: PFPE, also called perfluoroalkylether (PFAE), or perfluoropolyalkylether (PFPAE), oils and oil-based greases are being used with an increasing frequency i...|$|E
40|$|Semantic web {{services}} are {{touted as a}} means to integrate {{web services}} inside and outside the enterprise, but while current semantic web service frameworks— including OWL-S [1], SA-WSDL, and WSMO 1 [2]—assume a homogeneous ecosystem of SOAP services and XML serialisations, growing numbers of real services are implemented using XML-RPC and RESTful interfaces, and non-XML serialisations like JSON. 2 Semantic services platforms based on OWL-S and WSMO use XML mapping languages to translate between an XML serialisation of the ontology data and the on-the-wire messages exchanged with the web service, a process referred to as grounding. This XML mapping approach suffers from two problems: it cannot address the growing number of <b>non-SOAP,</b> non-XML services being deployed on the Web, and it requires the modeller creating the semantic web service descriptions to work with the serialisation of the service ontology and a syntactic mapping language, in addition to the knowledge representation language used for representing the semantic service ontologies and descriptions. Our approach draws the service’s interface into the ontology: we defin...|$|E
