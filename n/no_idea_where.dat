5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1943 season, Wensloff enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War II. When the Yankees were preparing {{for the start of the}} 1944 season, the team originally had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> Wensloff was, as they had not heard from him. He was inactive for the 1944 season. In 1945, Wensloff was traded from the Yankees to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League for Johnny Kreevich, allowing him to simultaneously pitch professionally and continue serving in the war. In 10 games for the Padres, he won three and lost four with a 3.82 ERA. After the 1945 season and the war ended, Wensloff remained in military service, and as a result did not play in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Bypassing Vigo on {{his flight}} southwards, Villeneuve {{put into the}} Southern Spanish fleet base of Cadiz on 20 August. By abandoning his efforts to reach the English Channel, Villeneuve was in effect abandoning the entire {{invasion}} strategy and, when news of Villeneuve's retreat reached him, Napoleon decided to formally abandon the campaign, marching the army at Boulogne south to the Austrian border. Without instructions from his superior, and with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the main French fleet was, Allemand spent much of August off the Spanish coast before deciding {{to turn to the}} third aspect of his orders, the disruption of British trade.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered {{for his work on}} nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E
60|$|Martin {{was little}} acquainted in San Francisco, {{and not at}} all south of Market; so he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>where</b> he was being led.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> they are. After hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back but has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually {{finds its way}} to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a block of ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. The bag of ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys the bag of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E

60|$|I {{could make}} no {{satisfactory}} reply to this question, and plainly told him so. We {{had nothing to}} guide us on the search. The old man had given us <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>where</b> he might go, and all we knew was that he disappeared beyond the burning tavern.|$|R
6000|$|... "Passing strange!"

50|$|General Liman von Sanders had <b>no</b> clear <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the British {{were going}} to attack. Compounding the problems, the Ottomans withdrew their best troops {{to serve in the}} Caucasus Campaign. General Allenby finally {{launched}} the Battle of Megiddo, with the Jewish Legion under his command. Ottoman troops started a full scale retreat.|$|R
25|$|When county {{supervisors}} {{provided more}} than $600,000 to fund six additional detective positions to investigate child abuse in fiscal 2007, none {{were added to}} the sex-crimes squad.

25|$|By {{this time}} the Helena was making good time through the water again and picking up {{momentum}} heading straight for the cloud. The wheel was still turned hard left and I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> either the Juneau or the San Francisco were. Total silence reigned in the pilot house and {{on the wings of}} the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the name}} Tech Valley was derided as over-enthusiastic self-boosterism, but SEMATECH's {{decision}} in 2002 to relocate its headquarters to the University at Albany, SUNY began Tech Valley's {{rise in the}} public's perception. In 2004, however, when Bill Gates was asked by an Albany Times Union reporter {{what he thought about}} Tech Valley, he responded that he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> that was; two years later though, $400,000 from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was used to fund the Tech Valley High School.|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of facts we get clichés. We (currently) have <b>no</b> {{accurate}} <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the Malaysian Airlines flight MH 370 is, so journalists resort to phrases such as ‘mystery surrounds the fate’ or ‘confusion reigns’. More journalism is like this than you realise. It’s proof that news can be even more compelling when incomplete...|$|R
50|$|Casper is {{on a train}} full {{of ghosts}} heading to the Ghost Central, with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>where</b> he is {{as well as being}} {{completely}} unaware that he is a ghost himself. He gets kicked off the train and finds himself in the city of Deedstown, where he unintentionally scares a bunch of the town's citizens, which leads him to the realization that he is a ghost.|$|R
50|$|Fortuna and Constanza permit {{him to ask}} questions: {{he wants}} to know where he is. He fell asleep in the kingdom of Massinissa, but now has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>where</b> he is.

25|$|Communication between {{ships and}} the British {{commander-in-chief}} were comparatively poor. For {{most of the}} battle, Jellicoe had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the German ships were, even though British ships were in contact. They failed to report enemy positions, contrary to the Grand Fleet's Battle Plan. Some {{of the most important}} signalling was carried out solely by flag instead of wireless or using redundant methods to ensure communications—a questionable procedure, given the mixture of haze and smoke that obscured the battlefield, and a foreshadowing of similar failures by habit-bound and conservatively minded professional officers of rank to take advantage of new technology in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Because of Forrest's {{relentless}} screening, Schofield had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the Confederate Army was headed. The aggressive Forrest had {{a considerable}} advantage over his Union cavalry opponents, commanded by Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson. Wilson had {{arrived from the}} Eastern Theater in late October to reorganize and command Thomas's cavalry, but he possessed only 4,300 horsemen, scattered around the theater in numerous small units, compared to 10,000 men unified under Forrest. The Confederate cavalry advanced to Mount Pleasant by November 23. Croxton's brigade was hopelessly outnumbered against Forrest, so Thomas reinforced him with a division under Brig. Gen. Edward Hatch and a brigade under Col. Horace Capron.|$|E
25|$|Because of Forrest's {{relentless}} screening, Schofield had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the Confederate Army was headed. The aggressive Forrest had {{a slight}} advantage over his Union cavalry opponents, commanded by Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson. Wilson had arrived from the Eastern Theater in late October to reorganize and command Thomas's cavalry, but he possessed only 4,800 horsemen ready to oppose Forrest, compared to Forrest's between 5,000 and 6,000 men. The Confederate cavalry advanced to Mount Pleasant by November 23. Brig. Gen. John T. Croxton's brigade, the initial Federal cavalry force, was reinforced with a division under Brig. Gen.

6000|$|She had, of course, {{no money}} at all. The {{quantities}} of [...] "black men" [...] all about frightened her.

5000|$|In June 1973, the British DLM, with Prem Rawat's mother {{acting on}} behalf of her son, {{organized}} the [...] "Festival of Love" [...] at the Alexandra Palace in London. While it drew thousands of attendees, Rawat began receiving hostile press coverage, partly due to his showing up late, or not at all, at scheduled appearances. The large membership had grown up very rapidly but the organizers had <b>no</b> clear <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> to lead the following, nor did they have the financial resources to maintain so many full-time workers.|$|R
25|$|During the French retreat, Reille {{turned up}} with three {{divisions}} of the Army of Portugal, adding 15,000 men to Joseph's army. Clausel's 25,000 troops were at large but Joseph had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> they were. For his part, Clausel never received any messages from the king until 15 June, at which time he gathered four divisions {{and set out to}} join the main army. Joseph massed his army behind the Ebro River, believing that it would be impossible for Wellington's army to outflank the line on the north. On 15 June, Hill's wing crossed the Ebro at Puente Arenas and Graham's wing crossed at San Martin de Lines. From the 13th until a cavalry encounter on 17 June, the French lost all contact with their adversaries.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{says that}} the Neuri had Scythian customs, but they were at first not {{considered}} Scythian. During the war between the Scythians and the Persian Empire, the Scythians came to dominate the Neuri. Strabo, younger contemporary of Pytheas, denies that any knowledge of {{the shores of the}} eastern Baltic existed. He had heard of the Sauromatai, but had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> to place them. Herodotus had mentioned these Sauromatai as a distinct people living near the Neuri. Pliny the Elder, however, is much better informed. The island of Baunonia (Bornholm), he says lies a days' sail off Scythia, where amber is collected. To him the limit of Germany is the Vistula. In contrast to Strabo, he knows that the Goths live around the Vistula, but these are definitely Germans.|$|E
25|$|Despite these problems, 76 men crawled {{through to}} freedom, until at 4:55a.m. on 25 March, the 77thman was spotted {{emerging}} {{by one of}} the guards. Those already in the trees began running, while a New Zealand Squadron Leader Leonard Henry Trent VC who had just reached the tree line stood up and surrendered. The guards had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the tunnel entrance was, so they began searching the huts, giving men time to burn their fake papers. Hut 104 {{was one of the last}} to be searched, and despite using dogs the guards were unable to find the entrance. Finally, German guard Charlie Pilz crawled back through the tunnel but found himself trapped at the camp end; he began calling for help and the prisoners opened the entrance to let him out, finally revealing its location.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Yao {{was found}} to have an affair with actor Wen Zhang while Wen's legal wife Ma Yili just gave birth to their second daughter. Some rumors {{suggested}} that their secret romance began when Ma was pregnant. Wen apologized to his family when he was caught by the media while Yao was widely blamed by the public through social media. Yao chose to keep silent after the disputed event and tried to escape from the public. Even her parents had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> about <b>where</b> she was and what she was doing.|$|R
60|$|Her first wild {{thought of}} {{rushing to the}} police-station she had {{dismissed}} as useless.

50|$|According to {{some old}} people living here, {{there was a}} house on this {{barangay}} long ago. Many people were cooking rice for their dinner. A Spaniard was spying on them. The Spaniard had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>where</b> he was. Suddenly, an old woman said that bumubulak na ang kanin. It meant that the rice is almost cooked. The Spaniard did not really understand what the old woman said. He {{thought that it was}} bumulak kanin. He thought that it {{was the name of the}} Barangay. After that, this barangay was named bulacanin, then it was changed to Bulacnin.|$|R
25|$|In the end, five American battleships were sunk, {{three were}} damaged, and eleven other cruisers, destroyers, and {{auxiliaries}} were sunk or seriously damaged. The Japanese lost only 29 aircraft, while 74 were damaged by anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} ground. The damaged aircraft were disproportionately dive and torpedo bombers, seriously impacting available firepower to exploit the first two waves' success, so {{the commander of the}} First Air Fleet, Naval Lieutenant-General Chuichi Nagumo, withdrew. Yamamoto later lamented Nagumo's failure to seize the initiative to seek out and destroy the US carriers, absent from the harbor, or further bombard various strategically important facilities on Oahu. Nagumo had absolutely <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the American carriers might be, and remaining on station while his forces cast about looking for them ran the risk of his own forces being found first and attacked while his aircraft were absent searching. In any case, insufficient daylight remained after recovering the aircraft from the first two waves for the carriers to launch and recover a third before dark, and Nagumo's escorting destroyers lacked the fuel capacity for him to loiter long. Much has been made of Yamamoto's hindsight, but, in keeping with Japanese military tradition not to criticize the commander on the spot, he did not punish Nagumo for his withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|A charismatic monk and {{powerful}} orator named Peter the Hermit of Amiens was the {{spiritual leader of}} the movement. He was known for riding a donkey and dressing in simple clothing. He had vigorously preached the crusade throughout northern France and Flanders. He {{claimed to have been}} appointed to preach by Christ himself (and supposedly had a divine letter to prove it), and it is likely that some of his followers thought he, not Urban, was the true originator of the crusading idea. It is often believed that Peter's army was a band of illiterate, incompetent peasants who had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> they were going, and who believed that every city of any size they encountered on their way was Jerusalem itself; this may have been true for some, but the long tradition for pilgrimages to Jerusalem ensured that the location and distance of the city were well known. While the majority were unskilled in fighting, there were some well-trained minor knights leading them, such as Walter Sans-Avoir (also mistakenly known as Walter the Penniless), who was experienced in warfare. A list of known members of Peter's army can be found in Riley-Smith, et al, A Database of Crusaders to the Holy Land.|$|E
25|$|The {{expanded}} 30th anniversary {{edition of}} the 1965 official book, The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation, was notable for its exclusion {{of most of the}} evidence against the map's authenticity, concentrating instead on vindications by George Painter, and Thomas Cahill with colleague Bruce Kusko (in which they claimed specifically that they had not analyzed the loose particles they took from the map {{at the time of their}} PIXE research), but it did reprint a remarkable essay written in 1989 by the original book dealer Laurence Witten. He stated that, when the McCrone investigation concluded the map to be a forgery in 1974, he was asked by Yale to reveal its provenance as a matter of urgency, and to discuss the possible return of Mr Mellon's money. He replied that he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the map came from, beyond Ferrajoli (who was convicted of theft shortly after the sale, and died shortly after release from prison). On the subject of the money, he said he could not pay it all back because he had paid agreed shares of his profit to Ferrajoli and to another dealer who had introduced him. For his part, Mellon did not ask for the return of any money. The essay also revealed that Witten had, on Ferrajoli's recommendation, met with Irving Davis after buying the map volume in 1957.|$|E
40|$|For many {{behaviours}} {{studied at}} the phenotypic level, we have little or <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>where</b> to start searching for “candidate” genes: the transcriptome provides such a starting point. Here we consider transcriptomic changes associated with oviposition in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Oviposition is a key behaviour, as females {{are faced with a}} variety of decisions that will impact offspring fitness. These include choosing between hosts of differing quality, as well as deciding on clutch size and offspring sex ratio. We compared the whole-body transcriptomes of resting or ovipositing female Nasonia using a “DEEP-Sage” gene expression approach on the Illumina sequencing platform...|$|R
5000|$|Allied {{ground forces}} had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> when, <b>where,</b> in what numbers, or under what {{circumstances}} they might see Allied aircraft. Unlike the earlier invasion of North Africa and later invasion of Italy, the United States invasion fleet included no aircraft carriers. Carriers which had supported the American landings during Operation Torch had been reassigned without replacement. The escort carrier [...] was defending UG convoys from U-boats while the other three Sangamon class escort carriers had been transferred to the Pacific to support the Guadalcanal campaign and the fleet carrier [...] was training new pilots on the United States Atlantic coast.|$|R
60|$|At last I {{ran away}} myself, {{whenever}} I saw an emissary {{of the police}} approaching with some new intelligence; and lived a stealthy life until he was tried and ordered to be transported. Even then he couldn't be quiet, but was always writing us letters; and wanted so much to see Dora before he went away, that Dora went to visit him, and fainted when she found herself inside the iron bars. In short, I had no peace of my life until he was expatriated, and made (as I afterwards heard) a shepherd of, 'up the country' somewhere; I have <b>no</b> geographical <b>idea</b> <b>where.</b>|$|R
