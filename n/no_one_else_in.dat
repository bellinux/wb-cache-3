Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances.

LM10 is capable of operating with a 1.1 volt power supply, thus instead of a conventional bandgap reference it employs Widlar's sub-bandgap circuit locked at 200 mV and the low-voltage Widlar output stage. For 10 years, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the industry was able to produce a circuit that matched the LM10.|$|E
25|$|In February 1897 Sinclair scored 301 not {{out in a}} club game, which {{remained}} {{the highest score in}} any form of cricket in South Africa for many years. South Africa's next Tests came in 1898-99, with a two-match series against England. This time, thanks largely to Sinclair, the matches were more evenly contested, and South Africa gained a first-innings lead each time before losing. He did not bowl in the First Test, but scored 86, South Africa's first Test fifty, opening the first innings; apart from Pelham Warner's 132 in England's second innings, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the match reached 40. In the Second Test Sinclair became the first person from any country to score a century and take five wickets in an innings in the same Test. In England's first innings he took 6 for 30, dismissing them for 92, then went in to bat with South Africa's score at 27 for 2 to make 106 before being last out with the total on 177. He was caught on the boundary in each innings.|$|E

500|$|Although Henry {{played up}} front as a striker during his youth, {{he spent his}} time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger {{immediately}} changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp. During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to 4–5–1. This change forced Henry to adapt again {{to fit into the}} Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker. Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: [...] "Thierry Henry could take the ball {{in the middle of the}} park and score a goal that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world could score".|$|E
500|$|At that time, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> {{the world}} of physics had noticed what Curie {{recorded}} in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: [...] "The fact is very remarkable, and leads {{to the belief that}} these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium." [...] She later would recall how she felt [...] "a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible." [...] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore.|$|E

[...] Stansbury ignored instructions from Arnold to involve <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the plot, and crossed the British lines and went to see Jonathan Odell in New York. Odell was a Loyalist working with William Franklin, the last colonial governor of New Jersey {{and the son of}} Benjamin Franklin. [...] On May 9, Franklin introduced Stansbury to Major André, who had just been named the British spy chief.

Killebrew moved to left field, where he started off the season slowly. He hit under [...]200 in both April and June, and because of this Killebrew was not selected to play in either 1962 All-Star Game, the last season he was not named an All-Star before 1972. On July 18 in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Killebrew and Bob Allison became the first teammates since 1890 to hit grand slams in the same inning as the Twins scored 11 runs in the first. Over the course of the season, Killebrew hit 48 home runs, 126 RBIs, and had 107 walks, all career highs at the time. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the AL managed even 40 home runs and he also led the league in RBIs. Killebrew's 48 home runs also broke the franchise record {{for the second year in}} a row.

500|$|The Ecstatic {{was titled}} after Victor LaValle's 2002 dark humor {{novel of the}} same name. One of Mos Def's {{favorite}} novels, it was written about an overweight college dropout who fell into mental illness while living with his eccentric family in Queens, New York. According to Mos Def, the phrase [...] "the ecstatic" [...] was [...] "used in the 17th and 18th centuries to describe people who were either mad or divinely inspired and consequently dismissed as kooks". The phrase resonated with him, as he believed <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> hip hop had ever recorded an album like The Ecstatic. [...] "I feel like I {{was the only person}} who was capable of making this type of music in this type of way", he claimed. [...] "I don't rap like nobody, I don't try to sound like nobody." [...] He said [...] "the ecstatic" [...] also referred to [...] "a type of devotional energy, an impossible dream that becomes reality but is discredited before it's realized. The airplane, a nutty idea. The telephone, the Internet. People who envisioned those were considered radical or extreme." ...|$|E
500|$|The Elder {{election}} {{is an old}} tradition at Seio Girls' Academy where every June {{one of the students}} is elected by her peers to be the [...] "Elder", who is seen as the number one [...] "Elder Sister" [...] in the school.

If there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the election, the current year's student council president becomes the Elder. In Otoboku, Mizuho gains 82% of the votes in the first round, effectively becoming the 72nd Elder in the school's history. After becoming Elder, Mizuho progressively gets more popular among the student body since he is now a symbol of the school's excellence. In the following months, Mizuho starts to get to know some of the girls better and helps them with their problems.|$|E

500|$|Returning {{to a job}} in {{the physics}} {{department}} at Auckland, Gascoigne worked on military optics, developing gun sights and rangefinders, although he did not remain there for long. Richard van der Riet Woolley, director of the Commonwealth Solar Observatory in Canberra (now Mount Stromlo Observatory), sought out Gascoigne because his [...] "experience in optical work [...] unique" [...] and Gascoigne was [...] "trained in a way that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Australia has been qualified". When in 1941 Gascoigne was offered a research fellowship by Woolley, he moved to Canberra. The Solar Observatory staff had similar responsibilities to those Gascoigne had held in New Zealand. His first task was to design an anti-aircraft gun sight, and he was also involved in a range of other military optical projects. In 1944, the Melbourne Observatory, home to the Commonwealth Time Service, was closed. Gascoigne reestablished the Time Service at Mount Stromlo, using two Shortt-Synchronome clocks and astronomical observing equipment that he and his colleagues adapted; the Time Service remained at Mount Stromlo until 1968. The knowledge and experience Gascoigne gained during the war proved valuable. He was at the only facility in Australia where optical work could be done, from design and manufacture to assembly and testing. Gascoigne developed a wide range of skills and [...] "finished up quite practical, especially with a screwdriver." ...|$|E

2500|$|American author Ralph Ellison wrote {{a tribute}} to the book in the prologue of his 1952 novel Invisible Man. According to Ellison biographer Arnold Rampersad, the {{character}} of the narrator [...] "resembles <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> previous fiction so much as he resembles Ishmael of Moby-Dick". Ellison acknowledges his debt in the prologue to the novel, where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana, and evocates a church service: [...] "Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most black, brother, most black...'" [...] In this scene Ellison [...] "reprises a moment in the second chapter of Moby-Dick", where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford {{looking for a place to}} spend the night, and momentarily joins a congregation: [...] "It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there." [...] According to Rampersad, it was Melville who [...] "empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition" [...] by his example of [...] "representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text".|$|E

He grows even angrier when he learns that she gave away Kate after letting Greg Madden {{convince}} her that Tad could not love a daughter, who, Madden claimed, would remind him of Dixie's death too much for him to love the child properly. Tad vents his anger while testifying at Dixie's trial when she stands accused of Greg Madden's murder. Afterwards, though, the two begin to reconcile. Tad invites her for a date one morning, and Dixie accepts. However, in 2007, she dies that day after eating poisoned pancakes that were meant for her daughter-in-law (Babe).
