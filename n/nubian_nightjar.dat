He has written a number of bird identification papers, mostly published in English in magazines such as British Birds and Birding World.

Projects have included working out an agricultural management plan for the Hula Valley to insure the health of migrating common cranes, and preventing the draining of a large area of salt pans, the last breeding site in Israel for <b>Nubian</b> <b>nightjars.</b> [...] The campaign to create the 2004 Coastal Law, which forbids new development in any area within 300 meters from the coastline was a notable accomplishment. With almost 800 employees, SPNI is an enormous non-profit organization, {{with a wide range of}} activities, thus SPNI is known as well by its various divisions' names as it is by the name [...] "SPNI".|$|R
