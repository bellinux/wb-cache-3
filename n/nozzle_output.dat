50|$|The most {{efficient}} atmospheric pressure {{at which a}} conventional propelling nozzle works is set by the geometry of the nozzle bell. While the geometry of the conventional bell remains static the atmospheric pressure changes with altitude and therefore nozzles designed for high performance in the lower atmosphere lose efficiency as they reach higher altitudes. In traditional rockets this is overcome by using multiple stages designed for the atmospheric pressures they encounter. An SSTO engine must use a single set of nozzles. Successful tests were carried out in 2010 on an expansion deflection nozzle called STERN that varies the <b>nozzle</b> <b>output</b> to overcome the problem of non-dynamic exhaust expansion.|$|E

Spray drift modelling has been developed {{to get a better}} understanding of the parameters involved and better estimation of the off-target spray deposit. Two groups of models have received extensive a. ttention: Random-walk and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been used to predict the effect of: nozzle height, spray pressure, wind speed, [...] . and were v. alidated with wind tunnels trials. Statistical models based on field trials results have been developed to estimate off-target spray deposit for different sprayers in various environmental conditions. A third group, Gaussian dispersion models, have received early attention in spray drift modelling but are not so popular, despite their international success in environmental pollution modelling. The adaptation of such a model to ground spraying is proposed. The nozzle droplet size distribution measured with a Malvern laser particle analyser is used to divide the <b>nozzle</b> <b>output</b> into several size classes. The spray deposit (or footprint) of each diameter class is computed. The summation of these footprints results in the global drift of the nozzle.

They have requested assistance, and field days are planned where Department of Agriculture Technicians will assist growers to calibrate knapsacks and select herbicides. A series of four tables has been developed to assist the Technicians, and aims to simplify the SASRI Herbicide Guide and calibration calculations. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explain the contents and step-wise use of the tables. An example is given in Table 1, which provides calculations according to <b>nozzle</b> <b>output</b> and cane row spacing, and specifies the height of water to be added to either a standard 210 L plastic or 220 L metal drum used for mixing herbicides for application to 0. 5 ha.

The required amount of each herbicide for addition to the mixing drum is adjusted for different soil clay contents. Finally, calculations are provided for the addition of suitable adjuvants according to the height of water initially added to the mixing drum.

40|$|A delay-compensated Bang-Bang {{control design}} {{methodology}} {{for the control}} of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>output</b> flow rate of screw-extruder-based 3 D printing processes is developed. The presented application has a great potential to move beyond the most commonly used processes such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Syringe Based Extrusion (SBE), improving the build speed. A geometrical decomposition of the screw extruder in a partially and a fully filled regions (PFZ and FFZ) allows to describe the material convection in the extruder chamber by a 1 D hyperbolic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) coupled with an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). After solving the hyperbolic PDE by the Method of Characteristics (MC), the coupled PDE-ODE's system is transformed into a nonlinear state-dependent input delay system. The aforementioned delay system is extended to the nonisothermal case with the consideration of periodic fluctuations acting on the material's convection speed, which represent the effect of viscosity variations due to temperature changes in the extruder chamber, resulting to a nonlinear system with an input delay that simultaneously depends on the state and the time variable. Global Exponential Stability (GES) of the nonlinear delay-free plant is established under a piecewise exponential feedback controller that is designed. By combining the nominal, piecewise exponential feedback controller with nonlinear predictor feedback the compensation of the time- and state-dependent input delay of the extruder model is achieved. Global Asymptotic Stability (GAS) of the closed-loop system under the Bang-Bang predictor feedback control law is established when certain conditions, which are easy to verify, related to the extruder design and the material properties, {{as well as to the}} magnitude and frequency of the materials transport speed variations, are satisfied.

40|$|The {{reasons and}} degree of {{converter}} waste gases afterburning in slag and gas cavity of the converter during blowing have been studied. The afterburning is connected with reflection of the circumferential part of an oxygen jet on its length from the <b>nozzles</b> <b>output</b> section to the metal melt surface because of ongoing streams of converter waste gases and slag layer. Thus oxygen assimilation degree because of the above mentioned factors decreases by 5 - 35 of % depending on regime parameters, the blowing devices design, portable properties of supersonic jets in the high-temperature gas cavity of the converter and melt, on {{the height of the}} tuyere arrangement above the melt etc. Afterburning is influenced with the gas jet and the liquid melt interaction at upper blowing which is various at different intensity of blowing and the height of the tuyere arrangement, that is laminar, transient or turbulent. It has been shown, that gas and melt interaction is also influenced with the probability of the disturbances from the surrounding atmosphere transfer into the jet.

40|$|Until the 1960 s {{pesticides}} {{were applied}} with a spray gun {{connected to a}} long hose or directly to the tank and operated by a worker standing on a platform. This technique was gradually replaced by airassisted sprayers. The purchase of three sprayer test facilities in 1991 signified {{the start of a}} new era in pesticide application:• The ejection rate of the individual nozzles as well as the distribution pattern of the liquid could be measured and optimized on a vertical test stand by adjusting the nozzles or adding additional ones. • The ceramic nozzles were replaced by hollow-cone nozzles, which allowed for the first time to calculate the exact amount of liquid per hectare and tree height based on various parameters such as driving speed, spray pressure, number of open nozzles and <b>nozzle</b> <b>output</b> volume. The amount of water was reduced from 500 l/m tree height and hectare to 166 – 100 l. • The efficacy of the pesticides was increased and spray drift reduced, which brings about economic and ecological benefits. • Up to the year 1997 sprayer calibration was optional. Since then, a sprayer calibration in 5 -year intervals has become a condition for participation in the South Tyrolean IP-programme. This also facilitates the observance of the GobalGAP control points and Compliance Criteria regarding application equipment. Since 2011 the South Tyrolean sprayer manufacturers and fruit- and winegrowers have been able to measure and optimize the air blast and emission pattern. Thereby we hope to further reduce spray drift and increase the efficacy of the pesticides. A properly calibrated sprayer enables the fruit- and winegrowers to observe more easily the regulations for the distances to residential and public buildings as well as pastures enacted by the South Tyrolean Provincial Government and AGRIOS in 2011. We trust that the South Tyrolean fruit- and winegrowers will have no difficulties in complying with the Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides with regard to application techniques and sprayer calibration...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{concern about}} environmental effect of off-target deposits of pesticides use {{has resulted in}} the development of numerous spray drift models. Statistical models based on experimental field studies are used to estimate off-target deposits for different sprayers in various environmental conditions. Random-walk and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been used to predict the effect of operational parameters and were extensively validated in wind tunnel. A third group, Gaussian dispersion models have been used for several years for the environmental assessment of the pesticide spray drift, mainly for aerial application. When these models were used for the evaluation of boom sprayer spray drift, their predictions were found unreliable in the short range, were the initial release conditions of the droplets {{have a significant effect on}} the spray deposits. For longer ranges, the results were found consistent with the field measurements as the characteristics of the source have a reduced influence on the small droplets drift. Three major parameters must be taken into account in order to define realistic initial conditions of the droplets in a spray drift model: the spray pattern of the nozzle, the boom movements and the effect of entrained air and droplet velocities. To take theses parameters into account in a Gaussian model, the nozzle droplet size distribution measured with a Malvern laser particle analyser was used to divide the <b>nozzle</b> <b>output</b> into several size classes. The spray deposits of each diameter class was computed for each successive position of the nozzle combining the nozzle spray distribution with drift computed with a Gaussian tilting plume model. The summation of these footprints resulted in the global drift of the nozzle. For increasing droplet size, the release height used in the Gaussian model was decreased from nozzle height to ground level using an experimental law to take into account the effect of entrained air and droplet initial velocity. The experimental law was adjusted on 2 m/s wind tunnel measurements and robustness was evaluated for 1 and 4 m/s...|$|E

The suggested model provides the conversion of its oscillatory motions (both pitching and rolling) into a jet flow.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to study pressure recovery in various models of aorlic valve stenosis by performing hemodynamic measurements under physiologic conditions in a pulsatile aortic flow circuit. The results were used to validate calculations of pressure recovery based on theoretic considerations derived from fluid dynamics. Background. Pressure recovery in aortic stenosis has not been systematically analyzed. Methods. Stenoses varying in size, shape (circular, Y-shaped, slitlike) and inlet configuration (sharp-edged, nozzle-shaped inlet, artificially stenosed hioprostheses) were used. Aortic pressures were measured at multiple sites distal to the stenotic orifice to determine pressure gradients and recovery. Results. With decreasing orifice area (2, 1. 5, 1 and 0. 5 cm 2) pressure recovery increased (5, 7, 10 and 16 mm Hg, respectively) and the index pressure recovery to maximal peak to peak gradient decreased (56 %, 37 %, 24 % and 14 %, respectively). For a given orifice size of 0. 5 cm 2, this index ranged between 12 % for a Y-shaped orifice and 15 % for a circular orifice with a <b>nozzle</b> (cardiac <b>output</b> 4 liters/min). Increasing the cardiac output increased pressure recovery, whereas the ratio of pressure recovery to maximal pressure gradient remained constant. Conclusions. The index pressure recovery to transvalvular pressure gradient, which expresses the hemodynamic relevance of pressure recovery, decreases with increasing severity of aortic stenosis but is independent of transvalvular flow. Thus, pressure recovery is of minor importance in severe aortic stenosis but may account for discrepancies between Doppler and manometric gradients observed in patients with mild to moderate aortic stenosis or a prosthetic valve in the aortic position...|$|R

It {{is based on a}} micromachined print head incorporating a central microarray of presently up to 96 vertical <b>nozzles</b> on the <b>output</b> side. Droplets featuring volumes down to 1 nl aligned in a 500 μm grid are simultaneously ejected by applying a steep air pressure ramp to the open upper side of the liquid.

40|$|Simultaneous {{multiple}} path measurements of temperature and H 2 O concentration {{will be presented}} for the AIMHYE test entries in the NASA Ames 16 -Inch Shock Tunnel. Monitoring the progress of high temperature chemical reactions that define scramjet combustor efficiencies is a task uniquely suited to nonintrusive optical diagnostics. One application strategy to overcome the many challenges and limitations of nonintrusive measurements is to use laser absorption spectroscopy coupled with optical fibers. Absorption spectroscopic techniques with rapidly tunable lasers are capable of making simultaneous measurements of mole fraction, temperature, pressure, and velocity. The scramjet water absorption diagnostic {{was used to measure}} combustor efficiency and was compared to thrust measurements using a nozzle force balance and integrated nozzle pressures to develop a direct technique for evaluating integrated scramjet performance. Tests were initially performed with a diode laser tuning over a water absorption feature at 1391. 7 nm. A second diode laser later became available at a wavelength near 1343. 3 nm covering an additional water absorption feature and was incorporated in the system for a two-wavelength technique. Both temperature and mole fraction can be inferred from the lineshape analysis using this approach. Additional high temperature spectroscopy research was conducted to reduce uncertainties in the scramjet application. The lasers are optical fiber coupled to ports at the combustor exit and in the <b>nozzle</b> region. The <b>output</b> from the two diode lasers were combined in a single fiber, and the resultant two-wavelength beam was subsequently split into four legs. Each leg was directed through 60 meters of optical fiber to four combustor exit locations for measurement of beam intensity after absorption by the water within the flow.

Assessment of its value as a combustor performance evaluation tool will be conducted...|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} the water-jet {{as a good}} option to be implemented as propulsion source for a probe since a water-jet can be generated via the transfer of water through a long hose with constant and relatively small diameter from a water source to an <b>output</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Additionally, such a water-jet generates a thrust force that can be controlled by the regulation of the flow rate. Taking into account that this system requires control in open areas, three different configurations are suggested. The first one is a configuration similar to the tendril from NASA with the difference that only one actuated section is required at the tip; in this way, {{it is possible to}} position the tip in the desired place in the three-dimensional space. The water-jet is directed partially backwards to the longitudinal axis of the hose, {{in the same way as}} in the piping inspection devices, and via the regulation of the flow rate, the magnitude of the thrust force can be controlled. The second option is by regulating the water-jet through servo-valves. Similar to continuum robots, at least three actuation elements are necessary to control the motion in three-dimensional space. Thus, it requires independent control of each water-jet. This necessitates at least three servo valves which should be placed at the tip of the probe in order to regulate the opening of the orifices of each water-jet, thereby controlling the flow rate and thrust force. However, the need of servo valves at the tip will increase the diameter of the device and the complexity of the manufacture. Finally, the last proposal is a device with no mobile element at the tip. Instead, it has three nozzles in circular arrangement directed partially backward. Each water-jet is generated independently, which means that each nozzle has its own feeding hose and independent pump. By regulating the speed of each pump, the flow and thrust force are controlled. Because the last option is the easiest to implement, we chose the three hose configuration to test the concept. A more detailed study of the generation of water-jet thrust force is presented next.|$|R
