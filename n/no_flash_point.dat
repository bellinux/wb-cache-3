40|$|Accurate {{ignitable}} liquid {{flash point}} testing provides {{an important component}} {{in the evaluation of}} a liquid material’s relative flammability danger. Government regulations and industry standards dealing with labeling, warnings, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS’s), and transportation and handling of ignitable liquids are frequently based on the physical property of flash point. “Outgassing ” in flash point testing is the condition in a flash point test in which nonflammable components of a liquid mixture tend to inert the vapor space being tested, while the evolution of gasses to the atmosphere outside the test cup are ignitable. Outgassing can mask the true flammable nature of a substance. When outgassing occurs during flash point testing, products capable of producing dangerously flammable atmospheres are frequently listed as having <b>no</b> <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> and thereby are classified as non-flammable.

40|$|Flammability is an {{important}} factor of safe practices for handling and storage of liquid mixtures and for the evaluation of the precise level of risk. <b>Flash</b> <b>point</b> is a major property used to determine the fire and explosion hazards of a liquid, and it is defined as the minimum temperature at which the vapor present over the liquid at equilibrium forms a flammable mixture when mixed with air. Experimental tests for the complete composition range of a mixture are time consuming, whereas a mixture <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> can be estimated using a computational method and available information. The information needed for mixture <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> predictions are flashpoints, vapor pressures, and activity coefficients as functions of temperature for each mixture component. Generally, sufficient experimental data are unavailable and other ways of determining the basic information are needed. A procedure to evaluate the <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> of binary mixtures is proposed, which provides techniques {{that can be used to}} estimate a parameter that is needed for binary mixture <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> evaluations. Minimum <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> behavior (MFPB) is exhibited when the <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> of the mixture is below the <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> of the individual components of the mixture. The identification of this behavior is critical, because a hazardous situation results from taking the lowest component <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> value as the mixture <b>flash</b> <b>point.</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>point</b> predictions were performed for 14 binary mixtures using various Gex models for the activity coefficients. Quantum chemical calculations and UNIFAC, a theoretical model that does not require experimental binary interaction parameters, are employed in the mixture <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> predictions, which are validated with experimental data.

40|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>point</b> is an {{important}} property of chemical compounds that is widely used to evaluate flammability hazard. However, {{there is often a}} significant gap between the demand for experimental <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> data and their availability. Furthermore, the determination of <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> is difficult and costly, particularly for some toxic, explosive, or radioactive compounds. The development of a reliable and widely applicable method to predict <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> is therefore essential.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Flash</b> <b>point</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{physical}} and chemical properties used to determine the fire and explosion hazards of liquids; therefore, the prediction of <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> is an important safety consideration. However, the study on <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> and the correlation between <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> and pressure has been inadequate, and needs further investigation. So in this paper, the experimental method is adopted to study the correlation between the closed <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> temperature of RP- 5 Aviation Kerosene and low pressure environment. In the experiments, use the BS- 1 closed bomb apparatus to measure the oil samples and use the hypobaric chamber to change the environment pressure from 50 kPa to 101. 3 kPa. Through the experiment data, it indicates that the atmospheric pressure is much lower than the normal atmosphere, there is a quadratic function relation between the reciprocal Aviation Kerosene’s <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> and logarithm of environment pressure, therefore the relationship between the reciprocal Aviation Kerosene’s <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> and altitude is reciprocal. Compared the experiment results with theoretical results, it finds that the experiment result is closed to reality. The experiment results will provide the scientific data for the safety of aircraft tank, and benefit the fire protection, such as inflammable liquid production, transport, storage et al in oil pipeline management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Good {{correlations}} between normal boiling <b>points</b> and <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> of Si-organic and Ge-organic com-pounds have been found. These correlations are discussed and compared with known boiling-point=flash-point correlations for organic compounds. Since boiling point data {{are often not}} available, application of molecular-similarity methods for the estimation of <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> of query compounds from <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> of structurally related source compounds in a database have been explored. Relationships, called quantitative source-target differences (QSTDs), that allow the estimation of a query (new target) from database compounds (source com-pounds) have been developed. For example, the QSTD relationship, TffR 4 Geg=C = 19 : 0474 + 0 : 9149 TffR 4 Sig=C (m = 13; r = 0 : 9832); allows the estimation of the <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> (Tf) of a Ge-organic compound from the known <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> of the analogous compound that contains a Si atom instead of a Ge atom, but otherwise has the same molecular structure as the query. Further, QSTDs to estimate <b>flash</b> <b>points</b> of Si-organic compounds from related Si-organic compounds are presented. The QSTD approach additionally allows to predict lower and upper boundary values between which the true <b>flash</b> <b>point</b> of a query compound will be found with high probability.
