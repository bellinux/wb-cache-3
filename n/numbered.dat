Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership of the fleet, the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the fleet as a compromise.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the concept of}} (computational) verb <b>number</b> and arithmetical {{operations}} of verb <b>numbers</b> are presented.

The arithmetic for verb <b>numbers</b> and its rules are presented and proved. If host computational verbs degrade to BE, then verb <b>numbers</b> collapse to real <b>numbers,</b> interval <b>numbers,</b> fuzzy <b>numbers</b> (sets) or other <b>numbers.</b> The set of all verb <b>numbers</b> can be a metric space. The distance between verb <b>numbers</b> can be defined based on the collapses of verb <b>numbers.</b> The cases when verb <b>numbers</b> collapse to triangular fuzzy <b>numbers,</b> trapezoidal fuzzy <b>numbers</b> and interval <b>numbers</b> are presented and proved. The method of constructing verb <b>numbers</b> from fuzzy <b>numbers</b> is presented. c Yang's Scientific Research Institute, LLC. All rights reserved...|$|R
