The research is based on the results obtained in an experimental programme composed of 84 fracture specimens, combining the two materials and 7 different notch radii varying from 0. 15 mm up to 10 mm. The <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> is analysed through the evolution of the apparent fracture toughness and the application of the Theory of the Critical Distances.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> in two ferritc–pearlitic steels: S 275 JR and S 355 J 2. The research is based on the development and analysis of an experimental programme composed of 336 CT specimens, combining 6 different notch radii, and testing temperatures from the lower shelf up to the upper shelf of the two materials. The <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> is analysed through the evolution of both the load bearing capacity and the apparent fracture toughness, and also through the relation between these two variables and the failure micromechanisms. The results reveal a clear <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> in both materials. In the case of the load bearing capacity, this <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> has its maximum at lower shelf temperatures.

Thus, caused by the <b>notch</b> <b>effect,</b> there are induced peaks of stress in the matrix which weaken the material. With rounded ends, the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> at the fiber end can be considerably reduced and the mechanical properties of the composite are improved. With enlarged fiber-ends a form closure between the fiber and the matrix can be achieved.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} the theoretical analysis of isotope <b>effect</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{as a function}} of transition temperature in two orbital per site model Hamiltonian in iron based superconducting system. The expression of isotope <b>effect</b> <b>coefficient</b> has been computed numerically and self-consistently by employing Green's function technique within the BCS-mean-field approximation. It is observed that the isotope <b>effect</b> <b>coefficient</b> increases with the increase of the hybridization while with the increase in Coulomb interaction it starts decreasing. On increasing the carrier density per site in two orbital per site iron pnictide system, isotope <b>effect</b> <b>coefficient</b> (α) exhibits large values (much higher than BCS limit) at lower temperatures. While in the underdoped case, isotope <b>effect</b> <b>coefficient</b> shows minimum value in superconducting states of the iron based systems.

This old concept has been recently modeled using sound mechanical principles to properly quantify the influence of the stress gradient around the notch tip on the fatigue behavior of mechanically short cracks. This model can be used to calculate q values from the basic fatigue resistances of the material, its fatigue limit and its crack propagation threshold, considering all the characteristics of the notch geometry and of the loading. This model predictions have been validated by proper tests, and based on this experimental evidence a criterion to accept tolerable short cracks has been proposed.

40|$|Deterioration {{of fatigue}} {{properties}} of weathering steels {{is a serious}} problem of operating life of engineering components subjected to corrosion and cyclic loads. There are two possible mechanisms of damage, which are discussed in literature. There is an effect of surface roughening, which develops during corrosion, and an effect of corrosion cracks, which can influence the fatigue crack initiation. The paper contains results of an experimental determination of fatigue life of ATMOFIX 52 A grade steel with a corroded surface and comparison with the fatigue strength of basic smooth material. The <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> of corrosion dimples, which initiated fatigue cracks, was determined on the basis of fractographic observation and numerical evaluation of stress concentration.

40|$|While a long stable crack {{propagation}} phase was observed during experiments of complex welded components, very conservative {{assessments of the}} fatigue life were achieved in the past. The difference was explained by the stress gradient occurring over the plate thickness. This paper deals with numerical {{crack propagation}} simulations which were performed for different geometrical variants. The variants differ related to global geometry, boundary conditions and weld shape. The analyses aim to investigate how the crack propagation is altered if the structural configuration gets more complex. In conclusion, the stress gradient over the plate thickness, the apparent plate thickness and the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> slows down the crack propagation rate if the same stress value being effective for fatigue appears at the weld toe. Thereby, the load-carrying grade of the weld, the weld flank angle and the geometrical configuration {{have an impact on}} both the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> and the local stress concentration...|$|R

40|$|When the {{structural}} integrity of notched components is analysed, {{it is generally}} assumed that notches behave as cracks, something which generally provides overconservative results. The proposal of this paper consists, on the one hand, {{in the application of}} the theory of critical distances for the estimation of the notch fracture toughness and, therefore, for the conversion of the notched situation into an equivalent cracked situation in which the material develops a higher fracture resistance. On the other hand, once the notch fracture toughness has been defined, the assessment is performed using the failure assessment diagram methodology, and assuming that the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> on the limit load is negligible. The methodology has been applied to 336 CT notched fracture specimens made of two different structural steels, covering temperatures from the corresponding lower shelf up to the upper shelf, providing satisfactory results and a noticeable reduction in the overconservatism derived from the analyses in which the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> is not considered...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} protect the {{patterned}} mask from contamination during lithography process, pellicle has become a critical component for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology. According to EUV pellicle requirements, the pellicle should have high EUV transmittance and robust mechanical property. In this study, silicon nitride, which is well-known for its remarkable mechanical property, was used as a pellicle membrane material to achieve high EUV transmittance. Since long silicon wet etching process time aggravates <b>notching</b> <b>effect</b> causing stress concentration on the edge or corner of etched structure, the remaining membrane is prone to fracture at the end of etch process. To overcome this <b>notching</b> <b>effect</b> and attain high transmittance, we began preparing a rather thick (200 nm) SiNx membrane which can be stably manufactured and was thinned into 43 nm thickness with HF wet etching process. The measured EUV transmittance shows similar values to the simulated result. Therefore, the result shows possibilities of HF thinning processes for SiNx EUV pellicle fabrication. ? ??? ?? ??

The wave-like distribution of the load amplitude along the longitudinal axis of the UFTS specimens with a maximum in the minimum cross-section (at about the half length) of the sample permits a selective testing of the different weld zones (weld seam, heat-affected zone and base metal). In addition, the influence of microscopic and macroscopic <b>notch</b> <b>effects</b> on the VHCF behaviour was analysed systematically for a precipitation-hardened Al-alloy in different heat-treatment conditions, representing the different zones of a welded joint. “Artificially” notched and heat-treated samples with the same notch factor compared to the weld reinforcement represent the macroscopic <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> of the welded joint. A comparison of VHCF results of the welded samples with those based on notched specimens is presented and discussed. The weld metal with its various welding defects proved to be the weakest link of the joint structures, provided the reinforcement is trimmed.

40|$|Austenitic steels {{are among}} the {{stainless}} steels the most common used type of material to produce sheet metal parts which can be manufactured by laser beam cutting in a useful manner. However, {{the use of this}} technique to manufacture structural thick parts is restricted due to the creation of macroscopic defects and the lack of reliable fatigue strength data. In this context, the fatigue behavior of sheet-like samples made of metastable austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 cut by laser beam is discussed in this paper. The analyses showed that laser beam cutting creates three kinds of macroscopic defects, which are a pronounced relief-like structure along the cut surface, burr in the underside of the cut edge and pores in the interface between the recast layer and base material or inside the recast layer. As a consequence, the fatigue strength of parts cut by laser beam is 40 % lower in comparison to specimens in a macroscopically quasi defect-free state. An evaluation of the fatigue results based on comprehensive fractographic analyses allows to explain the reasons for distinct differences between the aforementioned influence factors. The most significant reduction of fatigue life is attributed to the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> of the burr, followed by the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> created by pores, while the influence of the surface relief is of minor significance...|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to study <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> to the fatigue life. The thesis describes the stress concentration present on the notched specimen and its effect to the fatigue life on the specimen. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of both smooth and notched specimen was developed by using the computer aided drawing software, SOLIDWORK 2012. The finite element analysis on the stress distribution was then performed by utilizing MSC NASTRAN. The maximum stress for specimens also was found by calculation using formula. The fatigue lives of both smooth and notched specimens were predicted by calculation using stress-life approach.
