It is accepted that this list is incomplete and more bouts could be added in future, or changed.|$|E
5|$|Despite much speculation, {{there is}} <b>no</b> <b>definitive</b> {{explanation}} of either Linnaeus fils or Herbert's thinking.

The Latin word equestris (of a knight, or horseman) may have been confused with equi (of a horse), or possibly Herbert was making a literary Knight's Move on the Linnaean term. The flower name has even been compared to the mediaeval weapon, the spoked mace or Morning Star which it superficially resembles.|$|E

5|$|The great {{northern}} tilefish has {{a unique}} burrowing behavior and habitat preference. In addition to their unique habitat choice, golden tilefish display sexually dimorphic growth with males growing to larger sizes and are behaviorally dominant over their female counterparts. The {{great northern tilefish}} is not a migratory fish; it stays in one local area that fits its needs all year round. Seasonal migration may occur with changes in the water temperatures around the Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank during the winter or spring, but this theory has <b>no</b> <b>definitive</b> evidence. A competing theory suggests that tilefish may instead reduce their activity or hibernate within their burrows during times of cold temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The last notable {{members of}} the family are {{mentioned}} in Constantinople during the early centuries of the Ottoman Empire, as with Michael or Mozalos Gabras, active ca. 1555–65, or Cyril Gabras, megas skeuophylax of the Patriarchate in 1604. Other family members are attested in Crete and the Aegean islands. Thus an unnamed Gabras held lands in Santorini in the early 17th century; and numerous Gabrades are to be found at Chios and in Crete, especially around Siteia, until the early 19th century. For Crete in particular, it has been often supposed, although with <b>no</b> <b>definitive</b> evidence, that the local Gabrades came directly from the Pontus.|$|E
5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered <b>no</b> <b>definitive</b> theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils.|$|E

5|$|<b>No</b> <b>definitive</b> {{antidote}} is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E
5|$|Rome {{typically}} employed four legions each year, each {{consisting of}} 4,000 foot soldiers and 200 cavalry. Perceiving the Carthaginian army {{as a real}} threat, {{for the first time}} ever the Senate introduced eight legions, each consisting of 5,000 foot soldiers and 300 cavalry, with allied troops numbering the same amount of foot soldiers but 900 cavalry per legion-- more than triple the legion numbers. Eight legions--some 40,000 Roman soldiers and an estimated 2,400 cavalry--formed the core of this massive new army. However, some have suggested that the destruction of an army of 90,000 troops would be impossible. They argue that Rome probably had 48,000 troops and 6,000 cavalry against Hannibal's 35,000 troops and 10,000 cavalry. Livy quotes one source stating the Romans added only 10,000 men to their usual army. While <b>no</b> <b>definitive</b> number of Roman troops exists, all sources agree that the Carthaginians faced a considerably larger foe.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of mountain ranges bordering the Mediterranean are conducive for severe weather and thunderstorms, with the sloped nature of mountainous regions permitting {{the development of}} convective activity. Although the {{geography of}} the Mediterranean region, {{as well as its}} dry air, typically prevent the formation of tropical cyclones, when certain meteorological circumstances arise, difficulties influenced by the region's geography are overcome. The occurrence of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea is generally extremely rare, with an average of 1.57forming annually and merely 99recorded occurrences of tropical-like storms discovered between 1948 and 2011 in a modern study, with <b>no</b> <b>definitive</b> trend in activity in that period. Few medicanes form during the summer season, though activity typically rises in autumn, peaks in January, and gradually decreases from February to May. In the western Mediterranean region of development, approximately 0.75such systems form each year, compared to 0.32in the Ionian Sea region.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human activity on the site pre-dating the Iron Age, {{as far back as}} 8,0006,000BC. During this period Mellor may have been a knap site where flint tools were produced, and also may have been a seasonal camp. Over 200lithics have been recovered and range from the early to the late Mesolithic. A high proportion of the flints are bladed tools, indicating that the people who produced them were hunter gatherers. Bronze Age artefacts are rare on the site, and there is <b>no</b> <b>definitive</b> indication of habitation in this period. Despite this, {{it is likely that the}} long-term habitation of the site had its roots in the late Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|Venus (0.7 AU {{from the}} Sun) is close {{in size to}} Earth (0.815 Earth masses) and, like Earth, has a thick {{silicate}} mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752°F), most likely due {{to the amount of}} greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. <b>No</b> <b>definitive</b> evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is <b>no</b> <b>definitive</b> evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
