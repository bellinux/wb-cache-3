5|$|BMC {{was active}} at {{two of the}} {{traditional}} season-opening races, attaining seventh place with Ballan in the Italian opener Trofeo Laigueglia, and eighth with Quinziato in the Belgian opener, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Ballan narrowly missed victory a week later at Montepaschi Strade Bianche, finishing second at the line behind Philippe Gilbert. Ballan acknowledged that Gilbert and <b>not</b> <b>he</b> had used the optimal tactics in the final sprint, but felt nonetheless pleased with his early-season form. The two {{had been part of}} a 19-rider group that made all the selections through the sectors of unpaved roads before the finish on cobblestones in Siena.|$|E
5|$|Christian Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, {{and offered}} an alternative. He argued that, if Malcolm does prove the {{necessary}} {{existence of the}} greatest possible being, it follows {{that there is a}} being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in some worlds is not surpassed. It does <b>not,</b> <b>he</b> argued, demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in this world.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the libido was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E
5|$|During {{subsequent}} {{discussions with}} a US consular official, Terrazas gave conflicting answers {{as to whether}} or <b>not</b> <b>he</b> had truly intended to abandon his rights as a US citizen when he applied for his certificate of Mexican nationality. The State Department eventually concluded that he had lost his US citizenship, a decision which Terrazas appealed, first before the State Department's board of appellate review, and subsequently to the courts.|$|E
5|$|During the Red Scare, {{psychology}} professor Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused of}} being a Communist. San Diego representatives persuaded the California legislature along with Governor Earl Warren to attempt to remove him from his teaching position. After the State Board of Education was unable to get an answer from Steinmetz about whether or <b>not</b> <b>he</b> was a Communist, he was dismissed on February 5, 1954. He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E

5|$|Gjems-Onstad's {{cooperation}} with Hagen was however not to last. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party, {{and he had}} by mid-year not decided whether or <b>not</b> <b>he</b> wanted to run for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party {{at the start of}} October. After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent.|$|E
5|$|Hugh may {{not have}} {{attended}} the coronation of King Henry II of England and his queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Some sources place him at the coronation, others do <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> also {{did not attend the}} Council of Clarendon in 1164 that issued the Constitutions of Clarendon, that was the cause of the quarrel between the king and Thomas Becket. In the ensuing dispute between the king and Becket, Hugh did not take sides. He was, however, present with Roger de Pont L'Evêque the Archbishop of York at the coronation of the king's eldest son Henry the Young King in 1170, and consequently was suspended by Alexander III. The coronation of the Young King eventually led to Becket's martyrdom in December 1170.|$|E

Smith said that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo's, a nightclub in Handsworth, and that when they left some time later, Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as a Teddy Boy, with whom she had argued at the Kerryman. Smith said that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that she told him she did <b>not,</b> <b>he</b> said he then left her.|$|E

While Jack is deciding whether or <b>not</b> <b>he</b> will stand up to his new bosses, Karen (Megan Mullally) desires a baby of her own.

5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks whether or <b>not</b> <b>he</b> should compare his beloved {{to the summer}} season, and argues {{that he should not}} because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were not protected by the Termination Act, so they were lost. Stewart did note that this would have also made the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it or <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E

On January 11, 2013, Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee, without announcing whether or <b>not</b> <b>he</b> would run.
