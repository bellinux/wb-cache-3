5|$|Routine {{home care}} {{is the most}} common level of care provided. In spite of its title, routine home care does not {{indicate}} a location of care, but a level (or intensity) of care provided. Routine care may be provided at a nursing home or assisted living facility, although the majority of hospice patients are treated at home. Interdisciplinary team members supply a variety of services during routine home care, including offering necessary supplies, such as durable medical equipment, medications related to the hospice diagnosis and incidentals like diapers, bed pads, gloves, and skin protectants. Twenty-four-hour on-call services must be available as needed. Typically this is provided after <b>normal</b> <b>business</b> <b>hours</b> by a registered nurse prepared to address urgent patient concerns.|$|E

5000|$|The {{service was}} run by General Electric Information Services (GEIS, now GXS) based in Rockville, Maryland. GEIS served a diverse set of large-scale, international, {{commercial}} network-based custom application needs, including banking, electronic data interchange and e-mail services to companies worldwide, but was able to run GEnie on their many GE Mark III time-sharing mainframe computers that {{otherwise would have been}} underutilized after <b>normal</b> U.S. <b>business</b> <b>hours.</b> This orientation was part of GEnie's downfall. Although it became very popular and a national force in the on-line marketplace, GEnie was not allowed to grow. GEIS executives steadfastly refused to view the service as anything but [...] "fill in" [...] load and would not expand the network by a single phone line, let alone expand mainframe capacity, to accommodate GEnie's growing user base. (Later, however, GE did consent to make the service available through the SprintNet time-sharing network, which had its own dial-up points of presence; an Internet-to-SprintNet gateway operated by Merit Network also made the text-based parts of the service available through telnet.) ...|$|R

40|$|Deregulation is haltingly {{changing}} the United States electricity markets. The resulting uncertainty and/or rising energy costs can be hedged by generating electricity on-site and other benefits, such as use of otherwise wasted heat, can be captured. The Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) of 1978 first invited relatively small-scale generators ({ge} 1 MW) into the electricity market. The advent of efficient and reliable small scale and renewable equipment has spurred {{an industry that}} has, in recent years, made even smaller (business scale) electricity generation an economically viable option for some consumers. On-site energy capture and/or conversion, known as distributed energy resources (DER), offers consumers many benefits, such as economic savings and price predictability, improved reliability, control over power quality, and emissions reductions. Despite these benefits, DER adoption can be a daunting move to a customer accustomed to simply paying a monthly utility bill. San Diego {{is in many ways}} an attractive location for DER development: It has high electricity prices typical of California and a moderate climate i. e. energy loads are consistent throughout the year. Additionally, the price shock to San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) customers during the summer of 2000 has interested many in alternatives to electricity price vulnerability. This report examines the business case for DER at the San Diego biotechnology supply company, BD Biosciences Pharmingen, which considered DER for a building with 200 - 300 kW base-load, much of which accommodates the refrigerators required to maintain chemicals. Because of the Mediterranean climate of the San Diego area and the high rate of air changes required due to on-site use of chemicals, modest space heating is required throughout the year. Employees work in the building during <b>normal</b> weekday <b>business</b> <b>hours,</b> and daily peak loads are typically about 500 kW...|$|R

2500|$|Other {{cities and}} towns in Massachusetts began issuing {{applications}} during <b>normal</b> <b>business</b> <b>hours.</b> Boston Mayor Thomas Menino greeted three of the couples who were plaintiffs in Goodridge and said: [...] "We've broken down the barrier. I am so proud of these people. I am very proud to be mayor of this city today." [...] The first to marry in Boston City Hall were Tom Weikle and Joe Rogers, who lined up for their license application at 5:30a.m. and were wed about 11 a.m. by Boston's city clerk. Rejecting the governor's insistence that the 1913 statute be respected, Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone addressed a crowd of same-sex couples that included several from New York gathered in front of Town Hall at 8 am.: [...] "No matter who you are or where you come from, if you fill out the application, you {{will be given a}} license to marry. Those of you from out of state, welcome to Somerville." [...] The seven couples who were party to the Goodridge lawsuit were all wed on May 17, beginning with Robert Compton and David Wilson at Boston's Arlington Street Church. There were sizable celebrations in Northampton, Worcester, and Provincetown, while [...] "explicit protests were scattered and few".|$|E

2500|$|Land {{ambulance}} service provision {{is funded by}} the national government, and provided by means of one of the four Regional Health Authorities (Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, Southern Norway Regional Health Authority, Western Norway Regional Health Authority, and Northern Norway Regional Health Authority) which provide most healthcare in Norway. [...] Services may be provided directly by the Trust or its member hospitals, but are typically outsourced. [...] In many locations in Norway, the provision of land {{ambulance service}} is contracted to private operators, most typically large scale transportation companies operating a variety of types of service. [...] Namsos Trafikkselskap (NTS) {{is an example of a}} private company participating in this type of arrangement for service delivery. [...] While the majority of such arrangements are currently with Norwegian-based companies, this is changing, and international companies, such as Falck are beginning to contract for services in some areas. [...] Such services may operate 24 hours per day in larger centers, but in remote and rural locations are still frequently staffed by 'on-call' personnel after <b>normal</b> <b>business</b> <b>hours.</b> [...] Even in areas with directly operated emergency ambulances, non-emergency transportation is more likely to be conducted by commercial transportation companies.
