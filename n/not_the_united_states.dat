25|$|Informally, a {{national}} recession {{is a period}} of declining economic output. In a 1974 New York Times article, Julius Shiskin suggested several rules of thumb to identify a recession, which included two successive quarterly declines in gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the nation's output. This two-quarter metric is now a commonly held definition of a recession. In the United States, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is regarded as the authority which identifies a recession and which takes into account several measures in addition to GDP growth before making an assessment. In many developed nations (but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States),</b> the two-quarter rule is also used for identifying a recession.|$|E

On 13 November 2009, NASA confirmed that water was detected after the Centaur impacted the crater. The LCROSS [...] "Centaur" [...] kinetic energy impactor was underpowered and therefore only partially successful, having not produced the expected earth visible flash, nor succeeding in excavating and vaporizing enough subsurface {{material for a}} complete lunar soil spectral analysis, that would identify the lunar soil composition to a great depth.|$|E

He branded himself as a reliant conservative whose campaign was [...] "looking good" [...] due to the base he was attempting to establish in Iowa. The state would hold the nation's first presidential caucus in January 2008. His entrance into the race slightly increased voter's recognition of [...] "Thompson" [...] in polls but pollsters stated that this increase was most likely attributed to the exposure of potential candidate Fred Thompson. He remained at 2% in presidential polls, in sixth place overall behind potential candidates Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson, but ahead of declared candidates Ron Paul, Jim Gilmore, Tom Tancredo, Sam Brownback, Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee. Statewide polls placed Thompson at 24% {{in his home state}} of Wisconsin, which was considerably higher than the marks achieved by other lower tiered candidates in their home states. [...] Upon his entrance, the candidate set forth his position on the War in Iraq, holding that as president, he would allow Iraqis to vote on whether or <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> military should remain in the nation. He stated that if the Iraqis [...] "don't want us there...we should get out." ...|$|E

[...] The {{question of whether or}} <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Supreme Court had jurisdiction over this issue arose. [...] In an effort to argue against the Supreme Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings, the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of certiorari. [...] This request for judicial review, upon writ of error, was denied. [...] The court held that a conviction for murder, punishable with death, was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment. [...] The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
2500|$|Nicaraguan {{migration}} to Costa Rica has occurred since the mid-19th century. Unlike other Latin American countries, Nicaraguan migrants' primary destination is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> it is Costa Rica. An estimated 10% [...] (400,000 - 600,000) of the Costa Rican population {{is made up}} of Nicaraguans; some of them migrate for seasonal work opportunities and then return to their country. Costa Rica and Nicaragua signed an agreement regulating seasonal migration in 1998; it allows Nicaraguans with work permits to enter Costa Rica at the western border at Peñas Blancas on the Pan-American Highway. In the northern part of Costa Rica there are 200,000 Nicaraguans and the Catholic Church in this area has an active program {{to protect the rights of}} migrant workers.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1959, the Federal Mines Department {{approved}} Project Oilsand. However, {{before the}} project could continue beyond preliminary steps, the Canadian government's {{stance on the}} use of nuclear devices changed. In April 1962, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs said [...] "Canada is opposed to nuclear tests, period". These 1962 changes in Canadian public opinion is regarded by historian Michael Payne to be due to the shift in public perception of nuclear explosives following the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Project Oilsand was subsequently cancelled. Prime Minister John Diefenbaker told Parliament that the decision to detonate an atomic bomb on or under Canadian soil would be made by Canada, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> and ordered Project Cauldron/Oilsand placed on permanent hold, citing the risk of upsetting the Soviet Union during nuclear disarmament negotiations being conducted in Geneva.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Panama Canal Zone {{was legally}} a leased {{territory}} of the United States until {{the implementation of the}} Torrijos-Carter Treaties in 1979, questions arose almost from its inception as to whether it was considered part of the United States for constitutional purposes, or, in the phrase of the day, whether the Constitution followed the flag. In 1901 the US Supreme Court had ruled in Downes v. Bidwell that unincorporated territories are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> On July 28, 1904, Controller of the Treasury Robert Tracewell stated, [...] "While the general spirit and purpose of the Constitution is applicable to the zone, that domain is {{not a part of the}} United States within the full meaning of the Constitution and laws of the country." [...] Accordingly, the Supreme Court held in 1905 in Rasmussen v. United States that the full Constitution only applies for incorporated territories of the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Clapton formed Darktown Strutters with Ross Andreasen, Mick Bradley, Will Fowler, Dennis Hunter, Ross Lamonde and Ian Peepman. He {{left school}} {{in his final}} year without {{completing}} his mathematics examination. He played guitar while training as a commercial artist in the 1960s. He raised enough money to board ship in 1967 to London where he played with three locals in a pre-punk group, followed by a group with four North Americans who were raided by the police for marijuana importing. Clapton changed his birth name, using the last names of two of his heroes Keith Richards and Eric Clapton. His visa had expired and he moved to Germany, where he played in a band titled Bitch and worked solo in folk clubs and on streets busking. Clapton, as guitarist and vocalist, {{was a member of}} Sopwith Camel (<b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> band of same name), with Burghard Rausch on drums and Michael Günther on bass guitar (both members of krautrock group Agitation Free).

2500|$|The {{following}} Monday, the Queen {{issued a}} statement saying that she would not attempt to amend the constitution except by the means provided in the 1887 constitution. However, the Committee of Safety did not believe her promise was sincere, and continued with their planning. A group of men mostly drawn from the ranks of the Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom formed the Committee of Safety and asked the United States Minister, John L. Stevens, to land troops from the U.S.S. Boston (anchored in Honolulu Harbor) into Honolulu, to protect American lives and property. John L. Stevens, reacting to what he saw as potential unrest as the internal crisis continued, requested the landing of about 160 Marines, who were given specific orders by Captain G. C. Wiltse to [...] "land in Honolulu for the purpose of protecting our legation, consulate, and the lives and property of American citizens, and to assist in preserving public order." [...] At 2:00pm on January 17, 1893, a proclamation was read on the steps of Government building, declaring the monarchy overthrown. U.S. peacekeepers were at the time stationed at Arion Hall, the U.S. Consulate, and the U.S. Legation, under orders of strict neutrality and out of any potential line of fire between the Provisional Government and Royalist forces. The Queen abdicated under protest ostensibly [...] "to the superior force of the United States government", though her surrender was delivered to the Provisional Government, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> The Kingdom of Hawaii had ended, and a new provisional government was declared.|$|E
