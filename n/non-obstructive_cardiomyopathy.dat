40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increasing}} afterload on early diastolic dysfunction in 10 patients with hypertrophic <b>non-obstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> were studied by computer assisted analyses of digitised M mode echocardiograms. Infusion of angiotensin II increased the end systolic pressure {{by a mean}} (SD) of 36. 2 (10. 3) mm Hg. As the afterload increased early diastolic dysfunction tended to become more normal: the interval and the change in dimension between minimal cavity dimension and mitral valve opening decreased and the duration of rapid diastolic filling and the accompanying change in dimension increased. None the less, the end diastolic dimension and thus the overall diastolic filling remained unchanged. Impaired early diastolic function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is at least partly caused by altered loading conditions...|$|E
40|$|Background Treatment {{options for}} {{patients}} with symptomatic non-obstructive HCM are limited, driving a need to develop novel treatment strategies. Objectives To investigate the effects of biventricular pacing on symptom status and exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic <b>non-obstructive</b> Hypertrophic <b>Cardiomyopathy</b> and explore the mechanism of benefit. Methods 31 patients with symptomatic, exercise limited <b>non-obstructive</b> Hypertrophic <b>Cardiomyopathy</b> were enrolled into this double blind randomised cross over study of Biventricular vs sham pacing. The primary end point was peak oxygen consumption. Results 29 patients successfully completed the study. Biventricular pacemaker therapy increased peak Oxygen consumption (1. 17 ml/kg/min) and improved quality of life, without effects on systolic or diastolic mechanical dyssynchrony. A subset of patients in whom left ventricular diastolic volume fell on exercise (n = 15) achieved a greater increase in peak Oxygen consumption vs. those in whom left ventricular diastolic volume increased (1. 4 vs. 0. 91 ml/kg/min p = 0. 03) and this {{was associated with a}} normalisation of the left ventricular diastolic volume response to exercise. Conclusions Severely symptomatic patients with <b>non-obstructive</b> Hypertrophic <b>Cardiomyopathy</b> may benefit from Biventricular pacing.

40|$|Two {{patients}} with seriously impaired left ventricular function, abnormal left ventricular con-duction on the electrocardiogram, mitral regurgitation, {{and a very}} late systolic click are reported. Idiopathic <b>non-obstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> {{seemed to be the}} cause of the left ventricular dysfunc-tion in both cases. The mitral valve was anatomically normal at the time of operation in one patient, except for dilatation of the annulus, and the mitral regurgitation appeared to be secon-dary to left ventricular failure. The very late timing of the mitral systolic clicks in these two patients may be related to a large left ventricular end-diastolic volume and impaired left ven-tricular function, or to an abnormal sequence of excitation of the left ventricle. The timing of the late systolic click in these patients is in contrast to that in {{patients with}} mid systolic clicks, hearts of normal size, and little cardiac disability. The genesis of mid systolic and late systolic clicks has been controversial. Some authors considered them to be extracardiac and of little significance (Gallavardin, 19 I 3; Thomp-son and Levine, I 935; Johnston, 1938; Wol-ferth and Margolies, I 940; McKusick, 1958; Bleifer et al., I 959).

However, with high quality cardiac imaging with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) becoming increasingly available, it is being increasingly identified. However, asymptomatic patients with a serendipitous diagnosis of IVNC are being discovered, and their prognosis is less clear. We present our consecutive case series of four patients with this condition, and discuss the implications of their clinical presentation in context of the current literature. Methods Four patients in whom a CMR diagnosis of IVNC was established are presented. All CMR studies were performed on a Siemens Sonata 1. 5 T MRI scanner and phased array surface coil. ECG gated trueFISP (fast image with steady state precision) images were performed and analysed off-line with proprietary software. Where transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) had been performed it was retrospectively re-assessed for the diagnosis. Results In none of the four patients was a diagnosis of IVNC confirmed or even suspected until the CMR study. Two of the four patients were asymptomatic and identified serendipitously; aged 21 and 72 years, respectively. The other two presented for the investigation of ventricular dysrhythmias, and one of these had had a previous (incorrect) diagnosis of hypertrophic <b>non-obstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy.</b> Conclusions Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is becoming increasingly identified and the initial poor prognosis described may not represent the true natural history of this condition.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to assess the usefulness of myocardial 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) /computed tomography (CT) for evaluating myocardial metabolic status in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the therapeutic efficacy of alcohol septal ablation (ASA) in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Thirty HCM patients (64. 4 ± 10. 5 years, 14 male, 12 hypertrophic <b>non-obstructive</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> [HNCM], 16 HOCM, and 2 dilated phase of HCM) underwent 18 F-FDG-PET/CT. 18 F-FDG uptake was semi-quantitatively evaluated using an uptake score in each 17 segment and the entire LV or regional standardized uptake value (SUV). 18 F-FDG uptake was observed mostly in a hypertrophied myocardium in HNCM patients, whereas 18 F-FDG was extensively accumulated beyond the hypertrophied myocardium in HOCM patients. There was a positive correlation between the summed uptake score of 18 F-FDG and high-sensitive troponin T level in HNCM patients (r = 0. 603, p = 0. 049), whereas the score was positively correlated with brain natriuretic peptide level (r = 0. 614, p = 0. 011) in HOCM patients. In 10 patients who received ASA, the maximum SUV of the entire LV was significantly reduced from 5. 6 ± 2. 6 to 3. 2 ± 2. 1 (p = 0. 040) after ASA. Reduction of that maximum SUV was particularly significant in the lateral region (from 5. 5 ± 2. 6 to 2. 9 ± 2. 2, p = 0. 024) but not significant in the anteroseptal region (from 4. 5 ± 2. 6 to 2. 9 ± 1. 6, p = 0. 12).

Seventeen patients with non-obstructive HCM (mean age 71 years) were investigated by Doppler echocardiography, before and after oral treatment with verapamil (mean daily doses: 335 mg). Diagnosis was based on clinical and echocardiographic data. Mitral regurgitation was absent or mild. Heart rate, PQ interval and mitral regurgitation did not change after treatment. All calculated values of Doppler LV filling improved significantly: corrected relaxation time, ratio of atrial to early velocity, EF slope and pressure half-time (P < 0. 005) showed more significant differences than more sophisticated indices using time-velocity integrals of Doppler LF filling flow (P < 0. 005). Results appear to reflect an effect of verapamil on LV relaxation; a slight effect of a modified load was nevertheless not excluded.

AimTo assess the prevalence of mitral valve chordal rupture in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the clinical, echocardiographic, surgical and histological profiles of those patients. MethodsWe searched for patients with mitral valve chordal rupture diagnosed by echocardiography among all electronic files of patients admitted to our centre for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy between 2000 and 2010. ResultsAmong 580 patients admitted for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, six patients (1 %, 5 men, age 68 – 71 years) presented with mitral valve chordal rupture, symptomatic in five cases, always involving the posterior mitral leaflet. In all cases, echocardiography before rupture showed mitral valve systolic anterior motion, with anterior (and not posterior) leaflet elongation compared with {{a random sample of}} patients with <b>non-obstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (P= 0. 006) (and similar to that observed in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Significant resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was always present before rupture and disappeared after rupture in the five cases requiring mitral valve surgery for severe mitral regurgitation. Histological findings were consistent with extensive myxomatous degeneration in all cases. ConclusionMitral valve chordal rupture is: infrequent in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; occurs in aged patients with obstructive disease; involves, essentially, the posterior mitral leaflet; and causes, in general, severe mitral regurgitation requiring surgery.

BackgroundSome HCM patients have an ABPR to exercise, which may be due to paradoxical peripheral vasodilatation. A similar proportion has paradoxical forearm vasodilatation during central volume unloading using LBNP. These abnormal reflexes may be caused by left ventricular mechanoreceptor activation. Similar mechanisms may also contribute to some cases of vasovagal syncope. MethodsBlood pressure changes were assessed during exercise, and forearm vascular responses and baroreceptor sensitivity were assessed during LBNP using plethysmography. ResultsNine (43 %) patients (group A) had paradoxical vasodilator responses (forearm vascular resistance [FVR] fell by 7. 5 ± 4. 6 U), and 12 (57 %) patients (group B) had normal vasoconstrictor responses during LBNP (FVR increased by 7. 7 ± 4. 9 U). Paroxetine augmented systolic blood pressure (SBP) during exercise in group A (21 ± 6 mm Hg vs. 14 ± 11 mm Hg at baseline, p = 0. 02); no effect was detected in group B.

40|$|AIM To {{determine}} {{the relation between}} the extent and distribution of left ventricular hypertrophy and the degree of disturbance of regional relaxation and global left ventricular filling. METHODS Regional wall thickness (rWT) was measured in eight myocardial regions in 17 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 12 patients with hypertensive heart disease, and 10 age matched normal subjects, and an asymmetry index calculated. Regional relaxation was assessed in these eight regions using regional isovolumetric relaxation time (rIVRT) and early to late peak filling velocity ratio (rE/A) derived from Doppler tissue imaging. Asynchrony of rIVRT was calculated. Doppler left ventricular filling indices were assessed using the isovolumetric relaxation time, the deceleration time of early diastolic filling (E-DT), and the E/A ratio. RESULTS There was a correlation between rWT and both rIVRT and rE/A in the two types of heart disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: r = 0. 47, p < 0. 0001 for rIVRT; r = - 0. 20, p < 0. 05 for rE/A; hypertensive heart disease: r = 0. 21, p < 0. 05 for rIVRT; r = - 0. 30, p = 0. 003 for rE/A). The degree of left ventricular asymmetry was related to prolonged E-DT (r = 0. 50, p = 0. 001) and increased asynchrony (r = 0. 42, p = 0. 002) in all patients combined, but not within individual groups. Asynchrony itself was associated with decreased E/A (r = - 0. 39, p = 0. 01) and protracted E-DT (r = 0. 69, p < 0. 0001) and isovolumetric relaxation time (r = 0. 51, p = 0. 001) in all patients. These correlations were still significant for E-DT in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (r = 0. 56, p = 0. 02) and hypertensive heart disease (r = 0. 59, p < 0. 05) and for isovolumetric relaxation time in <b>non-obstructive</b> hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (n = 8, r = 0. 87, p = 0. 005). CONCLUSIONS Non-invasive ultrasonographic examination of the left ventricle shows that in both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertensive heart disease, the local extent of left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with regional left ventricular relaxation abnormalities. Asymmetrical distribution of left ventricular hypertrophy is indirectly related to global left ventricular early filling abnormalities through regional asynchrony of left ventricular relaxation...|$|R
