50|$|Re{{insurance}} {{can make}} an insurance company's results more predictable by absorbing larger losses and {{reducing the amount of}} capital needed to provide coverage. The risks are diversified, with the reinsurer bearing some of the loss incurred by the insurance company. The income smoothing comes forward as the losses <b>of</b> the <b>cedant</b> are essentially limited. This fosters stability in claim payouts and caps indemnification costs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present results}} {{allowing}} one {{to evaluate the}} cost and the variance reduction <b>of</b> the <b>cedant</b> {{in the framework of}} reinsurance treaties based on order statistics. We compare the efficiency of such treaties with excess of loss covers. Numerical examples show that the best choice may depend on the distribution of the individual claim size, especially on the heaviness of the tail. It may also depend on the premium principles applied by both companies...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{catastrophe}} {{bonds are}} issued by special purpose reinsurance companies domiciled in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, or Ireland. These companies typically participate {{in one or}} more reinsurance treaties to protect buyers, most commonly insurers (called [...] "cedants") or reinsurers (called [...] "retrocedents"). This contract may be structured as a derivative in cases in which it is [...] "triggered" [...] by one or more indices or event parameters (see below), rather than losses <b>of</b> the <b>cedant</b> or retrocedent.|$|R
50|$|On 16 June HMS Herald {{arrived with}} Major Thomas Banbury on board {{bringing}} the Treaty of Waitangi for the South Island chiefs to sign. This {{took place on}} Horahora-Kakahu Island just offshore from the eastern shoreline. The only European to sign the Treaty as one <b>of</b> the <b>cedants,</b> Joseph Thomas, son-in-law of Te Rauparaha's elder brother Nohorua, signed on the 16th. Nouhora himself, initially reluctant to sign, did so on 17 June. A commemorative bronze plaque marking the occasion was unveiled here on 3 October 1964.|$|R

50|$|The {{municipality}} of Vardø {{is centered on}} the town of Vardø, which received its town status from King Christian VII of Norway on 17 July 1789. The year 1789, the Latin motto <b>of</b> the town <b>Cedant</b> tenebræ soli ("Darkness must give way for the sun"), and the descriptive text Vardöensis insignia urbis are all also featured on the shield.|$|R
50|$|The {{ceding company}} may seek surplus {{reinsurance}} {{to limit the}} losses it might incur from {{a small number of}} large claims as a result of random fluctuations in experience. In a 9 line surplus treaty the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the reinsurer (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity <b>of</b> the <b>cedant</b> would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require facultative reinsurance.|$|R
60|$|The story last told {{was said}} to have {{happened}} in the south <b>of</b> Scotland; but <b>cedant</b> arma togae and let the gown have its dues. It was an old clergyman, who had wisdom and firmness enough to resist the panic which seized his brethren, who was the means of rescuing a poor insane creature from the cruel fate which would otherwise have overtaken her. The accounts of the trials for witchcraft form one of the most deplorable chapters in Scottish story.|$|R
50|$|In {{catastrophe}} excess <b>of</b> loss, the <b>cedant's</b> retention {{is usually}} a multiple of the underlying policy limits, and the reinsurance contract usually contains a two risk warranty (i.e. {{they are designed to}} protect the cedant against catastrophic events that involve more than one policy, usually very many policies). For example, an insurance company issues homeowners' policies with limits of up to $500,000 and then buys catastrophe reinsurance of $22,000,000 in excess of $3,000,000. In that case, the insurance company would only recover from reinsurers in the event of multiple policy losses in one event (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, flood).|$|R
