5|$|Indeed, the endosymbiotic {{theory for}} {{the origin of}} organelles sees a form of {{horizontal}} gene transfer as a critical step {{in the evolution of}} eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals. The endosymbiotic theory holds that organelles within the cells of eukorytes such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, had descended from independent bacteria that came to live symbiotically within other cells. It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between mitochondria and bacteria were noted, but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s; Margulis was able to make use of <b>new</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell's nucleus.|$|E
5|$|When Veronica discovers <b>new</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{suggests}} that Lilly's convicted killer is innocent, {{she decides to}} investigate the case. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an 09er party. Veronica, no longer part of the school's wealthy in-crowd, makes some new friends: Wallace, Neptune High basketball star; Weevil, leader of the PCHers, a Latino biker gang; and Mac, Neptune High's resident computer genius. Using her friends' resources, {{as well as those}} provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan, who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death and {{went out of his way}} to harass her.|$|E
25|$|Developments {{in other}} fields of science: DNA {{analysis}} has had an impact in various areas of history either confirming established historical theories or presenting <b>new</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> undermines the current established historical explanation. Professor Andrew Sherratt, a British prehistorian, was responsible for introducing the work of anthropological writings on the consumption of currently legal and illegal drugs {{and how to use}} these papers to explain certain aspects of prehistoric societies. Carbon dating, the examination of ice cores and tree rings, palynology, SEM analysis of early metal samples, and measuring oxygen isotopes in bones, have all provided new data in the last few decades with which to argue new hypotheses. Extracting ancient DNA allows scientists to argue whether or not humans are partly descended from Neanderthals.|$|E

25|$|After a death {{sentence}} is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus, which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal habeas corpus {{is a type of}} collateral review, and {{it is the only way}} that state prisoners may attack a {{death sentence}} in federal court (other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth <b>new</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling. According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal habeas corpus.|$|E

500|$|In her 2015 book Proba the Prophet, Cullhed {{counters}} Shanzer et al.s claims. She {{disputes the}} first argument, noting that [...] "there are no 'grounds for determining {{priority of the}} lines. Regarding the second point, Cullhed notes that the reference to the 387 debate about Easter could have referred to an earlier dispute. About the third point, Cullhed says that many other scholars feel that Jerome would have never insulted Anicia Proba; he praised her as [...] "the richest, noblest and most powerful woman in Rome" [...] in another letter. Regarding the fourth argument, Cullhed notes that Faltonia Betitia Proba's alleged death in AD 351 is unproven. Opposing the fifth point, Cullhed writes that the titles {{used to refer to}} the author could have been inserted during the Middle Ages. Finally, she introduces <b>new</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> if Anicia Proba had written De laudibus Christi, the Latin poet Claudian would have probably mentioned her poetic skills in his 395 panegyric celebrating the joint consulship of her sons Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius and Anicius Probinus. Cullhed summarizes her argument: [...] "The evidence for discrediting Isidore's attribution [...] is not sufficient, and so, I will assume that the cento was written in the mid-fourth century by Faltonia Betitia Proba." [...] Karl Schenkl also argues that scholars should accept Isidore's testimony, which clearly attributes De laudibus Christi to Faltonia Betitia Proba, and today, the general consensus of classicists and scholars is that De laudibus Christi was indeed written by Faltonia Betitia Proba.|$|E

2500|$|The {{archaeologist}} Marija Gimbutas {{based at}} least part of her Kurgan Hypothesis and Old European culture theories on these Cucuteni-Trypillia clay figurines.

However, Gimbutas' theories have been partially discredited by more recent discoveries and analyses. Today there are many scholars who disagree with Gimbutas, pointing to <b>new</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> suggests a much more complex society during the Neolithic era than she had been accounting for.|$|E

2500|$|Following the SJC's {{assertion}} {{that it could}} not order a new trial even if there was <b>new</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> [...] "would justify a different verdict," [...] a movement for [...] "drastic reform" [...] quickly took shape in Boston's legal community. In December 1927, four months after the executions, the Massachusetts Judicial Council cited the Sacco and Vanzetti case as evidence of [...] "serious defects in our methods of administering justice." [...] It proposed a series of changes designed to appeal to both sides of the political divide, including restrictions on the number and timing of appeals. Its principal proposal addressed the SJC's right to review. It argued that a judge would benefit from a full review of a trial, and that no one man should bear the burden in a capital case. A review could defend a judge whose decisions were challenged and make it less likely that a governor would be drawn into a case. It asked for the SJC to have right to order a new trial [...] "upon any ground if the interests of justice appear to inquire it."

2500|$|Since the 2000s, {{scholars}} have brought forward <b>new</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Luang Pu Sodh's approach may [...] have roots [...] in the Yogavacara tradition (also known as tantric Theravada; {{not to be}} confused with the Yogacara School in Mahayana Buddhism). During the revival and modernization of Thai Buddhism in the nineteenth and early twentieth century CE, Thai tempels in the Mahanikaya fraternity were forced to adjust to new reforms, including the meditation method used and taught. In particular, leading monks in the Mahanikaya fraternity promoted the New Burmese method of U Narada and Mahasi Sayadaw. The Dhammakaya meditation method managed to survive despite these pressures to reform. Therefore, Dhammakaya and Yogavacara meditation are both meditation forms that date back before these modernization efforts, and {{scholars have}} theorized that the two disciplines may share a common ancestry. This ancestry would be related to Wat Rajasittharam, the temple where Luang Pu Sodh used to practice before he went on to develop Dhammakaya meditation. An alternative theory suggests an origin in Tibetan or other forms of Mahayana Buddhism, but scholars C.S. Newell and Phibul Choompolpaisal believe a Yogavacara origin to be more likely. Newell notes that some aspects of Dhammakaya meditation cannot be found in Yogavacara practices, and theorizes that Dhammakaya meditation could have been [...] "grafted onto an existing, preparatory system of concentration" [...] and further developed. Theologist Rory Mackenzie does not draw any conclusions about the matter yet, however: he states a Tibetan origin is unlikely, a Yogavacara origin cannot yet be proven, but a new discovery by Luang Pu Sodh is also [...] "quite possible".|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), {{the body}} that {{develops}} Canada's national list of endangered species, assessed Atlantic Cod. COSEWIC's designations in theory are informed by reports it commissions and expert discussion in the panel, and it claims to be scientific and apolitical. Recognising faults in processes is not recreational, but {{an important step in}} their improvement. In this case much was mishandled. One observer opined [...] "this process stinks"; the same observer later joined, and then became Chair of, COSEWIC. COSEWIC listed Atlantic cod as [...] "vulnerable" [...] (this category later renamed [...] "special concern") on a single-unit basis, i.e. assuming a single homogeneous population. The basis (single-unit) of designation and the level (vulnerable) assigned was in contrast to the range of designations including [...] "endangered" [...] for some of the 10 management (sub) units addressed in the report that COSEWIC had commissioned from Dr. K.N.I. Bell. That contradiction between the report and the listing reflected political pressure from the DFO; such bureaucratic pressure had been evident through three years of drafts. The 1998 designation followed on from a deferral in 1997 and bureaucratic tactics including what one COSEWIC insider characterised as [...] "a plan to make it late". Press interest prior to the 1998 meeting had, however, likely deterred a further deferral. COSEWIC's 'single unit' basis of listing was at the behest of DFO, despite that DFO itself had previously in criticism demanded (properly, given the <b>new</b> <b>evidence)</b> <b>that</b> the report address multiple stocks. The author had agreed with that criticism and revised accordingly, but DFO then changed its mind without explanation. By the time of COSEWIC's 1998 cod discussion, the Chair had been ousted for having said [...] "I have seen a lot of status reports ... t is as good as I have ever seen in regards to content", and COSEWIC had already attempted to unilaterally alter the 1998 report. The report remains one of an undeclared number that are illegally suppressed (COSEWIC refuses to officially release it unless it can change it [...] "so that it ... reflects COSEWIC's designation"), in this case despite kudos from eminent reviewers of COSEWIC's own choice. COSEWIC in defense asserted a right to alter the report or that Bell had been asked to provide a report that supported COSEWIC's designation; either defense would involve clear violations of ethics, of COSEWIC's procedures at the time, and of the norms of science. The key tactics used to avert any at-risk listing centered on the issue of stock discreteness, and DFO's single-stock stance within COSEWIC contradicted the multiple-stock hypothesis supported by the most recent science (including DFO's, hence DFO's earlier and proper demand that the report address these). Bell has argued that this contradiction between fact and tactic effectively painted management into a corner from which it could not acknowledge or explain the contrast between areas where conservation measures were clearly needed and areas where opposite observations were gaining press attention. In effect, DFO's opposition to a listing compromised its ability to carry out its conservation mandate.|$|E
