5|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>selection</b> acts on the phenotype, or the {{observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> is a key process {{in the evolution of}} a population. <b>Natural</b> <b>selection</b> can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> there is no intentional choice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>selection</b> can act on any {{heritable}} phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does not imply that <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E

5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended <b>natural</b> <b>selection.</b> In it, he proposed the hypothesis that <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E

5|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>selection</b> {{is one of}} the {{cornerstones}} {{of modern}} biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of <b>Natural</b> <b>Selection,</b> which described <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> originally developed {{in the absence of a}} valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.|$|E

5|$|The Mendelian and biometrician {{models were}} {{eventually}} reconciled {{with the development}} of population genetics. A key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of <b>Natural</b> <b>Selection,</b> Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> could change gene frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J. B. S. Haldane, applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of <b>natural</b> <b>selection,</b> such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths, and showed that <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> worked at an even faster rate than Fisher assumed.|$|E
5|$|This teleonomy is {{the quality}} whereby the process of <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> creates and {{preserves}} traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform.

The four most widely recognised evolutionary processes are <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> (including sexual selection), genetic drift, mutation and gene migration due to genetic admixture. <b>Natural</b> <b>selection</b> and genetic drift sort variation; mutation and gene migration create variation.|$|E

5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of <b>natural</b> <b>selection,</b> which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of <b>natural</b> <b>selection,</b> called K-selection.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{coloration}} provided important early {{evidence for}} evolution by <b>natural</b> <b>selection,</b> {{at a time}} when little direct evidence was available.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{selection}} can {{be classified}} according to the resource being competed for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. Ecological selection is <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> via any means other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.|$|E
40|$|The (standard) {{randomization}} {{method is}} an attractive alternative for the transient analysis of continuous time Markov models. The main advantages of the method are numerical stability, well-controlled computation error, and ability to specify the computation error in advance. However, {{the fact that the}} method can be computationally very expensive limits its applicability. In this paper, we develop a new method called split regenerative randomization, which, having the same good properties as standard randomization, can be significantly more efficient. The method covers reliability-like models with a particular but quite general structure and requires the selection of a subset of states and a regenerative state satisfying some conditions. For a class of continuous time Markov models, model class C_ 2, including typical failure/repair reliability-like models with exponential failure and repair time distributions and deferred repair, <b>natural</b> <b>selections</b> are available for both the subset of states and the regenerative state and, for those <b>natural</b> <b>selections,</b> theoretical results are available assessing the efficiency of the method in terms of “visible” model characteristics. Those results can be used to anticipate when the method can be expected to be competitive. We illustrate the application of the method using a large class C_ 2 model and show that for models in that class the method can indeed be significantly more efficient than previously available randomization-based methodsPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|R

5|$|Frank Evers Beddard's 1892 book, Animal Coloration, {{acknowledged}} that <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> existed but examined {{its application to}} camouflage, mimicry and sexual selection very critically. The book was in turn roundly criticised by Poulton.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, after {{studying}} butterfly coloration, Theodor Eimer (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of <b>Natural</b> <b>Selection</b> in Species Formation. Eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance {{that would be}} difficult to explain by <b>natural</b> <b>selection.</b> To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. Eimer linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book Organic Evolution as the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics According to the Laws of Organic Growth. He used examples such as the evolution of the horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> could not create new species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Charles Darwin {{formulated}} the scientific {{theory of evolution}} by <b>natural</b> <b>selection,</b> published in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution by <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three facts about populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed {{from generation to generation}} (heritability of fitness). Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> takes place.|$|E

5|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>selection</b> {{will only}} cause {{evolution}} {{if there is}} enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by <b>natural</b> <b>selection</b> implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant {{in the absence of}} selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.|$|E
