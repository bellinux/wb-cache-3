25|$|The future General Paul Huard, {{who served}} under de Gaulle at this time, {{recorded}} {{how he would}} often stand {{on a piece of}} high ground, keeping other officers literally at six yards’ distance, subjecting his subordinates to harsh criticism and taking all decisions autocratically himself, behaviour consistent with his later conduct as a political leader. Lacouture points out that for all his undoubted energy and physical courage there is no evidence in his brief period of command that he possessed the “hunter’s eye” of the great battlefield commander, and that <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> of his officers joined him in London, although some joined the Resistance in France.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Lewis Nicola held Fort Mifflin with a {{party of}} Pennsylvania militia, mostly men unfit for field service. Among the {{approximately}} 60 militiamen present for duty, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> knew how to operate the cannons. On September 23rd, with Philadelphia about to be captured, Washington sent Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Smith of the 4th Maryland Regiment with a detachment of Continentals into the fort on Mud Island. Smith's force numbered 200 soldiers plus Major Robert Ballard of Virginia, Major Simeon Thayer of Rhode Island, and Captain Samuel Treat of the Continental Artillery. However, another account stated that Thayer did not reach Fort Mifflin until October 19. With the British army closing in on Philadelphia, the small force had to reach Fort Mifflin by a circuitous route. On {{the last leg of}} their journey, reinforcements for Mud Island had to be ferried across the Delaware from Red Bank, New Jersey under the protection of the Pennsylvania Navy river flotilla commanded by John Hazelwood. Washington ordered Colonel the Baron Henry Leonard d'Arendt, a six-foot tall Prussian to take charge of Fort Mifflin. Since the baron was too sick to assume his post, Smith became the effective commander. To further complicate matters, Lieutenant Colonel John Green of the 7th Virginia Regiment, who outranked Smith, arrived with reinforcements on October 18. Smith developed an uneasy relationship with Hazelwood and their differences soon became obvious. On October 4, Washington marched against Howe's army at the Battle of Germantown but was defeated.|$|E

It largely {{took place on the}} city's north side, a region that was nearly all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a US Commission on Civil Rights hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> had been sold to an African-American. Phoenix's African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely sequestered {{on the south side of}} town. The color lines were so rigid that no one north of Van Buren Street would rent to the African-American baseball star Willie Mays, in town for spring training in the 1960s. In 1964, a reporter from The New Republic wrote of segregation in these terms: [...] "Apartheid is complete. The two cities look at each other across a golf course." ...|$|E

500|$|James Jackson of The Times {{rated the}} first episode {{four out of five}} stars, calling Nesbitt's {{performance}} as Hyde [...] "as entertainingly [...] as a dozen Doctor Who villains, with a palpable sense of menace to boot". The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that distinguishes this series from other adaptations. The Daily Telegraph's Stephen Pile criticised the script for [...] "veering between Hammer horror and larky humour" [...] and for being [...] "cheesy". He also criticised Hyde's gravity-defying hijinks and mistook Michelle Ryan for a model. In the same newspaper, James Walton called {{the first episode}} a combination of [...] "a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches". David Cornelius of DVDTalk was full of compliments for the series, summing up its review with the statement [...] "six episodes, 300 minutes, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> of them wasted. 'Jekyll' is this year's finest television event".|$|E

Others, including Nigel Slater, Gordon Ramsey, Jamie Oliver, Prue Leith and Clarissa Dickson Wright, {{have been influenced by}} David; Dickson Wright said that David [...] "taught me that food is more than cooking; it is poetry and passion as well. She also taught me never to settle for culinary second-best". Norman quotes Leith as being quite shocked when she asked students at a catering college how many of them had read David's books, and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> raised a hand.

500|$|Itzam K'an Ahk II, {{also known}} as Ruler 4, was born on November 18, 701 AD (9.13.9.14.15 7 Men 18 K'ank'in [...] in the Long Count). Of the three extant {{references}} to Itzam K'an Ahk's birth, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> mentions his pedigree or parentage, suggesting that Itzam K'an Ahk was not a direct descendant of his predecessor, K'inich Yo'nal Ahk II. Despite this, Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube point out that in one portrait, the ajaw is shown with a turtle-headdressed belt ornament, suggesting that one of Itzam K'an Ahk's ancestors may have indeed had the word auk, or turtle, in their name, signifying royalty. With this being said, Stela 40—discussed later—shows what could be Itzam K'an Ahk's mother in Teotihuacano garb, suggesting that Itzam K'an Ahk was emphasizing potential connections to Teotihuacan, possibly {{the home of his}} mother. Martin and Grube also point out that this stela was erected exactly 83 Tzolk'in, or about 59 years, following the death of Itzam K'an Ahk I, a former ajaw of Piedras Negras who lent his name to Itzam K'an Ahk II, insinuating some sort of [...] "special link" [...] between the two rulers.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{still felt}} that Lightning Bolt was {{not up to}} the {{standards}} set by the band's previous work. Blue Sullivan of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that the album had a [...] "familiar spark" [...] and was dragged down by [...] "Pearl Jam's antiseptic '70s-album-rock-radio conservatism, along with frontman Eddie Vedder's ham-fisted lyrics", ultimately concluding that [...] "Lightning Bolt is no masterwork. Years removed from the raw emotion and desperate appetites of youth, Pearl Jam has slipped into alt-rock elder statesmanship as one would a comfortable old sweater." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin gave the album a six out of ten, describing it as [...] "far from an implosion, far from spectacular", criticizing the focus on calm songs and considering that Backspacer [...] "barked louder and bit harder overall." [...] In his 5.0 out of 10 review for Pitchfork, Stuart Berman also had a negative reaction to what he described as [...] "centerpiece ballads [...] tread on odious Lite-FM territory and forcefully tip the scales from poignant to maudlin". Philip Cosores of Paste gave the album a 4.0 out of 10, saying [...] "The album does grow on the listener, as Vedder's voice and the band's seeming ambivalence to all musical trends and developments outside of them is strangely comforting. And maybe some of these songs will come alive when performed, but there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> to love in the set. Essentially, the cruise control is running onward with disregard for all the maintenance and repairs that an engine needs, and the result is the worst album of their career." ...|$|E

In response, the director of the FDA's division of plant- and dairy-food safety, John Sheehan, called the organization's claims on the health benefits and safety of raw milk [...] "false, devoid of scientific support, and misleading to consumers".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the century the de Bange cannons were {{rendered}} obsolete by the newer quick-firing guns using the French 75 recoil system, in which only the tube recoiled. Besides the technical obsolesce issue, the French army's doctrine at the time emphasizing mobility—"75 for everything" [...] had become its universal mantra for field artillery. The 155mm de Bange was therefore retained in forts and in reserve. On 2 August 1914, the French army had 1,392 pieces of 155 L de Bange, either in depots or in fixed positions; <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>one</b> was part of the equipment of a mobile unit.
