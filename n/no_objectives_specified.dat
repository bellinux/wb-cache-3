40|$|Several reports {{indicate}} that the highest business priorities include: business improvement, security, and IT management. The importance of security and risk management is gaining that even government statements in some cases have imposed the inclusion of security and risk management within business management. Risk assessment has become an essential mechanism for business security analysts, since it allows the identification and evaluation of any threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to which organizations maybe be exposed. In this work, a framework based on the concepts of Model-Driven Development has been proposed. The framework provides different stages which range from a high abstraction level to an executable level. The main contribution lie in the presentation of an extension of a business process meta-model which includes risk information based on standard approaches. The meta-model provides necessary characteristics for the risk assessment of business process models at an abstract level of the approach. The framework has been equipped with specific stages for the automatic validation of business processes using model-based diagnosis which permits the detection of the non-conformance of security <b>objectives</b> <b>specified.</b> The validation stages ensure that business processes are correct {{with regard to the}} <b>objectives</b> <b>specified</b> by the customer before they are transformed into executable processes.

40|$|Abstract The {{theory of}} graph games is the {{foundation}} for modeling and synthesizing reactive processes. In the synthesis of stochastic processes, we use 2 1 2 -player games where some transitions of the game graph are controlled by two adversarial players, the System and the Environment, and the other transitions are determined probabilistically. We consider 2 1 -player games where the objec- 2 tive of the System is the conjunction of a qualitative <b>objective</b> (<b>specified</b> as a parity condition) and a quantitative <b>objective</b> (<b>specified</b> as a mean-payoff condition). We establish {{that the problem of}} deciding whether the System can ensure that the probability to satisfy the mean-payoff parity objective is at least a given threshold is in NP∩coNP, matching the best known bound in the special case of 2 -player games (where all transitions are deterministic). We present an algorithm running in timeO(d·n 2 d ·MeanGame) to compute the set of almost-sure winning states from which the objective can be ensured with probability 1, where n is the number of states of the game, d the number of priorities of the parity objective, and MeanGame is the complexity to compute the set of almost-sure winning states in 2 1 2 -player mean-payoff games. Our results are useful in the synthesis of stochastic reactive systems with both functional requirement (given as a qualitative objective) and performance requirement (given as a quantitative objective). ...|$|R
40|$|Graph games {{provide the}} {{foundation}} for modeling and synthesis of reactive processes. Such games are played over graphs where the vertices are controlled by two adversarial players. We consider graph games where {{the objective of the}} first player is the conjunction of a qualitative <b>objective</b> (<b>specified</b> as a parity condition) and a quantitative <b>objective</b> (<b>specified</b> as a mean-payoff condition). There are two variants of the problem, namely, the threshold problem where the quantitative goal is to ensure that the mean-payoff value is above a threshold, and the value problem where the quantitative goal is to ensure the optimal mean-payoff value; in both cases ensuring the qualitative parity objective. The previous best-known algorithms for game graphs with n vertices, m edges, parity objectives with d priorities, and maximal absolute reward value W for mean-payoff objectives, are as follows: O(n^(d+ 1) ·m·W) for the threshold problem, and O(n^(d+ 2) ·m·W) for the value problem. Our main contributions are faster algorithms, and the running times of our algorithms are as follows: O(n^(d- 1) ·m·W) for the threshold problem, and O(n^d·m·W·log(n·W)) for the value problem. For mean-payoff parity objectives with two priorities, our algorithms match the best-known bounds of the algorithms for mean-payoff games (without conjunction with parity objectives). Our results are relevant in synthesis of reactive systems with both functional requirement (given as a qualitative objective) and performance requirement (given as a quantitative objective) ...|$|R

The intended learning outcomes were drawn from the social studies curriculum for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. An extensive literature search resulted in the composition of related research on the community of Happy Valley-Goose Bay. This research was used to develop the content of the instructional materials. – At various stages in the development of the unit consultations were held with content specialists, media specialists, and learning specialists. Their suggestions were incorporated into the unit. – The materials were field-tested in grade five classes in St. John’s, Mount Pearl and the Goulds. Results of the evaluation showed that the unit was appropriate for the intended use, and successful in meeting the <b>objectives</b> <b>specified.</b> – The following the conclusions were drawn from the study: [...] 1.
