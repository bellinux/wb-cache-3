Instead, {{to the extent}} possible, it {{exclusively}} uses data from primary sources such as censuses and national household surveys that are conducted by <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>authorities</b> every few years. These surveys include the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and the USAID funded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). One of the challenges faced by the JMP is that the definitions for an improved water source and improved sanitation are not consistent across countries. Another challenge is that censuses and surveys are only conducted every few years. The JMP thus uses linear regression to estimate data for a given year in a particular country even if no survey or census {{was carried out in}} that year, {{in order to be able}} to compare data across countries for the given year.|$|E

30|$|Some caveats are {{in order}} in {{interpreting}} these results. First, the Blanchard-Katz methodology followed in this paper and elsewhere identifies migration flows as a residual. The changes in employment that are not explained by changes in unemployment and inactivity are due {{to changes in the}} working-age population. Changes in the working-age population that occur in response to labour demand shocks are, in turn, attributed to labour mobility. This method has been devised to circumvent situations in which net migration rates are not available or not sufficiently reliable. In the case of the EU, the available data series “Crude rate of net migration plus statistical adjustment” includes the effects of revisions of population projections by <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>authorities.</b> Thus, the time series includes a number of revisions and outliers, which makes its time series properties less than ideal (see Additional file 1 on data sources on migration in the EU).|$|E

Against the background of two pilot projects that were recently launched by the Inter-Agency Group of Economic and Financial Statistics (IAG) to test the sharing of institutional sector accounts for G- 20 economies as well as GDP main aggregates and population data for a wider representation of global economies, this paper reports on planned enhancements for the exchange of data between Eurostat and the OECD.

40|$|Abstract: The {{number of}} open {{government}} initiatives and directives {{around the globe}} with focused interest on publishing large amounts of data on the Web as “open ” is increasing rapidly in the recent years. Opening up data aims for citizens, scientists and organizations to easily access, discover and exploit the data, and consequently to benefit from them. As a result, there is an emerging need to integrate and represent data in transparent and reusable ways, {{with a high degree}} of interoperability which will further facilitate the discovery of new connections and insights by linking data coming from diverse sources. Statistical data published either by government bodies or by <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>authorities</b> are used for policy and decision making purposes, as they present important socioeconomic indicators. In this paper, we present a generic methodology describing the basic steps and overall model to publish statistical data coming from tabular data sources or relational databases in the form of Linked Open Data...|$|E
40|$|A central {{principle}} {{for the work}} of statistical offices is their user orientation so that products and services provided satisfy stated and implied user needs. User satisfaction surveys are carried out on an increasing scale by statistical institutes with a view to both gathering information on user expectations and gaining insight in how far they have been met. This paper reviews the 2006 - 07 round of user satisfaction surveys in the European Statistical System, which were conducted {{in the context of the}} implementation of the European Statistics Code of Practice 1. The Code of Practice, which was adopted in 2005 by the statistical institutes of the European Statistical System, explicitly addresses users "…to show that European and <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>authorities</b> are impartial and that the statistics they produce and disseminate are trustworthy, objective and reliable " (European Commission, 2005). This overall user orientation is translated into a number of indicators dealing with users ’ needs. Indicator 11. 3 of the Code of Practice explicitly calls for “User satisfaction surveys (to be) undertaken periodically ” so as to ensure that European statistics meet the needs of user...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{providing}} {{some evidence of}} the short-term and long-term changes occurred in the Italian regional economies following the economic downturn. Our analysis will combine the use of structural and coincident indicators to describe the specialization of the region Emilia Romagna and its economic performance during the crisis. We adopt the Indicator of the Regional Economic Activity - IREA (Brasili, Benni 2006) to proxy the regional business cycle and give a timely picture of its economic performance till September 2010. The IRAE overcomes the deficit of the regional GDP - which is released with considerable delays by the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>authorities</b> - by using a set of timely and high-frequency variables that tend to move {{in concert with the}} GDP. For our assessment of the regional specialization, we will proceed to the reconstruction of a pre-crisis scenario of specialization, using a set of structural indexes. Then, we will study the conjunctural changes occurred in the main sectors of specialization. We will complement our analysis by studying the evolution of the trade specialization through the index of "relative comparative advantages" (Lafay 1992). In the final section, we will compare the specialization models of Emilia-Romagna, Toscana and Lombardia and discuss their vulnerability to disruptive shocks in the short and long term...|$|E

One reason is that information from the parts of SEEA related to flows of materials have been in more demand from the user community. Another reason is that it has been possible to develop harmonised approaches on which sound statistical practises could be implemented in relation to environmental economic statistics.

40|$|Since {{the fall}} of the iron curtain, {{research}} on population issues in Central Asia, with the exception of migration, has lost ground in the academia, and {{little is known about the}} geographical dimensions of population issues in this region beyond the findings of the handful of studies carried out under the auspices of international organisations. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to outline the main traits of the population geography of the Central Asian Republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The report investigates the geographical characteristics of the countries’ vital statistics, as well as of other significant demographic indicators, such as the age structure, dependency ratio and infant mortality. Additionally, the report attempts to establish whether particular regional and local demographies show inter-linkages with the specific socio-economic and/or cultural settings that they are embedded in. The report uses the systematic collection and analysis of data from statistical sources as its main method. Most of the statistical materials derive from the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>authorities</b> of the USSR and its successor states, although additional and complementary data was collected from the US Bureau of Census’ international database web resource. The use of such data involves substantial methodological and interpretative difficulties, which this report discusses in detail. Applying a three-scale geographical approach on the study of the Central Asian Republics’ population development, this report demonstrates that there are significant variations in the territoriality of these countries’ demographies. The variations are indeed striking, and suggest that the five states will face distinctly spatially differentiated challenges with regard to the volume and type of healthcare that will be required, the nature of the demand for housing, social and cultural services, and the structure of the labour market, just to name a few examples. These challenges should be taken into greater consideration by policy-makers and other stakeholders, along with matters of more immediate concern, such as the poor health infrastructure and sanitary situation, the high rate of poverty, environmental degradation, and the economic and political instability in the southern regions, most recently epitomized by the Ferghana valley-based “tulip” revolution in Kyrgyzstan and the violent riots in the Uzbek city of Andijan.
