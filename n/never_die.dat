5|$|Hancock was {{originally}} titled Tonight, He Comes and later changed to John Hancock {{before settling on}} its final title. Prior to the film's release, marketing consultants attempted to persuade Sony Pictures to again change the title Hancock {{because it was too}} vague for audiences, suggesting alternatives like Heroes <b>Never</b> <b>Die,</b> Unlikely Hero, and Less Than Hero.

Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth.

5|$|In February 1999, Payton {{announced}} that he had a rare autoimmune liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis, which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants, appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs, although by the time his first appeal was recorded, his illness was already too far advanced for transplantation to have been a viable option. In April of that year, Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with Mike Ditka, where he threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. Author Don Yaeger worked with him during the last weeks of his life to create his autobiography, <b>Never</b> <b>Die</b> Easy.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will <b>never</b> <b>die,</b> as he watches his father row.|$|E

25|$|A second 'deliberate' {{mechanism}} is called replicative senescence or cellular senescence. Metaphorically, a cell {{may be said}} to 'count' (with its telomeres) the number of times that it has divided, and after a set number of replications, it languishes and dies. It has been proposed that this mechanism evolved to suppress cancer. Many invertebrates experience replicative senescence, though they <b>never</b> <b>die</b> of cancer. Even one-celled organisms count replications, and will die if they don't replenish their telomeres with conjugation (sex).|$|E

Of his seventy to ninety screenplays, he wrote many anonymously to avoid the British boycott of his work in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
