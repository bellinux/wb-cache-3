5|$|The formal {{oxidation}} {{number in}} boranes is positive, {{and is based}} on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B2H6, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B10H14, it is 7/5 or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> number.|$|E

500|$|MTV's Josh Wigler {{thought the}} episode was [...] "a touching, sad tale {{with a healthy}} mix of mythological advancement," [...] and couldn't wait for more episodes about the Observers. Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode 7.6/10, writing that despite the hype, the episode was [...] "just plain average". He did however {{appreciate}} the new revelations about the Observers. After previewing the episode, Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker graded the episode an A-, explaining Fringe had become [...] "one of the fastest, smartest, wittiest shows on television now". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "good story peppered {{with a lot of}} great details... 'August' showed a greater connection to the larger Fringe universe". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded it with a B+, praising the [...] "wonderfully moody" [...] episode and how it was able to make the halting Observer dialogue work. Murray found some aspects lacking however, as he thought it was [...] "a very sketchy episode, plot-wise and mythology-wise. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot happened". Website blogger io9 listed [...] "August" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8.5 out of 10, praising the Lincoln and Daisy team up, Zimmer's {{portrayal}} of Rosalind and her dynamic with Coulson, Fitz's search for Simmons, {{and a quick}} resolution to where Simmons ended up. He also applauded the writing staff for not feeling the need to highlight {{all members of the}} team in the episode, noted by the absence of May and Ward. Brian Lowry of Variety was generally positive about the episode, stating, [...] "Television obviously can’t compete with the budgets and action found in summer blockbusters... but it has an advantage in being able to explore characters. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. obviously possesses a core audience drawn to those attributes, and showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen have admirably kept the plot moving ahead — engaging in larger serialized narratives — while grappling with the logistics of those ancillary considerations, which include plans for an Inhumans movie," [...] though concluded with [...] "there’s still <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot that feels particularly super about it." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said, [...] "“Laws of Nature” feels at once the show’s most confident, ambitious swing yet, its action-packed opening minutes a clear mission statement with an even more specific focus than Season 2." ...|$|E

[...] Rabin enjoyed all the plots featured here, and praised Will Forte's role as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator. Emily Exton from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the peacock storyline [...] "felt too silly", and that Forte [...] "was too underused as Paul", nonetheless said that despite not being the greatest 30 Rock episode of all time [...] "there were still some hilarious lines." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning liked Grizz's dilemma plot, commenting that Grizz not trying to hurt Tracy's feelings while Tracy tried to keep Dot Com away from Grizz's bride-to-be [...] "offered up some inspired lunacy." [...] His only complaint about [...] "Argus" [...] was Jack's plot as he deemed it disappointing. A review in TV Guide by Adam Mersel said [...] "...Fey and the gang {{live up to the}} challenge, and produce [...] a hilarious, quite snotty episode that holds up to any comedy around." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive towards the episode, reasoning that the writing [...] "is just so deliciously absurd that I can't help but giggle the whole way through", and that the plots featured here were [...] "sublimely inconsequential. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot happened, but it was all very funny." [...] Nick Catucci from New York magazine, who did not enjoy the two other stories, appreciated Jenna's, explaining that by having the character date one of her own impersonator was [...] "outrageous and funny without relying on any cheap insults to trannies." [...] Sean Gandert from Paste magazine reported that [...] "Argus" [...] was an episode that [...] " [...] us back to the show's roots", explaining that recapturing the [...] "old tone" [...] also worked to [...] "recapture the old joke-writing expertise. It wasn't 100% consistent, but there were so many good one-liners to counterbalance the misfires that it didn't even matter. This is 30 Rock the way it should be." [...] The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that Grizz's wedding story was [...] "pure filler, but everything on the show's kind of filler for the wackiness, so it mostly worked." [...] Carlson wrote that the best part from [...] "Argus" [...] came with Forte's Paul as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator.|$|E

Months later, Sherman resigned {{to start his}} professional coaching career as the assistant offensive line and tight ends coach for the Green Bay Packers. When asked by a reporter why he chose to accept the Green Bay job, Sherman responded: [...] "There is absolutely no other college job I would have left Texas A for and only one professional job that I've ever had any interest in and that being the Green Bay Packers.

2500|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the season, Perry {{continued}} his torrid scoring pace. On March 9, Perry scored two more goals, his 32nd and 33rd goal of the season, surpassing his previous career-high, single-season goal tally. Perry scored another goal in a win against Colorado. In the next game, he scored the only two goals as the Ducks lost to the Phoenix Coyotes. From March 19 through April 6, Perry recorded a least a point in ten consecutive games, later taking the League scoring lead from Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning when he scored two goals against the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. He then recorded his third career hat-trick in a game against the San Jose Sharks on April 6, with his third of the game giving him 50 for the year. After reaching the mark, he became just the third Ducks player to record a 50-goal season, joining Teemu Selänne and Paul Kariya.

These women had all been beheaded...and the procedure seems to have been, as follows: They would seize a woman, strip her carefully to her chemise, laying aside articles of clothing that were valuable, with any ornaments and jewels she might have about her. Then as many of them as cared would violate her, and the last man would kill her or not as the humour took him....We looked into the church which had been blackened by the burning of the woodwork, but not destroyed, nor even much injured. It was a low building with a low roof, supported by heavy irregular arches, that as we looked in seemed scarcely high enough for a tall man to stand under. What we saw there was too frightful for more than a hasty glance. An immense number of bodies had been partially burnt there and the charred and blackened remains seemed to fill it half way up to the low dark arches and make them lower and darker still, were lying in a state of putrefaction too frightful to look upon. I had never imagined anything so horrible. We all turned away sick and faint, and staggered out of the fearful pest house glad to get into the street again. We walked about the place and saw the same thing repeated over and over a hundred times. Skeletons of men with the clothing and flesh still hanging to and rotting together; skulls of women, with the hair dragging in the dust. bones of children and infants everywhere.
