5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> rewrote laws regarding the insanity defense.

5|$|By 1912, 239 {{political}} parties {{at both the}} state and national level had pledged some form of direct election, and 33 states had introduced the use of direct primaries. Twenty-seven states had called for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.|$|E

5|$|In 2004 José Manuel Barroso became President: the Parliament {{once again}} {{asserted}} itself in objecting {{to the proposed}} membership of the Barroso Commission.

As a result of the increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states,</b> the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a reduction in the number of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.|$|E

5|$|On March 4, 1794, Congress {{approved}} {{an amendment}} to the United States Constitution clarifying judicial power over foreign nationals, and limiting the ability of citizens to sue states in federal courts and under federal law, and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification.

5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and most of these are members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature of coalition governments in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing {{on the nature of the}} law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states,</b> the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E

5|$|States are {{the primary}} subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as {{regulating}} intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, while Representatives are distributed among the states {{in proportion to the}} most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>states</b> has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} compactly representing a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> sequences, e. g., sequences of activities, as a flow diagram. We argue that the flow diagram representation gives an intuitive summary that allows the user to detect patterns among large sets <b>of</b> <b>state</b> sequences. Simplified, our aim is to generate a small flow diagram that models the flow <b>of</b> <b>states</b> <b>of</b> all the <b>state</b> sequences given as input. For a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> sequences we present efficient algorithms to compute a minimal flow diagram. For a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> sequences we show that {{it is unlikely that}} efficient algorithms exist. More specifically, the problem is W[1]-hard if the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>state</b> sequences is taken as a parameter. We thus introduce several heuristics for this problem. We argue about the usefulness of the flow diagram by applying the algorithms to two problems in sports analysis. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms on a football data set and generated data. Comment: 18 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
