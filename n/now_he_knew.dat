25|$|For Alaungpaya, {{the worry}} was that French {{reinforcements}} would soon arrive. He {{decided that the}} time had come for the fortress to be stormed, <b>now.</b> <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that the French and the Mons, expecting no quarter, would resist fiercely and that hundreds of his men would die in any attempt to breach the walls. He called for volunteers and then selected 93, whom he named the Golden Company of Syriam, a name that would find pride of place in Burmese nationalist mythology. They included guards, officers, and royal descendants of Bayinnaung. The afternoon before, as the early monsoon rains poured down in torrents outside the makeshift huts, they ate together in their king's presence. Alaungpaya gave each a leather helmet and lacquer armor.|$|E
25|$|Lee now invaded Maryland and Pennsylvania, {{hoping to}} collect {{supplies}} in Union territory, and possibly win a victory that would sway the upcoming Union elections {{in favor of}} ending the war. But McClellan's men found a lost Confederate dispatch, Special Order 191, that revealed Lee's plans and movements. McClellan always exaggerated Lee's numerical strength, but <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the Confederate army was divided and could be destroyed in detail. However, McClellan moved slowly, not realizing a spy had informed Lee that McClellan had the plans. Lee quickly concentrated his forces west of Antietam Creek, near Sharpsburg, Maryland, where McClellan attacked on September 17. On the bloodiest single day of the war, with both sides suffering enormous losses, Lee's army barely withstood the Union assaults, then retreated to Virginia the next day. This narrow Confederate defeat gave President Abraham Lincoln the opportunity to issue his Emancipation Proclamation, which put the Confederacy on the diplomatic and moral defensive.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{dispute over}} how much direct {{operational}} control Haig maintained in the Hundred Days, Tim Travers arguing that he exercised “a symbolic form of leadership”, allowing his Army Commanders (Plumer, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst {{at the same time}} Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined to advice and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Robin Prior argues that by the second half of 1918 both Lloyd George and Haig were “moving steadily to the sidelines”, although he also concedes that Haig intervened in operations much less <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the BEF to be a fine fighting instrument and “he proved far more effective as a commander” as a result. By contrast Sheffield argues that Haig was Foch’s principal subordinate—they met sixty times between April and November—and influenced his strategy (in Wiest's view Foch was also “a buffer between Haig and his political tormentors in London”.) “At last (Haig) was able to behave as the sort of “arms-length” Commander-in-Chief that was his ideal: setting broad objectives” but devolving detailed planning of battles. Besides, “he had presided over the transformation of the army” and “Haig’s performance as a general improved as the army matured. He was … doing fewer things better”. GHQ also {{played a key role in}} sequencing the attacks of the armies in late September, and keeping them fully supplied.|$|E
