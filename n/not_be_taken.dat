5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E

Mayor Ferdinand Latrobe issued a proclamation, reciting the riot act and ordering the crowds to disperse, but to no effect. He later sent correspondence to the governor, asking that the garrison <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> from the city given {{the current state of}} affairs. Police commissioners ordered the closing of all barrooms and saloons.|$|E
5|$|During an {{excursion}} into Przemysl Land in the 48th {{year of his}} reign, Władysław cought a cold {{from which}} {{he was unable to}} recover. He finally died in Grodek in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, Władysław III, and Lithuania to his younger, Casimir, both still minors at the time. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> for granted. Władysław's death ended the personal union between the two realms, and it was not clear what would take its place.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E

5|$|Following the Caliph's instructions, Yazid {{proceeded}} to Caesarea, {{and once again}} laid siege to the port city.

Caesarea, however, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> until 640, when at last, the garrison surrendered to Muawiyah I, then a governor of Syria. With an army of 17,000 men, Abu Ubaidah and Khalid set off from Jerusalem to conquer all of northern Syria. This ended with the conquest of Antioch in late 637. In 639, the Muslims invaded and conquered Egypt.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} article, {{cataloguing}} {{the rights of}} man, Mason derived the following articles, which make clear {{that the role of}} government is to secure and protect those rights, and if it fails to do so, the {{people have a right to}} amend or abolish it. Property could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives.

5|$|Such a {{plan would}} still fail if {{sufficient}} ground could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> quickly in Belgium {{to squeeze the}} allies against two fronts. Preventing this from happening were the defences of Fort Eben-Emael and the Albert Canal. The three bridges over the canal were the key to allowing Army Group B a high operational tempo. The bridges at Veldwezelt, Vroenhoven and Kanne in Belgium, and Maastricht on the Dutch border were the target. Failure to capture the bridges would leave Reichenau's German 6th Army, the southern-most army of Group B, trapped in the Maastricht-Albert Canal enclave and subjected to the fire of Eben-Emael. The fort had to be captured or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Sm3 {{had a long}} {{prototype}} phase {{before the}} main series was ordered, with reliability issues being brought up by the press from time to time. Negative reporting continues to haunt the series' reputation. Reliability problems cannot be proven, as no statistics of specific train types are available. The train has not managed to cope with harsh Finnish weather conditions, and the time benefit of the tilting mechanism will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into account in timetables of winter 2011–2012. Nevertheless, the Sm3 has also received positive feedback from passengers and has led to increased operating speeds on the Finnish rail network.|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{by people}} who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Because his Nung {{soldiers}} were exhausted, with their ammunition and water supplies running low, White believed {{they could not}} defend the Ngok Tavak garrison in case the VC launched another major attack. At 10:45, White requested permission to evacuate the garrison, but {{he was told to}} stay and wait for the arrival of reinforcements. However, both White and Makowski knew that reinforcement was unlikely, because the two downed helicopters would prevent the insertion of additional soldiers, and the road between Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức was likely to be covered by the opposing forces waiting in ambush positions. White then decided to evacuate Ngok Tavak and withdraw his troops to safety. As part of the evacuation plan, any type of equipment that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> or was considered to be of value to the opponent was dumped into the command bunker and set alight using captured enemy flamethrowers. The Marines were ordered to fire their last remaining shells, about nine rounds in total, after their ammunition storage was set ablaze by the VC, and disable their 105mm guns.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the comets C/1843 D1, C/1880 C1, C/1882 R1, C/1887 B1, C/1963 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1970 K1 are all members of a family known as the Kreutz Sungrazers, which are all descended from one comet. Current models {{do not support the}} frequent supposition in the prior literature that the famous comet of 372 BC is in fact the ultimate parent of the Sungrazers. The comet of 372 BC is often associated with Aristotle who, along with others from his time, described that comet in his writings. However, Aristotle was only twelve {{at the time of the}} comet's appearance and the historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, who also wrote about it was born ten years after its appearance. Consequently, their reports should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> as eye-witness accounts. Further, there is no mention of the comet in Chinese literature of the time. Instead either the comet of February 423 or of February 467 with orbital periods of around 700 years is now considered the likely progenitor of the Sungrazers. The fragments of the Great Comet of 1882 will return in several hundred years' time, spread out over perhaps two or three centuries.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur's {{next move}} was the {{invasion}} of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikazes. During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ staff would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to the Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Omaha {{arrived at}} Port of Spain, on 17 November 1941, with Odenwald flying the German flag on the mast with the US flag flying over it. It {{was not until}} 30 April 1947, that a case was brought by Odenwalds owners in the District Court for Puerto Rico, against the US. Their claim stated that because {{a state of war}} between the United States and Germany did not exist at the time of capture the vessel could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> as a prize or bounty. The court however, given the fact that Odenwald was rescued from sinking by the US crew, {{declared}} that the seizing of the ship was defined as a legal salvage operation. The US was awarded the profits that were made from Odenwald and her cargo. All the men of the original boarding party received $3,000 each, {{while the rest of the}} crewmen in Omaha and Somers, at the time, were entitled to two months' pay and allowances. The laws have since been revised, making this the last time that US Navy members received such an award.|$|E
