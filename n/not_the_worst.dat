Barton's comments were criticised as sexist by an audience member and he later apologised on air. The Independent newspaper deemed that, despite the comments, Barton had produced a [...] "strong performance" [...] on the programme.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} rather negative reviews, since clip shows {{tend to be}} {{the least}} favorite episodes among fans. The episode has been described as [...] "framed {{in such a way as}} to still make [...] worth watching, like a slideshow that's not quite so boring", [...] "another clip show, although <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of them", and [...] "the episode title pretty much says it all". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said in a review: [...] "The romance related storyline fizzles. That leaves us with a good collection of clips, but since we can already watch them in their original episodes, why bother with this cheap excuse for product?" ...|$|E

Chad Michael Murray was also considered for the role. In March 2008, Johnny Simmons was reportedly cast as Nikolai. However, Brody was officially cast {{in the role of}} Nikolai, while Simmons was then given the role of Chip Dove. Brody said he did not do his own vocals, adding, [...] "My singing voice is still going through puberty.

She also wants to protect Mariah, who has now become [...] "guilty by association". The scandal {{revolving}} around Sharon and [...] "Sully" [...] breaks on the television show GC Buzz, with Case stating: [...] "Sharon always knew the truth would come out. She {{was just trying to}} adjust her mind and heart to the inevitability, even though she was only making things worse." [...] Despite her crime, Case also described Sharon as a victim, and contended that this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> thing Sharon has done. After losing Christian to Nick, Sharon decides to fight for a place in his life. CBS Soaps In Depth wrote that her frustration over no one willing to understand her [...] "is what finally lights a tiny flame of defiance deep inside Sharon". According to Case, [...] "Sharon is willing to do anything for her child. She's fighting for what she believes is right." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kids' WB {{version of}} the Cardcaptors dub was panned by critics. Jake Godek of THEM Anime called it [...] "the worst thing that has ever {{happened}} to anime that had a good Japanese name," [...] with the dubbing being [...] "one of the worst if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> dubbing done for a program." [...] He also criticized the editing, saying that it had [...] "demolished the plot" [...] and noting that it cut out vital character backgrounds {{needed in order to}} understand the show. Adam Arnold of Animefringe, reviewing the first Cardcaptors DVD, said it was [...] "nothing more than an attempt to dilute a fan favorite anime," [...] with the dubbed voices described as [...] "not up-to-par with the originals." [...] The ordering of the episodes on the DVD was also criticized, noting that starting with episode eight meant that the cast are [...] "left without their backgrounds fleshed out." [...] However, he also approved of the episode stories being left intact, and praised the voices of Carly McKillip as Sakura Avalon and Rhys Huber as Syaoran Li, stating that they were [...] "only voices that really shine above the rest." ...|$|E

500|$|Although widely acclaimed, {{the album}} has been censured by some. It was voted the worst record ever {{made in a}} 1998 Melody Maker poll of pop stars, DJs and journalists. Among the harshest detractors was {{musician}} and journalist John Robb, who described the album as [...] "the benchmark of 1967 – the low water point of rock 'n' roll". In a scathing appraisal of the record prior to its 40th anniversary in 2007, Guardian critic Richard Smith wrote that it is [...] "if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst,</b> then certainly the most overrated album of all time". He {{also said that the}} [...] "excruciating" [...] LP was often ranked by members of the music press as the best ever due to affection for its cultural impact, and [...] "not because of anything intrinsically great about the record". Asked in 2007 to nominate the [...] "supposedly great" [...] album he would [...] "gladly never hear again", artist and writer Billy Childish named Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, saying that it [...] "signalled the death of rock 'n' roll". Musician and author Bill Drummond, in a 2010 publication, called the record [...] "the worst {{thing that ever happened to}} music". In 2015, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards denounced the album as [...] "a mishmash of rubbish, kind of like Satanic Majesties".|$|E
500|$|Ralf Schumacher said, [...] "I'm {{more than}} happy; {{we have been}} strong here the whole weekend and my car behaved perfectly. I had a little moment of worry about six laps from the end when the {{throttle}} didn't seem to pick up properly and I thought the engine was going to stop, but it came back and all was well." [...] Schumacher added that his team was confident of securing third in the Constructors' Championship; although he could not match Häkkinen's pace, he praised the team for his car's set-up. Coulthard was disappointed with his fourth-place finish, and thought his team's decision to call him into the pit lane after his competitors cost him the victory; however, he remained confident about his championship chances. Button was also disappointed to finish fifth: [...] "It was a bad race for me, if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b> The car was working well at the start, but when I tried to pass Jarno I went in a bit late." [...] Trulli refused to criticise Button after the race, believing that Button made a mistake. Fisichella and Verstappen felt similarly about their lap-nine collision, with Fisichella saying that he [...] "felt sorry" [...] for Verstappen and describing his weekend as [...] "disastrous". Verstappen said that he struggled with his car's balance, which resulted in oversteer. He was [...] "happy to go home", because [...] "it's not been a good weekend." [...] Frentzen said that although {{he was happy to}} score points, he had hoped for a better finish.|$|E
500|$|... "Do or Die" [...] {{was awarded}} 'Single of the Week' in the January 19–25, 2000 {{issue of the}} Melody Maker by guest reviewers Pär Wiksten and Christina Bergmark from The Wannadies who gave the track [...] "all the points we can afford" [...] and claimed that it ends perfectly. The NME {{described}} the song as [...] "not the best track from ... Guerrilla, but then <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> either" [...] and claimed that it was mostly of note {{because it was the}} second single by Super Furry Animals to be less than two minutes long following 1996's [...] "God! Show Me Magic". Despite stating that there was [...] "no need whatsoever" [...] for the release, the NME ranked [...] "Do or Die" [...] at number 55 in their single of the year list for 2000. In a 2005 review of the reissued Guerrilla, Pitchfork described the track as [...] "near-perfect sunny pop" [...] while, in an earlier review of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1, the website called [...] "Do or Die" [...] "proggy quasi-Britpop" [...] and likened its guitar part to [...] "Jessica" [...] by The Allman Brothers Band. Also reviewing Songbook..., the BBC described [...] "Do or Die" [...] as one of several [...] "great hairy rock outs" [...] on the record, The Washington Post called it [...] "straightforward pop-punk" [...] and Drowned in Sound labelled it a [...] "guitar-laden sugar rush". Website Cokemachineglow likened the track to the work of The Stooges. Pitchfork claimed that the single's b-sides, the [...] "inescapably sha-la-la-ing 'Colorblind'" [...] and the [...] "piano-accented bounder" [...] "Missunderstanding (sic)", pale beside [...] "Do or Die" [...] and the other tracks on Guerilla although they [...] "do manage to scratch the itch for more SFA".|$|E

500|$|Webb {{felt that}} the Lizard was the best villain because, [...] "He's the literal {{embodiment}} of {{the theme of the}} movie, which is we all have a missing piece. He has no arm. Peter has no parents, and he fills that void with Spider-Man." [...] Producer Avi Arad felt likewise, explaining, [...] "ou look at Peter, he misses the parents, [...] Connors has one arm. ...motionally, [...] is a very similar problem. It is a cautionary tale." [...] Webb said that the Lizard [...] "is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> villain on the planet. He's not a mustache-twirling guy who wants to terrorize people. He believes he's doing the right thing." [...] Actor Rhys Ifans described his character as a flawed character comparable to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. [...] "Curt Connors is by no means an evil villain," [...] Ifans stated. [...] "He's not like the Batman villains, like the Joker, who are the embodiment of evil. Curtis Connors is a great man who makes a bad decision. ... hat's the whole magic of the Spider-Man idea. These people are the embodiment of our flaws and our desires that lead to tragedy." [...] Ifans described Connors as a force for good throughout his life: [...] "He's a geneticist who wants to help people, like him, who are limbless. In his eagerness to advance that science, he makes a mistake and that's an occurrence we've seen throughout time, sometimes to our benefit, sometimes to our detriment." [...] "...He is a broken man who wants to fix himself." [...] Ifans added, [...] "I'm not portraying a villain in any sense. Connors does feel cheated by God, and he's looking for answers in science. God seems to intervene." ...|$|E

In his review for Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy said, [...] "Laura Palmer, after all the talk, is not a very interesting or compelling character and long before the climax has become a tiresome teenager". USA Today gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it, [...] "a morbidly joyless affair". Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers wrote, [...] "though the movie ups the TV ante on nudity, language and violence, Lynch's control falters. But if inspiration is lacking, talent is not. Count Lynch down but never out". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley described the film as a [...] "perversely moving, profoundly self-indulgent prequel".|$|E

[...] A study by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Studies Institute at the University of Louisville concluded that expanding Medicaid [...] "would inject $15.6 billion into Kentucky's economy over the next eight years, create almost 17,000 new jobs, have an $802.4 million positive budget impact (by transferring certain expenditures from the state to the federal government, among other things), protect hospitals from cuts in indigent care funding and shield businesses from up to $48 million in annual penalties." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the start}} of World War II, pacifist and anti-war {{sentiment}} declined in nations affected by war. Even the communist-controlled American Peace Mobilization reversed its anti-war activism once Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, mainstream isolationist groups like the America First Committee, declined, but many smaller religious and socialist groups continued their opposition to war. Bertrand Russell argued that the necessity of defeating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis was a unique circumstance where war was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the possible evils; he called his position relative pacifism. Shortly before the outbreak of war, British writers such as E. M. Forster, Leonard Woolf, David Garnett and Storm Jameson all rejected their earlier pacifism and endorsed military action against Nazism. Similarly Albert Einstein wrote: [...] "I loathe all armies and any kind of violence; yet I'm firmly convinced that at present these hateful weapons offer the only effective protection." [...] The British pacifists Reginald Sorensen and C. J. Cadoux, while bitterly disappointed by the outbreak of war, nevertheless urged their fellow pacifists [...] "not to obstruct the war effort".|$|E
2500|$|Although theoretically, {{the emperor}} {{was the final}} and {{absolute}} authority in Chinese politics during the Song dynasty, in actuality many factors importantly affected events: these included other politically influential persons such as the emperor's in-laws and other relatives and also party politics. Party political division {{at the time was}} severe: Wang Anshi lead a group of [...] "reformists", also known as the [...] "New Policy party", whose ideas were perhaps ahead of their time. Su Shi was part of the politically-opposed [...] "conservative" [...] group, later known as the [...] "Yuanyou party", after the era-name during which they had exercised most power. Wang Anshi's New Policies had their ups-and-downs in imperial favour, but initially he was able to sweep the political field of oppositional voices. Sima Guang, the main oppositional leader retired to Luoyang, as did various others in his faction. Su Shi's patron Ouyang Xiu (1007 – 1072) was demoted, exiled, and eventually permitted to retire. Su Shi was not identified as a main leader of the opposition party and was exiled as governor of Hangzhou, which in itself was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> place to be sent, or the worst position for someone pursuing a career in politics, but it forbade his appearance at court, and consequentially denied him direct influence or interaction with the imperial government, at the national level.|$|E
