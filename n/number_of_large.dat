5|$|After the Jacobite rising of 1745, Adam's {{position}} as Mason to the Board of Ordnance {{brought him a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> military contracts in the Highlands. In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant, and Adam was quick to put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post. His three eldest sons were all involved in the family business by 1746, James and John both leaving Edinburgh University early to join their father.|$|E
5|$|Although most residences {{were built}} {{according}} to local vernacular traditions, some manors (such as Austråt and Rosendal) exhibit the influence of Baroque architecture. Only the city of Christiania (Oslo) had a building code that prohibited wooden houses, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> town houses modeled after Continental building types were constructed. Some large churches were constructed with brick walls, notably in Bergen, Christiania, Røros and Kongsberg.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to imitate the {{conventions}} of silent cinema in its infancy, the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial. The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations, causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be overexposed. The Pathé camera did not allow camera movement, had imprecise definition, and dark rendering. The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field, producing a flat image, and required good lighting to operate effectively. Overhead shots are most commonly used, with some medium shots and a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> shots.|$|E

By the end of 1918, the bank had recovered and surpassed CHF 1billion in total assets and grew to 2,000 employees by 1920. The impact {{of the stock market}} crash of 1929 and the Great Depression was severe, particularly as the Swiss franc suffered major devaluation in 1936. The bank saw its assets fall from a 1929 peak of CHF 1.6billion to its 1918 levels of CHF 1billion by 1936.|$|E
5|$|The town {{used to be}} {{the focus}} of {{thriving}} river business and was an important stop on the Dublin to Limerick navigation. It supported a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> industries, most notably a maltings and distillery, which are now defunct. Tourism has supplanted this to a certain extent with a modern marina providing support for river cruisers and watersports facilities and the town is an important angling centre, with particular attraction for pike anglers. Banagher is the centre of the Shannon Callows, grassy meadows which flood in winter and provide living space for myriads of waterfowl.|$|E
5|$|With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops {{launched}} a major offensive against South Kasai.

By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold-rich empire, sailing as far north as Pánuco River. As the fleet returned to Cuba, the Spanish attacked Champotón to avenge the previous year's defeat of the Spanish expedition led by Hernández. One Spaniard was killed and fifty were wounded in the ensuing battle, including Grijalva. Grijalva put into Havana five months after he had left.|$|E

5|$|Based on estimations of the {{primordial}} mass required to form Uranus and Neptune, {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> objects would increase {{by a factor of}} two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the Kuiper cliff, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km or more in radius beyond 50AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} seven years, 1870–1877, only two works of the painter's were exhibited. These were two water-colours, shown at the Dudley Gallery in 1873, one of them being the {{beautiful}} Love among the Ruins, destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed {{it to be an}} oil painting, but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter. This silent period was, however, one of unremitting production. Hitherto Burne-Jones had worked almost entirely in water-colours. He now began a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> pictures in oils, working at them in turn, and having always several on hand. The first Briar Rose series, Laus Veneris, the Golden Stairs, the Pygmalion series, and The Mirror of Venus are among the works planned and completed, or carried far towards completion, during these years. These years also mark the beginnings of Burne-Jones's partnership with the fine-art photographer Frederick Hollyer, whose reproductions of paintings and—especially—drawings would expose a wider audience to Burne-Jones's works in the coming decades.|$|E
5|$|Granvin is a port on the Hardangerfjord and was {{the center}} for freight {{transport}} in Hardanger. Hardanger is dominated by a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> industrial companies, primarily smelters, which were responsible for more than 80 percent of the line's cargo volume. While Hardanger in the 1980s had a population of 40,000, Granvin had a population of 1,000 {{and was the}} smallest municipality in Hardanger. Granvin served as a ferry hub for services by Hardanger Sunnhordlandske Dampskipsselskap (HSD), and in 1980 there up to two daily services with the local ferry services in Hardanger, in addition to fast ferries to both Bergen and Stavanger. Buses operated to Granvin from Norheimsund and Kvanndal.|$|E
5|$|Henry Darnall died in 1711. Carroll {{took over}} Darnall's {{positions}} as agent and receiver general for the Calvert {{family in the}} colony, both posts with significant additional salaries. Among the many uses to which he put this money was lending. After 1713, he became the largest mortgage lender in the colony, and made a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> personal loans to other planters. Carroll continued to practice law, making a small income from cases argued in the two courts where Catholics were still allowed to practice law, the chancery and prerogative courts. His speculation in mercantile enterprises also continued. Together, these made Carroll the wealthiest man in the colony by 1715, and its most prominent Catholic.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, the copper shark is rare and little fishery {{information}} is available, {{leading to an}} assessment of Data Deficient. However, catch declines across all shark and ray species have been documented in the heavily-fished Gulf of California. Off East Asia, the copper shark has been assessed as Vulnerable; though species-specific data is unavailable, shark populations overall have been decimated in the region. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> adults have been too low to sustain targeted fisheries since the 1970s, {{and most of the}} current shark catch consists of small juveniles. Additional threats to this species include the degradation and destruction of its coastal nurseries from development, pollution, and aquaculture, mortality from shark nets used to protect beaches in South Africa and Australia, and persecution by fish farmers in southern Australia.|$|E
5|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} basal fish with {{numerous}} primitive anatomical features {{similar to those}} of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set {{on the underside of the}} head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>large,</b> yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{described}} and analysed changes in the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> ovarian follicles (diameter 6. 1 - 9. 0 cm) and in the plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol- 17 beta (E 2 beta) in relation to individual egg production figures of farmed ostriches (Struthio camelus spp.) throughout one year. Ultrasound scanning and blood sampling for plasma hormone analysis were performed in 9 hens {{on a monthly basis}} during the breeding season and in two periods of the non-breeding season. Our data demonstrated that: (1) large follicles were detected and LH concentrations were elevated already 1 month before first ovipositions of the egg production season took place; (2) E- 2 beta concentrations increased as soon as the egg production season started; (3) <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations were elevated during the entire egg production season; and that (4) <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> follicles, LH and E- 2 beta concentrations decreased simultaneous with or following the last ovipositions of the egg production season. By comparing these parameters during the egg production season with their pre-and post-seasonal values, significant differences were found in the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> follicles and E- 2 beta concentrations between the pre-seasonal, seasonal and post-seasonal period; while LH concentrations were significantly different between the seasonal and post-seasonal period. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that changes in <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>large</b> follicles and in concentrations of LH and E- 2 beta closely parallel individual egg production figures and provide some new cues that egg production in ostriches is confined to a marked reproductive season. Moreover, our data provide indications that mechanism, initiating, maintaining and terminating the egg production season in farmed breeding ostriches are quite similar to those already known for other seasonal breeding bird species.
