40|$|With {{the growing}} amount of {{internet}} users, a negative form of sending email spreads that affects {{more and more}} users of email accounts: Spareming. Spareming means that the electronic mailbox is congested with unwanted advertising or personal email. Sorting out this email costs the user time and money. This paper introduces a distributed spare filter, which combines an off-the-shelf text classification with multiagent systems. Both the text classification {{as well as the}} multiagent platform are implemented in Java. The content of the emails is analyzed by the classification algorithm 'support vector machines'. Information about spare is exchanged between the agents through the <b>network.</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>numbers</b> for emails which where identified as spare are generated and forwarded to all other agents connected to the network. These numbers allow agents to identify incoming spare email. In this way, the quality of the filter increases continuously...|$|R
40|$|Background Gastrostomy feeding is {{commonly}} used to support patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who develop severe dysphagia. Although recommended by both the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies, currently little evidence indicates the optimum method and timing for gastrostomy insertion. We aimed to compare gastrostomy insertion approaches in terms of safety and clinical outcomes. Methods In this large, longitudinal, prospective cohort study (ProGas), we enrolled patients with a diagnosis of definite, probable, laboratory supported, or possible amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who had agreed with their treating clinicians to undergo gastrostomy at 24 motor neuron disease care centres or clinics in the UK. The primary outcome was 30 -day mortality after gastrostomy. This study was registered on the UK Clinical Research <b>Network</b> database, <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> 9923. Findings Between Nov 2, 2010, and Jan 31, 2014, 345 patients were recruited of whom 330 had gastrostomy. 163 (49...|$|R

40|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} worldwide have unique aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> on the rooves {{for ease}} of identification for aerial support, particularly if the individuals crewing the vehicle need exigent assistance. Drawing on an actual event from the 2013 Blue Mountains Wildfire, this paper highlights how aerial support from a water bombing aircraft was unable to read the existing black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> of a fire appliance because the black <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> coalesced with the black plumes of smoke emitted by the wildfire. Given the extensive technological development {{in the application of}} high visibility markings over the past twenty-one years, the current black and aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> used by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service on their fire appliances is far from adequate, doing little to provide optimum safety for fire ground crews in a wildfire. This paper concludes that the current black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> should be replaced with high visibility aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> markings because these have greater visibility for aerial support in a wildfire particularly in the colours of red, lime, yellow, orange or blue. 15 page(s...|$|R
