Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 86 - 92 Looking at {{the results}} of the elections in Turkey in the 1990 s, {{it can be seen that}} there has been a continuing decrease in the votes of the traditional Turkish centerright parties such as the Motherland Party (MP) and the True Path Party (TPP) while a converse situation has been observed in the case of extreme right parties such as the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party</b> (NAP) and the Welfare Party (WP). Another striking point about the voter alignments in Turkey during the last decade has been that no party has been the first party in successive elections. These developments led to the questions about whether the Turkish center is eroding, or the extreme right parties are coming to the center. The aim of this thesis is to attempt to clarify the case of Turkish center-right in the last decade in the sense whether there has been a shift in the center-right votes with the erosion of the center or replacement of the center right is taking place, with special emphasis on the case of the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party.</b> This thesis argues that there has been erosion in the Turkish center-right in the last decade and the NAP obtained some votes from the traditional center-right voters, while maintaining its own voter basis. This study offers explanations for the erosion of the traditional Turkish center-right together with the rise of the NAP in recent years both as a political party and as a political movementGözüküçük, YusufM.

40|$|This paper tests four {{hypotheses}} of “losers’ consent”—that is, {{the extent}} to which evaluations of democratic governance are shared by citizens who voted for the Justice and Development Party (AKP), the winner at the 2007 Turkish elections, and those who voted for the opposition parties, the Republican People’s Party (CHP) and the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party</b> (MHP). It uses survey data about governance evaluations from the 2007 Turkish Election Study. The evidence rejects the idea that losers withhold consent, creating polarized pluralism. It gives some support to a winner’s effect. It finds a substantial degree of similarity in views of governance across party lines. Differences between voters for the two losing parties are sometimes greater than differences with the AKP.

We tested the effects of political tendencies on the referendum results using provincial data. The results show that the “yes” votes are higher in the provinces where AKP has a stronger base, and lower in the provinces where the opposition parties, especially CHP, have stronger bases.

The MIR of Jaime Paz Zamora remained a coalition-partner throughout the Banzer government, supporting this policy (called the Dignity Plan). The Banzer government basically continued the free-market and privatization-policies of its predecessor. The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about {{the third year of}} its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth.

50|$|After the {{government}} falsely accused ETA {{of carrying out}} the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the conservative government lost the elections in favour of the Socialist Workers' Party, and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero became {{the new president of}} Spain. One of Zapatero's first actions was to engage in new peace talks with ETA. In mid-2006, the organisation declared a ceasefire, and conversations between Batasuna, ETA and the Basque and Spanish governments started. Despite the claims of peace talks ending in December, when ETA broke the truce with a massive car bomb at the Madrid-Barajas Airport, a new round of conversations took place on May 2007. ETA officially ended the ceasefire in 2007, and resumed its attacks around Spain. From that moment on, the Spanish government and police intensified their struggle both against ETA and the Abertzale left. Hundreds of members of the armed organisation were arrested {{since the end of the}} truce, with four of its leaders being arrested in less than one year. Meanwhile, the Spanish authorities banned more political parties such as Basque <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Action,</b> Communist <b>Party</b> of the Basque Homelands or Demokrazia Hiru Milioi. Youth organisations such as Segi have been banned, while members of trade unions, such as Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak have also been arrested.

30|$|It {{is obvious}} that the {{presence}} of Syrians in Turkey is instigating a reaction from the local population, and the AKP government strives to guarantee precautionary solutions while emphasizing the temporariness of the situation. During the 2015 general election campaigns, the Syrian refugee issue became a point of debate with the main opposition CHP (Republican People’s Party), arguing that they should be sent back home when their safety is guaranteed, whereas the Kurdish-dominated HDP (People’s Democracy Party) was asking for citizenship rights to be extended to Syrians. After the June 2015 election, a new MP from Gaziantep province elected on a MHP (<b>Nationalist</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party)</b> ticket claimed that his election showed that the voters disgruntled with Syrians were leaving the AKP. However, despite these conflicts and clashes, we cannot claim that the public aversion to Syrians had major political costs for the AKP thus far. To some extent, {{this may be due to}} the narrative of historical moral responsibility and temporariness that the officials have been so keen to emphasize, as I will spell out in the next section.|$|E

40|$|The Turkish {{party system}} {{experienced}} a serious blow {{in the early}} 1980 s, when the military government in power closed down all the former legal political parties.

This essay draws upon existing literature on voting behavior to develop four hypotheses to explain partisan affiliations of Turkish voters. Each of the hypotheses is then put to empirical tests, using data collected {{by means of a}} nationally representative survey. The four independent variables used in the four hypotheses are the role of parents' party identification (socialization), ideological orientations, economic expectations, and the ethnic identities of voters.

Includes bibliographical references. This {{thesis is}} an attempt to explain and explore the role and {{influence}} of <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party</b> (МНР) in Turkish political life. This study examines the rise of МНР in recent years both as a political party and as a political movement. For this reason, MHP’s role and influence is evaluated in terms of its origins, history, strategies and ideologies. Fruthermore, the changing role and influence of the party is assesed within the context of changing historical conditions. In this period, a crises of dominant ideologies has influenced the rise of МНР and its ideology. Kemalism, which is deemed as the official ideology of Turkish state and society throughout the history of Republic, has been challenged by Islamist movements and Kurdish nationalism in 1990 s. Furthermore, the New Right as the hegemonic ideology of 1980 s has lost its appeal and employed an extreme nationalist discourse to a great extent in recent years. In the ideological climate of 1990 s, which is strongly influenced by competing, intermixing and changing nationalisms, the МНР nationalism has become a rising and influential ideology by articulating the dominant ideologies. Within the framework of above argument, this study adresses the changing ideology and political strategies of the МНР. Arslan, EmreM. S...|$|E

The study basically asked two important questions about Euro-skepticism and answered each question by testing four main hypotheses. The hypotheses were tested on two different parties,,the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party</b> and the Felicity Party, and on two different events (on December 17, 2004 and on October 03, 2005). Since the study had 4 general hypotheses, the total hypothesis testing occurred 16 times. To be able to prove the hypotheses, the content analysis technique was used on the data that was collected from two newspapers: pro-MHP Ortadogu and pro-SP Milli Gazete. Each hypothesis was tested by using the two sample z-Test formula. The findings show that the two decisions by the EU did not have any impact on religion-based and trust-based Euro-skepticism. Only the first event {{had an impact on the}} nationalism-based Euro-skepticism of both political parties and overall Euro-skepticism of the MHP.

Only one of them, trust-based, showed significance at the 0. 10 level. The results showed that the decisions of the European Union either did not change the Euro-skepticism or if there was a change it was in a negative way.

40|$|This edited {{collection}} {{looks at}} how {{political parties in}} Turkey actually work, inside and out. Departing from traditional macro-level analyses, the book offers a new sociological approach {{to the study of}} political parties, treating them as non-unitary entities composed of many different groups and individuals who both cooperate and compete with one another. The central proposition of the book is that parties must be studied as clusters of relationships in specific locales rather than as unitary ‘black boxes. ’ This ground-up approach provides new insights into the internal workings of political parties; why parties gain and lose elections and other political resources; {{and the ways in which}} power is negotiated and exercised in Turkey and beyond. Chapters include studies of Islamic and Islamist parties from the 1970 s to the present, ethnic Kurdish parties, center- and extreme right parties, and the far left, as well as independent candidates. The authors pay particular attention to relations – and the blurry boundaries [...] between parties and civil society groups, religious associations, non-governmental organizations, ethnic and socio-economic groups, and state institutions, and to the variability of external and internal party politics in different geographies such as Adana, Mersin, and Diyarbakir.

40|$|Turkey’s {{relations}} with the European Union (EU) are at a critical juncture. As of 2002, the process of adapting Turkey’s legal framework to the EU’s political membership criteria began in earnest. The legislative amendments carried out in this respect amount {{to one of the}} largest, most wide-ranging reform processes Turkey has ever experienced. At the level of legislation, it involves updating Turkey’s laws to ensure that the prerequisites of a stable, pluralist democracy are in place, and that human rights are respected. In order for these amendments to be passed, however, the reforms must also be continuously justified vis-à-vis key constituencies. In this respect, the reforms are not only interesting from the perspective of EU-Turkey relations. They come at a crucial time in Turkey’s domestic politics, and pose a challenge {{to some of the most}} fundamental divisions in the country’s political party system. For the secularist state elite, supporting the reforms entails loosening their grip on the state, and allowing the public expression of Muslim and Kurdish identities. For the Islamic party elites, it involves modifying their anti-Western rhetoric, and reconciling their interests with the universalist norms expressed in the EU’s membership criteria. Thus, successfully following through with the legal prerequisites of EU membership requires not only legal engineering, but also a radical shift in Turkey’s political culture. Against this background, this thesis addresses the question of how representatives of Turkey’s largest political parties have framed the reforms in public discourse. Specifically, using a qualitative and quantitative content analysis, it analyzes the debates in Turkey’s Grand National Assembly regarding a selection of key adaptation packages, and measures to what extent Turkish MPs, when justifying or opposing the amendments, have distanced themselves from the antagonistic ideologies with which they have been associated in the past. The analysis finds that they have. In general, all of the parties have moderated their antagonistic discourses, and have emphasized the inherent and universal validity of the norms underlying them. The only clear exception is the far-right <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Party,</b> whose MPs see the reforms as a threat to Turkey’s unity. Interestingly, the analysis also finds that among the more moderate parties, those traditionally associated with the secular, Westernized state elite have had the most difficulties in adapting to the EU’s criteria. The Islamic parties, including the Justice and Development Party currently in government, have consistently emphasized the need for strengthening civil society and guaranteeing the freedom of speech and conscience. Although this may to some extent be a matter of self-interest, there are also indications that this is not the case...|$|E
