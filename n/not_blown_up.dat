They wanted {{the end of the season}} to be a [...] "beautiful culmination of everything" [...] while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but [...] "Over There" [...] marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: [...] "One of the big themes of the show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line." [...] Wyman said that the parallel universe [...] "is a reminder to our viewers that your life is what your choices are." [...] The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of zeppelins or the Statue of Liberty if we didn't let it oxidize or the Grand Central Hotel, we're not making up. Had the Hindenburg <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>up,</b> zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the Empire State Building. That was the plan. We opened ourselves to the standard that it had to be possible." [...] Pinkner later elaborated, [...] "We're interested in world building and all that stuff is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real." [...] They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor Joshua Jackson are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of Peter a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend Geoff Johns, Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics. He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side. Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season.|$|E

60|$|The autumn {{afternoon}} was fading into evening. It had been cloudy weather, but the clouds had softened and broken up. Now they {{were lost in}} slowly darkening blue. The sea was perfectly and utterly still. It seemed to sleep, but in its sleep it still waxed with the rising tide. The eye could not mark its slow increase, but Beatrice, standing upon the farthest point of the Dog Rocks, idly noted that the long brown weeds which clung about their sides began to lift as the water took their weight, till at last the delicate pattern floated out and lay like a woman's hair upon the green depth of sea. Meanwhile a mist was growing dense and soft upon the quiet waters. It was <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>up</b> from the west, it simply grew like the twilight, making the silence yet more silent and blotting away {{the outlines of the}} land. Beatrice gave up studying the seaweed and watched the gathering of these fleecy hosts.|$|E
60|$|Now we may {{say that}} the battle had begun, and that the two ships were pledged by the general laws of courage and naval warfare to {{maintain}} the contest till one of them should be absolutely disabled, if <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>up</b> or sunk. And at this moment it might be difficult for a bystander to say with which of the combatants rested the better chance of permanent success. Mrs Lupex had doubtless on her side more matured power, a habit of fighting which had given her infinite skill, a courage which deadened her to the feeling of all wounds while {{the heat of the}} battle should last, and a recklessness which made her almost indifferent whether she sank or swam. But then Amelia carried the greater guns, and was able to pour in heavier metal than her enemy could use; and she, too, swam in her own waters. Should they absolutely come to grappling and boarding, Amelia would no doubt have the best of it; but Mrs Lupex would probably be too crafty to permit such a proceeding as that. She was, however, ready for the occasion, and greedy for the fight.|$|E

Subjects that I feel {{will never be}} of the slightest interest or consequence to me have been insisted upon with almost tiresome reiteration. Matters that should be useful and helpful to me-- gunpowder, to take but one example--I have been left in ignorance concerning. About all that I say nothing; people have done their best according to their lights, no doubt. When, however, we come to purity of motives, singleness of intention, then, I maintain, I am above reproach. The proof {{of this is that}} Providence has bestowed upon me the seal of its approval: I was <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>up.</b> Had my conduct been open to censure--as in certain quarters has been suggested--should I be walking besides you now, undamaged--not a hair turned, as the saying is? No. Discriminating Fate--that is, if any reliance at all is to be placed on literature for the young--would have made it her business that at least I was included in the debris. Instead, what do we notice!--a shattered chimney, a ruined stove, broken windows, a wreckage of household utensils; I, alone of all things, miraculously preserved. I do not wish to press the point offensively, but really it would almost seem that it must be you three--you, my dear parent, upon whom will fall the bill for repairs; Dick, apt to attach too much importance, maybe, to his victuals, and who {{for the next few days}} will be compelled to exist chiefly upon tinned goods; Robina, by nature of a worrying disposition, certain till things get straight again to be next door to off her head--who must, by reason of conduct into which I do not enquire, have merited chastisement at the hands of Providence. The moral lesson would certainly appear to be between you three. I--it grows clear to me-- have been throughout but the innocent instrument." ...|$|E

50|$|As soon as an {{invasion}} was confirmed, {{members of the}} 280th Field Company, Royal Engineers (based in Yorkshire), would rapidly advance north via Durham, Leadgate, Ebchester and Hexham and blow up more than 100 road, rail and foot bridges on the Tyne from the Rede Valley to Scotswood. The holes for the charges were already drilled (and the traces of many can still be seen to this day). Road approaches were to be mined and blocked by craters. The major bridges at Newcastle were to be mined but <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>up</b> until the last minute; this was to enable any withdrawal of British forces southwards.

50|$|In the {{vicinity}} of Khadakwasla Dam, there is the well-known National Defence Academy, the Institute of Advanced Technology (IAT) earlier collocated with CME, Dapodi and Central Water & Power Research Station (CWPRS). A few kilometres up the road lie Sinhagad Fort and the twin dams of Panshet and Varasgaon which mainly supply water for irrigation. Khadakwasla Dam burst at 0730 hrs on 12 July 1961, causing the greatest ever natural disaster to strike Pune. It was <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>up,</b> as some people have been led to believe-it simply collapsed {{at the point of}} greatest impulsive force, unable to withstand the destructive forces generated by three times the quantity of water gushing in from upstream than it was meant to store at peak capacity as placid water.|$|E
50|$|The {{locality}} adopted {{its name}} from a mineral spring first documented by chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf about 1748, later site of the Luisenbad spa, named after Queen Louise of Prussia. The area became a popular destination for day-trippers and, after its incorporation into the city of Berlin in 1861, a densely settled working-class district. From 1905 the sports field near the Berlin-Gesundbrunnen station, later Stadion am Gesundbrunnen, was the home ground of the Hertha BSC Berlin football club.The Humboldthain urban park, finished in 1876, from 1942 {{was the site of}} two large flak towers.

40|$|We {{examine the}} trade-related {{diffusion}} of R&D in three steps. First, using OECD and UNESCO data we provide {{an overview of}} global R&D expenditures. Second, we estimate the relation between sectoral R&D expenditures and growth. Finally, these R&D linkages are incorporated in WorldScan: a dynamic applied general equilibrium model for the world economy. We simulate trade liberalisation and analyse the effects on GDP in different regions. We find that the GDP effects of trade liberalisation are magnified considerably for some regions, notably Japan and South-East Asia, where for others, for example China and Sub-Saharan Africa, the GDP effects are <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>up</b> at all. These findings {{can be traced back to}} changing specialization patterns and changing import patterns. A region either specialises in R&D-intensive sectors or imports R&D-intensive goods. Some regions import the knowledge-intensive goods from knowledge-poor regions. Such a 'double unfortunate' trade and production pattern explains the results for Sub-Saharan Africa and China...|$|E
40|$|Heterotic orbifolds provide {{promising}} {{constructions of}} MSSM–like models in string theory. We investigate {{the connection of}} such orbifold models with smooth Calabi-Yau compactifications by examining resolutions of the T 6 /� 6 –II orbifold (which are far from unique) with Abelian gauge fluxes. These gauge backgrounds are topologically characterized by weight vectors of twisted states; one per fixed point or fixed line. The VEV’s of these states generate the blowup from the orbifold perspective, and they reappear as axions on the blowup. We explain methods to solve the 24 resolution dependent Bianchi identities and present an explicit solution. Despite that a solution may contain the MSSM particle spectrum, the hypercharge {{turns out to be}} anomalous: Since all heterotic MSSM orbifolds analyzed so far have fixed points where only SM charged states appear, its gauge group can only be preserved provided that those singularities are <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>up.</b> Going beyond the comparison of purely topological quantities (e. g. anomalous U(1) masses) may be hampered by {{the fact that in the}} orbifold limit the supergravity approximation to lowest order in α ′ is breaking down. 1...|$|E
