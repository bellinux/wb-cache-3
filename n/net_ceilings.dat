40|$|Abstract Background Mosquito-proofing homes {{was one of}} the {{principal}} methods of environmental management in the early 1900 s. House screening provides protection against malaria by reducing exposure to malaria parasites and has the added benefit of protecting everyone sleeping in the house, avoiding issues of inequity within the household. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether house screening protects people against malaria in Africa. It is hoped that this study will mark the beginning of a series of trials assessing a range of environmental interventions for malaria control in Africa. Design A 3 -armed randomised-controlled trial will be conducted in and around Farafenni town in The Gambia, West Africa, to assess whether screening windows, doors and closing eaves or installing <b>netting</b> <b>ceilings</b> in local houses can substantially reduce malaria transmission and anaemia compared to homes with no screening. Eligible houses will be sorted and stratified by location and the number of children in each house, then randomly allocated to the interventions in blocks of 5 houses (2 with full screening, 2 with screened ceilings and 1 control house without screening). Risk of malaria transmission will be assessed in each house by routine collections of mosquitoes using light traps and an anaemia prevalence study in children at the end of the main transmission period. Discussion Practical issues concerning intervention implementation, as well as the potential benefits and risks of the study, are discussed.

50|$|Wallyball {{is played}} in a racquetball court, which {{is divided into two}} halves by a net. The game is played like volleyball, with the added {{complexity}} that players may carom the ball off a side wall when playing it into the opponents' court. If a ball played over the <b>net</b> contacts the <b>ceiling,</b> the opponent's back wall, or both side walls without being touched by an opponent, the ball is ruled out of bounds. The pace of the game is generally fast, as the confined quarters encourage quick action and the walls often keep the ball conveniently in play.|$|R

The framework reflects a long learning process, e. g. how to reconcile sound public finance, political pressures and the detailed requirements for managing public expenditure. There was not only progress, but also regression (e. g. the budgetary process became hectic and short-sighted in the seventies and early eighties) and old ideas becoming relevant again, e. g. taxes should be low and stable, each generation should bear its own burden and the reintroduction of cost-benefit analysis in public decision-making...|$|R

There are separate chairs in front except on the Family saloon which has a three-seater single-piece bench seat at the front. Triplex safety glass is now throughout the car. There are dual screenwipers, a roof lamp, a rear blind which may be controlled from the driver's seat, locks on all doors and a driving mirror. A special design of bumpers is standard throughout the range. De luxe saloons have a sunshine roof, ash trays, cigar lighter, a parcel <b>net</b> on the <b>ceiling</b> and pillar pulls.

40|$|House design {{may affect}} an individual's {{exposure}} to malaria parasites, and hence to disease. We conducted a randomized-controlled study using experimental huts in rural Gambia, {{to determine whether}} installing a ceiling or closing the eaves could protect people from malaria mosquitoes. Five treatments were tested against a control hut: plywood ceiling; synthetic-netting ceiling; insecticide-treated synthetic-netting ceiling (deltamethrin 12. 5 mg/m 2); plastic insect-screen ceiling; or the eaves closed with mud. The acceptability of such interventions was investigated by discussions with local communities. House entry by Anopheles gambiae, the principal African malaria vector, was reduced {{by the presence of}} a ceiling: plywood (59 % reduction), synthetic-netting (79 %), insecticide-treated synthetic-netting (78 %), plastic insect-screen (80 %, P < 0. 001 in all cases) and closed eaves (37 %, ns). Similar reductions were also seen with Mansonia spp., vectors of lymphatic filariasis and numerous arboviruses. <b>Netting</b> and insect-screen <b>ceilings</b> probably work as decoy traps attracting mosquitoes into the roof space, but not the room. Ceilings are likely to be well accepted and may be of greatest benefit in areas of low to moderate transmission and when used in combination with other malaria control strategies...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{liberalization}} {{has been}} a controversial issue as there is little empirical evidence for its positive effects on economic growth. However, we find sizable welfare gains, 1 to 28 percent of permanent consumption though, consistent with the literature, the gain in the economic growth is ambiguous, - 0. 2 to 0. 7 percent. We apply a canonical growth model with endogenous financial deepening to Thailand, 1976 - 96. As effective bank transaction costs decline, more people take advantage of financial services. We estimate the gains by comparing model simulations under the historical episode of financial liberalization to those under a hypothetical continuation of financial repression.

40|$|Abstract Background Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) {{have proven}} {{instrumental}} in the successful reduction of malaria incidence in holoendemic regions during the past decade. As distribution of ITNs throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is being scaled up, maintaining maximal levels of coverage {{will be necessary to}} sustain current gains. The effectiveness of mass distribution of ITNs, requires careful analysis of successes and failures if impacts are to be sustained over the long term. Methods Mass distribution of ITNs to a rural Kenyan community along Lake Victoria was performed in early 2011. Surveyors collected data on ITN use both before and one year following this distribution. At both times, household representatives were asked to provide a complete accounting of ITNs within the dwelling, the location of each net, and the ages and genders of each person who slept under that net the previous night. Other data on household material possessions, education levels and occupations were recorded. Information on malaria preventative factors such as <b>ceiling</b> <b>nets</b> and indoor residual spraying was noted. Basic information on malaria knowledge and health-seeking behaviours was also collected. Patterns of ITN use before and one year following net distribution were compared using spatial and multi-variable statistical methods. Associations of ITN use with various individual, household, demographic and malaria related factors were tested using logistic regression. Results After infancy (< 1  year), ITN use sharply declined until the late teenage years then began to rise again, plateauing at 30  years of age. Males were less likely to use ITNs than females. Prior to distribution, socio-economic factors such as parental education and occupation were associated with ITN use. Following distribution, ITN use was similar across social groups. Household factors such as availability of nets and sleeping arrangements still reduced consistent net use, however. Conclusions Comprehensive, direct-to-household, mass distribution of ITNs was effective in rapidly scaling up coverage, with use being maintained at a high level at least one year following the intervention. Free distribution of ITNs through direct-to-household distribution method can eliminate important constraints in determining consistent ITN use, thus enhancing the sustainability of effective intervention campaigns...|$|R
