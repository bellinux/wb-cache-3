There were no radio talk shows or TV documentaries. In all the United States, there were maybe a half dozen groups, two hundred people active in all."

[...] While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting. They met twice a month and often invited doctors, psychiatrists, ministers and attorneys to address their meetings, even if the message was clearly disparaging to lesbians. Gittings recalled, [...] "At first we were so grateful just to have people— anybody— pay attention {{to us that we}} listened to and accepted everything they said, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> it was...anything that helped to break the silence, no matter how silly or foolish it may look to us today, was important." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E

Secure {{in the knowledge that}} practically no one had ever heard the thing, Slade eventually redid the record as We'll Bring the House Down, a fully realized project." [...] In early 2010, Classic Rock considered the album [...] "superior, reputation cementing" [...] and wrote: [...] "We'll Bring the House Down was cobbled together quickly after the band's Reading triumph, largely from the contents of their previous (overlooked) album, Return to Base." [...] Colin Harper of Record Collector said: [...] "Searching for the UK zeitgeist, 1979's now abjectly obscure Return to Base ironically had a pleasingly diverse, reinvigorated musical palette." ...|$|E

They reasoned that a festival was also a good opportunity to pull the residents out of the pervasive gloomy atmosphere brought by the Don Juan Tragedy.

2500|$|Part of {{this was}} due to the power Ben Dunn sees the Vatican as possessing. He at one point wrote that it may not speak of itself as being a world power but it is. That is because despite being the {{smallest}} country on Earth the Vatican's influence on world affairs is disproportionately immense by virtue of its moral and spiritual authority as the headquarters of Earth's largest religion. With over a billion adherents, a headquarters that is a Sovereign nation, a leader that is a world leader, it is a force in the world. Thus, it was only a small step to grant the (fictionalized) church also has a military force that would serve as Heaven's proxy if demons were to attack. In further explaining the concept, he added that [...] "If Hell were an actual physical place with physical manifestations then they would be subject to some of the physical laws of nature would they not? Of course that would mean Heaven too would be physical place. While this may not be so in our world it certainly is so in WNA's world. Therefore, things would progress differently. To the Vatican in WNA's world 'thou shalt kick Satan's ass!'." [...] However, in creating the character, Dunn sought to distinguish Areala from scantily clad bad girl antiheroines with which she might be confused. He was also desirous of creating a true hero, not an anti-hero. [...] "I made it a very strong point that she doesn't kill people, only demons", and that [...] "She believes everybody [...] <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> they've been [...] can be saved." ...|$|E

Spoken For is filled with songs that I pray the church will use." [...] He added that this album leaned more toward rock than Almost There.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to provide a}} profile of Shaun Hunt. Design/methodology/approach: Shaun {{provides}} a short biographical description of his life. He is then interviewed by Jerome. Findings: Shaun tells us about the long journey of recovery that he has made {{to the point where he}} is now a University lecturer. Research limitations/implications: In large group studies the individual gets lost in statistical tables and the lived experience is absent. Single case studies provide us with stories to nurture and encourage us all. Practical implications: Shaun says that we often miss the obvious question in our interactions with people with lived experience. “What happened to you?” seems a simple but telling conversation opener. Social implications: As Shaun says there are some amazing people who work in mental health services, but they are the ones who spoke to him and not to a “schizophrenic. ” Originality/value: As Shaun also says, “Never, ever give up hope, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> dark and <b>bad</b> things become, there is always a way back. ...|$|R
50|$|Pierre and Ève are {{permitted}} {{to return to the}} living {{for the express purpose of}} falling in love. But in the afterlife they have seen terrible things that they overlooked while living and attempt to prevent these things from occurring, rather than loving one another. After 24 hours, the pair die once more, having accomplished nothing besides saving a young girl, Marie Astruc, whose life Eve and Pierre promised her father (a man referred to in the boutique of the dead) they would improve. While they managed to succeed in their quest to better Marie's life they fail in the consummation of their love. This reinforces Sartre's view that one is condemned to follow one's choices (see determinism), <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> good or <b>bad.</b> He also shows that it is impossible to know if a choice is right, even if it is done with the best possible motivations. To Sartre, there is no absolute truth or morality. Instead, he suggests in this screenplay that destiny will always win over the power of life.|$|R

60|$|I {{have noticed}} {{through most of}} the {{hospitals}} that {{as long as there is}} any chance for a man, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> he may be, the surgeon and nurses work hard, sometimes with curious tenacity, for his life, doing everything, and keeping somebody by him to execute the doctor's orders, and minister to him every minute night and day. See that screen there. As you advance through the dusk of early candle-light, a nurse will step forth on tip-toe, and silently but imperiously forbid you to make any noise, or perhaps to come near at all. Some soldier's life is flickering there, suspended between recovery and death. Perhaps at this moment the exhausted frame has just fallen into a light sleep that a step might shake. You must retire. The neighboring patients must move in their stocking feet. I have been several times struck with such mark'd efforts--everything bent to save a life from the very grip of the destroyer. But when that grip is once firmly fix'd, leaving no hope or chance at all, the surgeon abandons the patient. If it is a case where stimulus is any relief, the nurse gives milk-punch or brandy, or whatever is wanted, ad libitum. There is no fuss made. Not a bit of sentimentalism or whining have I seen about a single death-bed in hospital or on the field, but generally impassive indifference. All is over, as far as any efforts can avail; it is useless to expend emotions or labors. While there is a prospect they strive hard--at least most surgeons do; but death certain and evident, they yield the field.|$|E
