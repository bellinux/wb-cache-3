40|$|We {{compute the}} O(1 /M,m_s) heavy quark and SU(3) {{corrections}} to B_s -> D_s e <b>nu</b> form <b>factors.</b> In {{the limit of}} vanishing light quark mass, B_s -> D_s e <b>nu</b> form <b>factors</b> are given {{in terms of the}} the B -> D e <b>nu</b> form <b>factors,</b> the leading order chiral parameter g, and two O(1 /M) chiral parameters g_ 1 and g_ 2. All the chiral parameters can be extracted, in principle, from other heavy meson decays. Analytic counterterms proportional to the strange quark mass are presented for completeness, but no predictive power remains when they are included. Anomalously large loop corrections warn of poor convergence of the heavy quark chiral symmetry expansion for these processes. This suggests that naive extrapolations of B → D form factors relying on heavy quark and chiral symmetries, as often used in monte carlo simulations of lattice QCD, may incur large errors.

In this study, an experimental investigation was conducted to explore the effect of twin counter and co-twisted tapes on heat transfer rate (<b>Nu),</b> friction <b>factor</b> (f) and thermal enhancement index (η). The twin counter twisted tapes (CTT) and twin co-twisted tapes (CoTT) were used as swirl flow generators in a test section. The tests were conducted using the CTT and CoTT with three different twist ratios (H/D) = 5, 10 and 15) for Reynolds numbers range between 7200 and 32, 400 under uniform heat flux conditions. The results show that Nusselt number (<b>Nu),</b> friction <b>factor</b> (f) and thermal enhancement index (η) increase with decreasing twist ratio (H/D) and the CTT is more efficient than the CoTT for heat transfer enhancement.

The maximum thermal enhancement index (η) obtained at the constant flow rate by the CTT with H/D = 5, 10 and 15, are 1. 58, 1. 44 and 1. 15 respectively, while those obtained using the CoTT with the same range of H/D are 1. 43, 1. 19 and 1. 04, respectively.
