5|$|The {{conversation}} {{poems are}} {{a group of}} eight poems composed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) between 1795 and 1807.

They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> society, and ask as if there is a place for simple appreciation of nature without having to actively dedicate one's life to altruism.|$|E

5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. <b>Nature</b> <b>and</b> wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E
