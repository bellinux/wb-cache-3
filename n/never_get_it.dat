25|$|Odin said that, {{given how}} she {{obtained}} it, she would <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> back. That is, with one exception: {{she could have}} it back if she could make two kings, themselves ruling twenty kings each, battle one another, and cast a spell so that each time one of their numbers falls in battle, they will again spring up and fight again. And that this must go on eternally, unless a Christian man of a particular stature goes into the battle and smites them, only then will they stay dead. Freyja agreed.|$|E
25|$|A fresh {{appreciation}} of the library began to emerge as the Council declared their intention to demolish it. The movement was led by artists and writers mainly of the 1960s generation {{who had grown up}} with it. Jonathan Meades appreciated the ‘guts and attack’ of the library and spoke negatively of the Council’s policies stating “you don’t get a car and <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> serviced”. Brutalist architecture was becoming more appreciated in the 21st Century with the listing of Preston bus station, Trellick Tower and the rejuvenation of Park Hill in Sheffield. Books celebrating brutalism were published and television shows featuring brutalist buildings began to feature with greater regularity. Central library was chosen as the location of MI5 HQ in BBC series The Game.|$|E

500|$|Howard {{became the}} first NBA athlete who entered the draft early and {{graduated}} with his academic class, thus fulfilling a promise he had made to his grandmother {{on the last day}} he saw her alive. He told Mitch Albom that when he made it to the NBA, he realized how much leisure time the multimillionaire players had and decided to do something productive instead of find ways to spend his new riches. [...] "I knew if I kept pushing it off, I'd <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> done", he said. He completed his final 32 course hours by taking summer classes in 1994 during the NBA off-season. He took correspondence classes and independent study courses during the following season, studying on road trips and mailing in his papers from the nearest post office. In the end, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in radio-television communication (with a minor in business) at Michigan. He told Albom that earning his degree made him a better example when speaking about staying in school. [...] Although Howard had spent the prior year playing in the NBA, he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates. [...] During the graduation, keynote speaker Marian Wright Edelman paid special recognition to Howard and Fab Five teammates King and Jackson, who graduated together, and noted that Howard's graduation made him a role model for children.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if we lose our freedom, we may <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E

[...] But Taiwan is a part of China. [...] If money and reinforcements fail to get through to Taiwan, we will lose it and <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> back.

2500|$|On July 25, 2011, Erica stabs David {{after she}} escapes from the {{clutches}} of her look-alike Jane Campbell that posed as her. She is taken to Oak Haven and there she first sees Janet [...] "from another Planet" [...] Green Dillon, then Annie Lavery, then Marian Colby Chandler, and finally she sees Dixie Cooney Martin. On August 11, 2011, Jane takes the blame for stabbing David so Erica can remain free. During the last few episodes of the show Erica is offered a chance to write a movie about her book (much {{to the dismay of}} Jack who wants to marry her). This leads to a fallout between the two at Stuart Chandler's welcome home party. As Jack leaves the party, Erica admits in front of everyone that she needs and loves Jack, to which he replies by bitterly telling her, Rhett Butler-style, that [...] "frankly," [...] he doesn't give a damn about what she needs. [...] "This is not the ending I wanted," [...] Erica says to Opal. [...] "Oh, you've done it, now you'll <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> back," [...] Opal tells her. [...] "Just watch me," [...] says Erica. As Erica goes after Jack, JR fires his pistol, ending the show. It is implied that the bullet has hit Erica as she is last to be shown before the screen blacks out.|$|E
2500|$|Reshika Udugampola was the {{youngest}} person to represent Sri Lanka at the London Olympic Games {{at the age of}} 18. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Udugampola attained qualification into the Games through one of FINA's universality places because her fastest time of one minute and 4.23 seconds was 7.69 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] (FINA/Olympic Invitation Times) qualifying standard for the women's 100 metre freestyle. Udugampola spent time at Nunawading Aquatic Club in Melbourne to help prepare her for the Games. Prior to leaving for the Games, she said to the press about her excitement over taking part in London and called it [...] "a one in a lifetime chance and we may <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> again": [...] "London is going to be something different. I’ve been training in Australia and I’m aiming for a national record, I don’t know if I will get it but I’m going to focus on that.” Udugampola participated in event's second heat on 1 August, finishing sixth out of seven athletes, with a time of one minute and 4.93 seconds. She finished in front of Magdalena Moshi of Tanzania (one minute and 5.80 seconds) but behind Madagascar's Aina Fils Rabetsara (one minute and 2.39 seconds) in a heat led by Jade Ashleigh Howard of Zambia (59.35 seconds). Overall she finished 44th out of 48 swimmers, and was unable to advance into the semi-finals because she finished 10.51 seconds behind the slowest athlete who made the later stages.|$|E
