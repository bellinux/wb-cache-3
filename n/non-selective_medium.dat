5000|$|A {{small number}} of cells are used to {{inoculate}} parallel cultures in a <b>non-selective</b> <b>medium.</b> The cultures are grown to saturation to obtain equal cell densities. The cells are plated onto selective media to obtain the number of mutants (r). Dilutions are plated onto rich medium to calculate {{the total number of}} viable cells ( [...] Nt [...] ). The number of mutants that appear in the saturated culture is a measure of both the mutation rate and when the mutants arise during the growth of the culture: mutants appearing early in the growth of the culture will propagate many more mutants than those that arise later during growth. These factors cause the frequency ( [...] r / Nt [...] ) to vary greatly, even if the number of mutational events ( [...] m [...] ) is the same. Frequency is not a sufficiently accurate measure of mutation and the mutation rate (m / Nt) should always be calculated.|$|E

40|$|The author {{reviews the}} more {{important}} studies on the laboratory diagnosis of gonococcal infections published since 1964. The most significant new developments are the use (a) of fluorescent antibody techniques and (b) of selective media for the identification and isolation of Neisseria (N.) gonorrhoeae. The sensitivity and specificity of culture methods and of the direct “delayed” fluorescent antibody technique (FAT), both at their best, are very similar, but the FAT allows for more rapid reporting. The results of the direct “undelayed” FAT can be given even more rapidly, but, especially with specimens from women, it is less sensitive than culture or the direct “delayed” FAT. The use of a selective medium facilitates the recognition and identification of N. gonorrhoeae, but {{the advantage of a}} selective medium over a <b>non-selective</b> <b>medium</b> depends very much on the skill of the technical personnel involved. One disadvantage is the existence of gonococcal strains that are very sensitive to the antibiotics used hitherto for the suppression of Gram-positive contaminants.

BLS is prevalent in Asia and West Africa, where {{it was first reported}} in Nigeria and Senegal in the early 1980 s (4). Recently, molecular analysis of strains from Mali (2) and Burkina Faso (5) further confirmed the presence of BLS in West Africa. In Madagascar, BLS symptoms were first reported in the 1980 s by Buddenhagen but the causal agent was not unequivocally determined (1). To confirm Buddenhagen's observations using modern molecular typing tools, we surveyed several rice fields in the Antananarivo and Antsirabe districts in March 2013. BLS symptoms were observed on cultivated Oryza sativa grown under both upland and lowland conditions, with a proportion of diseased individuals varying from 30 % up to 80 %. Symptomatic leaves presenting water-soaked lesions that developed into translucent, yellow streaks with visible exudates at the surface were sampled. One to four centimeter long pieces of diseased leaves were ground using the Qiagen TissueLyser system at 30 rps for 30 s (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). The ground tissue was then macerated in 1 ml of sterile water for 1 h at 4 °C. Non-diluted and 10 -fold diluted tissue macerates were plated on semi-selective PSA medium (peptone 10 g/liter, sucrose 10 g/liter, glutamic acid 1 g/liter, bacto agar 16 g/liter, actidione 50 mg/liter, cephalexin 40 mg/liter, and kasugamycin 20 mg/liter) and incubated for 3 to 7 days at 28 °C. Single, yellow, Xanthomonas-like colonies were isolated on <b>non-selective</b> PSA <b>medium.</b> Diagnostic multiplex PCR was performed on single colonies for pathovar identification (3). Five strains that produced three diagnostic bands corresponding to the X. oryzae pv. oryzicola pattern were further analyzed for pathogenicity on 3 -week-old O. sativa cv. Nipponbare plants. Bacteria grown on PSA plates and adjusted to 1 × 108 CFU/ml were infiltrated into rice leaves with a needleless 1 -ml syringe (2 × 3 infiltrations per plant and strain). Seven days after incubation in the greenhouse (27 ± 1 °C with a 12 -h photoperiod), inoculated leaves showed water-soaked lesions that produced yellow exudates corresponding to those initially observed in rice fields and observed for leaves challenged with the X. oryzae pv. oryzicola reference strain BLS 256. Symptomatic leaf tissues were ground and plated on <b>non-selective</b> PSA <b>medium,</b> resulting in colonies with typical Xanthomonas morphology that were confirmed as X. oryzae pv. oryzicola by multiplex PCR typing (3), thus fulfilling Koch's postulates.

The regular detergent will show more mutagenic effect, followed by environment friendly detergent. The Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity plate incorporation assay was used for testing this hypothesis. In the first stage, toxicity assay was performed.

Although the heteroplasmons were unstable and the homoplasmic components could be segregated by plating on selective media, the heteroplasmic state was often maintained beyond 19 cell divisions when grown on <b>non-selective</b> <b>medium.</b> Homoplasmons of recombinant genotype from repulsion crosses were observed with a frequency of 7. 2, 9. 0, 11. 2 and 11. 4 percent; two crosses with the resistance markers in coupling had 5. 4 and 11. 5 percent recombinants. Under non-selective conditions, the mitochondrial marker {{derived from the}} haploid parent of a mating type predominated in zygote-daughter-cells; this asymmetrical distribution could be reversed by selective pressure for the marker transmitted with low frequency. The challenge with chloramphenicol and erythromycin of zygotes from crosses of resistance-markers in repulsion revealed that inter-mitochondrial complementation was not occurring...|$|E
40|$|Optimization {{of potato}} genetic {{transformation}} by Agrobacterium tumefaciens using hygromycin resistance as selective marker. The {{objective of this}} work is the optimization of a genetic transformation and a regeneration protocol of transgenic plants in Solanum tuberosum cv Désirée using hygromycin resistance as selective marker. The gene Cat 2 of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and the gene SU 2 of Gossypium hirsutum, both coding for catalases, have been used. Two antibiotic concentrations (5 and 10 mg. l - 1 of culture medium) combined with two preculture periods (5 and 20 days) on <b>non-selective</b> <b>medium</b> were tested. Coculture medium was supplemented with 10 mg. l - 1 of acetosyringone to test its effect on potato transformation. The addition of this phenolic compound to the coculture medium affected positively the regeneration aptitude of transgenic SU 2 plants. Only the combination of 5 mg. l - 1 of hygromycin and 20 days of preculture without antibiotic allowed the obtention of plants transformed with the gene SU 2. Screening of the rooted shoots with PCR showed 45 % of transgenic plants for both molecular constructions used...|$|E
40|$|Mating {{procedures}} for detection of mobilization of the Proteus mirabilis chromosome were re-investigated. The chromosome was mobilized by plasmid D, the previously used hybrid between plasmids P-lac and Rldrdl 9. About a 40 -fold increase in recombinant recovery {{correlated with the}} absence of swarming during mating and a lower temperature of in-cubation. The modification introduced was that conjugation was allowed to proceed on a <b>non-selective</b> supplemented minimal <b>medium</b> at 30 "C before washing and plating on selective media. Final incubation was also at 30 "C. This technique enabled eight additional chromosomal markers to be mapped. Polarized transfer of the chromosome was shown by gradient of transmission experiments using a previously described marker as reference, by linkage analysis with reference to proximal and distal markers and (less successfully) by interrupted mating on solid medium. Markers of plasmid D transferred at high frequency to all recombinants. The plasmid was stable in recombinants and could transfer itself and chromosomal markers of the new hosts in further matings. Resulting recombination of markers occurred at usual frequencies. The marker order, his- 1, ser- 2, ura- 2, pyrBl, trp- 3...|$|R
40|$|Nisin is a {{naturally}} occurring food antimicrobial that inhibits many Grampositive pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterial pathogen responsible for ~ 500 {{deaths in the}} U. S. annually. Factors known to counteract the nisin activity in a food matrix include: antimicrobial interaction with food components, insolubility, protease inactivation, and target cell-driven envelope modifications. Encapsulating nisin in liposomes can help protect nisin functionality by regulating its introduction to the external environment. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the encapsulation efficiency (%EE) of nisin within liposomes as a function of encapsulation method and the capacity of liposomal nisin to inhibit L. monocytogenes in fluid milk. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphotidyl-DL-glycerol (PG) were used to prepare three lipid molar formulations: PC, PC/PG 7 : 3, and PC/PG 6 : 4 (mol. %). Liposomes were formulated to entrap the self-quenching fluorophore calcein and nisin. Unencapsulated analyte was removed via size-exclusion chromatography, and percent EE was determined. To determine antilisterial activity of liposomes, fluid milk samples containing L. monocytogenes (4 log 10 CFU/mL) in combination with liposomal or unencapsulated nisin at 50 IU/mL were mixed and aerobically stored at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Surviving L. monocytogenes were enumerated via plating on a <b>non-selective</b> microbiological <b>medium</b> after 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours of incubation. Encapsulation of nisin via extrusion resulted in a mean EE% of 84. 20 %, 77. 33 % and 80. 78 % for PC, PC/PG 7 : 3, and PC/PG 6 : 4 liposomes, respectively. Freeze-thaw cycling formed liposomes without detectable fluorophore entrapment. L. monocytogenes populations grew to 5 log 10 CFU/mL after 72 hours at 5 degrees C and 8 log 10 CFU/mL at 20 degrees C after 48 hours. Unencapsulated nisin exerted statistically greater inhibition of Listeria in skim milk compared to liposomal nisin, regardless of incubation temperature. No statistically significant differences in Listeria populations exposed to free or encapsulated nisin in whole milk were observed at either incubation temperature. Results indicate storage temperature and presence of milk fat exert greater influence then nisin delivery (free vs. encapsulated) over Listeria inhibition. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and develop more effective means of liposome entrapment of nisin for the inhibition of foodborne bacterial pathogens...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{genetic transformation}} protocol {{has been developed}} for strawberry cv. Redcoat using Agrobacterium tumefadens. The protocol relies on a high frequency (84 %) shoot regeneration system from leaf disks. The leaf disks were inoculated with a non-oncogenic Agrobacterium tumefadens strain MP 90 carrying a binary vector plasmid pBI 121 which contains a chimeric nopaline synthase (NOS) promoter driven neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT II) gene and a cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S (CaMV 35 S) promoter driven, ß-glucuronidase (GUS) marker gene. The inoculated leaf disks, pre-cultured for 10 days on <b>non-selective</b> shoot regeneration <b>medium,</b> formed light green meristematic regions on selection medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. These meristematic regions developed into transformed shoots at a frequency of 6. 5 % on a second selection medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The selected shoots were multiplied on shoot proliferation medium {{in the presence of}} kanamycin. All such shoots were resistant to kanamycin and expressed varying levels of NPT II and GUS enzyme activity. Histochemical assays for GUS activity indicated that the 35 S promoter was highly active in meristematic cells of shoot and root apices. Molecular analysis of each transgenic clone confirmed the integration of both marker genes into the strawberry genome. Leaf disks prepared from transformed plants, when put through the second selection cycle on kanamycin, formed callus and exhibited GUS activity. The rooted transformed plants were grown in a greenhouse for further characterization. The protocol may be useful for improvement of strawberry through gene manipulations...|$|R
