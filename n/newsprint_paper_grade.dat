30|$|The results (Table  3) of {{the panel}} data {{analysis}} by model (5) show that <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> and printing and writing paper have a substitution relationship with the Internet as the economic level rises. However, the reductive effect of Internet use on printing and writing paper begins to manifest at a relatively low economic level while the effect on <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> is not observed until the economic level has risen substantially. Specifically, the economic levels are 14, 183 US$/person or more [(7.29 e− 05  −  5.14 e− 09  ×  14, 182) >  0  > (7.29 e− 05  −  5.14 e− 09  ×  14, 183)] and 21, 189 US$/person or more [(5.17 e− 05  −  2.44 e− 09  ×  21, 188) >  0  > (5.17 e− 05  −  2.44 e− 09  ×  21, 189)], respectively. Conversely, Hujala [19] reported that {{the spread of the}} Internet has reduced demand for <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper,</b> but has had a negligible impact on the demand for printing and writing paper. Latta et al. [20] showed that the spread of the Internet has driven the decline in demand for <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper,</b> while only in the United States and other OECD countries has the demand for printing and writing paper also decreased. For our analysis, we covered more countries and more recent years (104 countries for the period 1990 – 2014) than previous studies have (50 countries for the period 1990 – 2007 [19]; 6 major world regions for the period 1970 – 2011 [20]). As a result, we surmise that globally in recent years, a substitution relationship with Internet use is observed both for <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> and for printing and writing paper. However, because the models used for the regression analysis differ from those of previous studies, more detailed comparison between them is difficult. In <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper,</b> {{there is a possibility that}} as per capita GDP increased, the per capita demand decreased for the period 1990 – 2014 from the results (Table  3) by model (5). When we conducted the regression analysis using only per capita GDP as the explanatory variable for that period for model (5), the regression coefficient for per capita GDP was negative, confirming the statistical significance. This indicates that the demand for newsprint decreased as economic level rose in recent years after 1990. Looking at the time trend, in <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper,</b> the regression coefficient for the time trend was negative and was confirmed to be statistically significant. This demonstrates the presence of other factors with a reductive effect on demand, such as advances in technology for reducing the weight of <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper,</b> the reorientation towards digital media in the advertising industry, and improvement of Internet line speed. Meanwhile, in printing and writing paper, the time trend was not statistically significant, indicating that the impact on demand from other factors with a time trend is insignificant.|$|R

An inverse U-shaped quadratic relationship, such as an environmental Kuznets curve, was found between economic level and paper and paperboard demand, which saturates and begins to decline as economic level increases.

The present work introduces, for the first time, deinked recycled old newsprint as a new resource of electrical purposes paper. Impregnation of recycled deinked old <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper,</b> by linseed oil, enhances the breaking length of paper and remarkably improves its electrical properties i. e., the dielectric constant increases greatly and the a. c. conductivity decreases significantly due to impregnation. It {{was found that the}} electrical properties of deinked recycled old <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> and its linseed oil impregnated counterpart, are close to the electrical properties of paper made from the more expensive virgin wood pulps and their linseed oil impregnated counterparts. In a series of research articles, the authors and others threw light {{for the first time on}} the electrical properties of paper made from agricultural residues pulps, and their linseed oil impregnated counterparts. Some, of the investigated agricultural residues papers, showed electrical properties close to wood papers, or even superior to it. This motivated the authors to expand the studies, on electrical properties of paper, to other cheap and abundant raw materials. Recycled old newsprint is an abundant raw material that is cheaper than virgin wood pulps. Therefore, recycled deinked old <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> was chosen as a new raw material to study its electrical properties in this work.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of fracture mechanics to study the strength of paper webs. The main aim of fracture mechanics is to predict the critical combination of defect size, structure geometry and external loading {{that will lead to}} a catastrophic failure. To serve as a practical tool, the fracture testing must be carried out on lab-scale structures, and the predictions must be made for an arbitrary size of the structure and defect geometry. That is, transferability must prevail. As a starting point for this thesis, we found (in Paper II) that for a range of different <b>paper</b> materials (SC, <b>newsprint,</b> MWC, liner board, uting and sack paper), the static strength of large paper webs with an edge notch was excellently predicted using the J -integral failure criterion and isotropic deformation theory of plasticity as a material model. Fracture toughness testing was done on small lab-scale specimens. The web failure predictions were made using the Finite Element Method (FEM), and the verification was done using a custom-built static tensile tester - able to test 1. 8 m long a 1 m wide paper webs. The tools of fracture mechanics are rarely used by the paper industry. There are several reasons for this. For many paper materials and printing press situations, there exist no clear evidence that defects - such as holes, cuts and shives - are responsible for the majority of web breaks. Another reason, which is an important topic in this thesis, is that for a given notch length and web size, the web failure conditions predicted by the standard fracture mechanics theory, is a factor 2 - 3 times higher than that experienced in a printing press for the same notch length. Skew web-tension profiles (caused by baggy webs or non-aligned rollers), moisture induced effects during printing, out-of-plane deformation such a buckling (amplified by a pressurized turner bar) and low basis weight areas around a defect are all examples of factors that are not accounted for in the standard laboratory fracture testing and predictions of web strength - {{and at the same time}} are present in a printing press situation. These factors are all believed to reduce the strength of a paper web. This thesis has addressed how all these factors can be taken into account when estimating the web strength. In the first article we wanted to test the hypothesis that some of the variation seen in the strength of notched paper samples is caused by variation in the basis weight close to the notch tip(s). By mapping the basis weight using a β-formation apparatus, and correlating the basis weight in the notch-tip region to the individual strengths, a relation between the local basis weight and the applied peak load was found. The distribution of floc-size and floc-orientation was found to be of importance to whether or not a correlation was found. For the SC and <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> <b>grades,</b> ocs and anti-ocs were oriented more strongly in the MD, as well as having a smaller average size, than what was observed in the copy <b>paper</b> <b>grade.</b> This explained why a much stronger correlation was found between the notch tip basis weight properties and the individual critical strengts of the copy <b>paper</b> <b>grade</b> than for the news and SC <b>paper</b> <b>grades.</b> Out-of-plane deformations will take place at the free notch edges in a notched paper loaded in tension. This is known as buckling, and will - compared to a sample that is prevented from buckling - drastically reduce its critical strength. In standard fracture toughness testing of paper, buckling is prevented. This will cause a situation quite different than in a printing press - where paper is free to buckle. From experiments on small paper samples, we found in Paper III that this buckling caused a strength reduction of 10 - 35 % depending on the notch length and <b>paper</b> <b>grade.</b> Through FEM simulations and by using the J -integral failure criterion, the strength reducing effect of buckling was successfully described (except for the smallest notch lengths). The degree of anisotropy and paper thickness were found to be important for the strength reducing effect of buckling. The strength reducing effect of buckling was found to decrease with both increasing anisotropy and material thickness. In Paper IV, buckling is further investigated - using a 3 D cohesive zone model. The model satisfyingly describes the experimental result from paper III. For small notches, the interaction between the process zone close to the notch tip and the buckle is found necessary to fully describe the observed strength reducing effect of buckling. A phenomenologically defined effective notch length - based on the shape of the damaged region - was defined from the simulations. In Paper V, three different loading situations - suspected of being detrimental to the runnability in a printing press - are investigated through numerical simulations of large paper webs. The factors investigated were buckling edge and center notches, skew web tension and a notch placed in a pressurized turner bar situation. Both buckling center and edge notches were shown to reduce the web strength compared to a web prevented from buckling. A skew web tension was also shown to decrease the web strength from 10 - 30 % depending on the notch length and applied web skewness. To investigate the possibility of simulating the turner bar pressure situation, experiments where an air pressure was applied to small center notched specimens were done. The experiments showed a reduction in critical strength (compared to no applied pressure) of 15 - 20 % depending on the amount of applied pressure and notch length. This was found to be in good agreement with the numerical results. The effect of an air pressure applied to center notched paper webs was, using FEM, shown to drastically reduce the critical web strength. When taking into account both free buckling and a 2 kPa surface pressure applied to the notched region, a ~ 45 % reduction in web strength (compared to a web kept in plane) was found.

In particular, prior research [17 – 21] exists that analyzes the impact of electronic media, such as computers and the Internet, on <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> and printing and writing paper demand. Zhang and Buongiorno [17] reported that the spread of electronic media, such as computers, in the United States between 1960 and 1991 had {{no impact on the}} demand for paper. However, the impact from electronic media recently has been confirmed, with Hujala [19] reporting that globally, the spread of the Internet has caused a decline in demand for <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper,</b> while the spread of computers has driven an increase in demand for office paper.

40|$|Abstract: In recycling, waste {{papers are}} {{segregated}} into various grades {{as they are}} subjected to different recycling processes. Highly sorted paper streams facilitate high quality end products and save processing chemicals and energy. Automated paper sorting systems offer significant advantages over human inspection in terms of worker fatigue, throughput, speed, and accuracy. As a consequence, many automated mechanical and optical paper sorting methods {{have been developed to}} fill the paper sorting demand during 1932 to 2009. Because of inadequate throughput and some major drawbacks of mechanical paper sorting systems, the popularity of optical paper sorting systems has increased. The implementation of the previous methods, while being a step forward in the large-volume automated sorting technology, is still complex, expensive and sometimes offers limited reliability. This research attempts to develop a smart vision sensing system that is able to separate the different <b>grades</b> of <b>paper</b> using chromaticity. For constructing template database, hue and saturation of the paper object image in a selected area are considered. The <b>paper</b> <b>grade</b> is identified based on the maximum occurrence of a specific template in the paper object image. The classification success rates for white <b>paper,</b> old <b>newsprint</b> <b>paper</b> and old corrugated cardboard are 95 %, 92 % and 90 %, respectively. Finally, the best result of the proposed method is compared with the results published in literature where waste <b>paper</b> <b>grade</b> identification systems were developed using other methods. The remarkable achievement obtained with the method is the accurate identification and dynamic sorting of all <b>grades</b> of <b>papers</b> using chromaticity, which is the best among the prevailing techniques of optical or electronic image based systems...|$|R
