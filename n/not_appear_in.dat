5|$|As with The Quatermass Xperiment, the {{screenplay}} for Quatermass 2 condenses {{many of the}} events of the original.

Several characters from the television version do <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the film, most notably Quatermass's daughter, Paula, and his assistant, Leo Pugh. Conversely, the character of Inspector Lomax reappears in the film version, having previously been in The Quatermass Xperiment, but does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the television version.

However, only his {{childhood}} is portrayed; {{the rest of}} his story, as it is described in Holinshed's Chronicles, does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> Shakespeare's play.
