40|$|<b>Neurobasal</b> defined {{culture medium}} has been {{optimized}} for survival of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons {{and is now}} widely used for many types of primary neuronal cell culture. Therefore, we were surprised that routine medium exchange with serum- and supplement-free <b>Neurobasal</b> killed as many as 50 % of postnatal hippocampal neurons after a 4 h exposure at day in vitro 12 – 15. Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), in contrast, produced no significant toxicity. Detectable Neurobasal-induced neuronal death occurred with as little as 5 min exposure, measured 24 h later. D- 2 -Amino- 5 -phosphonovalerate (D-APV) completely prevented <b>Neurobasal</b> toxicity, implicating direct or indirect N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated neuronal excitotoxicity. Whole-cell recordings revealed that <b>Neurobasal</b> but not MEM directly activated D-APV-sensitive currents similar in amplitude to those gated by 1 µM glutamate. We hypothesized that L-cysteine likely mediates the excitotoxic effects of <b>Neurobasal</b> incubation. Although the original published formulation of <b>Neurobasal</b> contained only 10 µM L-cysteine, commercial recipes contain 260 µM, a concentration in the range reported to activate NMDA receptors. Consistent with our hypothesis, 260 µM L-cysteine in bicarbonate-buffered saline gated NMDA receptor currents and produced toxicity equivalent to <b>Neurobasal.</b> Although NMDA receptor-mediated depolarization and Ca 2 + influx may support survival of young neurons, NMDA receptor agonist effects on development and survival should be considered when employing <b>Neurobasal</b> culture medium...|$|E

These cultures took approximately one month of time to grow sufficiently to warrant further passage. Neurospheres were split at 1 : 3 ratios by triturating NS pellets. It is important to stress here that our culture system favors slower growth than others but was developed to allow infection by RML scrapie prions in NS cultures (Giri et al. 2006). Neurosphere culture conditions that favor faster growth are not infected with prions (Herva et al. 2010). Although our cultures grow slowly, they are highly enriched with nestin positive cells (CNS stem/progenitor cells) and generate neurons and astrocytes after differentiation (data not shown). Therefore, in this report, we have employed slow growing NS culture protocol to model Aβ genesis, oligomerization and aggregation in vitro. Genomic DNA from each NS line and mother’s tail were isolated and genotyped for transgenes as mentioned above.

We generated a reporter embryonic stem cell (ESC) line for Lmx 1 a and used it to track differentiation and extract neural progenitors from differentiating mouse ESCs. Lmx 1 a+ cells gave rise to functional cortical upper layer GABAergic neurons or dopaminergic neurons depending on the culture conditions used for differentiation. Under chemically defined <b>neurobasal</b> conditions, ESC differentiation resulted in widespread and transient expression of Lmx 1 a, without the addition of exogenous factors such as sonic hedgehog (Shh), Wnts, and/or bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). Under neutral conditions, Lmx 1 a+ cells express genes known to be downstream of Lmx 1 a and cortical hem markers Wnt 3 a and p 73. The majority of these cells did not express the ventral midbrain dopaminergic marker Foxa 2 or dorsal roof plate marker BMP- 2. Lmx 1 a+-Foxa 2 &# 8722; cells were primed to become SatB 2 + GABAergic neurons and appeared to be resistant to dopaminergic patterning cues. PA 6 coculture produced a substantial population of Lmx 1 a+ progenitors that also expressed Foxa 2 and on further differentiation gave rise to dopaminergic neurons at high frequency. We conclude that Lmx 1 a is a useful marker for the extraction of progenitors of GABAergic or dopaminergic neurons. We caution against the assumption that it indicates dopaminergic commitment during in vitro differentiation of ESCs. Indeed, in monolayer culture under <b>neurobasal</b> conditions, with or without the addition of Shh and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF 8), Lmx 1 a+ cells were predominantly progenitors of forebrain GABAergic neurons.

40|$|The study {{explored}} {{a modified}} primary culture system for fetal rat cortical neurons. Day E 18 embryos from pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were microdissected under a stereoscope. To minimize enzymatic {{damage to the}} cultured neurons, we applied a sequential digestion protocol using papain and Dnase I. The resulting sifted cell suspension was seeded at a density of 50, 000 cells per[*]cm 2 onto 0. 1 [*]mg/mL L-PLL-covered vessels. After a four-hour incubation in high-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (HG-DMEM) to allow the neurons to adhere, the media was changed to <b>neurobasal</b> medium that was refreshed by changing half of the volume after three days followed by a complete medium change every week. The cells displayed progressively robust neurite extension, and nonneuronal-like cells could barely be detected by five days in vitro (DIV); cell growth was still substantial at 14 DIV. Neurons were identified by β-tubulin III immunofluorescence, and neuronal purity within the cultures was assessed at over 95 % by both flow cytometry and by dark-field counting of β-tubulin III-positive cells. These {{results suggest that the}} protocol was successful and that the high purity of neurons in this system could be used as the basis for generating various cell models of neurological disease...|$|E

The object of this study was to demonstrate the presence and function of PAR- 1 and PAR- 2 in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). Methods DMNV neurons were isolated from neonatal rat brainstems using micro-dissection and enzymatic digestion. Neurons were cultured in <b>Neurobasal</b> med-ium A containing 2 % B 27 supplement. Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) was measured using fura- 2 based microspectrometry. Expression of PARs was detected by RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining. Key Result Thrombin and PAR- 1 agonist peptide activate PAR- 1 with a maximum change in [Ca 2 +]i expressed as DF/F 0 of 229 ± 14 % and 137 ± 7 %, respectively. Trypsin and PAR- 2 agonist peptide activate PAR- 2 with a maximum DF/F 0 change of 258 ± 12 % and 242 ± 10 %, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: Erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) {{remains a}} major complication from cavernous nerve injury during radical prostatectomy. Recently, stem cell treatment for ED {{has been widely}} reported. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the availability, differentiation into functional cells, and potential of human muscle-derived stem cells (hMDSCs) and human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) for ED treatment. Materials and Methods: We compared the neural differentiation of hMDSCs and hADSCs. Human muscle and adipose tissues were digested with collagenase, followed by filtering and centrifugation. For neural induction, isolated hMDSCs and hADSCs were incubated in <b>neurobasal</b> media containing forskolin, laminin, basic-fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor for 5 days. Following neural induction, hMDSCs and hADSCs were differentiated into neural cells, including neurons and glia, in vitro. Results: In neural differentiated hMDSCs (d-hMDSCs) and differentiated hADSCs (d-hADSCs), neural stem cell marker (nestin) showed a significant decrease by immunocytochemistry, and neuronal marker (β-tubulin III) and glial marker (GFAP) showed a significant increase, compared with primary hMDSCs and hADSCs. Real-time chain reaction analysis and Western blotting demonstrated significantly elevated levels of mRNA and protein of β-tubulin III and GFAP in d-hADSCs compared with d-hMDSCs. Conclusions: We demonstrated that hMDSCs and hADSCs can be induced to undergo phenotypic and molecular changes consistent with neurons. The neural differentiation capacity of hADSCs was better than that of hMDSCs...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{efficiently}} culture primary chromaffin progenitors from the adult bovine adrenal medulla in a defined, serum-free monolayer system. Tissue is dissociated and plated for expansion under support by the mitogen {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF). The cultures, although not homogenous, contain a subpopulation of cells expressing the neural stem cell marker Hes 3 that also propagate. In addition, Hes 3 is also expressed in the adult adrenal medulla from where the tissue is taken. Differentiation is induced by bFGF withdrawal and switching to <b>Neurobasal</b> medium containing B 27. Following differentiation, Hes 3 expression is lost, and cells acquire morphologies and biomarker expression patterns of chromaffin cells and dopaminergic neurons. We tested the effect of different treatments that we previously showed regulate Hes 3 expression and cell number in cultures of fetal and adult rodent neural stem cells. Treatment of the cultures with a combination of Delta 4, Angiopoietin 2, and a Janus kinase inhibitor increases cell number during the expansion phase without significantly affecting catecholamine content levels. Treatment with cholera toxin does not significantly affect cell number but reduces the ratio of epinephrine to norepinephrine content and increases the dopamine content relative to total catecholamines. These data suggest that this defined culture system can be used for target identification in drug discovery programs and that the transcription factor Hes 3 may serve as a new biomarker of putative adrenomedullary chromaffin progenitor cells...|$|E
