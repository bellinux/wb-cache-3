50|$|In the gas phase, i.e. in {{the flames}} {{or in the}} smoke, the {{combustible}} {{can not be separated}} from the oxidizer, and the only possible action consists of cooling down. In this case, water droplets are evaporated in the gas phase, thereby lowering the temperature and adding water vapour making the gas mixture <b>non</b> <b>combustible.</b> This requires droplets of a size less than about 0.2 mm. In fire fighting, this is referred to as gas cooling or smoke cooling.|$|E

50|$|Under floor radiant {{systems are}} {{evaluated}} for sustainability through {{the principles of}} efficiency, entropy, exergy and efficacy. When combined with high performance buildings, under floor systems operate with low temperatures in heating and high temperatures in cooling in the ranges found typically in geothermal and solar thermal systems. When coupled with these <b>non</b> <b>combustible,</b> renewable energy sources the sustainability benefits include reduction or elimination of combustion and greenhouse gases produced by boilers and power generation for heat pumps and chillers, as well as reduced demands for non renewables and greater inventories for future generations. This has been supported through simulation evaluations and through research funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Fraunhofer Institute as well as ASHRAE.|$|E
40|$|Along {{with many}} advantages, wood as {{traditional}} building material {{also has some}} disadvantages. One {{of them is the}} flammability. The most usual way to improve the fire performance of wood is by treating it with fire retardants that can be applied to wood composite products during manufacture, pressure impregnated into solid wood or wood products or added as a paint or surface coating. Fire retardants are formulated to control ignition, flame spread on the wood surface and {{to reduce the amount of}} heat released from wood. Fire retardants cannot make wood <b>non</b> <b>combustible.</b> According to the European reaction-to-fire “Euroclasses”classification system for construction products, wood treated with fire retardant can meet the requirements of Euroclass B, whereas ordinary wood products typically fall into class D. This article attempts to bring together information related to the burning of wood, fire performance of wood, types of fire retardants and mechanism of fire retardancy. Fire retardant coatings and chemical impregnation by pressure-treating are described separately...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Tobacco use has seriously {{damaging}} {{effects on}} nearly every system in the body. It {{is the leading cause}} of preventable death in the world and an important cause of premature death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India is home to 12 % of the world’s smokers. Approximately 900, 000 people die every year in India due to smoking as of 2009. There is evidence that smoking can cause at least 50 different diseases, including 30 % of all cancers, 90 % of all lung cancers, 30 % of all ischaemic heart disease and strokes, and 70 % of chronic lung diseases. The first area of the body to be affected by tobacco is the oral cavity. The use of both combustible and <b>non</b> <b>combustible</b> forms of tobacco increases the risk of coronal and root caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer. Tobacco use is associated with oral precancerous lesions such as leukoplakia, erythroplakia and other mucosal lesions. Various models like 5 A’s and 5 R’s contribute in tobacco cessation. Medications are available worldwide which help people to quit tobacco. Dentists also play an important role in promoting tobacco cessation. Tobacco use being a public health problem is an important issue to be dealt by dentists and healthcare workers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBiogas is a green {{sustainable}} {{source of}} energy. Biogas mainly consists of combustible methane and <b>non</b> <b>combustible</b> carbon dioxide. Dry reforming reaction {{is of particular}} interest in the context of biogas as both main components of biogas (methane and carbon dioxide) are consumed to produce hydrogen rich syngas. Design and development of a fixed bed type reactor was carried out for reforming of biogas. The chemical equilibrium model was used for predicting the dry reforming reaction product composition followed by experimentation. In prediction of the product gas two ratios for biogas CH 4 : CO 2 = 1 : 1 and CH 4 : CO 2 = 1. 5 : 1 were considered in the temperature range of 300 to 1000 °C with the pressure at atmospheric. The catalyst γ -Al 2 O 3 with 10 % Ni was used for the dry reforming reaction. Experimentations were conducted with different Gas Hourly Space Velocity, temperature and biogas composition. Encouraging simulated and experimental results were obtained with the yield of almost 49 % volume of H 2 and 45 % volume of CO with very low levels of CO 2. Product syngas can be used in the engine for complete combustion and to fulfill the stringent emission norms. Syngas can be used as fuel in the fuel cell application for the remote integrated power generation system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFire safety {{engineering}} is nowadays {{an important way}} to improve safety in a large variety of buildings. Whatever the typology of building, {{one of the key}} points in order to evaluate the consequences of a fire consists in the ability in predicting the fire growth and total heat release rate inside the building. The beginning of such a modeling consists in evaluating the heat release rate of elementary component of the fire. In the specific case of warehouse storage, the pallets heat release rate is then crucial not only to predict fire growth inside the building and occupants' safety but to evaluate the total heat release rate for a generalized fire and consequences on the building environment too. A new model is then proposed to predict the heat release rate of a pallet in case of fire. This model consider the entire component located on this pallet, this means combustible that produce energy but also <b>non</b> <b>combustible</b> material that acts as a well. It also takes into account the arrangement of the combustible regarding that more ventilated is the fire, more important will be the power reached. Then, solving the global equilibrium between source and well enables to give a prediction of the heat release rate. This model was validated using a large number of fire tests achieved in the INERIS fire tunnel used as a large calorimeter. These tests include pallets that contain for example appliances, food products, toys, water bottle, clothes and some other. The comparison between the measured and computed heat release rate for those different products demonstrate the capability of the model...|$|E
40|$|Utilization of {{palm oil}} fuel ash (POFA) {{which is an}} abundantly {{generated}} waste by Malaysian palm oil industry in producing a new construction material is seen {{as one of the}} ways to reduce the quantity of this by-product disposed at landfill. This thesis presents an experimental study on the engineering properties and durability of aerated concrete consisting of POFA as partial cement replacement, known as POFA cement based aerated concrete. Two types of mixes are prepared. One consists of a control mix whereas another one consists of 20 percent of POFA. The latter has been found to give the highest strength as compared to any other replacements. More than one thousand specimens comprising cubes (70. 6 x 70. 6 x 70. 6 mm), panels (540 x 250 x 25 mm), mortar bars (25 x 25 x 250 mm) and prisms (40 x 40 x 160 mm), (40 x 40 x 50 mm) and (225 x 225 x 25 mm), plates (650 x 100 mm) and (885 x 270 x 25 mm) have been tested in this study. The influences of POFA with numerous replacement level and mixing constituents on compressive strength of aerated concrete have been investigated. The effects of curing methods on the compressive and flexural strengths of the specimens up to one year are also studied. Studies on the durability aspect of the mix are conducted to investigate its acid resistance, sulphate resistance, performance in sea water, carbonation, dimensional stability, as well as fire resistance. POFA aerated concrete is then used to produce panels for the investigation of their compressive strength. The experiments reveal that continuous water curing is the best method in assisting POFA aerated concrete for a higher strength than the ordinary Portland cement (OPC). A constant presence of moisture is significant for the strength development of POFA aerated concrete since pozzolanic reaction can only take place at the later age, after calcium hydroxide is available from the hydration. Utilization of POFA in aerated concrete improves the durability of the lightweight concrete when exposed to aggressive environment, such as acid, sulphate and sea water. The weight loss for OPC specimen is 3. 94 % from its original weight as compared to POFA aerated concrete which lost only 0. 9 % when immersed in hydrochloric acid solution for 1800 hours. Upon exposure to 10 % sodium sulphate solution, OPC mortar bar exhibit map cracks and expand as much as 14 times higher than POFA specimen. Besides that, POFA specimens also demonstrate higher durability to sea water when it exhibits lower strength reduction compared to plain aerated concrete after an exposure to marine environment for one year. The <b>non</b> <b>combustible</b> characteristic of this product and a very low influence on fire growth fulfills the requirement of the highest Class 0 under Clause 204 A in Building By-Law (1984). Finally, the study shows that POFA aerated concrete mix can be used to produce panels with adequate x 25 strength as non load-bearing element in construction...|$|E
