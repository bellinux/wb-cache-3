500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, {{authors of}} Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), noted {{the lyrics of}} the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing {{for the return of}} an ex-boyfriend." [...] Spears said [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is a song [...] "every girl can relate to. She regrets it. She wants him back." [...] The lyrics, however, caused {{controversy}} in the United States, because the line [...] "Hit me baby one more time" [...] supposedly has sadomasochistic connotations. As a response, the singer said the line [...] "doesn't mean physically hit me. [...] It means just give me a sign, basically. I think it's kind of funny that people would actually think that's what it meant." [...] Contemporary author Ben Shapiro deemed the song's lyrics as suggestive, mostly [...] "Oh baby, baby / The reason I breathe is you / Boy, you got me blinded / Oh pretty baby / There's <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't do" [...] and [...] "When I'm not with you I lose my mind / Give me a sign / Hit me baby one more time".|$|E
2500|$|The Better Boston Group is a {{political}} group that split from the Boston Bypass Independents in October 2007 under the leadership Cllr Anne Dorrian. She had unsuccessfully stood for leadership of the BBI group after their landslide victory in April 2007. It has four councillors on Boston Borough Council. Cllr Brian Rush, the other unsuccessful candidate for Party leadership in April 2007, of the group said of the Boston Bypass Independents that [...] "We came in on a typhoon and we {{are nothing more than}} a gentle breeze now. It appears to me that we haven't done anything yet. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can put my hand on and say the BBI have thought of that, the inspiration was there and they have carried it through." [...] The group criticised the record of the BBI, including their approval of the Lincolnshire County Council Transport Strategy for Boston. A deal with the county council was struck to aid the BBI with the bypass proposal if they agreed not to stand in the next county council elections, prompting two councillors to resign. The chairman of the Boston Bypass Pressure Group also called on Cllr Austin and his deputy, Cllr Peter Jordan to resign over the deal with Lincolnshire Council. Both Cllrs Austin and Jordan vigorously denied any such deal and there were four BBI candidates in the subsequent County Council elections in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
