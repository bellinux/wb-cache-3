These redox activities were greater {{than could be}} attributed to contamination of the glyoxysomal fractions in which 1. 4 % of the protein was mitochondrial and 5 % endoplasmic reticulum. The NADH:ferricyanide reductase activity in the glyoxysomes was greater than the palmitoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) oxidation activity which generated NADH at a rate of 340 <b>nanomole</b> electrons per minute per milligram glyoxysomal protein. Palmitoyl-CoA oxidation could be coupled to ferricyanide or cytochrome c reduction. Complete oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA, yielding 14 <b>nanomole</b> electrons/per <b>nanomole</b> palmitoyl-CoA, was demonstrated with the acceptors, NAL, cytochrome c, and ferricyanide.

Upon illumination of 8 -day-old etiolated wheat seedlings with white light, the ethylene production rate increased initially, due to the activation of ethylene-forming activity, but subsequently declined to a low level (0. 1 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram per hour) {{at the end of the}} 6 -hour illumination. This light-induced decline in ethylene production rate resulted from a decline (more than 35 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram) in ACC level, which was accompanied by a corresponding increase in 1 -(malonylamino) cyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid content. These data indicate that illumination promoted ACC malonylation, resulting in reduced ACC level and consequently reduced ethylene production. However, light did not cause any significant increase in the extractable ACC-malonyltransferase activity. The effect of continuous white light on promotion of ACC malonylation was also observed in intermittent white light or red light.

The rate of dhurrin breakdown was 4. 8 <b>nanomoles</b> per hour in the shoot and 1. 4 <b>nanomoles</b> per hour in the root. The rate of dhurrin accumulation in the shoot of 4 - to 5 -day-old seedlings was high but decreased with age until at the peak period of dhurrin accumulation, the rates of dhurrin synthesis and breakdown were equal. Using a first order equation (an approximation) the rate of dhurrin synthesis (which equals accumulation plus breakdown rates) was 17. 4 <b>nanomoles</b> per hour in the shoot and 4. 1 <b>nanomoles</b> per hour in the root. In both tissues, the breakdown rate was between 27 and 34 % of their synthetic capacity within the experimental period.

40|$|Roots of intact 5 -day-old maize (Zea mays L.) {{seedlings}} {{were exposed}} to 3 micromolar Cd during a 7 -day period. Cysteine, γ-glutamylcysteine, glutathione (GSH), and Cd-induced acid-soluble thiols (ASTs), including phytochelatins, were quantified in roots and shoots. Adaptation to Cd and its cost to seedling development were evaluated by measuring Cd content, tissue fresh weight, and rate of root elongation. Roots contained 60 to 67 % of the Cd in the seedlings between 4 and 7 days of exposure. Exposure to Cd decreased the fresh weight gain in roots from day 4 onward without affecting the shoots. Between days 1. 5 and 3. 5 of Cd treatment, roots elongated more slowly than controls; however, their growth rate recovered thereafter and exceeded that of controls. Exposure to Cd did not appreciably affect the concentration of cysteine in the seedlings. However, the initial low concentration of γ-glutamylcysteine increased (after a lag of 6 hours in roots and 2 days in shoots), reaching a plateau by day 6 at 28. 5 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram of fresh weight in roots and by day 5 at 19. 1 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram of fresh weight in shoots. During the first 9 hours of Cd exposure, the concentration of GSH in roots decreased dramatically (at 31. 6 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram of fresh weight per hour) and thereafter decreased more slowly than in controls. The depletion of GSH in the roots (366 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram of fresh weight) matched the synthesis of ASTs (349 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram of fresh weight) during the first 48 hours. The concentration of ASTs in roots increased steadily thereafter to reach 662. 2 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram of fresh weight by 6 days of Cd exposure. In shoots, Cd had little influence on the concentration of GSH, but ASTs still accumulated to 173. 3 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram fresh weight after 5 days. The molar ratio of thiols in ASTs to Cd increased {{to a maximum of}} 10. 24 in roots after 4 hours and of 4. 25 in shoots after 2 days of Cd exposure. After 4 days, the ratio reached a plateau of approximately 2 in roots and between 2 and 3 in shoots, as if a steady state of Cd chelation had been achieved in both organs. The plateau coincided with recovered root elongation or an adaptation to Cd. The reduced fresh weight gain of the roots during this time, however, indicated that the synthesis of Cd-induced thiols was at a cost to root development...|$|R

40|$|The work of deWardener {{and colleagues}} stimulated longstanding {{interest}} in natriuretic hormones (NH). In {{addition to the}} atrial peptides (APs), the circulation contains unidentified physiologically-relevant NHs. One NH {{is controlled by the}} central nervous system (CNS) and likely secreted by the pituitary. Its circulating activity is modulated by salt intake and the prevailing sodium concentration of the blood and intracerebroventricular fluid, and contributes to postprandial and dehydration natriuresis. The other NH, mobilized by atrial stretch, promotes natriuresis by increasing the production of intrarenal dopamine and/or nitric oxide. Both NHs have short (< 35 minutes) circulating half lives, depress renotubular sodium transport, and neither requires the renal nerves. The search for NHs led to endogenous cardiotonic steroids (CTS) including ouabain-, digoxin-, and bufadienolide-like materials. These CTS, given acutely in high <b>nanomole</b> to micromole amounts into the general or renal circulations, inhibit sodium pumps and are natriuretic. Among these CTS, only bufalin is cleared sufficiently rapidly to qualify for an NH-like role. Ouabain-like CTS are cleared slowly, and when given chronically in low daily <b>nanomole</b> amounts, promote sodium retention, augment arterial myogenic tone, reduce renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, suppress nitric oxide in the renal vasa recta, and increase sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure. Moreover, lowering total body sodium raises circulating endogenous ouabain. Thus, ouabain-like CTS have physiological actions that, like aldosterone, support renal sodium retention and blood pressure. In conclusion, the mammalian circulation contains two non-AP NHs. Identification of the CNS NH should be a priority...|$|E

These results show clearly that 5 -lipoxygenase metabolites can initiate the extravascular accumulation of bovine neutrophils in vivo.

The fully expanded second leaves of wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. cv Avalon) were fumigated with either 200 or 400 <b>nanomoles</b> per mole O 3 for between 4 and 16 hours. This reduced significantly the light-saturated rate of CO 2 uptake and {{was accompanied by a}} parallel decrease in stomatal conductance. However, the stomatal limitation, estimated from the relationship between CO 2 uptake and the internal CO 2 concentration, only increased significantly during the first 8 hours of exposure to 400 <b>nanomoles</b> per mole O 3; no significant increase occurred for any of the other treatments. Analysis of the response of CO 2 uptake to the internal CO 2 concentration implied that the predominant factor responsible for the reduction in light-saturated CO 2 uptake was a decrease in the efficiency of carboxylation. This was 58 and 21 % of the control value after 16 hours at 200 and 400 <b>nanomoles</b> per mole O 3, respectively. At saturating concentrations of CO 2, photosynthesis was inhibited by no more than 22 % after 16 hours, indicating that the capacity for regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate was less susceptible to O 3. Ozone fumigations also had a less pronounced effect on light-limited photosynthesis. The maximum quantum yield of CO 2 uptake and the quantum yield of oxygen evolution showed no significant decline after 16 hours with 200 <b>nanomoles</b> per mole O 3, requiring 8 hours at 400 <b>nanomoles</b> per mole O 3 before a significant reduction occurred. The photochemical efficiency of photosystem II estimated from the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence and the atrazine-binding capacity of isolated thylakoids demonstrated that photochemical reactions were not responsible for the initial inhibition of CO 2 uptake.

There were rapid changes in whole leaf F 2, 6 BP levels when the light intensity was altered. High F 2, 6 BP levels in the dark were not observed after short photosynthetic periods. Results obtained with barley primary leaves support the suggestion that F 2, 6 BP is involved in regulating the flow of photosynthate from the chloroplast to sucrose. Extractable sucrose-phosphate synthase activity was inversely related to barley primary leaf F 2, 6 BP levels.

However, GABA in the medium contained 78 % of the radioactivity found in extracellular l-Glu metabolites. Incubation with l-[1 - 14 C]Glu resulted in the appearance of unlabeled GABA, demonstrating its production through decarboxylation at carbon 1.

The exact end location of C-terminal structures was also established. Together, the analyses permit the definition of terminal regions and blocking groups, thus facilitating the delineation of remaining structures...|$|E
40|$|Combined use of {{chemical}} degradation, derivatization, and tandem mass spectrometry for rapid structural characterization of toxic cyclic peptides from blue-green algae at the <b>nanomole</b> level is described. Previously, all blue-green algal toxins were thought {{to belong to a}} family of seven-residue cyclic peptides, having the general structure cyclo-D-Ala-L-Xaa-erythro-beta-methyl-D-isoaspartic acid-L-Yaa-Adda-D-isoglutamic acid-N-methyldehydroalanine, where Xaa and Yaa represent variable amino acids of the L configuration and Adda is 3 -amino- 9 -methoxy- 2, 6, 8 -trimethyl- 10 -phenyl-deca- 4, 6 -dienoic acid. Structural characterization of two additional toxins indicates that further variability can exist within this family of naturally occurring toxic cyclic peptides. Isoaspartic acid and dehydroalanine can substitute for beta-methylisoaspartic acid and N-methyldehydroalanine, respectively...|$|E
40|$|A simple three-step assay {{has been}} {{developed}} {{for the analysis of}} <b>nanomole</b> quantities of glucose, fructose and sucrose from small plant samples in the presence of fructans. The assay of crude ethanol/water extracts proceeds by the sequential addition of the commercially available enzymes; hexokinase, phosphogluco-isomerase, and sucrose Phosphorylase. The assay was compared with conventional coupled assays for glucose and fructose, together with TLC and HPLC assays for total water-soluble carbohydrates. All assays showed similar results over the range of standards and plant samples tested. The assay {{has been developed}} for use on microtiter plate readers, allowing for the screening of large numbers of samples rapidly. Fructan content in the same plant samples can be calculated following the determination of total free and combined hexoses. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we reported that fragment Bb of bovine complement factor B activated bovine monocytes, {{as demonstrated by}} the uptake of 3 H-deoxyglucose. In the present study, the effects of Bb on the production of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by bovine monocytes was investigated. The production of superoxide was measured by the superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c. The change in absorbance was determined by a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 550 nm. Hydrogen peroxide production was measured by the horse-radish peroxidase-dependent oxidation of phenol red. The resulting color change was measured by a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 620 nm. Fragment Bb (20 micrograms/mL) induced the generation of 0. 96 +/- 0. 2 (mean +/- SEM) <b>nanomoles</b> of superoxide/ 2. 5 x 10 (5) monocytes at 5 min. The production of superoxide peaked at 15 min (1. 24 +/- 0. 3 <b>nanomoles).</b> The production of hydrogen peroxide was also rapid: 0. 195 +/- 0. 05 nanomoles/ 2. 5 x 10 (5) monocytes at 5 min with a peak at 15 min (0. 250 +/- 0. 04 <b>nanomoles).</b> These observations show that fragment Bb, which has serine protease activity, induces bovine monocytes to generate reactive oxygen intermediates such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide...|$|R
40|$|Tracerkinetic {{experiments}} were performed using l-[guanidino- 14 C]arginine, l-[U- 14 C]arginine, l-[ureido- 14 C]citrulline, and l-[1 - 14 C]ornithine to investigate arginine utilization in developing cotyledons of Glycine max (L.) Merrill. Excised cotyledons were injected with carrier-free 14 C compounds and incubated in sealed vials containing a CO 2 trap. The free and protein amino acids {{were analyzed using}} high performance liquid chromatography and arginine-specific enzyme-linked assays. After 4 hours, 75 % and 90 % of the 14 C metabolized from [guanidino- 14 C]arginine and [U- 14 C]arginine, respectively, was in protein arginine. The net protein arginine accumulation rate, calculated from the depletion of nitrogenous solutes in the cotyledon during incubation, was 17 <b>nanomoles</b> per cotyledon per hour. The data indicated that arginine was also catabolized by the arginase-urease reactions {{at a rate of}} 5. 5 <b>nanomoles</b> per cotyledon per hour. Between 2 and 4 hours 14 CO 2 was also evolved from carbons other than C- 6 of arginine at a rate of 11. 0 <b>nanomoles</b> per cotyledon per hour. It is suggested that this extra 14 CO 2 was evolved during the catabolism of ornithine-derived glutamate; 14 C-ornithine was a product of the arginase reaction. A model for the estimated fluxes associated with arginine utilization in developing soybean cotyledons is presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple method for the {{determination}} of a ferric iron pool in the free space of roots is described. Formation of this pool depended on the source of iron in the nutrient solution. During growth in water culture at pH 5 to 6 with Fe-ethylenediaminetetraacetate, a free space pool of 500 to 1000 <b>nanomoles</b> Fe per gram fresh weight was formed in the roots of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. Prélude), maize (Zea mays L. var. Capella), and chlorophytum (Chlorophytum comosum [Thunb. ] Jacques). No significant pool (less than 100 <b>nanomoles</b> per gram fresh weight) was formed with ferrioxamine. Upon impending Fe deficiency, bean and chlorophytum were able to mobilize this pool. Fe-deficient bean plants mobilized iron from the free space iron pool of another plant in the same vessel...|$|R
