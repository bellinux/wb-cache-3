500|$|Chesapeakes <b>nominal</b> <b>rating</b> is stated {{as either}} 36 or 38guns. Originally {{designated}} as a 44-gun ship, her redesign by Fox led to a rerating, apparently based on her smaller dimensions when compared to Congress and Constellation. Joshua Humphreys may have rerated Chesapeake to 38guns, or Secretary Stoddert rerated Congress and Constellation to 38 guns because they were larger than Chesapeake, which was rated to 36 guns. The most recent information on her rating is from the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, which states she was rerated [...] "from 44guns to 36, eventually increased to 38". Her gun rating remained a matter of confusion throughout her career; Fox used a 44-gun rating in his correspondence with Secretary Stoddert. In preparing for the War of 1812 Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton directed Captain Samuel Evans to recruit the number of crewmen required for a 44-gun ship. Hamilton was corrected by William Bainbridge in a letter stating, [...] "There is a mistake in the crew ordered for the Chesapeake, as it equals in number the crews of our 44-gun frigates, whereas the Chesapeake is {{of the class of}} the Congress and Constellation." [...] Lastly, when sold for scrap by the Royal Navy in 1819, she was rated as a 48-gun ship.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{a theory}} of the supply of inside money that is squarely based on optimisation, and which sets out from the question, 'As outside money has an opportunity cost that a mere promise to pay outside money does not, why is outside money used at all?'. The theory identifies the <b>nominal</b> <b>rate</b> of return on capital as the key determinant of the supply of inside money. So just as the <b>nominal</b> <b>rate</b> of return on capital {{is the cost of}} demanding money, so the <b>nominal</b> <b>rate</b> of return is identified here as the reward for supplying (inside) money. And just as the demand for money is negatively related to the <b>nominal</b> <b>rate</b> of return on capital, so the supply of inside money is positively related to the <b>nominal</b> <b>rate</b> of return on capital. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Is it {{important}} for central banks to set positive <b>nominal</b> interest <b>rates</b> {{and as a}} consequence make profits from printing money balances (seignorage) ? In a two period economy under entrepreneurial risk and credit frictions, optimal interest rate policy calls for setting positive <b>nominal</b> <b>rates.</b> Seignorage transfers provide insurance against idiosyncratic contingencies and credit frictions in the asset markets. In a finite horizon economy, optimal interest rate policy calls for higher <b>nominal</b> <b>rates</b> in the long-run and lower <b>nominal</b> <b>rates</b> in the short-run. Lastly, we investigate an alternative policy-money supply rules. Money supply rules imply a multiplicity of equilibria. We will construct economies where optimal allocations under interest rate rules are identical to optimal allocations under money supply rules. The same money supply rule that implied an allocation identical to the one with optimal interest rate rules can give another allocation that is far from the optimal allocation under interest rate rules. ...|$|R
