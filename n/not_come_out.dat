5|$|In May 1707, Governor Dudley {{organized}} {{an expedition}} to take Port Royal led by John March. However, 1,600 men failed to take the fort by siege, and a follow-up expedition in August was also repulsed. In response, the French developed an ambitious plan to raid most of the New Hampshire settlements on the Piscataqua River. However, much of the Indian support needed never materialized, and the Massachusetts town of Haverhill was raided instead. In 1709, New France governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil reported {{that two-thirds of the}} fields north of Boston were untended because of French and Indian raids. French-Indian war parties were returning without prisoners because the New England colonists stayed in their forts and would <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

Two cavemen hunters {{encounter}} a large extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil-like substance. In 1998, in the same area, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by a black substance which seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him do <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>out.</b> A team of men wearing hazmat suits arrive and extract the boy's body. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, while investigating a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.|$|E

5|$|Before {{arrival at}} the Ely Road, a small {{detachment}} of troops were ordered across the Hemp Field to enter the village from the east. The larger group then charged at a hard gallop down the Mill Street incline through to Main Street. The rioters were found making a stand in The George and Dragon near {{the west end of}} Station Road. The militia were called to the front when the rioters would <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> after being ordered to by Bate Dudley. Thomas South, shooting from a window, hit trooper Wallace in the forearm. The militia got the rioters out of the public house and assembled them in the street, surrounded by the troopers. Thomas Sindall attempted to take a musket from trooper William Porter but was not successful. Sindall ran away and when he did not stop after being called on to do so by Porter, he was shot through the back of the head. Thomas Sindall was killed; he was the only person known to be at both Downham Market and Littleport. The result of this shooting was to subdue the rest of the rioters. Those captured were taken to Ely gaol {{and the rest of the}} rioters were rounded up.|$|E
5|$|While her car {{is being}} serviced, Amy checks into the B where she meets Val and Eric and {{claims to be}} a trainee nurse to get a discount; but tells Victoria that she is {{actually}} 16 and has run away from foster care. Victoria tries to sneak Amy out without paying but Val catches her so she offers to pay her debt by working for them. The police arrive and inform Val that Amy stole her foster parents' car and she leaves with a social worker. Victoria stays in touch with Amy and when she runs away again, Victoria hides her in the B's basement. Val finds her and lets her stay but Eric insists she leave. Amy visits Val again and tells her that her foster parents have separated and she is moving to a care home. Amy locks herself in a bathroom and workers at the care home telephone Val, claiming she will <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> until Val arrives. Val arranges for Amy to stay at the B and later fosters her.|$|E

By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E

5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of his clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but}} to agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

25|$|As at the Battle of the Wilderness, Lee's tactics had inflicted severe {{casualties}} on Grant's army. This time, the toll was over 18,000 men, of which close to 3,000 were killed. In {{two weeks of}} fighting {{since the start of}} the Wilderness, Grant had lost about 36,000 men, and another 20,000 went home when their enlistments ended. In fact, Grant on May 19 had only 56,124 effectives. But Lee did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of these battles unscathed, either. At Spotsylvania, he lost another 10–13,000 men, about 23% of his army (versus 18% of Grant's). While the Union had many men available to reinforce Grant, the Confederates were forced to pull men away from other fronts to reinforce Lee. Making matters worse, the army was taking heavy losses among its veteran units and its best officers.|$|E
