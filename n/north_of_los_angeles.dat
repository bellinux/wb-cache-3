25|$|Several key {{attributes}} of the event were shared with the 1994 Northridge earthquake, considering both were brought about by thrust faults in the mountains <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> and each resulting earthquake being similar in magnitude, though no surface rupture occurred in 1994. Since both occurred in urban and industrial areas and resulted in significant economic impairment, each event drew critical observation from planning authorities, and has been thoroughly studied in the scientific communities.|$|E

25|$|The Mount Lowe Railway was {{the third}} {{in a series of}} scenic {{mountain}} railroads in America created as a tourist attraction on Echo Mountain and Mount Lowe, <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> California. The railway, originally incorporated by Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe as the Pasadena & Mt. Wilson Railroad Co. existed from 1893 until its official abandonment in 1938, and had the distinction of being the only scenic mountain, electric traction (overhead electric trolley) railroad ever built in the United States. Lowe’s partner and engineer was David J. Macpherson, a civil engineer graduate of Cornell University. The Mount Lowe Railway was a fulfillment of 19th century Pasadenans' desire to have a scenic mountain railroad to the crest of the San Gabriel Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{concentrated}} rainfall {{in the history of}} the United States has occurred in the San Gabriel Mountains <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> and Orange Counties. On April 5, 1926, a rain gauge in the San Gabriels collected one inch in one minute. In January, 1969, more water fell on the San Gabriels in nine days than New York City sees in a year. In February 1978, almost a foot of rain fell in 24 hours, and, in one blast, an inch and a half in five minutes. This storm caused massive debris flows throughout the region, one of them unearthing the corpses in the Verdugo Hills Cemetery and depositing them in the town below. Another wiped out the small town of Hidden Springs in a tributary of the Big Tujunga River, killing 13 people.|$|E
25|$|The {{areas that}} were {{affected}} by the strongest shaking were the outlying communities <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> that are bounded by {{the northern edge of}} the San Fernando Valley {{at the base of the}} San Gabriel Mountains. The unincorporated districts of Newhall, Saugus, and Solemint Junction had moderate damage, even to newer buildings. The area where the heaviest effects were present was limited by geographical features on the three remaining margins, with the Santa Susana Mountains on the west, the Santa Monica Mountains and the Los Angeles River to the south, and along the Verdugo Mountains to the east. Loss of life that was directly attributable to the earthquake amounted to 58 (a number of heart attack and other health-related deaths were not included in this figure). Most deaths occurred at the Veterans and Olive View hospital complexes, and the rest were located at private residences, the highway overpass collapses, and a ceiling collapse at the Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|While {{the public}} image of SWAT first became known through the LAPD, {{perhaps because of}} its {{proximity}} to the mass media and the size and professionalism of the Department itself, the first actual SWAT-type operations were conducted <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> in the farming community of Delano, California {{on the border between}} Kern and Tulare Counties in the San Joaquin Valley. At the time, the United Farm Workers union led by César Chavez was staging numerous protests in Delano, in a strike that would last over five years. Though the strike never turned violent, the Delano Police Department responded by forming ad-hoc SWAT-type units involving crowd and riot control, sniper skills and surveillance. Television news stations and print media carried live and delayed reportage of these events across the United States. Personnel from the LAPD, having seen these broadcasts, contacted Delano and inquired about the program. One officer then obtained permission to observe the Delano Police Department's special weapons and tactics units in action, and afterwards, he took what he had learned back to Los Angeles, where his knowledge was used and expanded on to form the LAPD's own first SWAT unit.|$|E

By 1925, the Midland Trail was established along what is modern State Route 168, joining El Camino Sierra in Big Pine. [...] Other named trails that would eventually follow this route included the Theodore Roosevelt highway, and Grand Army of the Republic Highway.

500|$|After filming in San Francisco {{wrapped in}} late June, the {{production}} traveled to Death Valley. Most Hollywood films that required desert scenes settled {{for the local}} Oxnard dunes <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> but von Stroheim insisted on authenticity. Death Valley had no roads, hotels, gas stations, or running water and was occupied by tarantulas, scorpions and venomous snakes. The nearest populated area to the shoot was [...] away and insurance coverage was denied. Filming in Death Valley lasted for two months during midsummer, allowing actors Gowland and Hersholt time to grow the beards necessary for the sequence. Some members of the production reported temperatures between , but the highest temperature officially recorded in Death Valley during the period was [...] Of the 43 members of {{the cast and crew}} who worked on the Death Valley sequence, 14 became ill and were sent back to Los Angeles.|$|E

In an attempt to save his {{relationship}} with his then-girlfriend, he once enrolled in Glendale Community College, <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> where they would take Spanish together. Harmon got involved in a study group and – somewhat against his own instincts – became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. [...] "...I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them," [...] he explained, [...] "even though they {{had nothing to do with}} the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them." [...] With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realised the value of connecting with other people.|$|E

500|$|Vulcan and the Bird-of-Prey {{exterior}} {{was created}} {{with a combination}} of matte paintings and a soundstage. Nimoy had searched for a suitable location for the scene of the Enterprise crew's preparations to return to Earth, but various locations did not work, so the scene was instead filmed on a Paramount backlot. The production had to mask the fact that production buildings were [...] away. A wide-angle shot of Spock {{on the edge of a}} cliff overlooking the scene was filmed at Vasquez Rocks, a park <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles.</b> The Federation council chamber was a large set filled with representatives from many alien races. Production manager Jack T. Collis economized by building the set with only one end; reverse angle shots used the same piece of wall. The positions of the Federation President's podium and the actors on the seats were switched for each shot. Since The Voyage Home was the first Star Trek film to show the operations at Starfleet Command, Bennett and Nimoy visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to learn how a real deep space command center might look and operate. Among the resulting set's features was a large central desk with video monitors that the production team nicknamed [...] "the pool table"; the prop later became a fixture in USS Enterprise-D's engine room on the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.|$|E

After moving to Sunland, a suburb <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> he was evicted from his one-bedroom cabin when the landlord found out that a large group of assorted Pranksters and musicians were staying there. Two hours later, a neighbor informed Romney that a nearby hog farm, owned by Claude Doty, needed caretakers. Romney [...] accepted the offer and worked the farm in exchange for rent. Local people, musicians, artists, and folks from other communes began staying at the mountain-top farm.
