40|$|AbstractUltra short laser pulses are used, when high {{requirements}} concerning machining quality are demanded. The cost- effectiveness {{plays an}} important role for a successful transfer of this technology into industrial applications. Therefore systems with longer ps-pulses could offer an attractive alternative compared to short ps- and fs systems. Beside fiber based systems with ∼ 50 ps pulse durations also small systems with sub-ns pulses are available today. In contrast to the dramatic drop of the material removal rate when the pulse duration is raised from 10 ps to 50 ps the impact is weaker for a further increase to 540 ps and the removal rate even increases when the pulse duration is raised to 1. 4 <b>ns.</b> <b>As</b> <b>no</b> crater formation is observed and the surface quality is better than for 1. 4 ns pulses, sub-ns pulses could be an attractive alternative to machine steel compared to fiber based systems with ∼ 50 ps pulse duration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{examined}} {{the roles of}} information from optic flow and body senses (eg vestibular and proprioceptive information) for path integration, using a triangle completion task in a virtual environment. In two experiments, the contribution of optic flow was isolated by using a joystick control. Five circular arenas were used for testing: (B) both floor and wall texture; (F) floor texture only, reducing information for rotation; (W) wall texture only, reducing information for translation; (<b>N)</b> <b>a</b> <b>no</b> texture control condition; and (P) an array of posts. The results indicate that humans can use optic flow for path integration and are differentially influenced by rotational and translational flow. In a third experiment, participants actively walked in arenas B, F, and N, so body senses were also available. Performance shifted from a pattern of underturning to overturning and exhibited decreased variability, similar responses with and without optic flow, and no attrition. The results indicate that path integration can be performed by integrating optic flow, but when information from body senses is available it appears to dominate. ...|$|R

30|$|According to {{the above}} knowledge, no obvious {{resonance}} responses will occur in the fundamental mode of a cantilever deck with long side L_b, for example, L_b[*]=[*] 700  m for the girder bridge studied in Sect.  3, whereas {{this does not mean}} that resonance responses will not occur in higher modes of the cantilever deck. Actually, because the generalized force in certain mode of the plate depends on the characteristic of the mode shape, the effective span of the cantilever pate could not be measured as plate side L_b but the wavelength of the mode shape of the track. It is noted from Eq. (13) that the wavelength of the mode shape of the track deceases with the increase in mode number <b>n.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>no</b> matter how long the plate side L_b is, the effective span of the plate, namely the wavelength of the modal shape, will become small enough in higher modes of vibration. Thus, significant periodical generalized exciting forces and resonance responses may occur in some higher modes of vibration of the cantilever deck.|$|R
