40|$|The {{nitroguanidine}} insecticide imidacloprid {{along with}} a second generation of related compounds including nitenpyram, all nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor ligands, are used increasingly in many countries. Site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes have been deployed to investigate mutants (G 189 D and G 189 E) of the chicken α 7 homomer-forming nicotinic receptor subunit which are predicted to enhance the negative charge at the negative subsite (loop D) of the ACh binding site. Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type α 7 nicotinic receptors respond to imidacloprid with rapid inward currents. Imidacloprid and nitenpyram are partial agonists, whereas ACh, (−) -nicotine and (+) -epibatidine are full agonists. Compared to wild-type α 7, the mutant G 189 D and G 189 E receptors are much less sensitive to the insecticides, whereas their sensitivity to (−) -nicotine, ACh and (+) -epibatidine is only slightly reduced. In contrast, G 189 N and G 189 Q mutants are sensitive not only to ACh, (−) -nicotine and (+) -epibatidine, {{but also to the}} two insecticides. Thus reduction of the insecticide-sensitivity by the mutations G 189 D and G 189 E are attributed to an increase in negativity of loop D. Desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI), an imidacloprid derivative lacking the nitro group is a potent agonist on the G 189 D and G 189 E mutants suggesting an important role of loop D in nicotinic receptor interactions with the nitro group of <b>nitroguanidine</b> <b>insecticides...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pesticides {{comprise}} {{a large portion}} of production inputs in cotton. Reducing or enhancing their efficacy presents an avenue to increase profit. Pesticides containing both insecticidal and growth enhancing properties may be a viable option to increased profitability. In cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), early season applications of some insecticides have shown effects similar to those of plant growth regulators (PGRs). TRIMAX?? (imidacloprid) is one of these purported PGR insecticides. TRIMAX?? and Centric?? 40 WG (thiamethoxam), both <b>nitroguanidine</b> <b>insecticides,</b> have properties that may exhibit PGR activity. A two - year field study was conducted at the Texas A&M Agricultural Experiment Station in Burleson County, Texas to assess the physiological effects of Centric?? 40 WG and TRIMAX?? on cotton. The statistical design consisted of a randomized complete block with four replications. Treatments consisted of each insecticide being applied one, two, and three times at the 5 - leaf stage, 5 - leaf stage plus 10 days after initial treatment (DAIT), and 5 -leaf stage plus 10 DAIT plus 20 DAIT. Rates consisted of TRIMAX?? and Centric?? 40 WG being applied at 0. 020 and 0. 017 L/ha, respectively. Data was collected for plant height, total number of nodes, biomass partitioning, photosynthetic rate, midseason plant mapping, end of season box- mapping, yield, and fiber quality analysis. No significant differences in lint yield were observed among any of the insecticide PGR treatments. There was a general trend for numeric decreases in lint yield with each additional insecticide application for both chemistries, with the exception of TRIMAX?? at three applications in 2004. No significant differences were detected in any of the growth parameters that were measured (height, total nodes, biomass partitioning, and leaf area). Numerical differences resulted in trends, but rate responses did not follow any logical pattern. Numerous trends and rate responses were also observed in the Absolute and Relative Growth Rates, and photosynthetic rates, but no significant differences were evident. In general, as more insecticide was applied, the photosynthetic rates decreased along with lint yield. Based on the parameters investigated {{during the course of this}} two-year study, there is no conclusive evidence that supports TRIMAX?? or Centric?? 40 WG as being growth and or yield enhancers in cotton...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of the predatory bug Orius laevigatus (Fieber) to {{the insect}} growth regulators diflubenzuron, pyriproxyfen, the <b>nitroguanidine</b> <b>insecticide</b> imidacloprid and the thiourea compound diafenthiuron {{was investigated in}} the laboratory. Fifth-instar nymphs were exposed to formulated materials of each compound and adults were exposed to formulated materials of diafenthiuron and imidacloprid. In each case, exposure via ingestion and residual contact was tested. Pyriproxyfen was harmless to O. laevigatus nymphs by both ways of exposure. The respective LC 50 -values of diflubenzuron via ingestion and residual contact were 229. 9 and 391. 1 mg a. i. /l. Diafenthiuron did not cause significant mortality to fifth-instar nymphs and adults via ingestion but was toxic by residual contact with LC 50 -values of 329. 4 mg a. i. /l and 125. 9 mg a. i. /l for nymphs and adults respectively. Imidacloprid {{proved to be the}} most toxic compound with LC,, values of 1. 1 and 0. 04 mg a. i. /l for nymphs and 2. 1 and 0. 3 mg a. i. /l for adults, via ingestion and residual contact, respectively. The results suggest that use of pyriproxyfen in an integrated pest management programme will not cause any problems but that imidacloprid, and to a lesser extent, also diflubenzuron and diafenthiuron could be harmful to the predator...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} bismuth {{modified}} electrodes, a bismuth-film modified glassy carbon (BiF-GCE) and a bismuth bulk modified carbon paste, were {{applied for the}} determination of selected <b>nitroguanidine</b> neonicotinoid <b>insecticides.</b> The method based on an ex situ prepared BiF-GCE operated in the differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) mode was applied to determine clothianidin in the concentration range from 2. 5 to 23 μg cm− 3 with a relative standard deviation (RSD) not exceeding 1. 5 %. The tricresyl phosphate-based carbon paste electrodes (TCP-CPEs), bulk modified with 5 and 20 w/w% of bismuth, showed a different analytical performance in the determination of imidacloprid, regarding the peak shape, potential window, and noise level. The TCP-CPE with 5 % Bi was advantageous, and the developed DPV method based on it allowed the determination in the concentration range from 1. 7 to 60 μg cm− 3 with an RSD of 2. 4 %. To get a deeper insight into the morphology of the bismuth-based sensor surfaces, scanning electron microscopic measurements were performed of both the surface film and the bulk modified electrodes...|$|R
