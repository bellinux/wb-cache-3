Further selection criteria were the integrated strength of the absorption lines in the aliphatic stretchings wavelength band, weak IR activity in the aromatic stretching band and absence of notable activity outside the astronomical UIBs (Unidentified Infrared Bands). Most of the structures that were retained can be classed as branched, short and oxygen-bridged CH_{ 2 } chains, and <b>naphtenic</b> chains. Combinations of their absorption spectra deliver spectra comparable to those observed in the sky. Absorption spectra were derived from Normal Mode Analysis. Emission spectra of the same structures were computed by monitoring their overall dipole moment as they vibrate freely in vacuum after excitation.

About two third of petroleum production of every oil field exists {{in the form of}} water in oil emulsion. The emulsion stability results from the presence of interfacial barrier preventing coalescence of the dispersed water droplets. This is due to the present of polar components such as asphaltenes, resins, wax and <b>naphtenic</b> acids in the crude oil. It has been reported that the combination of oil-soluble demulsifiers and water-soluble demulsifiers produced great result in water separation.

40|$|Abstract Operational {{discharges}} of {{produced water}} and drill cuttings from offshore {{oil and gas}} platforms are a continuous source of contaminants to continental shelf ecosystems. This paper reviews recent research on the biological effects of such discharges with focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The greatest concern is linked to effects of produced water. Alkylphenols (AP) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from produced water accumulate in cod and blue mussel caged near outlets, but are rapidly metabolized in cod. APs, <b>naphtenic</b> acids, and PAHs may disturb reproductive functions, and affect several chemical, biochemical and genetic biomarkers. Toxic concentrations seem restricted to < 2  km distance. At the peak of discharge of oil-contaminated cuttings fauna disturbance was found at more than 5  km from some platforms, but is now seldom detected beyond 500  m. Water-based cuttings may seriously affect biomarkers in filter feeding bivalves, and cause elevated sediment oxygen consumption and mortality in benthic fauna. Effects levels occur within 0. 5 – 1  km distance. The stress is mainly physical. The risk of widespread, long term impact from the operational discharges on populations and the ecosystem is presently considered low, but this cannot be verified from the published literature...|$|E

For this purpose, diverse trace metals and biomarker-derived parameters were used, for a suite of 30 crude oil samples analyzed by SARA, GC-MS, ICP-OES and UV-Visible techniques. Considering a unique geochemical type of crude oil in the reservoir [1 - 2], distributional changes along the reservoir area for selected parameters was studied. Ten trace metals were analyzed and splitted into two groups using multivariate statistic. The first group (Cd, Cu, Mo, Fe, P, Zn, Ca, Mg) does not display behaviors that can be associated to the secondary migration process but which rather they indicate a chalcophic association (Cd, Cu, Mo y Zn) or colloidal complexes with <b>naphtenic</b> acids (Ca, Mg, Fe). The behavior of the second groups, including total crude oil vanadium, nickel, porphyrins and resins plus asphaltenes concentrations, indicates that a natural chromatographic process has been affecting the crude oil composition, leading the proposition of a secondary migration route with a south-north oriented preferential migration axis. The analysis of different biomarkers did not throw clear results {{as far as the}} characterization of the process of migration and accumulation in the reservoir...|$|E

It refines <b>naphtenic</b> crude oils, which {{are not easy to}} find in nature. There are three kinds of Brazilian naphtenics oils currently available to be processed in Lubnor. The refinery produces basically asphalts and <b>naphtenic</b> lubricants, and it is the only Brazilian producer of these kinds of lubricants. The kinds of petroleum to process and the production planning of the refinery are made by the headquarters of the organization, which looks for the best results for the whole Company, although it means losses for one of the refineries. This work has the following objectives: to plan the logistic operations of a petroleum refinery in order to maximize its profits and to show that the refinery can improve its processing capacity reducing its in process inventory by synchronizing or balancing the output of final products and the input of crude oils. To reach these objectives, it was adopted the strategy of a literature research applicable to a case study. The theoretical references concern demand forecasting, inventory management and decision support systems. The results show that among the six possible configurations of oil refining, two are profitable, other two have a little gain and the last two are unfeasible. The demonstration {{that it is possible to}} increase the production reducing the in process inventory is made by using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with one variable: the diary flow of crude oil in the distillation unit.

The reasons {{of these are}} the growing aviation and the more conscious environmental requirements. The expansion of aviation featured the last two decades, especially the 2 % {{at the beginning of}} the reviewed period approaches 15 %, if we calculate in the point of passenger kilometers the driven passages with vehicles, buses, railroads and jets. It can not be left from focus that aviation generates only 2 % of the CO 2 emission of the world. This value can grow only for 3 % to 2050, moreover it generates 12 % of the CO 2 emission of the full transportation section, for comparison the public way transport generates 76 % of the CO 2 emission. One of the greatest problems is the jets that fly at one time more than 1500 kilometers, because aviation produces 80 % of the greenhouse gases. But there are no other alternatives for bridging these distances in the transport section. The quality of the jet fuels is improvable with reducing their sulphur- and aromatic content. The hydrogenation of the aromatic content of the jet fuels to <b>naphtenic</b> hydrocarbons can produce products that are environment-friendly, they have high energy content, lower density, which contributes to satisfying the growing demands. Our aim was to study the possibilities of producing low sulphur and aromatic content jet fuels in a catalytic way.

40|$|International audienceDue {{to their}} {{dielectric}} strength, viscosity and oxidation stability, mineral oils {{have been used}} for more than one hundred years ago as insulation liquid in high voltage equipment. However, mineral oils are non-renewable materials and have a low level biodegradability; their level of biodegradability is not more than 30 %. For that purpose, the development of vegetable oils is being continuously performed by many researchers and industries to replace mineral oils. These natural products present a high biodegradability, non-toxicity and higher fire safety guarantee. In general, vegetable oils which have been used today are derived from food material such as soybeans, palm, corn, sunflower and others. In this paper, we first introduce a new vegetable oil derived from a non-food material we called “JMEO (jatropha curcas methyl ester oil) ”. JMEO is produced by alkaline esterification process of jatropha curcas oil which comes from the pressing of jatropha fruits. Jatropha curcas are non-edible crop that can grow in all types of soil in tropical and subtropical regions and even in barren soils with low rainfall. Moreover, these plants do not need much fertilizer. Then we present the results of a comparison of statistical AC breakdown voltage in JMEO and mineral oil (<b>naphtenic</b> type). Breakdown voltage (BDV) measurements have been performed on series of 40 tests basing on IEC 60156 Standard. Hypothesis test of conformity to normal distribution of BDV is carried out by applying Shapiro-Wilk tests to calculate W-value and P-value and skewness and kurtosis test. We mainly analyze histogram, probability of oil samples, mean and standard deviation. It appears from the obtained results that the BDV of JMEO is better than that of mineral oil. Thus, JMEO (jatropha curcas methyl ester oil) constitutes a potential liquid for replacing mineral oil in high voltage equipment and especially in high voltage power transformer...|$|E

About two third of petroleum production of every oil field exists {{in the form of}} water in oil emulsion. The emulsion stability results from the presence of interfacial barrier preventing coalescence of the dispersed water droplets. This is due to the present of polar components such as asphaltenes, resins, wax and <b>naphtenic</b> acids in the crude oil. Therefore before transporting or refining the oil, it is essential to separate the water for economic and operational reasons. Minimizing the water level in the oil reduces pipeline corrosion and maximizes pipeline usage. The most effective method to overcome the problem is to demulsify the crude by using demulsifiers. The demulsifiers will destabilize the interfacial film between the droplets. It has been reported that the combination of oil-soluble demulsifiers and water-soluble demulsifiers produced great result in water separation. From the screening process of single oil-soluble demulsifiers, the most effective chemicals as demulsifier are TOMAC, hexylamine and dioctylamine while methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid are the most effective chemicals in water-soluble group. The new formulation of demulsifier was formulated by using Statistical Analysis System software. From this analysis, the optimum concentration needed for TOMAC, hexylamine, dioctylamine, methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid are 48. 7 ppm, 0 ppm, 8 ppm, 48. 2 ppm, 26. 5 ppm and 29. 9 ppm, respectively. The combination of these chemicals resulted 53. 7 % to 60. 4 % water separation from the emulsion system. It was found that this formulation is better than other commercial demulsifier formulation. This new formulation was found to be effective for demulsification of water-in-oil emulsion of Tabu, Seligi, Guntong, Semangkok, Irong Barat and Tapis fields and single emulsion system.

40|$|The {{coexistence}} {{of a large}} variety of molecular species (i. e., aromatic, cycloaliphatic and aliphatic) in several astrophysical environments suggests that unidentified IR emission (UIE) occurs from small solid particles containing a mix of aromatic and aliphatic structures (e. g., coal, petroleum, etc.), renewing the astronomical interest on this type of materials. A series of heavy petroleum fractions namely DAE, RAE, BQ- 1, and asphaltenes derived from BQ- 1 were used together with anthracite coal and bitumen as model compounds in matching the band pattern of the emission features of proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe). All the model materials were examined in the mid-infrared (2. 5 - 16. 7 um) {{and for the first}} time in the far-infrared (16. 7 - 200 um), and the IR bands were compared with the UIE from PPNe. The best match of the PPNe band pattern is offered by the BQ- 1 heavy aromatic oil fraction and by its asphaltenes fraction. Particularly interesting is the ability of BQ- 1 to match the band pattern of the aromatic-aliphatic C-H stretching bands of certain PPNe, a result which is not achieved neither by the coal model nor by the other petroleum fractions considered here. This study shows that a new interesting molecular model of the emission features of PPNe are asphaltene molecules which are composed by an aromatic core containing 3 - 4 condensed aromatic rings surrounded by cycloaliphatic (<b>naphtenic)</b> and aliphatic alkyl chains. It is instead shown the weakness of the model involving a mixture of PAHs for modeling the aromatic IR emission bands. The laboratory spectra of these complex organic compounds represent a unique data set of high value for the astronomical community; e. g., they may be compared with the Herschel Space Observatory spectra (~ 51 - 220 um) of several astrophysical environments such as (proto-) PNe, H II regions, reflection nebulae, star forming galaxies, and young stellar objects.

40|$|Nynas AB is {{a company}} that refines oil  for {{different}} applications such as insulating oils  for the electrical industry and base oils for both the lubricant and chemical industry. Different types of base oils are produced for the lubricant industry in order to provide required properties such as good viscosity, solvency, volatility, etc. But sometimes, the oils produced in the refineries (known as “straight cut” oils) do not have the all properties required by a customer, and a way for achieving those properties is to blend different straight cut base oils. To save money and time, empirical correlations are used to facilitate the prediction of the properties of those blends. Those correlations are adapted to products from a single site produced from certain crude oils. The company has recently decided to introduce a new stream of products with different characteristics, which means that the new properties of the products and blends can not be predicted by using the existing empirical correlations. The objective of this project was to analyze blends containing these new products and find the new correlations. The names of the oils are classified information and were renamed in the report and also number of the tables with result in appendices has been reduced to protect Nynas AB.   The correlations were surprisingly good for most of the blends. The differences between the values obtained by the blending program (which was calculating the properties) and the experimental values were very small. But the calculated values for properties such as flash point and pour point, were quite different from the experimental ones for some of the samples. Finally, there was one type of blends, between the Naphthenic oil 2 (N 2) and Paraffinic oil B (P (B)), were {{it was not possible to}} get any results with the blending program, because the viscosities at 40 °C of those oils (N 2 and P(B)) were too similar. As mentioned before, the property that was most difficult to predict was the pour point, specially for blends containing paraffinic oil blend with a <b>naphtenic</b> oil. However, suggestions were made based on the experimental values of how to get correlations based on. Anyhow, empirical correlations were developed based on the experimental data. ...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{limitations}} of petroleum products in terms of their high prices, scarce supplies, and the reality of petroleum depletion, emphasis must be on finding cheap, abundant & environmentally friendly alternative resources. Throughout the world, many steps are being taken in this direction to find alternatives to petroleum based fuels. Several substitute candidates including liquids from coal, biomass, spent lubricants, waste plastics, tyres, etc. are the focus of researchers {{in the past few decades}} to get fuel having properties similar to petroleum based oils. Among these, waste plastics are the promising one to get not only fuel like products to valorize petroleum and petrochemicals, but also to get rid of the disposal issues in a more environmental friendly way. The present work was aimed at catalytically converting two commonly used polyolefins i. e. PP and HDPE in a fixed-bed reactor over original and metal supported heterogeneous catalysts into useful products with emphasis on high conversion to liquid products that could be used as fuels or feed-stock in chemical industries. Four catalys systems i. e. original and metal impregnated titanates (BaTiO 3), prebaked clay (PBCs), bentonite clay (BCs) and activated carbon (ACs) were used to identify their potential as catalysts in conversion of PP and HDPE to liquid products with interest in gasoline and light gas oil fractions. All the laboratory prepared catalysts were calcined prior to use and characterized by using SEM, EDS, SAA, XRD and surface acidity measurements. The pyrolysis reactions were carried out in a steel made micro reactor under nitrogen environment. Preliminary experiments were performed in the temperature range of 250 - 400 Â°C in order to optimize the temperature. Time optimization study was also performed. The optimum temperature and time were decided on the basis of highest wt% yield of the liquid products. The effect of catalyst type and concentration on total conversion and conversions to liquid, gas and coke/residue was next studied. The optimum catalyst and its concentration in case of four catalysts systems were also decided on the basis of highest wt% yield of the liquid product. The llquid products derived from both polyolefins in thermal and catalyzed runs in highest yields were subjected to compositional analyses by FTIR and GC-MS in order to study the carbon range and hydrocarbon group types distributions. The results indicated that polyolefins (both PP and HDPE) were converted more meaningfully into useful liquid products through catalytic route compared to thermal route. The catalytic activities of the various catalysts were toward formation of C 6 -C 12 Crange products in case of PP and C 13 -C 16, and C 21 -C 30 range hydrocarbons in case of HDPE. Compared to thermal runs, the derived liquids were mostly comprised of paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons. Some of the catalysts used caused the formation of <b>naphtenic</b> hydrocarbons. Formation of oxygenates and aromatics were not observed. The standard fuel oil analyses developed for petroleum based fuels were applied to crude/lump liquids as well as their distillate fractions. The results indicated that the lump liquid pyrolysates derived from both thermal and catalytic degradation met the fuel grade criteria and may be used as feed stock to refineries or petrochemical industries. The fuel qualities of the distillate fractions (b. pt. 65 - 180 Â°C) closely matched with the gasoline and kerosene range hydrocarbons. On the other hands, the fuel characteristics of the distillates fractions (b. pt. 180 - 250 Â°C) showed that these fractions can be used as blends to marketable premium fuel products particularly gasoline & light gas oil...|$|E
