25|$|In some service industries, {{especially}} health care, {{dispute resolution}} and social services, a popular concept {{is the idea}} of the caseload, which refers to the total number of patients, clients, litigants, or claimants for which a given employee is responsible. Employees must balance the needs of each individual case against the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> other current cases as well as their own needs.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{realistic}} for the Court {{to assume that}} there are unlimited funds to address the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all.</b> A judicial approach on this basis would tend to make a government reluctant to create any new social benefit schemes because their limits would depend on an accurate prediction {{of the outcome of}} court proceedings under s. 15(1) of the Charter.|$|E
25|$|Merchants {{were seen}} as {{somewhat}} parasitic to the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> other groups in society, since it was acknowledged that they used the goods that others produced and made their own profits from them.

25|$|Multiple reasons {{account for}} the super {{conferences}} realignment. First, the plan was triggered by dissatisfaction with competitive balance between schools, particularly in the football programs in public and non-public schools {{in the northern part}} of the state. It would allow schools more flexibility with whom they schedule for such events. Second, new enrollment totals and rates have vastly changed since the conferences were set up 27 years ago, and therefore have not adequately met the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the schools. A final catalyst is the economy; the move would create cheaper overall traveling expenses.|$|E
25|$|There were motives {{behind the}} aristocratic {{officials}} and later scholar-officials' classifying of certain {{groups in the}} hierarchy and leaving others out. The scholar-officials placed farmers as the second most prestigious group because the aristocratic officials and scholar-officials were landholders themselves, much like farmers (the ones who weren't tenant farmers or serfs). Both farmers and artisans were placed on a higher tier than merchants because the two former groups produced crops and manufactured goods, essential things needed by the whole of society. The merchants were seen as merely talented at business and trading, and were often seen as greedy and even parasitic to the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> other groups.|$|E
25|$|Webster's first bill {{to become}} law was the 1985 Home Education Program Act which legalized homeschooling in Florida. He {{considers}} it his most significant legislation. He homeschooled his six children, remains a homeschooling advocate, {{and a member}} of a non-denominational Christian organization that promotes homeschooling, the Institute in Basic Life Principles. While Speaker of the House in 1997, Webster insisted that legislation providing funding to schools must balance the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> school districts and not raise any new taxes. He agreed to a school construction plan funded by borrowing up of to 2.5 billion in bonds, though he thought the crowding problem was being exaggerated for political purposes. He also sponsored 1998 legislation to improve and streamline pre-kindergarten education and provide training for parents who would be homeschooling their children.|$|E

25|$|Building on {{his first}} {{guardrail}} designs, Sicking developed the first guardrail system capable of safely accommodating light trucks and SUV’s. As {{the center of gravity}} and bumper heights of SUV’s and light trucks increased, pre-1990 guardrails that based their designs on low bumper height vehicles were no longer sufficient. Larger vehicles began to exhibit a tendency to rollover, vault, or rupture guardrails. Sicking led his team to develop a guardrail system that addressed the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> vehicle, increasing the rail mounting height, moving rail splices from the posts to the midspan, and increasing blockout depth by four inches. To date, 27 states have adopted this guardrail design, 10 more are currently adopting it, and the remaining 13 have adopted or are evaluating slight variation of this system.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, he persuaded his {{authority}} to fund major capital spending to sustain modern police efficiency. The Home Office authorised Hertfordshire {{to be the}} first force after the war to introduce a wireless system, one which Young adapted for rural circumstance from his Birmingham model. To make it as effective as possible, the Home Office accepted his proposal that the wireless network needed to be set up for a larger area than one county so the neighbouring county force of Bedfordshire was added. Almost simultaneously, Young was appointed by the Home Office to a committee chaired by Sir Percy Sillitoe, Chief Constable of Kent, to consider the wireless <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> forces. Young's action plan for the co-ordination and standardisation of all inter-force communications was rapidly accepted.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to the Albany Free School, the City School District of Albany {{felt that it was}} better prepared to fit the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> students by offering more social services and learning opportunities, such as an elementary school [...] "dual language enrichment program" [...] and the International Baccalaureate. In contrast, a Free School teacher said that the school's graduates were better able to empathize and emotionally interact, and thus were better equipped to address the fear and mistrust of authority that leads to [...] "laws, judges, courts, prisons".|$|E
