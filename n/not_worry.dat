She runs off into the bush, falls down a cliff and injures her ankle. Zeke also falls down the cliff, they are eventually rescued by Declan and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Karl and Susan call Sunny's parents and learn that they know nothing about the festival or Zeke. Sunny's parents demand that she {{is placed on the}} next flight home. However, Zeke moves out, so Sunny's parents will <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> about them having a relationship. Zeke later moves back home and Karl asks Sunny to call her father and translate for him. Sunny lies to her father {{about the nature of the}} conversation and tells him that her father said everything is fine.|$|E
5|$|Between 9 and 10 pm on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E

5|$|Jerry still {{worries about}} Elaine, but Harold and Manny inform him {{that someone else}} has bid higher than Elaine and will get the {{apartment}} unless Elaine is able to pay $5,000. Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does <b>not</b> <b>worry.</b> George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do <b>not</b> <b>worry,</b> we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
25|$|A {{big part}} of Facebook's pitch {{is that it has}} so much {{information}} about its users that it can more effectively target ads to those who will be responsive to the content.

25|$|QuickTime 7 for Mac {{introduced}} the QuickTime Kit (aka QTKit), a developer framework that {{is intended to}} replace previous APIs for Cocoa developers. This framework is for Mac only, and exists as Objective-C abstractions around {{a subset of the}} C interface. Mac OS X v10.5 extends QTKit to full 64-bit support. The QTKit allows multiplexing between QuickTime X and QuickTime 7 behind the scenes so that the user need <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> about which version of QuickTime they need to use.|$|E
25|$|The car {{stayed on}} the lead lap, until a minor safety-car hiccup saw it go down a lap, and {{seemingly}} out of race contention. New co-driver Russell Ingall {{was told by the}} team to <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> about the car, and just push 110% {{for the rest of the}} day - to spare nothing. When the leading Richards/Skaife Commodore retired with a failed diff, Ingall scrambled the car back onto the lead lap. Between them, Perkins and Ingall spent the rest of the race gradually whittling back the gap to the leaders.|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} in the abstract of his log made by Bartolome de Las Casas, on the outward bound voyage Columbus recorded two sets of distances. Las Casas originally interpreted that he reported the shorter distances to his crew so they would <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> about sailing too far from Spain. However, according to Oliver Dunn and James Kelley, this was a misunderstanding by Las Casas. Columbus did report two distances each day but one was in measurements he normally used, {{the other in the}} Portuguese maritime leagues used by his crew.|$|E

On October 31, 2005, Josh tells Babe that he cannot deny it anymore: he {{is falling}} for her, {{and he wants}} her {{to be happy and}} to enjoy her life and <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> about JR or Jamie anymore. During this talk, they share a kiss. Babe is taken aback by Josh's declaration. Although she is flattered, she tells him she simply is not ready to be in another romantic relationship. Babe later becomes romantically {{involved}} with JR again, however, which later leads to a murder attempt made on her by JR when he has an extreme mental breakdown.|$|E

25|$|On 1 July 1944, Major Plagge {{entered the}} camp and made an {{informal}} speech to the Jewish prisoners who gathered around him. In the presence of SS Oberscharfuehrer Richter, he told the Jews present at his speech {{that he and his}} men were being relocated to the west, and that in spite of his requests, he did not have permission to take his skilled Jewish workers with his unit. However, he said that they should <b>not</b> <b>worry,</b> for they too would be relocated on Monday July 3, and that during this relocation they would be escorted by the SS, which as they knew was “an organization devoted to the protection of refugees”.|$|E
25|$|Whether Tobias had {{an affair}} with Claire is not certain; however, his {{infidelity}} is. Claire knows about an affair that Tobias had with a young woman, but she has never told Agnes about it. Claire only uses the information to taunt Tobias. Some critics have suggested that the young anonymous woman with whom Tobias had the affair was actually Claire. Despite all this, Tobias appears secure in his marriage with Agnes, even though they have not shared the same bed for many years. Their marriage seems to have become something of a habit. Tobias shows very little affection to his wife except in the way that he reinforces her thoughts, giving her assurances, for instance, that she, of all people, should <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> about going mad.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel {{proved an}} {{excellent}} student and his excellence in academic life was only outdone {{by the great}} progress he was making in his spiritual life. At the same time Gabriel began to display the first symptoms of tuberculosis. The news did <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> Gabriel, who was, in fact, joyful; he had prayed for a slow death {{so as to be}} able to prepare himself spiritually. Throughout his illness he remained cheerful and kept up all his usual practises. He was a source of great edification and inspiration to his fellow students, who sought to spend time with him at his deathbed. Gabriel had proved himself an exemplary religious and a perfect follower of the Passionist Rule, being especially devoted to the Virgin Mary.|$|E

25|$|Phan {{met with}} his wife only once more {{following}} the divorce: when he was pardoned and released from Hỏa Lò Prison {{more than two decades}} later. He was then sent to a loose form of house arrest in Huế and the train stopped at Vinh, Nghệ An, Vietnam. On the way, his wife said, “I am very happy. From now on, my only wish is that you will hold to your initial aspiration. Do whatever you like, and do <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> about your wife and children.” While Phan was living out his final years, his children and their families came to visit him, but never his wife. When she died, she instructed her children not to tell Phan so as to not distract him.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Grothendieck {{attended}} Henri Cartan's Seminar at École Normale Supérieure, but {{he lacked}} the necessary background to follow the high-powered seminar. On the advice of Cartan and André Weil, {{he moved to the}} University of Nancy where he wrote his dissertation under Laurent Schwartz and Jean Dieudonné on functional analysis, from 1950 to 1953. At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of topological vector spaces. By 1957, he set this subject aside in order to work in algebraic geometry and homological algebra. The same year he was invited to visit Harvard by Oscar Zariski, but the offer fell through when he refused to sign a pledge promising not to work to overthrow the United States government, a position that, he was warned, might have landed him in prison. The prospect did <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> him, {{as long as he could}} have access to books.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{minstrel}} show {{coincided with}} the growth of the abolitionist movement. Many Northerners were concerned for the oppressed blacks of the South, but most had no idea how these slaves lived day-to-day. Blackface performance had been inconsistent on this subject; some slaves were happy, others victims of a cruel and inhuman institution. However, in the 1850s minstrelsy became decidedly mean-spirited and pro-slavery as race replaced class as its main focus. Most minstrels projected a greatly romanticized and exaggerated image of black life with cheerful, simple slaves always ready to sing and dance and to please their masters. (Less frequently, the masters cruelly split up black lovers or sexually assaulted black women.) The lyrics and dialogue were generally racist, satiric, and largely white in origin. Songs about slaves yearning to return to their masters were plentiful. The message was clear: do <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> about the slaves; they are happy with their lot in life. Figures like the Northern dandy and the homesick ex-slave reinforced the idea that blacks did not belong, nor did they want to belong, in Northern society.|$|E
