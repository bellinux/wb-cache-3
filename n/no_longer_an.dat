5|$|The breed is the {{smallest}} of the sporting dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognisable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> ideal working dog.

5|$|The {{status quo}} is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> option {{and there is an}} unquenchable desire for greater devolution. Quite simply, the Scottish people want to be more {{directly}} and deeply involved in the decisions that affect them and the generations to come. It is with this uppermost in mind that today we launch The National, a daily newspaper that will fly a vibrant flag for independence and the right for Scots to govern themselves.|$|E
5|$|When BSkyB publicised their {{intentions}} {{to take over}} Manchester United, supporters reacted furiously to the news. The majority felt the club’s traditions, built on a loyal fan base and great teams including the Busby Babes and currently Fergie's Fledglings would just be tarnished forever. United were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> independent entity, and major decisions affecting the club looked increasingly likely to be taken {{on the other side}} of the globe.|$|E

5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because {{the land to}} be secured might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack}} of overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, age meant Barnes was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> {{automatic}} {{first team}} selection, so he sought a move into management. An opportunity arose at Wrexham in May 1961, and Barnes was appointed player-manager. In {{his first season}} the club gained promotion to the Third Division. During his tenure he oversaw the club's record victory, a 10–1 defeat of Hartlepool United. The club finished ninth in 1962–63, but were relegated to the Fourth Division the following season. Barnes remained at the club until 1965, when he resigned his post. By {{the time of his}} departure from the club he had made 132 appearances, scoring 24 goals.|$|E
5|$|Halfway through Gather Together, an {{incident}} occurs that demonstrates {{the different ways}} in which Rita and her grandmother handle racism. Rita, when she is insulted by white clerk during a visit to Stamps, reacts with defiance, but when Momma hears about the confrontation, she slaps Rita and sends her back to California. Rita feels that her personhood was being violated, but the practical Momma knows that her granddaughter's behavior was dangerous. Rita's grandmother is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> important influence on her life, and Angelou demonstrates that she had to move on in the fight against racism.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{was born}} in the small rural village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton, part of western Bolivia's Oruro Department, on 26 October 1959. One of seven {{children}} born to Dionisio Morales Choque and Maria Ayma, only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood. His mother almost died from a postpartum haemorrhage following his birth. Ethnically identifying {{as a member of the}} indigenous Aymara people, in keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the placenta produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion. His childhood home was a traditional adobe house, and he grew up speaking the Aymara language, although later commentators would remark that by the time he had become president he was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> entirely fluent speaker.|$|E
5|$|Quiriguá {{traditionally}} {{had been}} subordinate to its southern neighbour, Copán, and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, king of Copán, installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quiriguá's throne as his vassal. As early as 734, however, K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat {{had shown that}} he was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> obedient subordinate of Copán {{when he started to}} refer to himself as k'ul ahaw, holy lord, instead of using the lesser term ahaw, subordinate lord; {{at the same time he}} began to use his own Quiriguá emblem glyph. These early assertions of independence can only have been made if Quiriguá had managed to form an external alliance.|$|E

5|$|The Gestapo's {{transfer}} to Himmler was {{a prelude to}} the Night of the Long Knives, in {{which most of the}} SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed. The SS and Gestapo carried out most of the killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> influential force after the purge. The SS became an independent elite corps of the NSDAP, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of Reichsführer-SS now became his actual rank, equivalent to the rank of field marshal in the army (his previous rank was Obergruppenführer). As Himmler's position and authority grew, so did his de facto rank.|$|E
5|$|As expected, the Australian team's leaders Ian Johnson and Keith Miller, {{retired from}} cricket after the tour. Harvey {{replaced}} Johnson as Victorian captain {{and was the}} logical choice as successor to the Test captaincy, as the most experienced {{member of the team}} (48 Tests). Queensland's captain, the veteran paceman Ray Lindwall, was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> automatic Test selection. However, both Harvey and Benaud had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. Harvey was surprisingly overlooked for the captaincy, which went to Ian Craig, who had replaced Miller as New South Wales skipper. Craig was only 22 and had played six Tests; he had yet to establish himself in the team. After several disappointing results against England, the selectors chose a youthful team. Harvey was named vice-captain to Craig for both the 1956–57 non-Test tour of New Zealand and the 1957–58 Test tour to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Before his NBA rookie year, Russell was {{the captain}} of the U.S. {{national}} basketball team that competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Avery Brundage, head of the International Olympic Committee, argued that Russell had already signed a professional contract and thus was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> amateur, but Russell prevailed. He had the option to skip the tournament and play a full season for the Celtics, but he was determined to play in the Olympics. He later commented that he would have participated in the high jump if he had been snubbed by the basketball team. Under coach Gerald Tucker, Russell helped the national team win the gold medal in Melbourne, defeating the Soviet Union 89–55 in the final game. The United States dominated the tournament, winning by an average of 53.5 points per game. Russell led the team in scoring, averaging 14.1 points per game for the competition. His former USF and future Celtics teammate K. C. Jones joined him on the Olympic squad and contributed 10.9 points per game.|$|E

5|$|Elements of the 4th Army {{began to}} {{withdraw}} southwards on 9 April. On {{the evening of}} 9 April, Generaloberst Maximilian von Weichs, commander of the German 2nd Army, was ready to launch major offensive operations from the bridgeheads on the following day. His plan involved two main thrusts. The first would be spearheaded by the 14th Panzer Division breaking out of the Zákány bridgehead and drive towards Zagreb, and the second would see the 8th Panzer Division {{break out of the}} bridgehead in the sector of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska and turn east between the Drava and Sava to attack towards Belgrade. On the night of 9/10 April, those Croats that had remained with their units also began to desert or turn on their commanders, and in the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska on the right flank of the 27th Infantry Division Savska, almost all the remaining troops were Serbs. Due to the increasing momentum of the revolt, Petrović concluded that the 4th Army was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>an</b> effective formation and could not resist the Germans.|$|E
