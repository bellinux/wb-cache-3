5|$|In May 1966, Imelda {{pushed through}} with campaigning for social welfare. Her {{plan was to}} pool {{together}} all the social welfare efforts of several dozen social welfare groups. Imelda wanted to build welfare villages to meet the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> with problems, and reorient a personnel to staff the villages. The scheme called for 12 million pesos. In November 1966, the cornerstone for the Reception and Study Center in Quezon City was laid. Until 1968, other villages were built: Marilla Hills in Alabang, the Children's Orphanage in Pasay City, the Molave Village in Tanay, a Home for the Aged in Quezon City, and the Philippine Village at the Manila International Airport.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.|$|E

The participants took into consideration the educational changes that had occurred in the region in the previous 20 years, including a more diverse and complicated world and a need for more creativity to educate young children. The seminar focused on the education <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> throughout the Arab world, the possible effects of the show's return, and how to provide educational resources and technology to children in the 21st century. The seminar participants recommended the creation of an advisory council, consisting of education experts and media professionals, as well as expanding to new media forms other than TV, and including important Arab celebrities as guests on the show, all components that the American show used.|$|E

The annual budget of British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons (OCTIP) was reduced by $200,000 a few months later.

Carleen McGuinty, child protection specialist for the Christian NGO World Vision Canada, said at the discussion that the NAP-CHT should focus on the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and that the plan should not emphasize child sexual abuse to the exclusion of addressing child labour.

Methods: Development of the QNCS-HARIC refers to literature review, expert panel meeting, experts 2 ̆ 7 review, and pilot study. Results: Four dimensions and 79 items were generated: 1) the physical <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> ARI <b>children</b> (36 items), 2) the psychological <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> ARI <b>children</b> and family (26 items), 3) the socio-cultural <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> ARI <b>children</b> and family (10 items), and 4) the spiritual <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> ARI <b>children</b> and family (7 items).

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{document}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse among children, non-offending parents, and siblings to further address the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> victims and their families. Following abuse, children are often referred to Child Advocacy Centers (CACs) for mental health and other support needs. Today most sexually abused children receive homogenized treatment from CACs; however, there is variability in the needs these children and their family members present with (Finkelhor 2 ̆ 6 Berliner, 1995). Research has begun to investigate the variability in symptom patterns of sexual abuse victims, finding aspects of the abuse including severity, duration, frequency, and amount of force seem to affect the types of symptoms displayed by sexual abuse victims (Kendall-Tackett et al., 1993). This exploratory study examined the nature <b>of</b> presenting <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> sexually abused youth and their families. Participants were child victims, their siblings, and their caregivers seeking treatment at a Midwestern CAC. Participants were given a battery of measures that assessed mental health, efficacy, expectations, knowledge and behaviors. As we hypothesized, there was heterogeneity {{in the mental health}} and support <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> victims and family members. Varying expectations, levels of efficacy, and mental health states <b>of</b> <b>child</b> victims, siblings and parents seem to contribute to the need for different types of treatment and support for sexually abused children and their families. Based on these findings, it would be beneficial for CACs to incorporate programs to address the varied mental health and support <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse victims and their families...|$|R

25|$|As {{an example}} of a Made-Over Classroom, Davidson {{discusses}} an experimental school Quest 2 Learn. Q2L is a school whose curriculum is based on the principles of gaming.

This model, according to Davidson, has the potential to address the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> who are diagnosed with learning disabilities, such as ADHD or autism, allowing them to learn in ways that focus on their individual strengths without forcing them into a standardized learning structure, which could be detrimental to their engagement and future achievements.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} Indian social {{scientists}} {{as well as}} the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have done extensive research on the numeric figures of child labour found in India and determined that India contributes to one-third of Asia’s child labour and one-fourth of the world's child labour. Due to a large number of children being illegally employed, the Indian government began to take extensive actions {{to reduce the number of}} children working, and to focus on the importance of facilitating the proper growth and development of children. International influences help to encourage legal actions to be taken in India, such as the Geneva Declaration of the Right of Children Act was passed in 1924.
