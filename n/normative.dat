5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into <b>normative</b> care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more <b>normative</b> caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} law as <b>normative</b> {{patterns}} in a <b>normative</b> field {{was developed by}} Anna Christensen {{in a number of}} published articles following the book Residential Right in the Tenement House (1994). The theory is based on the thesis that different basic <b>normative</b> patterns can be distinguished in the multitude of legal norms. As social life is quite complex, these <b>normative</b> patterns do not make up the ‘hierarchical legal system’ we frequently imagine. Instead, these patterns are being set into play in a <b>normative</b> field as determined by the different basic patterns, which also act as <b>normative</b> poles. Another component of the theoretical framework is the functional relationship between the legal system and the structure of society and conditions of economic production, elaborated in the work of Professor Ann Numhauser-Henning. The basic <b>normative</b> patterns are held to reflect <b>normative</b> practices functional to society and human relationships. They thus reflect – and codify – social <b>normative</b> conceptions and practices aimed at making long-lasting human relationships and sustainable societies possible, and they are closely related to societal conditions. Changes in the underlying conditions of production provide explanations for many of the movements in the <b>normative</b> field and the new legal institutions, which have arisen to satisfy fundamental <b>normative</b> demands. However, the basic <b>normative</b> patterns all represent enduring legitimate <b>normative</b> conceptions in society, and it is the task of legislators and courts to balance these conceptions within the framework of law.|$|E

In an older terminology, silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the SiO2 was greater than 66% and the family term quartzolite {{was applied to the}} most silicic. A <b>normative</b> feldspathoid classifies a rock as silica-undersaturated; an example is nephelinite.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBrazil is {{the third}} largest market for new {{investments}} in wind {{power in the world}} and thousands of turbines will become operational in the coming years. Wind power is necessary but, as any other source of energy, it has environmental impacts, especially on bats. Due to such rapid expansion and the volume of investiments on course, an analysis of the current environmental licensing of wind farms in Brazil is necessary. Here we compared <b>normatives</b> from Brazil with similar ones from Portugal, the United States and Canada. By using 21 driving questions, we detected that there is no an international standard in the licensing of wind farms, ranging from simplified to rigorous approaches, from mandatory to voluntary <b>normatives.</b> Despite having specific and mandatory legislation dated from 2014, Brazil's federal and state <b>normatives</b> have a vague and relaxed approach regarding the possible impacts of wind farms on bats. Larger wind parks can be fractioned in smaller units, licensed based on simplified and less rigorous studies, but with no explanation on how or when such fractionating may occur, neither details on when adopt it. Only Brazilian legislations do not clearly specify the procedures and the minimum necessary effort for pre and post-installation, and which should be the mitigation measures adopted for the impacts of wind farms. The Brazilian federal and state <b>normatives</b> must be revised and until that, the current EIA procedures should be seen as insufficient to accurately determine the real impact of wind farms on the Brazilian bat fauna...|$|R
