Frequently, people become disturbed by a particular situation, which results in discussion, tension, and conflict that leads to a search for solutions. Many issues often surround a problem or concern. The terms “public issue ” and “public policy ” can be defined in several ways. A private problem or issue becomes public when consequences of individual or group action go beyond those directly involved. An effort by others to influence those consequences is also present. As more people become involved, leaders and interested citizens become aware of the concern. Discussion clarifies and defines the problem or opportunity—the gap between “what is ” and “what could be. ” The issue then emerges as differen...|$|R

40|$|I am {{interested}} in humans, bodies, movements, directions and how they affect each other. How we move towards each other or away from each other, inside a home or outside. How we {{relate to each other}} and to what people say and do. Co-operations between people that occasionally, possibly, do not work; how certain relationships, like certain materials, can have various breaking-points; that materials can be laden with numerous preconceptions, for instance what they should be used for. Beginning from the perspective of a feminist commune, I have explored the concepts of family, belonging, and loneliness. I have interviewed, observed, photographed, and through living in the commune during shorter periods of time, I have taken part in their every-day life. Through this investigation I have become more aware of my view on loneliness and belonging, regarding both myself and others. Can we as humans stand alone, or is interdependence necessary to reach our full potential? Can we experience loneliness in spite of co-existence? And can we feel togetherness in our loneliness? I have created objects in which I hope the observer can recognise themselves, in the emotions I wish to communicate. It may be about shame; shame for not fitting in; not belonging; a <b>nagging</b> sensation that <b>you</b> are not “right”. It may be the dark side which can arise through togetherness; like being situated in an environment where you are surrounded by people but still do not feel you belong; but also the feeling of release that a self-imposed seclusion can give. Through my jewellery I want to show that the way in which something or someone is decorated can raise standards, values and preconceived ideas.

40|$|What {{warning signs}} might alert {{you that a}} project is floundering? In this guide, grant makers recount their {{experiences}} with troubled projects and tell how they responded - or how they wish they'd responded. With the benefit of hindsight, veterans describe what they learned and offer advice on {{the most effective and}} timely way to handle distress signals. Highlights Recognizing the warning signs Deciding whether to intervene Shaping your response to the situation What's in the Guide? Introduction: Every floundering grant flounders in its own way, and each one calls more for judgment than for technique alone. Varieties of Floundering: Some grants flounder just because the program design or implementation plan had some flaws. Those tend to be the easier ones to fix. The other two types of troubled grants are usually harder: those where the grantee has organizational or management problems, and those where the grantee and grantmaker have different (or even conflicting) values. In this guide, a group of grantmakers share personal experiences with each type of floundering grant. Looking for Warning Signs: A few warning signs can help grantmakers distinguish between fleeting or momentary problems and those that point to greater trouble ahead. When grantees turn up with chronic cash flow problems time after time, or when they start to engage in a desperate chase for dollars, or seize on dubious funding breakthroughs (poorly linked to their core mission), something deeper is likely to be wrong. When you sense that the grantee's board of directors is inattentive, or its founder suffers from major blind spots, you may be seeing signs of trouble. Most of all, trust your own inner feelings when they start to <b>nag</b> at <b>you</b> [...] even if the nagging isn't yet specific or clear. Several veterans recall the moment when they saw the "trouble" signals begin to flash. We include a miniCase on page 6 of the guide. Deciding to Intervene: When a grant starts to flounder, grantmakers must choose whether to treat it as a failure or to stick with it and correct the problems. When grants are large or strategically important, when the funder feels a special obligation to the grantee, or when the grantmaker represents a foundation that doesn't mind intervening in grantees' affairs, it may be particularly important [...] even necessary [...] to rescue a troubled grant, rather than writing it off. This section describes how some funders make that decision. We include a miniCase on page 9 of the guide. Tactics for Intervening: If you decide to try to rescue a floundering project, grantmakers argue that it helps to get help from your colleagues and superiors, from other funders, and from consultants [...] but also to stay involved yourself. They also advise that you make the issues institutional, not personal, to avoid provoking a defensive or evasive response from the grantee and from yourself. In some Cases, it helps to engage the grantee's board. But above all, be sure {{to be aware of the}} power imbalance, and use your power judiciously. While you're at it, you can try to create opportunities for learning so the next troubled organization or grantmaker might benefit from your experience. We include a miniCase on page 13 of the guide...|$|R
6000|$|DOYLE [hastily]. No, no: {{the climate}} is different. Here, if the life is dull, you can be dull too, and no great harm done. [Going off into a passionate dream] But your wits can't thicken in that soft moist air, on those white springy roads, in those misty rushes and brown bogs, on those hillsides of granite rocks and magenta heather. You've no such colors in the sky, no such lure in the distances, no such sadness in the evenings. Oh, the dreaming! the dreaming! the torturing, heartscalding, never {{satisfying}} dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming! [Savagely] No debauchery that ever coarsened and brutalized an Englishman can take the worth and usefulness out of him like that dreaming. An Irishman's imagination never lets him alone, never convinces him, never satisfies him; but it makes him that he can't face reality nor deal with it nor handle it nor conquer it: he can only sneer at them that do, and [bitterly, at Broadbent] be [...] "agreeable to strangers," [...] like a good-for-nothing woman on the streets. [Gabbling at Broadbent across the table] It's all dreaming, all imagination. He can't be religious. The inspired Churchman that teaches him the sanctity {{of life and the}} importance of conduct is sent away empty; while the poor village priest that gives him a miracle or a sentimental story of a saint, has cathedrals built for him out of the pennies of the poor. He can't be intelligently political, he dreams of what the Shan Van Vocht said in ninety-eight. If you want to interest him in Ireland you've got to call the unfortunate island Kathleen ni Hoolihan and pretend she's a little old woman. It saves thinking. It saves working. It saves everything except imagination, imagination, imagination; and imagination's such a torture that you can't bear it without whisky. [With fierce shivering self-contempt] At last you get that you can bear nothing real at all: you'd rather starve than cook a meal; you'd rather go shabby and dirty than set your mind {{to take care of your}} clothes and wash yourself; <b>you</b> <b>nag</b> and squabble at home because your wife isn't an angel, and she despises you because you're not a hero; and you hate the whole lot round you because they're only poor slovenly useless devils like yourself. [Dropping his voice like a man making some shameful confidence] And all the while there goes on a horrible, senseless, mischievous laughter. When you're young, you exchange drinks with other young men; and you exchange vile stories with them; and as you're too futile to be able to help or cheer them, you chaff and sneer and taunt them for not doing the things you daren't do yourself. And all the time you laugh, laugh, laugh! eternal derision, eternal envy, eternal folly, eternal fouling and staining and degrading, until, when you come at last to a country where men take a question seriously and give a serious answer to it, you deride them for having no sense of humor, and plume yourself on your own worthlessness as if it made you better than them.|$|R
