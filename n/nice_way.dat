25|$|Hirano et al. {{previously}} {{found that}} the newborns {{did not have a}} true lamina propria, but instead had cellular regions called maculae flavae, located at the anterior and posterior ends of the loose vocal fold tissue. Boseley and Hartnick examined at the development and maturation of pediatric human vocal fold lamina propria. Hartnick {{was the first one to}} define each layer by a change in their cellular concentration. He also {{found that the}} lamina propria monolayer at birth and shortly thereafter was hypercellular, thus confirming Hirano’s observations. By 2 months of age, the vocal fold started differentiating into a bilaminar structure of distinct cellular concentration, with the superficial layer being less densely populated than the deeper layer. By 11 months, a three-layered structure starts to be noted in some specimens, again with different cellular population densities. The superficial layer is still hypocellular, followed by an intermediate more hypercellular layer, and a deeper hypercellular layer, just above the vocalis muscle. Even though the VF seem to start organizing, this is not representative of the trilaminar structure seen in adult tissues, where the layer are defined by their differential elastin and collagen fiber compositions. By 7 years of age, all specimens show a three-layered vocal fold structure, based on cellular population densities. At this point, the superficial layer was still hypocellular, the middle layer was the hypercellualr one, with also a greater content of elastin and collagen fibers, and the deeper layer was less cellularly populated. Again, the distinction seen between the layers at this stage is not comparable to that seen in the adult tissue. The maturation of the VF did not appear before 13 years of age, where the layers could be defined by their differential fiber composition rather than by their differential cellular population. The pattern now show a hypocellular superficial layer, followed by a middle layer composed predominantly of elastin fiber, and a deeper layer composed predominantly of collagen fibers. This pattern can be seen in older specimens up to 17 years of age, and above. While this study offers a <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> to see the evolution from immature to mature VF, it still does not explain what is the mechanism behind it.|$|E

500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just knew that when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.'

500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides". He added, [...] "Santana has certainly been not-exactly-cuddly these past few weeks, but it's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line." ...|$|E

500|$|When Bowden gives Dussander an SS uniform to {{wear and}} in which to march under Bowden's orders, the student's demands are more {{heightened}} in the film as [...] "more dominant and voyeuristic", according to Picart and Frank. Bowden tells Dussander, [...] "I tried to do this the <b>nice</b> <b>way,</b> but you don't want it. So fine, we'll do this the hard way. You will put this on, because I {{want to see you}} in it. Now move!" [...] The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march. Shots of Bowden's reaction are from a low angle, which reflects [...] "the sexual difference between the characters"; Bowden is masculinized as [...] "the bearer of the [...] gaze", and Dussander is feminized as [...] "the object of the gaze". The cutting between Bowden and Dussander [...] "corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images" [...] which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up shot reverse shot [...] "radically [...] the structure of power", where Bowden loses [...] "control of his sadistic power over Dussander".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it {{four out of}} five stars. Forcella praised the Jim–Dwight dynamic in the episode and wrote, [...] "Jim and Dwight, and especially the latter, were terrific." [...] In addition, Forcella positively compared the character growth of Nellie Bertam to Michael Scott, noting [...] "the most heartwarming moment [...] her scene with Pam, in which Nellie was so happy to have made a friend, reminded me of so many Michael Scott moments of the past." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger from The California Literary Review wrote moderately positive of the episode, saying, [...] "Tonight's episode worked for the most part thanks to the ever reliable Robert California and the usually reliable Jim and Dwight: Partners." [...] However, he did retroactively criticize season eight for not elaborating on the problems facing Dunder Mifflin until [...] "Turf War". In addition, he called the premise of Andy seeking Wallace's help [...] "iffy ... even if it was predictable". Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave wrote, [...] "The immediate, don't over-analyze opinion here is that 'Turf War' is a top three episode of season 8, with a chance of it being number one." [...] Furthermore, he concluded that the episode [...] "was good, very good, and a <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> to get set for the season/series finale. ... The Office can still bring it when it wants to." ...|$|E

[...] Raquel Wilson, editor in chief of hip-hop e-zine Verbalisms said: [...] "They completely misrepresent the culture." [...] Dr John Richer, a clinical child psychologist in Oxford, England said: [...] "This has the same sort of flavour as beauty contests in America where little kids get dolled up as teenagers." [...] Miriam , {{the editor in chief of}} Child described the dolls' multiculturalism as positive: [...] "a very <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> of helping children all over the country realize that people look many different ways." [...] Several British toy industry analysts expected the Flavas dolls to sell well, one of them saying that [...] "the risqué nature of these dolls would guarantee their success." [...] But they sold poorly—Wall Street Journal described their results as [...] "disastrous". According to AP some analysts believed Flavas were just [...] "too edgy." [...] Businessweek said that the [...] "clunky jewelry and graffiti on the packaging ... scared away mothers and left kids cold." [...] They ended up being taken off the market after less than a year. Several Mattel executives were let go following the discontinuation. Moe Tkacik of Slate described Flavas as [...] "ridiculous, but in a cute way" [...] and questioned if their hasty withdrawal had been premature, suggesting they could have found a niche market.|$|E

500|$|Famitsu {{gave the}} SNES {{compilation}} remake Dragon QuestI+II {{a rating of}} 35 out of 40. The Satellaview remake was given a mixed, but overall positive review by Microgroup. The touches such as the real-time event and voicing were appreciated, but their implementation left much to be desired. However, the medal collection is a <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> to compete with friends and the reviewer enjoyed the game. Dragon Warriors English remake, {{as part of the}} dual GBC cartridge Dragon WarriorI&II, received better reviews than the original, garnering praise. IGN and Nintendo Power gave it an 8 out of 10. IGN's Marc Nix noted that while [...] "it's one of the only interesting RPGs on the Game Boy Color to actually make American shores", players will feel frustrated; those who played the original will lament the changes, while new players will feel that the game is too linear and simple. GameSpot gave it a 9.6 out of 10, citing the great improvements to sound quality and the appeal of playing both games in succession, and GameRankings reports an 83.46% overall score. It received RPGamer's Game Boy Color Award of the Year for 2000. [...] Comparing it to its NES counterpart, RPGamer's Derek Cavin awarded it 3 out of 5, and wrote that the game is above average in all aspects, and particularly praised the visual elements. He criticized the game's repetitiveness, and said that it is short enough that most players should finish the game before repetition becomes an issue. Combined, both the SNES and GBC remakes saw more than 1.94million copies sold worldwide. With the remakes' good sales performances, Enix released Dragon WarriorIII for the GBC in 2001, which was based on a previously unreleased SNES update of Dragon QuestIII English version.|$|E
500|$|Forman and {{his colleagues}} were {{committed}} to the strategy of casting non-professionals and utilizing dialogue improvisation whenever possible. Most of the actors were chosen from among relatives, friends and acquaintances of Forman and his crew, {{to the point where}} Forman was later to liken the atmosphere to making a [...] "home movie". For the title role, Forman selected his 18-year-old ex-sister-in-law, Hana Brejchová, not because, as was rumored at the time, he wanted revenge on his ex-wife, movie-star Jana Brejchová, but because he had known Hana a long time, trusted her, and had great respect for her natural talents: [...] "She had an amazing ability of free expression, but with the risk that she didn’t recognize the extent. However, Vlada Pucholt [...] held her firmly in the rhythm of the scene, in a professional position.” The character of Milda's father was played by the uncle of Forman's cameraman, and Milda's mother was played by a factory lathe operator whom Passer and Papoušek had met on a streetcar, and who struck them as someone who [...] "seemed so interested in things around her, no matter how silly". The factory supervisor was played by the actual public relations manager of the factory at Zruč nad Sázavou, where location shooting took place. For the main trio of reservists, Forman wanted to use non-professionals, including the writer Josef Škvorecký, but found that, while the three men did well improvising together whenever they appeared in pairs, they lost their rhythm when all three were included in the same shot. So Forman went to Škvorecký and told the writer that he looked too intelligent to play his role and replaced him with the professional actor Vladimir Mensik. [...] In Škvorecký's words: [...] "To tell someone that he is too intelligent to be an actor is a very <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> of letting him know that he should stay with screen-play writing. [...] Milos is a very considerate person. The fact that he so gently threw me out made possible the greatest scene of Loves of a Blonde". Forman was later to justify his decision to add a professional: [...] "While nonactors keep the actors honest and real, the actors give the scene the rhythm and shape that the nonactors don't feel. A nonactor inhabits the situation so completely that he or she isn't able to view it from the outside, to perceive it as a rhythmic whole with its punctuation and its larger dramatic purpose. Nonactors are perfectly content to repeat themselves and ramble on, so an actor can pull them through the dramatic arch of the scene and draw out the emotional contours of the situation." ...|$|E
