5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>his</b> own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E

Racial issues, ethnicities, religions, class, education, women's equality, gun control, politics, inflation, the Vietnam war, energy crisis, Watergate and other timely topics of the 1970s were addressed. Like its British predecessor Till Death Us Do Part, the show lent dramatic social substance to the traditional sitcom format. Archie Bunker's popularity made O'Connor a top-billing star of the 1970s.

Pojaman na Pombejra insisted that tens of billions of baht of her wealth had been given to her children and relatives well before Thaksin took office in 2001 and denied that her children and relatives were nominees of her and her husband. She also denied having any control over Ample Rich and Win Mark, two firms that the AEC had accused of being her nominees. In spite of Pojaman's claim, Thaksin was the authorised signature for Ample Rich through 2005, making him the only individual authorised to withdraw funds from the company's account until he transferred the authority to his children, four years after he took office in 2001.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his career, Bacon {{consciously}} {{and carefully}} avoided explaining the meaning behind his paintings, and pointedly observed {{that they were}} not intended as narratives, nor open to interpretation. When Bragg challenged him with the observation that Triptych, May–June 1973 was the nearest the artist had come to telling a story, Bacon admitted that [...] "it is in fact the nearest I've ever done to a story, because you know that is the triptych of how [...] was found". He {{went on to say that}} the work reflected <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>his</b> reaction to Dyer's death, but his general feelings about the fact that his friends were then dying around him [...] "like flies". A borderline alcoholic himself, Bacon continued to explain that his dead friends were [...] "generally heavy drinkers", and that their deaths led directly to his composition of a series of meditative self-portraits which emphasised his own aging and awareness of the passage of time.|$|E
500|$|Mansfield made a {{great effort}} to bring English {{merchant}} law up to the same standards as that of other European nations, defining his position by saying that [...] "the daily negotiations and property of merchants ought not to depend on subtleties and niceties, but upon rules easily learned and easily retained because they are dictates of common sense drawn from {{the truth of the}} case". In most European countries, the principle was that a merchant was bound by his promises, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>his</b> signed legal documents, while English lawyers maintained that a merchant could only be legally bound by documents that he signed. The European principle was based on the assumption of good faith {{on the part of the}} merchants, or uberrima fides, something completely lacking in English law. In , [...] Mansfield got a chance to reform the law relating to the assumption of good faith. Carter was the Governor of Fort Marlborough (now Bengkulu), which was built by the British East India Company in Sumatra, Indonesia. He took out an insurance policy with Boehm against the fort's being taken by a foreign enemy. A witness called Captain Tryon testified that Carter knew the fort was built to resist attacks from natives but not European enemies, and the French were likely to attack. The French did attack, and Boehm refused to fulfil the insurance claim.|$|E

500|$|A stela was {{not just}} {{considered}} a neutral portrait, it {{was considered to be}} 'owned' by the subject, whether that subject was a person or a god. Stela3 from ElZapote in Guatemala is a small monument dating from the Early Classic period, the front of the stela bears a portrait of the rain god Yaxhal Chaak, [...] "Clear Water Chaak". The accompanying text describes how the deity Yaxhal Chaak himself was dedicated, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>his</b> image on the stela. This could be taken to imply that the stela was seen as the embodiment of the deity and is also true of those stelae bearing royal portraits, which were seen to be the supernatural embodiment of the ruler they represented. The stela, combined with any accompanying altar, was a perpetual enactment of royal ceremony in stone. [...] David Stuart has stated that stelae [...] "do not simply commemorate past events and royal ceremonies but serve to perpetuate the ritual act into eternity", thus ascribing a magical effectiveness to stela depictions. In the same vein, stelae bearing royal portraits may have been magically loaded extensions of the royal person (uba 'his self'), extremely powerful confirmations of political and religious authority. Stelae bearing images of multiple people, for instance of several nobles performing a ritual or of a king with his war captives, were likely to be exceptions to this idea of the stela as sacred embodiment of the subject.|$|E
500|$|... "The Man from Jupiter" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>his</b> mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which makes it all the better when it does do so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode is any indication, you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E
500|$|Grant's [...] "immaculate comic performance" [...] (BBC) as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel About a Boy received raves from critics. Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) {{was determined by the}} Washington Post to be [...] "that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [...] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs," [...] while Roger Ebert observed that [...] "the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource." [...] Released a day after the blockbuster , About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129million globally. The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2006. [...] "His performance {{can only be described as}} revelatory," [...] wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that [...] "Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness." [...] The New York Observer concluded: [...] " [...] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance." [...] About a Boy also marked a notable change in Grant's boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it [...] "looked good on him." [...] He added that Grant's [...] "pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>his</b> surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency." ...|$|E

2500|$|Religious {{music was}} at the centre of Bach's output {{for much of his}} life. The {{hundreds}} of sacred works he created are usually seen as manifesting <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>his</b> craft but a truly devout relationship with God. He had taught Luther's Small Catechism as the [...] in Leipzig, and some of his pieces represent it. The Lutheran chorale was the basis of much of his work. In elaborating these hymns into his chorale preludes, he wrote more cogent and tightly integrated works than most, even when they were massive and lengthy. The large-scale structure of every major Bach sacred vocal work is evidence of subtle, elaborate planning to create a religiously and musically powerful expression. For example, the St Matthew Passion, like other works of its kind, illustrated the Passion with Bible text reflected in recitatives, arias, choruses, and chorales; but in crafting this work, Bach created an overall experience that has been found over the centuries since to be both musically thrilling and spiritually profound.|$|E
