40|$|Of the 10 {{species in}} the genus Tambja (Polyceratidae) {{described}} in the biogeographical Atlantic-Mediterranean subregion, 6 species were chosen {{for the present study}} because of their relative abundance in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean area. Data are given on the variations in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> radular <b>tooth</b> rows and their morphology for specimens at different developmental stages from juveniles to adults. Juvenile specimens smaller than 10 mm show a variable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> rows which is always above 20. In juvenile specimens larger than 10 mm in length or the juvenile pre-adult and adult stages, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> rows is invariably lower than 20, but a positive linear relationship between body length and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> rows is still shown. The significance of this phenomenon is not known at this time, although different hypotheses have been suggested...|$|R
5|$|The molars are low-crowned (brachydont), with {{relatively}} rounded (bunodont) cusps running lengthwise (selenodont), {{resulting in a}} condition known as bunoselenodonty. The upper molars also lack a distinctive cusp (hypocone). Gheerbrant et al. noted these features and some others are shared with the pantodonts Haplolambda and Leptolambda, but due to many differences between the two, including <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> the similarities {{are thought to be}} the result of convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|Alioramus were bipedal {{like all}} known theropods, and their sharp teeth {{indicate}} that they were carnivores. Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex, but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur. The genus Alioramus {{is characterized by a}} row of five bony crests {{along the top of the}} snout, a greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull than other tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|Gorgosaurus {{teeth were}} typical of all known tyrannosaurids. The eight premaxillary teeth {{at the front}} of the snout were smaller than the rest, closely packed and D-shaped in cross section. In Gorgosaurus, the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary teeth. The rest of the teeth were oval in cross section, rather than blade-like as in most other theropods. Along with the eight premaxillary teeth, Gorgosaurus had 26 to 30maxillary teeth and 30 to 34teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw. This <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> is similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus but is fewer than those of Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The genus is {{characterized}} by workers which have head-capsules that are trapazoidal in shape, narrowing at the front and widening towards {{the rear of the}} capsule. The oval compound eyes are generally placed slightly {{to the rear of the}} capsules midpoint, and lacking ocelli completely. The mandibles have a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> along the masticatory margin (the middle area of the mandibles) and an overall triangular shape. The gaster has a flat first tergite that does not cover the petiole, a flat fourth abdominal sternite.|$|E
5|$|When a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or {{implants}} {{may be used}} as replacements. Dentures {{are usually}} the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a partial <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth.</b> Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants {{may be used as}} support.|$|E
5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
50|$|Mitre gears are {{a type of}} {{bevel gears}} that have equal <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth.</b> The shafts are {{positioned}} at right angles from each other, and the gears have matching pitch surfaces and angles, with a conically shaped pitch surface.|$|R

50|$|Tooth gemination, in {{contrast}} to fusion, arises when two teeth develop from one tooth bud. When the anomalous tooth appears to be two separate teeth, {{it appears that the}} patient has an extra tooth, although they have a normal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> roots.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the teeth}} found with the holotype {{specimen}} were not {{attached to the}} skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were in the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger teeth were less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and the teeth slender. The carinae (edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with denticles {{on the front and}} back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039in), more than in most theropods. Some of the teeth were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, and the difference between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. The teeth in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.|$|E

They held that title until April 22, 2006, when they dropped it to the S.A.T. After further appearances in 2006, which were all matches they lost, the Briscoe Brothers entered PWU's Pitbull/Public Enemy Memorial Cup on October 20. They advanced past the first round match, winning over the Krash Krew, but {{in the course of}} this match, Mark was injured when Jay inadvertently struck him in the mouth with the backswing of a chairshot.

5|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Mertens had signed for fellow Eredivisie club PSV as a replacement for the departing Balázs Dzsudzsák in a dual transfer with Utrecht teammate Kevin Strootman for a combined fee of €13million. He scored on his competitive debut for the club on 7 August 2011, netting PSV's only goal in a 3–1 loss to AZ. Later that month, on 28 August, Mertens scored his first hat-trick for PSV in a 6–1 drubbing of Excelsior. Mertens' strong start to season culminated with him netting four goals in a 7–1 rout of Roda JC on 24 September 2011, meaning he had scored 11 goals in his first 7 appearances for PSV. Towards the back end of the campaign, Mertens lost a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> during a collision with Heracles goalkeeper Remko Pasveer, although he managed to score during the incident. It was revealed on social media platform Twitter that Pasveer had found one of Mertens' teeth lodged in his head three weeks after the players had collided. Mertens ultimately ended the season having scored 21 goals in 33 matches, the fourth highest in the Eredivisie. He also scored three goals in four KNVB Cup matches, including a header in the final at De Kuip, Rotterdam, leading PSV to a 3–0 win over Heracles.|$|E

40|$|Phase-oriented gear {{systems are}} {{differential}} planetary transmissions {{in which each}} planet gear has two sets <b>of</b> unequal <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> indexed at prescribed relative angles (phases).

Typically, the ground internal ring gear and output internal ring gear have different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>teeth,</b> giving rise to a progressive and periodic phase shift between the corresponding pairs <b>of</b> <b>teeth</b> engaged by each successive planet gear.

40|$|Abstract: This {{article has}} carried out {{systematic}} {{research on the}} multi-tooth meshing problem of involute internal gear pairs with small <b>tooth</b> <b>number</b> difference <b>of</b> normal gear. It firstly establishes the entity assembly model of internal gear pairs with precise tooth profile, then determines the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> multi-tooth meshing <b>teeth</b> pairs with finite element software and finally analyzes the main factors and reason affecting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> meshing <b>teeth</b> pairs. In the range <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> internal gear equal to 40 - 200, the conclusion is that when tooth number difference equal to 1 the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> effective meshing <b>teeth</b> pairs is 3 - 15,when tooth number difference equal to 5 the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> effective meshing <b>teeth</b> pairs is 3 - 11. The main factors affecting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> meshing <b>teeth</b> pairs are tooth number and tooth number difference. The fewer tooth number is and the greater tooth number difference is, the fewer the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> meshing <b>teeth</b> pairs is. The reason is that when tooth number is obviously reduced or tooth number difference is obviously increased, the clearance of adjacent gear surface will be greatly increased, which will cause the decrease <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> meshing <b>teeth</b> pairs. Within the normal value scope of modification coefficient difference of involute internal gear pairs with small tooth number difference, the influence of modification coefficient difference and modification coefficient is very small. When the torque increases, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> effective contacting teech pairs will keep unchanged.

Methods: Preschool children (332) with autism at special child care centre in Hong Kong were assigned to a test SSDHE intervention group (148 children) or a control CDHE intervention group (204 children) to learn the task <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> brushing. Performance in tooth brushing was assessed using a standardized 13 -step pro forma. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> brushing steps and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>tooth</b> brushing steps successfully completed were assessed and compared over time, and between groups in a 6 -month study. Results: The response rate to the study was 67 % (222 / 332). Over time, there were significant improvements in the overall <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tooth</b> brushing steps completed among the test group (p< 0. 001) and the control group (p< 0. 001). Likewise, there were significant improvements in <b>number</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>tooth</b> brushing steps completed among the test group (p< 0. 001) and control group (p< 0. 001). Those in the test group completed a greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>tooth</b> brushing steps compared to the control group at 3 -months (p= 0. 009) and at 6 -months (p= 0. 003).
