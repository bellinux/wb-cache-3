According to Politico reporter Jonathan Martin, Huntsman campaigned in a dual manner, with a style and manner suggesting moderation while his SuperPAC aired TV ads which depicted him as conservative.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the 1952 <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary,</b> no {{candidate}} had won Truman's backing. His first choice, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, had declined to run; Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson had also turned Truman down, Vice President Barkley was considered too old, and Truman distrusted and disliked Senator Kefauver, who had {{made a name for himself}} by his investigations of the Truman administration scandals. Truman had hoped to recruit General Eisenhower as a Democratic candidate, but found him more interested in seeking the Republican nomination. Accordingly, Truman let his name be entered in the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary</b> by supporters. The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver; 18 days later the president announced he would not seek a second full term. Truman was eventually able to persuade Stevenson to run, and the governor gained the nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity.

5|$|In {{the initial}} contest, the 2012 Iowa caucuses of January 3, {{election}} officials announced Romney as ahead with 25percent of the vote, edging out a late-gaining Rick Santorum by eight votes (an also-strong Ron Paul finished third).

A week after the Iowa caucuses, Romney earned a decisive win in the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary</b> {{with a total of}} 39percent of the vote; Paul finished second and Jon Huntsman, Jr. third.|$|E

In mid-January, McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary, narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee. Pundits credited the third-place finisher, Tennessee's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina, thereby giving a narrow win to McCain.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{entered his}} name on the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary</b> ballot on January 5, 1972, {{effectively}} announcing his candidacy for reelection. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy (brother of the late president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2008, Kemp {{endorsed}} McCain in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries {{shortly before}} the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary,</b> which surprised conservative Republican tax cutters.

Kemp prepared {{an open letter to}} Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham and other conservative talk show hosts on McCain's behalf to quell their dissatisfactions. In addition, Kemp and Phil Gramm advised McCain on economic policy.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson {{had focused}} the {{majority}} of his campaign activities on the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary,</b> he announced on November 29, 2011 that he would no longer campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media that he might run as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering such a move. In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E

Obama gained ground in {{national}} polling {{in the next few}} days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary.</b> Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly. It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{entered the}} race for the Democratic Party's {{nomination}} for president on March 16, 1968—four days after Senator Eugene McCarthy received {{a large percentage of the}} vote in the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary</b> against the incumbent President (42% to Johnson's 49%). Two weeks later, a demoralized Johnson announced he was no longer seeking re-election. One month later, Vice President Hubert Humphrey announced he would seek the presidency. Humphrey did not participate in any primaries but he did obtain the support of many Democratic Party delegates. Following the California primary, Kennedy was in second place with 393delegates compared to Humphrey's 561 and McCarthy's 258.|$|E
5|$|Paul came in 5th {{place in}} both the January 4 Iowa caucuses (10% of votes cast) and the January 8 <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary</b> (8%). With the {{exception}} of the Nevada caucuses January 19, where he came in 2nd (14%) behind Romney (51%), he did little better through the rest of January: Michigan 4th (6%), South Carolina 5th (4%), Florida 5th (3%). On SuperTuesday, February 5, he placed 4th in almost every state, generally taking in a mere 3–6% of the votes although he did better in the northern states of North Dakota (21%, 3rd place) and Montana (25%, 2nd place).|$|E

5|$|Prior to Humphrey's run, President Lyndon Johnson began a {{campaign}} for re-election, entering {{his name in the}} first-in-the-nation <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary</b> for March 1968. Late in 1967, building upon anti-war sentiment, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race with heavy criticism of the President's Vietnam War policies. Even before McCarthy's entrance, Johnson grew concerned about a challenge. He confided to Democratic Congressional leaders that an opponent could pull the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, defeating him in New Hampshire, and forcing his withdrawal from the race; similar to Senator Estes Kefauver's 1952 challenge to President Harry Truman, which likely caused Truman not to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|While having name recognition, McGovern {{had little}} funding or staff, {{although}} he did garner critical funding from some celebrities and statesmen. He won a surprise third-place showing in the Iowa caucuses amidst a crowded field of candidates, but finished fifth in the <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary.</b> He announced he would drop out unless he finished first or second in the Massachusetts primary, {{and when he came}} in third behind his former campaign manager Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, he made good on his promise. He later endorsed Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee. McGovern hosted Saturday Night Live on April 14, 1984.|$|E
5|$|His spirits buoyed, Nixon {{sought a}} second term, {{but some of}} Eisenhower's aides aimed to {{displace}} him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection {{in order to give}} him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> <b>primary</b> election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate. Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election.|$|E
