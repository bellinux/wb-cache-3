50|$|Nuts of all hickory {{species are}} {{susceptible}} to attack by the hickory <b>nut</b> <b>weevil</b> (Curculio caryae). Another weevil (Conotrachelus aratus) attacks young shoots and leaf petioles. The Curculio species are the most damaging and can destroy 65 percent of the hickory nut crop. Hickory shuckworms also damage nuts.|$|E
50|$|Curculio nucum (<b>nut</b> <b>weevil)</b> is a {{medium-sized}} beetle, with an especially elongated snout, {{characteristic of the}} Curculionini tribe of the weevil family (Curculionidae). Its larvae develop in hazel nuts Corylus avellana, being a serious pest in hazenut orchards. It occurs in most of Europe, from south Sweden, Finland and Great Britain to the Mediterranean.|$|E
30|$|The {{decrease}} in LAI clearly {{showed that the}} forest was disturbed between August 2003 and June 2004. There were three candidates of disturbance then: typhoon Maemi, heavy rain, and outbreak of <b>nut</b> <b>weevil.</b> Typhoon Maemi {{is one of the}} most destructive typhoon that struck Korea on September 11, 2003. According to the Dongducheon station weather data, rainfall was only 19  mm for 2  days (12 and 13 September) during the typhoon period. However, the maximum instantaneous wind speeds on September 12 (10.6  m/s) and 13 (15.5  m/s) were much stronger than those on the other days (Korea Meteorological Administration [2001], [2002], [2003], [2004], [2005]). When rainfall and wind weather data were compared for 5  years, the heaviest rainfall of 202  mm occurred on 18 September 2003 (Figure  2 a,b). Heavy rain of > 200  mm occurred only once in the 5  years. When M. ursulus damage was compared for 5  years, the largest damage occurred in 2003 (Figure  2 c). Massive dropping of tree branches (Quercus spp.) which was caused by M. ursulus, was intermittently observed in the Gwangneung forest (T-SK, personal observation). Female M. ursulus adults oviposit on acorns and cut-off branches (Park et al. [1998]). These factors might compositely damage the forest.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDiapausing insect {{species have}} evolved a great {{diversity}} of life cycles, although overwintering occurs {{at a single}} development stage within most species. Understanding why diapause has evolved towards a given life stage requires investigation of both the ecological and physiological attributes. Notably, {{it is suggested that}} adult overwintering is more energy-demanding than larval overwintering but it brings fitness gains by allowing adults to be synchronized with their seasonal requisites through an early spring emergence. This hypothesis is tested in field conditions in the <b>nut</b> <b>weevil</b> Curculio nucum, whose life cycle comprises an obligate 2 -year, nonfeeding underground phase, including a larval, followed by an adult, overwintering. In this species, adult wintering leads to an early spring emergence; at first glance, however, this does not enhance synchronization between weevils and their host because adults emerge more than 1 month before starting to breed. It is suggested that adult overwintering ultimately evolved in response to the phenology of the host, by allowing females to oviposit in nuts before their full sclerotinization. Adult overwintering appears to be costly because adults postpone reproduction for 1 year, incur a significant weight loss and require feeding before egg laying. Surprisingly, lipids are unaffected during diapause, lipogenesis even being likely in the summer metamorphosis. These results suggest that the lipids involved in egg production may entirely come from the larval stages, whereas the other nutrients are acquired through adult feeding but this remains to be tested...|$|E
30|$|The {{temporary}} {{decrease in}} ant diversity in 2004 (see the ‘Results’ section) {{was due to}} a forest disturbance (as indicated by a LAI decrease). To find the cause for this forest disturbance, we first examined the route and damage area of typhoon Maemi, which struck the Korean peninsula on September 11, 2003 (Seo [2004]). Second, to identify the impacts of heavy rain and strong wind, heavy rainfall (> 100  mm) and strong wind speed (meters per second) were analyzed for 5  years beginning 2001 (Korea Meteorological Administration [2001], [2002], [2003], [2004], [2005]). Data from Dongducheon weather station (about 17  km from the study site) {{were used for the}} analysis. Massive dropping of tree branches (Quercus spp.) which was caused by <b>nut</b> <b>weevil</b> (Mechoris ursulus) was intermittently observed in the Gwangneung forest (T-SK, personal observation). To evaluate M. ursulus occurrence, the nationwide damage level of M. ursulus was compared between 5  years, beginning in 2001. We used the data from the annual monitoring report for forest insect pests and diseases from 2001 to 2003 (Korea Forest Research Institute [2001], [2002], [2003 c]) and unpublished data from 2004 to 2005, which was provided by Dr. SH Go and Dr. WI Choi of the Insect Pest Division at KFRI. These pest data were obtained from the nationwide monitoring of forest insect pests which, since 1968, has been conducted monthly in May to September at 80 sites by the KFRI. However, Gwangneung forest is not a monitoring site for forest insect and disease pests.|$|E
50|$|Curculio is a genus of weevils {{belonging}} {{the family}} Curculionidae and subfamily Curculioninae. Members {{of the genus}} are {{commonly referred to as}} acorn <b>weevils</b> or <b>nut</b> <b>weevils</b> as they infest the seeds of trees such as oaks and hickories. The adult female weevil bores a tiny hole in the immature nut to lay her eggs, which then hatch into legless grubs. In the fall, the grubs bore holes through the shells from the inside to emerge into the soil where they may live {{for a year or two}} before maturing into adults.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 39 insect species, mostly seed chalcids in the genus Megastigmus (Hymenoptera), but also midges (Diptera), {{are listed as}} {{potential}} seed-borne invaders of Chinese conifers. Although the number of native seed insects per conifer genus does not differ between China and other biogeographical regions, there are significantly fewer seed insects associated with each conifer genus in China than potential invaders. The eventual success of the invaders is likely {{to depend on the}} presence of native Chinese conifers that are congeneric with the original host, or on the presence of the original host as an exotic. When a substantial entomofauna is already associated with cones, competition for seed resources may limit the potential impact of invaders because seed insects are usually the last organisms to colonize the cone. A survey of 26 fir species, both native and introduced to Europe, showed that overall seed infestation by five species of exotic chalcids is negatively correlated to levels of damage by native insects, except on the original hosts of the chalcids. Similar patterns are hypothesized for native firs, spruces, Douglas firs, and larches in China. Uncontrolled importation of seeds and nuts of broad-leaved trees could also facilitate the introduction of seed chalcids, seed bruchids, tortricid moths and <b>nut</b> <b>weevils</b> into China. Only six species of seed chalcids are present in China, out of the 72 known to attack broad-leaved seeds over the world...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{differences}} were found among the 22 studied hazel cultivars (Corylus avellana L.) in their resistance to hazelnut weevil (Curculio nucum L.) which is the main pest of this crop in Europe. The study investigated {{the relationships between the}} resistance of the cultivars to the pest and the physicochemical properties of the pericarp, i. e. the lignification dynamics, changes in thickness and hardness during nut development and the rate of nutlet development. Correlation analysis showed that there was no dependence between the physicochemical properties of the pericarp and the resistance of the hazel cultivars to the hazelnut <b>weevil.</b> <b>Nut</b> development dynamics were also found to be unrelated to resistance to the pest. Laboratory feeding experiments showed that during the initial feeding phase and at the time the insect searches for an oviposition site, it seems to prefer cultivars with the largest nutlets. However, in the period of intensive oviposition, traits other than nutlet size seem to be decisive for the beetles choice of cultivar...|$|R
