2500|$|Fatima Sesay of Sahara Reporters states; [...] "Black November narrates {{the true}} story of the {{corruption}} and greedy tactics used by multi-national oil corporations and the Nigerian government to hide the truth about the oils spills in the Niger Delta, while making a large sum of money from exporting what really belongs to the Nigerian citizens. [...] Sadly, the people most affected by the spills get rewarded not even a penny for their agony". Amata stated in an interview {{that the purpose of the}} film is to [...] "bring to light the injustice and inhumane situation of the Niger Delta", he also said [...] "If BP can be made to compensate the people of the Gulf of Mexico, why can't the world make the oil companies polluting our land make amends? We have been suffering spills the size of Exxon Valdez for 50 years, yet <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> about it, as long as they benefit from the oil." [...] The producer of the film Dede Mabiaku says Black November is [...] "an eye-opening movie with a cause" [...] which he says should be able to encourage people to fight for the immediate clean-up of the Niger Delta. The Guardian states; [...] "Amata's film is weighing into the 50-year history of western exploitation of the delta's oil resources, local collusion and violent resistance to it".|$|E

50|$|However, Oaksey's visit {{throws up}} more {{questions}} than answers. Why does the wider community not want him there? Why will <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talk</b> about the creature seen wandering the island? What lies beyond the wood and the gorge that almost splits the island in two, with a fence that has rotting pig heads atop its posts? Most importantly, {{what has happened to}} Pastor Dove, not seen on the island for years, and why will <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talk</b> about him? Joe's visit to the island, and its horrific conclusion, is only the beginning of the legacy that Pig Island will leave on his life.|$|R
60|$|The breakfast was by lamp-light, and {{the mist}} looked lurid and grim {{over the white}} cake, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talked</b> of {{anything}} but the comparative density of fogs; and Mr. Mansell's asthma had come on, and his speech was devolved upon Lord Ormersfield, to whom Louis had imprudently promised exemption.|$|R

The unexpected thing when we first performed My Nth was the heightened concentration in the room. It was very powerful, a very charged atmosphere. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>talked</b> or clapped.

60|$|It is {{as though}} the Rains were just over, {{and none of the}} womenfolk had been allowed to go to the hills. Yet <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> about the unhealthiness of Singapur. A man lives well and happily until he begins to feel unwell. Then he feels worse because the climate allows him no chance of pulling himself together--and then he dies. Typhoid fever appears to be one gate of death, as it is in India; also liver. The nicest thing in the civil station which lies, of course, far from the native town, and boasts pretty little bungalows--is Thomas--dear, white-robed, swaggering, smoking, {{swearing}} Thomas Atkins the unchangeable, who listens to the band and wanders down the bazaars, and slings the unmentionable adjective about the palm trees exactly as though he were in Mian Mir. The 58th (Northamptonshire) live in these parts; so Singapur is quite safe, you see.|$|E

Rapper Cam'ron and hip hop entrepreneur Damon Dash appeared on the program to defend their supposed corruption of young people, to which Damon Dash responded:So, if you know there is negative in something, {{try to find the}} positive as opposed to always talking about the negative. That's the thing I don't understand, why we're criticized so hard within hip-hop. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> about the jobs we create, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> about the things we do within our community, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> about the businesses we've done, how we've opened the doors and shown people that it's cool to be smart, it's cool to be a CEO, and it's cool to not take advantage but to reap the benefits of all your labor and to do it fairly.|$|E

He appeals that the Temple has a very long history, and a crime should not merit {{the destruction of the}} buildings, or any of the monks. As the Abbot, he accepts the blame. The Emperor has him placed on a great pyre, which is set aflame. He tells the monks that if they reveal the traitors’ whereabouts, he’ll spare the Temple and the Abbot’s life. When <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks,</b> he has his men kill several of the other top monks, and threatens that if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks,</b> they’ll all be killed.|$|E

5000|$|While <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> seriously of rescinding Article 14 anymore, that hasn't stopped some {{residents}} of the state from publicly chafing at its strictures. This is particularly common in the Adirondacks, since the many vast tracts of land under Forest Preserve protection limit economic opportunities {{in a region where}} it has always been a struggle to earn a living. Melvil Dewey sounded a common theme in the early 20th century when, advocating another constitutional amendment to open up more land to logging, he complained that the current situation only benefited [...] "the bugs," [...] referring to the blackfly infestations that keep many residents indoors during daylight hours in the early summer.|$|E

50|$|In {{the year}} 1930, John Maynard Keynes {{predicted}} that, by century’s end, technology would have advanced sufficiently that countries like Great Britain or the United States would {{have achieved a}} 15-hour work week. There’s {{every reason to believe}} he was right. In technological terms, we are quite capable of this. And yet it didn’t happen. Instead, technology has been marshaled, if anything, to figure out ways to make us all work more. In order to achieve this, jobs have had to be created that are, effectively, pointless. Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>talks</b> about it.|$|E
