This venue has allowed the Arts Club to put on <b>new</b> <b>kinds</b> of shows, such as large musicals, classics and productions from around the world. The first production was Swing!, which opened on October 28, 1998 and had a successful run, followed by Hamlet. In addition to showing Arts Club productions, the theatre is rented out for other purposes, including business and educational presentations, and has been used for comedy acts and concerts, such as Lorne Elliott, Francis Cabrel, and RyanDan.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many <b>new</b> <b>kinds</b> of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{a sequel}} titled BoxBoxBoy! was {{released}} for the Nintendo 3DS, allowing Qbby to create {{two sets of}} boxes at a time. The game was announced and released in Japan on January 6, 2016, and in other terrorities on June 30, 2016. A third game, titled Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, was released 2017. The game adds <b>new</b> <b>kinds</b> of boxes, such as explosive bombs and rocket propelled boxes, as well as box children {{that need to be}} escorted safely through levels. A physical compilation of all three games, titled , was also released in Japan the same day. The compilation also included a soundtrack CD featuring the music from all three games, as well as a Qbby Amiibo figure, the latter of which can be used with Goodbye! BoxBoy!.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} moves from world to world, eradicating the Heartless, Chirithy has brief conversations {{with one of}} the Foretellers and another Chirithy {{regarding}} concerning events. Once in a while, the player return to Daybreak Town where they meet another Keyblade wielder named , who is part of a rival union. He wishes to explore a mysterious tower that lies within the center of the town, and against Chirithy's wishes, the player agrees to help find a way in. Ephemer, however, abandons the player to explore the tower himself. During the player's exploration, the tower is discovered to be the base of the Foretellers, and while there, the player is confronted by Master Ava, the Foreteller they had met previously. She challenges the player to test their strength, and afterwards tells the player they have sadness in their hearts, which links them to the darkness. Undeterred, the player continues their mission and later meets another Keyblade wielder named , who comes from Ephemer's union. She expresses an interest in further exploring the mysterious tower of the Foretellers. She and the player encounter warring Foretellers from different unions and <b>new</b> <b>kinds</b> of Heartless that are revealed to be corrupted Keyblade wielders as well as a dark vision of Chirithy called Nightmare Chirithy (who is the same Chirithy that had been speaking with the player's).|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on <b>new</b> <b>kinds</b> of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the {{discovery of}} the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. Finally, the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome. This project was essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was {{the first step in a}} globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.|$|E

Probably the best known and most widely used of these inventions, adopted well beyond cycling, is Charles Bennett's Bike Web, which came to be called the jock strap.|$|E
25|$|<b>New</b> <b>kinds</b> of technology, {{including}} {{social media}} have {{also played a}} role. Increasingly information is conveyed in brief 'sound bites' so that it becomes something between information and entertainment. This makes 'the news' more susceptible to simplistic and populist explanations {{at the expense of}} more in-depth analysis and the seemingly indigestible opinions of academics and experts. Pratt argues that as a result, the influence of academics, senior civil servants, penal reform groups and judges who collectively make up the 'criminal justice establishment' has steadily declined.|$|E

The {{study of human}} problem solving required <b>new</b> <b>kinds</b> of human measurements and, with Anders Ericsson, Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis.

He said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50,000 chunks of information. A chess expert was said to have learned about 50,000 chunks or chess position patterns.|$|E
