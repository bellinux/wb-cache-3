5|$|Costa, Oscar and Fàbregas were {{targeted}} by Chelsea supporters as the players whose poor form {{led to the}} dismissal of popular manager José Mourinho in December 2015. Costa scored twice {{in the first game}} under interim replacement Guus Hiddink, a 2–2 home draw against Watford. Costa, who played in a protective mask after breaking his <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> training, improved his form under the Dutchman, scoring seven times in his first eight games under the new management.|$|E
5|$|England faced {{a target}} of 596, which would have {{required}} a world record Test run-chase—no team had successfully chased down more than 400 for victory. Early on, Washbrook pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> his customary short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 1994, Trinidad {{traveled}} to the MGM Grand for a second straight fight {{to compete in a}} title defense against Yori Boy Campas, who had a record of 56-0. In the second round Campas scored a knockdown, the second knockdown in Trinidad's career. Following this Trinidad exchanged several combinations, injuring Campas' face and breaking his <b>nose.</b> <b>In</b> the fourth round, the referee stopped the fight, the first defeat in Campas' career.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the war he}} was put {{in charge}} of {{analyzing}} technical advances at home and abroad and his enthusiasm for innovation earned him the nickname Armee Modernissimus ("the army modernization fanatic"). Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never tested on the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of his approach. At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him, and as late as November 1944, he gave the U.S. 12th Army Group a bloody <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{was fitted}} with a {{protective}} mask after breaking his <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> a collision with Charlie Adam during the reverse fixture on 4 April. Eight days later, he scored the only goal {{of the game in}} the 88th minute in a victory over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. On 3 May, the day before his 28th birthday, he won his first Premier League title at the ninth attempt, following a 1–0 home win over Crystal Palace. During the penultimate game of the season, away at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion, Fàbregas was shown the red card and booed off by fans for deliberately kicking the ball at Chris Brunt's head while players were speaking to referee Mike Jones. On appeal, the suspension for this red card was cut from three matches to one.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1985, Reagan {{underwent}} surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon. He relinquished presidential {{power to the}} Vice President for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the 25th Amendment, which he specifically avoided invoking. The surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful. Reagan resumed {{the powers of the}} presidency later that day. In August of that year, he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his <b>nose.</b> <b>In</b> October, more skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed.|$|E

5|$|S. ciliata is most {{commonly}} called the 'sand whiting' {{in reference to}} its preference for sandy substrates compared to {{some members of the}} genus which prefer muddy, silty, or grassy substrates. Other common names include the 'blue-nose whiting' in reference to the colour of the <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> fish of larger sizes, and 'summer whiting', a name often applied to S. analis as well. This name is applied to these species as they move from deeper offshore waters into shallow beach and estuarine waters in summer, where they become a target for recreational fishers.|$|E
5|$|The F-16A/B was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar. Its slotted planar array antenna {{was designed to be}} compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small <b>nose.</b> <b>In</b> uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful signal processing, higher output power, improved reliability and increased range in cluttered or jamming environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.|$|E
5|$|Triple H {{returned}} at the 2016 Royal Rumble {{match for}} the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, as the unannounced 30th entrant. After eliminating the defending champion, Roman Reigns, he then eliminated Dean Ambrose to secure his second Royal Rumble win and 14th world championship overall. After breaking Reigns' <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> storyline, Triple H was then challenged by Ambrose, whom he defeated at Roadblock to defend the title, before dropping it back to Reigns – who had become the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Dean Ambrose and Brock Lesnar in a triple threat match at Fastlane – at WrestleMania 32, ending his reign at 70 days.|$|E

5000|$|In Persian literature, {{beautiful}} women {{are said to}} have <b>noses</b> like hazelnuts. <b>In</b> Arabian society in the Middle Ages, a component of the female beauty ideal was for women to have straight and fine <b>noses.</b> <b>In</b> Jewish Rabbinic literature, the Rabbis considered a delicate nose to be the ideal type of <b>nose</b> for women. <b>In</b> Japan, during the Edo period, a component of the female beauty ideal was for women to have tall noses which were straight and not [...] "too tall".|$|R
5|$|Wilde's charm {{also had}} a lasting effect on Parisian literati, who {{produced}} several original biographies and monographs on him. André Gide, on whom Wilde had such a strange effect, wrote In Memoriam, Oscar Wilde; Wilde also features in his journals. Thomas Louis, who had earlier translated books on Wilde into French, produced his own L'esprit d'Oscar Wilde in 1920. Modern books include Philippe Jullian's Oscar Wilde, and L'affaire Oscar Wilde, ou, Du danger de laisser la justice mettre le nez dans nos draps (The Oscar Wilde Affair, or, On the Danger of Allowing Justice to put its <b>Nose</b> <b>in</b> our Sheets) by , a French religious historian.|$|E
5|$|Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had {{starred in}} the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes, which were {{produced}} by an expert contact lens fabricator who sandwiched wrinkled tinfoil between two sclera contact lenses which covered the entire eye. These were outdated even in the 1960s and dangerous {{to the health of the}} actors' eyes. Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them almost impossible to use. He needed to raise his face and sight along his <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Baroš {{was accused}} of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian {{opponent}} Stéphane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> front of Mbia and waved his hand as if to waft away an unpleasant smell. In the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture {{was not intended to}} be racist in any way, and he was only trying to tell Mbia to get out of his face and leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E

5|$|In reptiles, {{features}} of the scales are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha skink, the supranasal scales (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal scales (behind the <b>nose)</b> <b>in</b> most individuals. The two frontoparietal scales (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in T.maculata, the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four supraocular scales (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary scales (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The dorsal scales (on the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in T.maculata. There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody scales (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63–64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral scales (on the underparts). Mabuya species and T.maculata generally have fewer midbody scales (up to 34). There are 21 to 29subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in T.maculata, which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26presacral vertebrae (located before the sacrum), similar to most Trachylepis, but unlike American Mabuya, which have at least 28.|$|E
5|$|On March 10, 2005, London {{became the}} number one {{contender}} for Chavo Guerrero's WWE Cruiserweight Championship, which he later won in a cruiserweight battle royal. Guerrero challenged London for the title at Judgment Day, where London emerged victorious. During another title match with Guerrero on June 23, The Mexicools stormed the ring, attacking both London and Guerrero. On the July 14 episode of SmackDown!, London teamed with Scotty 2 Hotty and Funaki to face The Mexicools. The ending of the match saw Juventud perform the 450° splash on London for the win, but landed his knee onto London's face and legitimately broke his <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> the process. London lost the Cruiserweight Title on the August 4 episode of Velocity to Nunzio. Later in the night, London cut a heel promo encouraging the fans to protest his title loss. London went on a losing streak before returning as a face and teaming with the newly rehired Brian Kendrick.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{secretly}} {{played a}} game for Rothwell Town in 1988, he played amateur football {{for the first time}} since childhood with pub side New Wheel in 2000, and broke his <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> a game for the club. He gained his A-licence, which allowed him to coach in the professional game, and he took up coaching at Ossett Town. He and John Beresford then set up an unsuccessful wooden flooring company called 'Major Oaks'. The pair then developed a football training product called 'BallMax', Alex Ferguson used it in the Manchester United Academy, but this business also went nowhere. Billy Jennings then took the pair on as football agents at Premier Management International for a twelve-month period. Northampton Town manager Martin Wilkinson then took Swan on as a coach, but soon after Colin Calderwood took over as manager in 2003 Swan found himself again out of work. Swan instead found success in the building trade, constructing a house in his expansive back garden. He also found work as an 'expert witness' for Hull City's games at BBC Radio Humberside in 2003. The next year he also began working as a pundit for the Hull Daily Mail, and did occasional work for BBC Look North.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E
