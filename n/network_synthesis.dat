5|$|<b>Network</b> <b>synthesis</b> filters. The {{mathematical}} {{bases of}} <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> were {{laid in the}} 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> became the primary tool of filter design. <b>Network</b> <b>synthesis</b> put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques of image design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence of <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E
5|$|Graph {{theory is}} at its most {{powerful}} in <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> when {{the elements of the}} network can be represented by real numbers (one-element-kind networks such as resistive networks) or binary states (such as switching networks).|$|E
5|$|The {{essence of}} <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> {{is to start}} with a {{required}} filter response and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. <b>Network</b> <b>synthesis</b> on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of network analysis {{needed to take}} place before <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> was possible. The theorems of Gustav Kirchhoff and others and the ideas of Charles Steinmetz (phasors) and Arthur Kennelly (complex impedance) laid the groundwork. The concept of a port also {{played a part in}} the {{development of}} the theory, and proved to be a more useful idea than network terminals. The first milestone on the way to <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> was an important paper by Ronald M. Foster (1924), A Reactance Theorem, in which Foster introduces the idea of a driving point impedance, that is, the impedance that is connected to the generator. The expression for this impedance determines the response of the filter and vice versa, and a realisation of the filter can be obtained by expansion of this expression. It is not possible to realise any arbitrary impedance expression as a network. Foster's reactance theorem stipulates necessary and sufficient conditions for realisability: that the reactance must be algebraically increasing with frequency and the poles and zeroes must alternate.|$|E
5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E
5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with <b>network</b> <b>synthesis.</b> Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required {{in the body of the}} filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E

[...] Some canonical forms require mutual inductances for their realisation. [...] A major aim of topological methods of <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> has been to eliminate the need for these mutual inductances.

[...] For this reason image filter designers incorporated end sections in their designs of a different form optimised for an improved match rather than filtering response.

500|$|Image filters {{continued}} {{to be used by}} designers long after the superior <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> techniques were available. Part of the reason for this may have been simply inertia, but it was largely due to the greater computation required for <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> filters, often needing a mathematical iterative process. Image filters, in their simplest form, consist of a chain of repeated, identical sections. The design can be improved simply by adding more sections and the computation required to produce the initial section is on the level of [...] "back of an envelope" [...] designing. In the case of <b>network</b> <b>synthesis</b> filters, on the other hand, the filter is designed as a whole, single entity and to add more sections (i.e., increase the order) the designer would have no option but {{to go back to the}} beginning and start over. The advantages of synthesised designs are real, but they are not overwhelming compared to what a skilled image designer could achieve, and in many cases it was more cost effective to dispense with time-consuming calculations. This is simply not an issue with the modern availability of computing power, but in the 1950s it was non-existent, in the 1960s and 1970s available only at cost, and not finally becoming widely available to all designers until the 1980s with the advent of the desktop personal computer. Image filters {{continued to}} be designed up to that point and many remained in service into the 21st century.|$|E

The goal of this work was to assess the kinetic of catalysed and noncatalysed reactions for polyurethanes based on castor oil as the polyol component and different types of diisocyanates. Due to the presences of hydroxyl groups on ricinoleic acid, castor oil is suitable for polyurethane preparation. The differential scanning calorimetry has been employed to study the polyurethane formation reaction using Ozawa isoconversion method. It was estimated that the catalyst addition decreases the activation energy. The highest reduction of activation energy was observed for the reactive systems with hexamethylene diisocyanate.
