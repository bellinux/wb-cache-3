Family <b>nicknames</b> <b>function,</b> unlike surnames, as indices which have not completely lost the transparency of their semantic background and are used as labels which refer to a salient feature or a memorable episode {{from the history of}} a particular family. They reflect how the community per-ceives a specific group within the community. Some of the family nicknames are considered to be offensive to the persons and groups that bear them and are consequently not used by members of the community in direct communicati-on with them. The question of whether it is ethically justified and responsible to publish such family nicknames needs to be considered. An overview of the main principles in research ethics is presented, and five possible courses of ac-tion are described and discussed. 1. Introduction: Wha...|$|E

The specimen is currently {{housed in the}} Natural History Museum in London, and will eventually be re-described by Dr. Michael P. Taylor of Bristol University.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins and}} {{application}} of the name Oreo in itself provides insight into what Ross urges readers to understand about the main protagonist's identity. Oreo, named Christine at birth, receives her nickname from a dream her grandmother Louise had. In keeping with Ross' humor, it is the name “Oriole” that Louise hears in her dream, but due to her thick Southern accent, all of their family and friends interpret it as “Oreo.” Moreover, Oreo’s “rich brown color and wide smile full of sugar white baby teeth” provides the imagery that justifies naming Christine after the cookie (39). The fact that this <b>nickname</b> <b>functions</b> {{within the context of}} the novel as one of endearment adds more dimensions to the use of “Oreo” more traditionally as a derogatory term to describe black people who engage in activities and/or behaviors that are not commonly considered “black” ("black on the outside, white on the inside" [...] is the most common definition). In this way, the name [...] "Oreo" [...] with respect to the main character's identity falls within the boundaries of Trey Ellis' New Black Aesthetic and specifically speaks to the values of the cultural mulatto. According to Ellis, the cultural mulatto does not adhere to the rules of performative blackness or whiteness, but instead seeks to claim ownership to an identity that is all their own while easily navigating both black and white communities and issues-. Through Oreo's experiences and how they are characterized by non-traditional ideas of what it means to be [...] "Black," [...] Ross successfully employs the NBA by expressing the diversity of Blackness through new forms. Oreo's search of self throughout the novel also speak to inner ideals of Blackness and how, despite not aligning with traditional Blackness, these ideals still exist in the diaspora. By satirizing the word in a way that it was at first misheard and then applied in loving admiration of Christine’s looks, it becomes empowering instead of limiting, and Oreo’s fearless personality reflects the symbolism of her nickname.|$|R
40|$|Nicknames are {{powerful}} indicators of attitudes towards gender categories {{and because of}} their transient and optional nature, {{it has been argued}} that they are more likely to show a closer relationship to ongoing trends in the culture and society than other more fixed parts of the language E. B. Phillips (1990) ["Nicknames and Sex Role Stereotypes," Sex Roles, Vol. 23, pp. 281 - 289]. This study reports on a survey of nickname usage among a group of South African adolescents from mixed socioeconomic backgrounds (approximately 25 % other than white) in an attempt to explicate gender-linked trends in frequency of occurrence, usage and attitudes to such special names. It reveals that conventions regarding nickname coinage and usage are intimately connected to the gender of bearers and users, and that more males have nicknames and coin them than females; it also shows significant sex-linked differences in the linguistic sources and users of nicknames, and reveals a greater tendency for female <b>nicknames</b> to <b>function</b> as indicators of affection rather than for humorous or critical effect. It could be argued that these trends could be linked to the nurturing and nurtured role of females in society, and to the differences in social power generally between males and females...|$|R

Examples of these clubs include the Commonwealth Club (formerly United Nations Club), the Junior Achievement club (known as J.A), the French Club, the Rifle Club,the St. John Ambulance club, the Boy Scouts, the Duma (prefects' club) and Christian Union, to name a few. From time to time, the school is called upon to host festivals and <b>functions</b> (<b>nicknamed</b> funkies) with invited guests from other schools, near and far. These include Drama festivals/contests, music festivals/contests, Science Congress and many others. School magazines are also a popular activity, be they the formal school newsletter, the Laibon or those of the satirical gossip variety (Scandal, Peep, etc.).|$|R
40|$|The article {{demonstrate}} how urban Shona- speakers often use nicknames as linguistics resources {{to perform a}} variety of social functions in everyday informal interactions. The intention of this article is twofold: to contribute to research on African nicknaming, often limited to nicknaming as mere verbal play, by illustrating their communicative utility and to present the common <b>functions</b> <b>nicknames</b> fufill in particular relationships and situations. The data reveal that Shona nicknaming occures in a wide array of relationships and age groups, although it happens more frequently among males than females. The forms nicknames take and nicknaming patterns depend on the social distance between the participants, their relative social status, the context of nicknaming and the speaker's intention. The data for this article come from (a) field noted from participant observations taken of naturally occurring in public and private spheres over a period of one year (from September 2003 to September 2004) in and around the city of Harare and (b) transcriptions of semi-structured indepth interviews conducted with 60 Shona native speakers of varying age, gender, social status, occupations and religious affiliation...|$|R
