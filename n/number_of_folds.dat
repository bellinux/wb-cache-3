One of the challenges in the computer simulation of proteins at the atomic level is the ef-ficiency of sampling conformational space.

40|$|For a given mountain-valley {{pattern of}} {{equidistant}} creases {{on a long}} strip paper, there are many folded states consistent with the pattern. Among these folded states, we like to fold a paper so that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the paper layers between each pair of hinged paper segments is minimized. We first formalize this problem as optimization problem. The complexity {{of the problem is}} not known. In this paper, we give partial results related to the problem. First, we show that the problem is well-defined even in a simple folding model. The simple folding model is the most primitive model of basic origami models, and hence the folding availability is very restricted. We show a universality theorem <b>of</b> the simple <b>folding</b> model for this problem. That is, every flat folded state consistent with any given pattern can be folded by a sequence of simple foldings. Next, we investigate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>folded</b> states consistent with a given pattern.

The cassock is bound by a sash, called a fascia. The habit is given at formal reception into the community which comes after a few months of living together to see if the candidate fits in well. Members often, but do not necessarily, wear the cassock whilst engaged in their respective ministries, as this may be deemed unsuitable. On such occasions, members of the Oratory would wear the normal street clothes of a cleric, i.e., dark suit, but with the Oratorian collar.

The painting contains a number of features that confirm its technical superiority over the Dublin version.

Superior technique is also seen in the depiction of light on the objects, particularly on the glazed ceramic jug that the maid is holding in her hand, in which it is possible to see the shine of the crackle glaze and marks left when the jug was formed on a potter’s wheel. A possible explanation for this improvement in technique is that Velázquez returned to a previous theme in order to improve on it, concentrating on the tactile qualities of the painting, which were his main interest at the time, and disregarding the religious motif.|$|E
