5000|$|Beginning in the mid-1990s, however, {{informal}} recycling {{in parts}} of the United States and Western Europe once again began to mushroom. Two factors fueled the boom: First, the demand for recycling surged due to the increased waste stream, declining room in landfills, <b>new</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies,</b> and the efforts of environmentalists. [...] In 1985 only one roadside recycling program existed in the United States. By 1998, there were 9,000 such programs and 12,000 recyclable drop-off centers. Laws were passed in some states making it illegal not to recycle. Second, changes in the political economy including the loss of manufacturing jobs, cutbacks to government employment, and the roll back of the welfare state increased the ranks of the poor, working poor, and homeless—thus there were more people disposed to wastepick as a full-time profession or supplemental job.|$|E

The aluminum industry developed historically in an economy of energy surplus or abundance. It has responded to energy constraints with stringent, voluntary energy conservation programs that are enabling producers to reduce their consumption significantly. Conservation plus the results of on-going, energy-related R&D work and innovative technology are helping Alcoa reduce energy requirements. This talk reviews the aluminum industry's and Alcoa's conservation activities of the past five post-embargo years.

5000|$|Since the aseptic {{packages}} contain {{different layers}} of plastic and aluminium {{in addition to}} raw paper, they cannot be recycled as [...] "normal" [...] paper waste, but {{need to go to}} special recycling units for separation of the different materials. Tetra Pak has operated limited recycling since the mid-1980s, introducing a recycling program for its cartons in Canada as early as 1990. In 2000, Tetra Pak invested ฿20 million (€500,000) in the first recycling plant for aseptic packages in Thailand. Recycling of the aseptic packages has indeed been one of Tetra Pak's big challenges. Once separated, the aseptic carton results in aluminium and pure paraffin, which can be used in industry. Even without separating the carton materials, however, the aseptic carton can be reused, a Tetra Pak spokesman said, for example in engineering equipment. In 2010, 30 billion used Tetra Pak carton packages were recycled, a doubling since 2002. The company stated that it aims to help double the recycling rate within the next ten years, something that will require an engagement within the whole recycling chain. As of 2011, 20% of Tetra Pak cartons are recycled globally, with countries like Belgium, Germany, Spain and Norway showing local recycling rates of over 50%. To increase the level of recycling and meet the targets, Tetra Pak has engaged in driving recycling activities such as facilitating the development of collection schemes, launch <b>new</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> and raise the awareness about recycling and sustainability. Used Tetra Pak packages have been used as construction material in different design projects, with varying results.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a <b>new</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>technology</b> for waste plastics, {{catalytic}} degradation of low-density polyethylene has been investigated using a batch reactor system, in which the polymer thermally degraded first and the resulting decomposed fragments underwent further cracking on H-borosilicate catalyst. The presence of the boron catalyst was highly effective for converting the polymer into such lower alkenes as propene, butenes, and pentenes. Propene was more produced with decreasing thermal degradation temperature and increasing catalytic degradation temperature. However, the yield of the alkenes produced in the batch system was lower than that obtained in a fixed-bed flow reactor system. An excessive occurrence of the thermal degradation of polyethylene in the former {{might lead to a}} lowering of the alkenes yield, suggesting that the primary thermal reaction should be properly controlled to produce lower alkenes selectively in the subsequent catalytic process. 特集 : 「環境調和型社会を指向して...|$|R

40|$|In Japan, {{the most}} of waste {{concrete}} scraps have been reused as roadbed materials and the recycling ratio of waste concrete scraps has been kept over 95 % from 2000. However, {{it is expected that}} the demands of waste concrete scraps as roadbed materials would decrease even though the waste concrete scraps increase with the pulling down buildings in next decade. These facts mean that the recycling of waste concrete scraps would be in the negative situation. Therefore, the development of <b>new</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>technology</b> of waste concrete scraps is paramount importance in Japan. In this work, the pulsed power discharges inside of waste concrete scraps immersed in water were used to reproduce the coarse aggregate. In the experiments, the Marx generator, which storages the energy of 6. 4 kJ/Pulse, was used as pulsed power source and the point to hemisphere mesh electrode was immersed in water. The pulsed voltages with 400 kV of peak voltage were applied to the concrete scraps placed on hemisphere mesh and the reproduced coarse aggregates were evaluated after the repetitive discharge treatment. From the experimental results, it is found that the coarse aggregates reproduced by 40 ~ 60 pulsed discharge treatments have the enough qualities of the bone-dry density and the water absorption rate to satisfy JIS (Japan Industrial Standard) regulation (A 5005). In addition, the concretes consisted of the reproduced coarse aggregate also have the enough compressed strength and Young’s module to utilize as the construction material...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aluminum has {{experienced}} significant growth in several sectors {{over the last}} decade {{as a result of its}} properties and performance attributes. Aluminum is being recognized by different sectors such as automotive, construction, aerospace, etc. as a one of the best candidate material for various applications. Increasing demand for aluminum-based products and further globalization of the aluminum industry have contributed significantly to the higher consumption of aluminum scrap for re-production of aluminum alloys. In automotive applications, for example, the opportunities for continued growth in powertrain and suspension applications plus lightweighting of body structures offer the potential for considerable further growth. Today, a large amount of the aluminum going into new products is coming from recycled products. This represents a growing "energy bank " of aluminum that will become available for recycling at the end of vehicles ' lives, and thus recycling is becoming a major issue, and it is essential to tackle this problem before it is too late.

40|$|Today's {{recycling}} {{companies are}} faced with the challenge of finding proper recycling technologies to match the constantly changing production technologies. The problem for recycling companies in their search for new technologies is that they cannot fall back on industry-specific tools tailored to their needs. Accordingly, new technologies are identified too late, reaching the companies with considerable delay. A tailor-made approach combined with IT support would be a major benefit and would make it possible to identify relevant industry-specific technologies in a fast and structured way. Technology Scouting is a method that allows for the systematic and rapid identification of relevant technologies. However, a review of the state-of-the-art revealed significant deficiencies: The specific needs of the recycling industry, in particular, are neither met nor is the use of new media addressed. One {{reason for this is that}} no suitable approach exists for identifying and selecting material flows for which a considerable improvement can be expected when using new technologies. Another reason is that there is no automated Technology Scouting solution to support the user's search. The solution presented here consistently applies the principles of structuring, simplification, standardization, and automation. These principles are used in developing both an IT system and a tailor-made approach based on the existing Technology Scouting process. The above-mentioned deficiencies are eliminated by three new elements. The first is a mathematical optimization model that maps the identification process. From the given set of material flows, it selects those that hold the greatest potential for being optimized by new technologies. The second element is information modeling, which enables a systematic and automated search for <b>new</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>technologies</b> and applies algorithms of information retrieval to automate the search. A third element is the classification or filtering of the identified technologies according to different aspects of relevance. This procedure makes it possible to significantly reduce the effort required for the selection. In the end, the three elements are transformed into an organizational approach and put into practice in the business environment. Applicability, efficiency, and the software-related feasibility are verified by an IT-supported prototype. The approach was evaluated in a case study at a recycling company of waste electrical equipment. The case study made it possible to identify new fields of application for the recycling of CRT glass. It was considered as particularly relevant for the technologies to be useable for radiation protection in the medical and energy industry. Thus, CRT glass can be used for new purposes, presenting considerable opportunities for recycling companies...|$|E
