25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

In an interview with GOG.com's Trevor Longino, he said that [...] "NOLF is a really great title, and it's {{one of the ones}} where the rights are a bear to get sorted. Just like pretty much any other classic IP you're ever thought of, we’ve looked into it, but it’s <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> to do." ...|$|E

Then {{brooding}} for a moment on his wrongs: [...] "Have you a bloated brother? or you, sir? It matters little to you. But it has mattered to me with a vengeance! Shabby as I sit here I can boast that advantage--as he his five thousand a year. Being but a twelvemonth my elder he swaggers while I go thus. There's old England for you!

Wilson elaborated on Budig's way of showing vulnerability: [...] "You love to watch this bad girl, and that's <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> to make people do. As a person, Rebecca has this wonderful kind of spunky, upbeat quality that is endearing. I've always liked this girl, and enjoyed spending time with her. She's {{just a lot of}} fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|Newsted {{has stated}} {{that he has never}} regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said [...] "I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It {{was the right thing to}} do for the camp. That's it. I've never told anyone that I wanted to go back or {{anything}} like that—not once. I made up my mind. It was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> to do, but it was something I had to do. I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E

60|$|Gilbert flung himself wearily {{into the}} easy chair before the fire. He looked tired. It had <b>not</b> been <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> {{for him to}} tell Leslie.

60|$|It was <b>not</b> always <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> to {{maintain}} in the vacillating {{minds of the}} anthropoids a sustained interest in their venture.

60|$|They {{looked at}} each other, pouted, coloured, swung their heels; they were not pleased, I saw, but they were impressed, {{and in the way}} I wished them to be.

60|$|After all, it was, for {{the most}} part, carelessness, {{because he did not}} know Hayes as she knew him. Still, she had <b>not</b> {{undertaken}} <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> and she braced herself as she went up the steps of the new terrace. Grace hated the terrace. It was the price they, the Osborns, had taken for a shabby deed, and for which poor people and hard-worked women paid. Grace knew about the extra dust that peat fires caused and how often the bread was spoiled.|$|R
6000|$|What {{possible}} proof can Guicciardini have--what possible proof {{can there}} be--of such a [...] "bargain"? It rests upon purest assumption formed after those properties had changed hands--Ascanio being rewarded by them for his valuable services, and, also--so {{far as the}} Vice-Chancellorship was concerned--being suitably preferred. To say that Ascanio received them in consequence of a [...] "bargain" [...] and {{as the price of}} his vote and electioneering services is <b>not</b> only <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> to say, but it is the obvious thing for any one to say who aims at defaming.|$|R

60|$|Much {{cannot be}} said for the five voices that sang, nor for the two fiddles that {{accompanied}} them.

60|$|The {{stepmother}} {{knew what}} it all meant, and her mind never ceased from trying to invent some way of destroying the trees. It was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing,</b> but a woman's will can press milk out of a stone, and her cunning will overcome heroes. What craft will not do soft words may attain, and if these do not succeed there still remains the resource of tears.|$|E

5000|$|Another large Indiana {{event has}} taken the demise of BOTOD to heart: In 2006, nearby Cass County's 'Chief Logan's Port of Living History Festival at France Park' was {{struggling}} in its second year. [...] "Cass County parks officials deserve credit for pushing this concept forward and committing to it {{for at least another}} year.

5000|$|Similar sentiments {{had been}} {{expressed}} by others before. In The Codebreakers, David Kahn states: [...] "Few false ideas have more firmly gripped {{the minds of}} so many intelligent men than the one that, if they just tried, they could invent a cipher {{that no one could}} break", and in [...] "A Few Words On Secret Writing", in July 1841, Edgar Allan Poe had stated: [...] "Few persons can be made to believe that it is <b>not</b> quite <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>thing</b> to invent <b>a</b> method of secret writing which shall baffle investigation.

Data analysis technique is by reviewing the result of preliminary note, further it is drawn a conclusion from the informants’ and research subjects’ answers. The research result shows that the deaf people tend to show aggression attitude because of dissatisfaction on their attitude in social environment. It also supported by apathetic and withdrawn from their social environment. It is relevant to the theory of condition affecting social adaptation of deaf people at the end of schoolage. Thus, it is suggested that intensive conselling and emotional support should be given and social acceptance in their environment should be improved in order to make better social adaptation of deaf children...|$|R

40|$|Illegal dumps {{or illegal}} TPSS (Tempat Pembuangan Sampah Sementara) in Sleman formed {{because of the}} habbit of the society, They feel {{burdened}} to pay levy to the local government so they considered that garbage or home-industry waste are the government’s affairs. What writer tend to go thorough is the implementation of law enforcement against illegal TPSS in Sleman district and the obstacle of law enforcement against the illegal TPSS. Writer use empirical approach in doing the research which focuses on law behavior. The result after observation is that the law enforcement on illegal TPSS have been done by local government in Sleman which is “Kantor Lingkungan Hidup”, “Dinas Pekerjaan Umum Pertamanan”, and “Satuan Polisi Pamong Praja”. Unfortunately, the law enforcement haven’t goes well because there’re no decisive actions for the violators. This happen because of any other constraints such as {{there are many different}} views between the law enforcement’s officer in understanding and interpreting the legislation about illegal dumps. The verification of contamination or enviroment destruction because of the illegal dumps is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>things</b> to do because it needs a big amount of cost to acknowledge the community and that become one of the heavy burden for the government. The other things are the size of the Sleman district, lack of infrastructure and human resources, unproductive land which abandoned by locals and government which happen to be the main source of the whole problems. ...|$|R
