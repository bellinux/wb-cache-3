Seven year quarterly data of ten firms in the Indian Cement industry when analyzed reveals that {{there is no evidence of}} cointegration between the above mentioned variables, but the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model suggests that although past sales do not influence current advertising, advertising and sales promotion have a significant effect on the sales of cement after one year.

40|$|This paper {{measures}} the technical efficiency, super-efficiency, slacks, and input/output targets for large Indian pharmaceutical firms according to ownership by applying Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. The paper uses raw material, salaries & wages, advertisement & marketing and capital usage cost as input variables and <b>net</b> <b>sales</b> <b>revenue</b> as output variable. The super-efficiency model {{is applied to}} rank firms {{on the basis of}} efficiency scores. The paper finds that mean overall technical efficiency scores of Private Indian and Private Foreign are higher than Group-owned firms, suggesting that type of ownership affects the performance of a given firm. Further, foreign firms were found to have minimum slacks in inputs, evidently owing to their superior technology, better engineering skills and managerial practices. The study suggests that the inputs, such as, advertisement & marketing expenditure, and also the usage of labour and capital are required to be utilized far more productively in order to improve efficiency. ...|$|E

Svoje proizvodne in storitve ponujajo tako domačim kot tudi tujim uporabnikom. V teoretičnem delu diplomskega projekta smo opredelili pojem kaj je rast podjetja, zakaj naj bi podjetje rastlo, kakšni so vzroki za rast podjetja. Osredotočili smo se tudi podbrobneje na oblike rasti podjetja in značilnosti teh oblik rasti. V aplikativnem delu diplomskega projekta sem izvedla analizo rasti podjetja od leta 2014 - 2016 za 5 kazalnikov: sredstva, število zaposlenih za 3 leta, dodana vrednost na zaposlenega, čisti poslovni izzid za 3 leta ter čiste prihodke od prodaje. Na podlagi teh kazalnikov sem ugotovila, da je podjetje rastlo po številu zaposlenih, kar je vidno tudi po indeksu povprečne rasti podjetja, ki je najvišji od vseh. Pri ostalih kazalnikih pa se je pokazalo sorazmerno nihanje.

Tehnoles is a company that deals with dry construction and sale of paints and construction material. They offer their products and services to both, domestic and foreign customers. In the theoretical part of the thesis, the author defined what there is to understand about the term company growth and what it embraces, why a company should grow, what the reasons for the growth of a company are. The author also focused on the forms of company growth and the characteristics of these forms. In the applicable part of the thesis, the author carried out an analysis of the company 2 ̆ 7 s growth from 2014 to 2016 based on five indicators: assets, number of employees for 3 years, added value per employee, net profit for 3 years and <b>net</b> <b>sales</b> <b>revenue.</b> On the basis of these indicators, the author {{came to the conclusion that}} the company grew according to the number of employees and also to the average growth index of the company, which was the highest of all indicators.

40|$|Featured price {{cuts are}} a popular tool among brand-manufacturers and {{retailers}}. Yet, {{there is growing}} concern about the <b>net</b> <b>sales</b> and <b>revenue</b> gains from these promotions, as retailers and manufacturers may simply be subsidizing consumers that shop around. This notion has placed the (co-) occurrence of a brand’s promotions across retailers high on the promotion-planning agenda. This paper examines the mechanisms underlying out-of-phase vs. in-phase schedules, and empirically demonstrates their <b>sales</b> and <b>revenue</b> implications in four product categories, covering purchases of a national panel of households across eight years. Our results reveal that calendar effects primarily materialize in categories where the chosen retailer is driven by brand promotions. In those categories, alternating the timing of featured price cuts across chains substantially increases the manufacturer and retailers’ immediate sales lift. However, {{when it comes to}} net gains, striving for out-of-phase promotions – the dominant approach among chains – is not necessarily ‘best practice’: retailers see the revenue advantage diminish, and manufacturers may even earn less...|$|R

Case studies section of the dissertation examines the history and motives of Amazon. com and eBay for engaging in mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances activity, and measures the consequences of this activity by applying accounting and empirical financial approaches. Qualitative data is obtained from both online and published resources; the findings are that: 1.

However, their impact on market share can be either positive or neutral. Quantitative data is taken from the companies' annual reports, business research companies' archives and financial website, Yahoo! Finance. com. The empirical models test four hypotheses, which concern the companies' financial and stock market performance. The findings of these models can be summarised as follows: 1. Mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances can have either positive or negative effect on the companies' financial performances. 2. Mergers and acquisitions have either negative or close to zero effect on the companies' stock market's performance. 3. Strategic alliances have strongly positive effect on the companies' stock market's performance. 4.

We include all companies listed in the financial and industry sector on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm in an attempt to examine human capital and its effect on firm valuation. Our results indicate that a higher efficiency of human capital has a positive effect on return on assets. However, we find that our measure can be interpreted in two ways; either as a firm’s level of human capital efficiency or its dependency on human capital, to achieve its <b>net</b> <b>sales</b> and <b>revenue.</b> We also find indications that the market is valuing firms that rely on human capital lower than firms that don’t.
