5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were a <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of everyday life, {{much more so}} than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The chewing of cud by {{animals such as}} cows, goats, and giraffes is {{considered}} normal behavior. These animals are known as ruminants. Such behavior, though termed rumination, {{is not related to}} human rumination syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary rumination, similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates. True merycism, as opposed to the cud-chewing process in ruminants, is also a <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the digestive process in some other animals, such as kangaroos.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become a <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E

5|$|Dances can be {{performed}} solo (1, 4); in pairs, (2, 3); in groups, (5, 6, 7); or by massed performers (10). They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (4); a paying audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2, need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves (9).|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is a <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of {{the human}} immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in {{the walls of the}} bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E
5|$|The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ the King. Most {{of these}} festivals {{are tied to}} the {{moveable}} feast of Easter. Festivals take precedence over all other days, including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas is considered to be twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and Easter is fifty days in length (from Easter Sunday up to and inclusive of Pentecost). For Easter, Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of Easter, will always be on a Thursday, the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of Easter in addition to or in place of the <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the Easter festival for that day.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to the Borrelia {{bacterium}} during Lyme disease possibly {{causes a}} long-lived and damaging inflammatory response, {{a form of}} pathogen-induced autoimmune disease.

25|$|The British anti-nuclear {{movement}} {{at this time}} differed {{from that of the}} 1960s. Many groups sprang up independently of CND, some affiliating later. CND's previous objection to civil disobedience was dropped and it became a <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of anti-nuclear protest. The women's movement had a strong influence, much of it emanating from the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp, followed by Molesworth People's Peace Camp.|$|E

40|$|In ophthalmology, optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) {{is rapidly}} becoming popular to diagnose retinal diseases. However, the quantitative evaluation of retinal diseases has not been established for OCT image. Some clinical doctors desire a computer-aided diagnosis system to evaluate the size {{and the degree of}} disease quantitatively. In previous researches, the size of the retinal diseases is measured as abnormal parts of small regions in the number of layer boundaries, which is estimated by analysis method on a gray level profile for an OCT image. However, in an abnormal part, the difference of the number of layer boundaries is small between abnormal <b>parts</b> and <b>normal</b> <b>parts,</b> and the previous method can’t detect the size of the abnormal part. In this research, we propose a new method to measure the size of abnormal parts using correlation coefficient in gray level distribution for an OCT image. In the gray level distributions of the OCT image, the correlation coefficient is large in <b>normal</b> <b>parts,</b> and the coefficient is small between normal regions and abnormal parts. Therefore, our system can detect the position of borders between abnormal <b>parts</b> and <b>normal</b> <b>parts</b> using the distribution of correlation coefficient. We apply the proposed method to some retinal disease images. For an OCT image, we obtained the overlap rate 92. 3 [%] between the identified part by the proposed method and the clinical doctor for the abnormal part. The overlap rate is improved for 21 OCT images among 25 OCT images, and the improved rate in the proposed method is 84 [%] compared with the previous metho...|$|R

However, they were strongly disliked by the protesters, and each declared they would not accept succession to the Presidency, finally promoting Edwardo Rodriguez, Supreme Court Chief Justice, to the Presidency. Considered apolitical and hence trustworthy by most, his administration was a temporary one until elections could be held. Protesters quickly disbanded in many areas, and like many times in Bolivia's past, major political upheavals were taken as a <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the political process.|$|E

Spare-time education included a very broad range of educational activities at all levels.
