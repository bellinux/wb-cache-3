5000|$|A {{nomogram}} (from Greek νόμος nomos, [...] "law" [...] and γραμμή grammē, [...] "line"), {{also called}} a nomograph, alignment chart or abaque, is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram {{designed to allow}} the approximate graphical computation of a mathematical function. The field of <b>nomography</b> was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne (1862-1938) and used extensively {{for many years to}} provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.|$|E
5000|$|Hilbert's thirteenth {{problem is}} one of the 23 Hilbert {{problems}} set out in a celebrated list compiled in 1900 by David Hilbert. It entails proving whether a solution exists for all 7th-degree equations using algebraic (variant: continuous) functions of two arguments. It was first presented in the context of <b>nomography,</b> and in particular [...] "nomographic construction" [...] — a process whereby a function of several variables is constructed using functions of two variables. Hilbert's conjecture, that it is not always possible to find such a solution, was disproven in 1957.|$|E
5000|$|With Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne Lalanne is {{considered}} {{the inventor of the}} nomogram. The intention was to replace the slide rule. In a paper of 1846 Lalanne contributed to the subject the ideas of anamorphosis and the use of projective transformations. There were applications to the solution of the cubic equation. He called his nomographic device the [...] "abac". This [...] "universal calculator" [...] had 60 functions implemented graphically. Half a century later Maurice d'Ocagne provided a general theory, founded in projective geometry, for the nonlinear scales related by <b>nomography.</b>|$|E
50|$|Philbert-Maurice Ocagne {{was born}} in Paris on 25 March 1862. He {{attended}} high school at the Lycée Fontanges school in Paris, and studied at Chaptal college. In 1877, he published his first mathematical work. In 1880, he entered the École Polytechnique. He published many articles on math.Starting in 1885, he served for six years as engineer, supporting waterworks projects in Rochefort and Cherbourg, then worked at Seine-et-Oise, at the residence of Pontoise. From 1882, continued to published articles on mathematics in the Academy of Sciences. Several major journals publish his work, including Journal of the École Polytechnique, Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France, Acta Mathematica, Archiv der Mathematik und Physik, and American Journal of Mathematics. He became a répétiteur at the École Polytechnique in 1893, then in 1894 {{a professor at the}} École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées. In 1891 he began publishing papers on <b>nomography.</b>|$|E
50|$|Language classicists do {{not like}} this word or approve of it, because of its {{inherent}} confusion with the existing, though rare, nomophobia, a fear of laws, rules or regulations. The latter derives from the Greek nomos (a law, rule or regulation) seen in such other words as astronomy (rules about the stars), gastronomy (rules about food and eating), autonomy (ruling oneself), economy (rules governing the finances of the state or household), antinomy (a law contrary to another law), metronome (a device to regulate metre or beat), nomocracy (the {{rule of law in}} society), <b>nomography</b> (the law in written form), nomology (the study or science of law), nomothete (a lawgiver), and the archaic anomy (lawlessness). The neologistic meaning referred to in this article, relating to mobile phones, seems to have been adopted by the younger generations, and by those without {{a deeper understanding of the}} Oxford guidelines on word construction, in which typically Greek words are attached to Greek words (and Latin to Latin, etc.).|$|E

In 1907, he received his doctorate at, and joined {{the faculty of the}} Technische Hochschule in Budapest (today Budapest University of Technology and Economics). His classes were visited by Paul Erdős, who, as a first year student, solved one of his problems. Kőnig became a full professor there in 1935. To honor his fathers' death in 1913, Kőnig and his brother György created the Gyula Kőnig prize in 1918. This prize was meant to be an endowment for young mathematicians, however was later devaluated. But the prize remained as a medal of high scientific recognition. In 1899, he published his first work while still attending High School in a journal Matematikai és Fizikai Lapok. After his graduation in 1902, he won first place in a mathematical competition [...] "Eötvös Loránd". [...] Shortly after he wrote the first of two book collections Matematikai Mulatságok (Mathematical Entertainments). He spent four semesters at the university in Budapest and his last five in Göttingen, during which he studied under the famous mathematicians József Kürschák and Hermann Minkowski. He then received his doctorate [...] in 1907 due to his dissertation in geometry, that same year he began working for the Technische Hochschule in Budapest and remained a part of the faculty till his death in 1944. At first he started as an assistant in problem sessions, in 1910 he was promoted to [...] "oberassistant", and then promoted to [...] "Privatdocent" [...] in 1911 teaching <b>nomography,</b> analysis situs (later to be known as topology), set theory, real numbers and functions, and graph theory (the name [...] "graph theory" [...] didn't appear in the university catalogue until 1927). During this time he would be a guest speaker giving mathematics lecture for architecture and chemistry students, in 1920 these lectures made their way into book form. at the Technische Hochschule.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBetween 1884 and {{his death}} in 1938, Maurice d’Ocagne {{published}} more than fifty papers on <b>nomography</b> in important journals of engineering (Annales des Ponts et Chaussées, Le Génie Civil…) and mathematics (Nouvelles Annales de mathématiques, Acta Mathematica, Archiv der Mathematik und Physik…), but also in journals intended for popularization and teaching. Moreover, several of his papers were adapted or translated by himself or other authors in many languages all over Europe and elsewhere. Through these papers and d’Ocagne’s correspondence, we will analyse his strategies of publication and his efforts to promote <b>nomography</b> in different professional milieus and different countries...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nomography</b> {{deals with}} {{geometrical}} transformations, particularly projective transformations of a plane. The book reviews projective plane and collineation transformations in geometrical and algebraical terms. The geometrical approach aims at permitting {{the use of}} elementary geometrical methods in drawing collineation nomograms consisting of three rectilinear scales. The algebraical treatment concerns nomograms containing curvilinear scales. The text explains functional scales that include the graph of a function and a logarithmic scale. The book explores equations which can be represented by e...|$|E
40|$|C-INVInternational audienceTraditionally, {{history of}} {{mathematics}} {{was more interested}} in the production of abstract concepts and major theories than in the one of methods and tools of calculation. As a result, it has often neglected to consider the mathematical practices of engineers. I want to sketch here a sample of these practices through the example of <b>nomography</b> {{in the second half of}} 19 th century and first half of the 20 th century, precisely at the time when the professional community of engineers structures itself and deepens its mathematical culture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{a type of}} the {{high-strength}} abrasion-resistant steel-NM 360 {{has been}} studied {{with the aid of}} the modern physical simulation technology {{to solve the problem of}} its poor weldability. In the experiment, the welding thermal cycles under different cooling conditions with the peak heating temperature of 1320 o C were simulated via the Gleeble- 1500 D thermal/mechanical simulator. The SH-CCT diagram of NM 360 has been established by investigating the microstructure transformation course and the hardness of the welded heat-affected zone (HAZ) near fusion line during different cooling process. Moreover, the impact toughness and fracture in HAZ with different cooling rate have been studied. The established SH-CCT diagram and impact toughness in HAZ provide the referential experimental basis for selecting proper welding parameters. At last, the welding parameters for NM 360 steel are determined with the aid of <b>nomography</b> of carbon dioxide gas shielded arc welding and empirical formula...|$|E
40|$|We give an {{introduction}} to Malliavin calculus following the notes of four lectures that I gave in the working group {{of the research team}} Mathfi in October 2001. These notes contain three topics: An elementary presentation of Malliavin's differential operators and of the integration by parts formula which represents the central tool in this theory. The Wiener chaos decomposition and the differential operators of Malliavin calculus as operators on the Wiener space. The application of this calculus {{to the study of the}} density of the law of a diffusion process. This was the initial application of Malliavin's calculus - and provides a probabili- stic proof of Hormander's hypothesis. The aim of these notes is to emphasis some basic ideas and technics related to this theory and not to provide a text book. The book of Nualart, for example, is an excellent <b>nomography</b> on this topic. So we live out some technical points (we send to the papers or books where complete proofs may be found) and do not treat problems in all generality or under the more general assumptions. We hope that this choice provides a soft presentation of the subject which permits to understand better the objects and the ideas coming on as well as the possible applications...|$|E
40|$|That body of {{knowledge}} which has the name <b>Nomography</b> consists of the theory and practice by which the results of Geometry are used to facilitate numerical calculation. The subject existed under various titles before 1891 when d'Ocagne coined its present name. Methods in use before 1840 are examined to determine the foundations on which the subsequent structure was erected. In particular, the development of analytical geometry and {{of the concept of}} level curves, or contours, are noted for the main period of development, up to 1900, the works of lalanne, Massau and d'Ocagne are examined with that of other less important contributors. Lalanne published his ideas in 1843 giving the first indication of a related theoretical problem, that of anamorphosis or the replacement of curves difficult to construct by others more regular, preferably straight lines. Massau published many important results in 1884 including the form of a determinant equation which must be satisfied by components of a function of three variables if that function is to be represented by three systems of straight lines. Also in 1884, d'Ocagne described a new type of nomogram depending on the alignment of points; previous nomograms had depended on the intersection of curves. The possibility of alignment in the case of three variables is seen to be related to Massau's determinant equation and thus to the problem of anamorphosi for the period from 1900 two main themes are followed. The major theme examines the attempts {{to solve the problem of}} anamorphosis for functions of three variables. Surprisingly, this requires the examination of comparatively recent material and it is found that there is no neat and tidy solution; at least not one that has yet been found. The second theme considers the propagation and USB of nomographic ideas with special reference to Britain, where they were not readily adopted. finally, some recent developments in the subject are examined...|$|E
