40|$|Vaccines {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} public health medicinal products with an excellent safety record. As vaccines are produced using biological materials, there is a need to safeguard against potential contamination with <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents.</b> <b>Adventitious</b> <b>agents</b> could be inadvertently introduced into a vaccine through starting materials used for production. Therefore, extensive testing has been recommended at specific stages of vaccine manufacture to demonstrate the absence of <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents.</b> Additionally, the incorporation of viral clearance steps in the manufacturing process can aid in reducing the risk of <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> contamination. However, for live viral vaccines, aside from possible purification of the virus or vector, extensive <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> clearance may not be feasible. In the event that an <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> is detected in a vaccine, it is important to determine its origin, evaluate its potential for human infection and pathology, and discern which batches of vaccine may have been affected in order to take risk mitigation action. To achieve this, it is necessary to have archived samples of the vaccine and ancillary components, ideally from developmental through to current batches, as well as samples of the biological materials used in the manufacture of the vaccine, since these are the most likely sources of an <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent.</b> The need for formal guidance on such vaccine sample archiving has been recognized but not fulfilled. We summarize in this paper several prior major cases of vaccine contamination with <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents</b> and provide points for consideration on sample archiving of live recombinant viral vector vaccines for use in humans.

40|$|The {{availability}} of {{safe and effective}} animal vaccines is critical {{for the prevention of}} animal disease. <b>Adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> testing is done on master seed viruses prior to vaccine licensure to ensure that no biological contaminants were introduced during manufacture. Traditional <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> testing is performed using a variety of cell culture lines and a panel of polymerase chain reaction tests. The purpose of this research was to determine if new technologies like DNA microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS) could be of any benefit for <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> testing. A literature review describes the state of the field and the challenges {{that will have to be}} addressed to use these technologies in a regulatory environment. Both techniques were tested on a panel of mammalian and avian viruses, and each virus was tested individually and in combination with other viruses. NGS was found to be a more reliable method of screening for <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents</b> than microarray...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince the {{earliest}} days of biological product manufacture, {{there have been a number}} of instances where laboratory studies provided evidence for the presence of <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents</b> in a marketed product. Lessons learned from such events can be used to strengthen regulatory preparedness for the future. We have therefore selected four instances where an <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent,</b> or a signal suggesting the presence of an agent, was found in a viral vaccine, and have developed a case study for each. The four cases are: a) SV 40 in polio vaccines; b) bacteriophage in measles and polio vaccines; c) reverse transcriptase in measles and mumps vaccines; and d) porcine circovirus and porcine circovirus DNA sequences in rotavirus vaccines. The lessons learned from each event are discussed. Based in part on those experiences, certain scientific principles have been identified by WHO that should be considered in regulatory risk evaluation if an <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> is found in a marketed vaccine in the future...|$|R

Along with colleagues from several other genome se-quencing centers, we recently published an editorial proposing a common nomenclature for describing levels of finishing for viral genomes assembled with HT sequencing data (2). In addition, we discuss two ways of characterizing viral samples that go beyond consensus genome assembly, namely, the description of population-level diversity and the identification of contaminants or <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents.</b> Due to limitations of space, we focused primarily on the im-portance {{of these types of}} characterizations and the strengths of HT sequencing for conducting such analyses.

40|$|Occult viral {{agents in}} cell {{cultures}} may include (i) known viruses present at a concentration {{too low for}} detection and (ii) unknown viruses. For maximal safety regarding <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents,</b> a strategy is proposed which involves cellular cloning of candidate cell substrates for vaccines. This will render occult viruses present in either all cells or none, thus greatly facilitating their detection. Known and unknown members of virus families known to establish latency are best detected by molecular methods based on broadly conserved sequences and low stringency conditions. The presence of retrovirus particles, known or unknown, in vaccine harvests can be excluded by the Product-Enhanced Reverse Transcriptase (PERT) assay which detects particle-associated reverse transcriptase with the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification tests. Latent retroviruses can be activated by stimulation with halogenated pyrimidines and/or azacytidine. Endogenous proviruses with no release of particles are of no concern...|$|R

We derived and characterized three hESC lines in adherence to regulations for embryo procurement, and good tissue, manufacturing and laboratory practices. To minimize freezing and thawing, we continuously expanded the lines from initial outgrowths and samples were cryopreserved as early stocks and banks. Batch release criteria included DNA-fingerprinting and HLA-typing for identity, characterization of pluripotency-associated marker expression, proliferation, karyotyping and differentiation in-vitro and in-vivo. These hESCs may be valuable for regenerative therapy. The ethical, scientific and regulatory methodolog...|$|R
