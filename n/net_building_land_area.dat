The possible association between urban heat island (UHI) and urbanization indicators are also discussed. Examination of the population variation indicates a continuously increase of registered population and a rapid increase of floating population that mainly comes from neighboring provinces in recent years. With rapid urban sprawl, {{a large amount of}} cultivated lands has been replaced with <b>building</b> <b>lands</b> around urban <b>areas</b> and towns of Shanghai. Urbanization is correlated with the increase of air temperature, hot days and the decrease of relative humidity, wind speed and vegetation NDVI in Shanghai. The growth of UHI in Shanghai has been driven by the continuous increase of buildings, paved roads, buses, population and GDP, as well as the decrease of cultivated <b>land.</b> Boosting the <b>area</b> of green <b>land</b> in urban <b>areas</b> has to a certain extent mitigated the UHI in Shanghai in recent years...|$|R

50|$|Earlier urban model {{systems were}} {{generally}} based on deterministic solution algorithms such as Spatial Interaction or Spatial Input-Output, that emphasize repeatability and uniqueness of convergence to an equilibrium, but rest on strong assumptions about behavior, such as agents having perfect information {{of all the}} alternative locations in the metropolitan area, transactions being costless, and markets being perfectly competitive. Housing booms and busts, and the financial crisis, are relatively clear examples of market imperfections that motivate the use of less restrictive assumptions in UrbanSim. Rather than calibrating the model to a cross-sectional equilibrium, or base-year set of conditions, statistical methods {{have been developed to}} calibrate uncertainty in UrbanSim arising from its use of Monte Carlo methods and from uncertainty in data and models, against observed data over a longitudinal period, using a method known as Bayesian Melding. In addition to its less strong assumptions about markets, UrbanSim departs from earlier model designs that used high levels of aggregation of geography into large zones, and agents such as households and jobs into large groups assumed to be homogeneous. Instead, UrbanSim adopts a microsimulation approach meaning that it represents individual agents within the simulation. This is an agent-level model system, but unlike most agent-based models, it does not focus exclusively on the interactions of adjacent agents. Households, businesses or jobs, <b>buildings,</b> and <b>land</b> <b>areas</b> represented alternatively by parcels, gridcells, or zones, are used to represent the agents and locations within a metropolitan area.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master Thesis {{is to create an}} {{evaluation}} system of undeveloped <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> which will allow objective evaluation of the market value of <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> We have set ourselves the following research hypothesis: the generalized market value of <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> estimated {{to meet the needs of}} mass valuation, is not applicable to individual valuation of <b>building</b> <b>lands</b> in Slovenia, because it does not reflect the situation on the market of <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> Therefore, in Slovenia we need to establish a system of an individual valuation of <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> based on the market standard ground values of <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> For the purposes of research, we obtained, processed and analyzed data on completed transactions with <b>building</b> <b>land</b> on the applied area of the Municipality of Maribor in the period from 2007 to the end of 2014. We adjusted the acquired data on completed transactions on 31 12 2014 and eliminated the differences, caussed by different time of sale. We have created value zones by using the modified method of leaders. The adequacy of formed zones has been checked by comparing the coefficients of variation and execution of t-tests with which we verified differences of created zones. We have determined the reference <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> which has properties that are on the applied area most represented. Range of factors that affect the value of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> has been determined based on a survey of the professional public. With multiple regression analysis, we have checked which factors in each zone affected the value of <b>building</b> <b>land.</b> Standard ground values have been determined by a statistical method and its suitability was checked by intersubjective methods. In order to verify the adequacy of zones, the "Zielbaum" method or branched diagram after Aurnhammer procedure has been used. We have found that the standard ground value is properly defined by using the statistical methods. We have designed the coefficients for the conversion for variable <b>area</b> of <b>building</b> <b>land</b> in the value zone three. The survey has shown that the existing system of individual evaluation does not prohibit indirect valuation through market comparisons, which may also include the evaluation with the help of market standard ground values.
