PVD coatings shows both very low values for wear rate and friction coefficient and high hardness. Nevertheless PVD techniques allow to obtain just thin coatings (< 10 &# 956;m), which do not warrant good mechanical resistance in presence of highly localized loads, during the whole lifetime of component. Such limit is currently overcame by utilizing duplex processes or multilayer coatings, which allow to reach high thickness with mechanical properties increasing gradually from the substrate-coating interface to the outer surface.

40|$|One {{important}} {{process in}} tool based micro machining technology is CNC micro turning {{which has the}} capability to produce 3 D structures on micro scale. The major drawback of micro turning process is that the machining force influences machining accuracy and the limit of machinable size and shape. Therefore, the control of reactive force during cutting {{is an important factor}} in improving machining accuracy. The properties of work material significantly affect the cutting force generated during turning process. Commercially available metal rods are inhomogeneous and hence, qualifying the right material is very crucial in micro turning. Unlike plates, the properties like grain size and density vary significantly at different locations of the round bars. Hence, it is found very important to systematically find right material for micro turning from the commercially available rods. In present study, an attempt has been made to study the grain size and density of blank material from different locations of a larger diameter shaft. The work material selected is a 32 mm diameter shaft of commercial brass, a <b>non</b> <b>ferrous</b> <b>alloy</b> of copper and zinc.

Superior resistances to corrosion and compatibility in high temperature and high vacuum have particularly made it an attractive choice. However, the machinability of austenitic {{stainless steel}} is not very promising owing to lower thermal conductivity, higher degree of ductility and work harden ability. Grade 316 L 1 is the standard molybdenum- bearing grade. Molybdenum gives 316 better corrosion resistance properties than crevice corrosion in chloride environment.

Since P 30 grade of cemented carbide would provide excellent balance of hardness, wear resistance and toughness, the same grade has been chosen for machining of stainless steel. In the first phase of work, tool life test would be carried out using three different cutting velocities (110, 130 and 150 m/min) with constant feed of 0. 2 mm/rev and constant depth of cut of 1 mm for different duration of machining. Tool life study would be based on average flank wear, VB= 0. 3 mm criterion. Flank wear would be measured using a zoom optical microscope.
