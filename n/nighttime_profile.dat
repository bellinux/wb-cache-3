Although the measurements were obtained {{at different times of}} day and during different seasons, {{ozone concentration}}s in the upper stratosphere varied by only a few percent. Quadratic, least squares fits to the data between 34 km and 40 km for the four daytime flights, yield a mean concentration at 37 km of 1. 02 x 10 to the 12 th power molecules/cu cm with a 2 percent standard deviation.

40|$|We {{show that}} a <b>nighttime</b> <b>profile</b> of OClO in the Arctic vortex {{during the winter of}} 2000 is overestimated, by nearly a factor of 2, using an {{isentropic}} trajectory model constrained by observed profiles of ClOx (ClO + 2 X ClOOCl) and BrO. Calculated abundances of nighttime OClO are shown {{to be sensitive to the}} abundance of BrOx (BrO + BrCl), details of the air parcel history during the most recent sunrise/sunset transitions, and the BrCl yield from the reaction BrO + ClO. Many uncertainties are considered, and the discrepancy between measured and modeled nighttime OClO appears to be robust. This discrepancy suggests that production of OClO occurs more slowly than implied by standard photochemistry. If the yield of BrCl from the reaction of BrO + ClO is increased from 7 % (JPL 2002 value) to 11 % (near the upper limit of the uncertainty), good agreement is found between measured and modeled nighttime OClO. This study highlights the importance of accurate knowledge of BrO + ClO reaction kinetics as well as air parcel trajectories for proper interpretation of nighttime OClO. These factors have a considerably smaller impact on the interpretation of OClO observations obtained during twilight (90 (deg) <=SZA <= 92 (deg)), when photolytic processes are still active...|$|E
40|$|The high power, {{broadband}} {{very low}} frequency (VLF, 3 [...] 30 kHz) and extremely low frequency (ELF, 3 [...] 3000 Hz) electromagnetic waves generated by lightning discharges and propagating in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide {{can be used to}} measure the average electron density profile of the lower ionosphere (D region) across the wave propagation path due to several reflections by the upper boundary (lower ionosphere) of the waveguide. This capability makes it possible to frequently and even continuously monitor the D region electron density profile variations over geographically large regions, which are measurements that are essentially impossible by other means. These guided waves, usually called atmospherics (or sferics for short), are recorded by our sensors located near Duke University. The purpose of this work is to develop and implement algorithms to derive the variations of D region electron density profile which is modeled by two parameters (one is height and another is sharpness), by comparing the recorded sferic spectra to a series of model simulated sferic spectra from using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) code. In order to understand the time scales, magnitudes and sources for the midlatitude nighttime D region variations, we analyzed the sferic data of July and August 2005, and extracted both the height and sharpness of the D region electron density profile. The heights show large temporal variations of several kilometers on some nights and the relatively stable behavior on others. Statistical calculations indicate that the hourly average heights during the two months range between 82. 0 km and 87. 2 km with a mean value of 84. 9 km and a standard deviation of 1. 1 km. We also observed spatial variations of height as large as 2. 0 km over 5 degrees latitudes on some nights, and no spatial variation on others. In addition, the measured height variations exhibited close correlations with local lightning occurrence rate on some nights but no correlation with local lightning or displaced lightning on others. The <b>nighttime</b> <b>profile</b> sharpness during 2. 5 hours in two different nights was calculated, and the results were compared to the equivalent sharpness derived from International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) models. Both the absolute values and variation trends in IRI models are different from those in broadband measurements. Based on sferic data similar to those for nighttime, we also measured the daytime D region electron density profile variations in July and August 2005 near Duke University. As expected, the solar radiation is the dominant but not the only determinant source for the daytime D region profile height temporal variations. The observed quiet time heights showed close correlations with solar zenith angle changes but unexpected spatial variations not linked to the solar zenith angle were also observed on some days, with 15 % of days exhibiting regional differences larger than 0. 5 km. During the solar flare, the induced height change was approximately proportional to the logarithm of the X-ray fluxes. During the rising and decaying phases of the solar flare, the height changes correlated more consistently with the short (wavelength 0. 5 - 4 Å), rather than the long (wavelength 1 - 8 Å) X-ray flux changes. The daytime profile sharpness during morning, noontime and afternoon periods in three different days and for the solar zenith angle range 20 to 75 degrees was calculated. These broadband measured results were compared to narrowband VLF measurements, IRI models and Faraday rotation base IRI models (called FIRI). The estimated sharpness from all these sources was more consistent when the solar zenith angle was small than when it was large. By applying the nighttime and daytime measurement techniques, we also derived the D region variations during sunrise and sunset periods. The measurements showed that both the electron density profile height and sharpness decrease during the sunrise period while increase during the sunset period. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} surface flux {{boundary}} conditions and geostrophic forcing on multiday evolution of {{flow in the}} atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) was assessed using large-eddy simulations (LES). The LES investigations included several combinations of surface boundary conditions (temperature and heat flux) and geostrophic forcing (constant, time varying, time and height varying). The setup was based on ABL characteristics observed during a selected period of the Cooperative Atmosphere–Surface Exchange Study— 1999 (CASES- 99) campaign. The LES cases driven by a constant geostrophic wind achieved the best agreement with the CASES- 99 observations specifically in terms of daytime surface fluxes and daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>profiles.</b> However, the <b>nighttime</b> fluxes were significantly overestimated. The LES cases with the surface temperature boundary condition and driven by a time- and height-varying geostrophic forcing showed improved agreement with the observed nighttime fluxes, but there was less agreement with other observations (e. g., daytime profiles). In terms of the surface boundary condition, the LES cases driven by either surface temperature or heat fluxes produced similar trends {{in terms of the}} daytime profiles and comparisons with data from soundings. However, in reproducing the fluxes and <b>nighttime</b> <b>profiles,</b> the agreement was better with imposed temperature because of its ability to interact dynamically with the air temperature field.

40|$|The {{vertical}} {{structure of the}} nighttime thermosphere and exosphere of Venus was discussed. A comparison {{of the day and}} <b>nighttime</b> <b>profiles</b> indicates, contrary to the model of Dickinson and Riley (1977), that densities (principally atomic oxygen) dropped sharply from day to night.

Large periodic oscillations, in both density and inferred exospheric temperatures, were detected with periods of 5 to 6 days. The possibility that cyclic variations in the thermosphere and stratosphere were caused by planetary-scale waves, propagated upward from the lower atmosphere, was investigated using simultaneous temperature measurements obtained by the Venus radiometric temperature experiment (VORTEX). Inferred exospheric temperatures in the morning were found to be lower than in the evening as if the atmosphere rotated {{in the direction of the}} planet's rotation, similar to that of earth.

These two systems have been providing high-resolution vertical profiles of ozone number density between 15 - 50 km, several nights a week since 1989 (TMF) and 1993 (MLO). The climatology presented here is typical of early night ozone values with only a small influence of the Pinatubo aerosols and the 11 -year solar cycle. The observed seasonal and vertical structure of the ozone concentration at TMF is consistent with that typical of mid- to subtropical latitudes. A clear annual cycle in opposite phase below and above the ozone concentration peak is observed. The observed winter maximum below the ozone peak {{is associated with a}} maximum day-to-day variability, typical of a dynamically driven lower stratosphere. The maximum concentration observed in summer above the ozone peak emphasizes the more dominant role of photochemistry. Unlike TMF, the ozone concentration observed at MLO tends to be higher during the summer months and lower during the winter months throughout the entire stratospheric ozone layer. Only a weak signature of the extra-tropical latitudes is observed near 19 - 20 km, with a secondary maximum in late winter.

40|$|International audienceThe current {{emphasis}} on global climate studies {{has led the}} scientific community {{to set up a}} number of sites for measuring the long-term biosphere-atmosphere net CO 2 exchange (net ecosystem exchange, NEE). Partitioning this flux into its elementary components, net assimilation (F-A), and respiration (F-R), remains necessary {{in order to get a}} better understanding of biosphere functioning and design better surface exchange models. Noting that F-R and F-A have different isotopic signatures, we evaluate the potential of isotopic (CO 2) -C- 13 measurements in the air (combined with CO 2 flux and concentration measurements) to partition NEE into F-R and F-A on a routine basis. The study is conducted at a temperate coniferous forest where intensive isotopic measurements in air, soil, and biomass were performed in summer 1997. The multilayer soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model MuSICA is adapted to compute (CO 2) -C- 13 flux and concentration profiles. Using MuSICA as a "perfect'' simulator and taking advantage of the very dense spatiotemporal resolution of the isotopic data set (341 flasks over a 24 -hour period) enable us to test each hypothesis and estimate the performance of the method. The partitioning works better in midafternoon when isotopic disequilibrium is strong. With only 15 flasks, i. e., two (CO 2) -C- 13 <b>nighttime</b> <b>profiles</b> (to estimate the isotopic signature of F-R) and five daytime measurements (to perform the partitioning) we get mean daily estimates of F-R and F-A that agree with the model within 15 - 20 %.

Polar cap absorption (PCA) models predict the 30 MHz cosmic noise absorption, A, measured by riometers, based on real-time {{measurements of the}} integrated proton flux-energy spectrum, J. However, empirical models in common use cannot account for regional and day-to-day variations in the day- and <b>nighttime</b> <b>profiles</b> of αeff(z) or the related sensitivity parameter, m=A/√J. Large prediction errors occur during twilight when m changes rapidly, and due to errors locating the rigidity cutoff latitude. Modeling the twilight change in m as a linear or Gauss error-function transition over a range of solar-zenith angles (χl < χ < χu) provides a better fit to measurements than selecting day or night αeff profiles based on the Earth-shadow height.

40|$|I ntrod uction The {{goal of this}} {{research}} program {{is the development of}} a critical design for a Raman lidar system optimized to match Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program needs for profiling atmospheric water vapor at Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) sites. This work has emphasized the development of enhanced daytime capabilities using Raman lidar techniques, but the evolution of the ARM Program has led us to investigate other characteristics as well, in order to provide a range of options for implementing a Raman lidar system at CART sites. Raman lidar systems detect selected species by monitoring the wavelength-shifted molecular return produced by Raman scattering from the chosen molecule or molecules. Forwater-vapor measurements, the nitrogen Raman signal is observed simultaneously with the water-vapor Raman signal; proper ratioing of the signals yields the water-vapor mixing ratio. Raman lidar is used currently to perform meteorologically important, sustained, reliable <b>nighttime</b> <b>profiling</b> of water vapor. Daytime measurements present added challenges because of the difficulties inherent in detecting Raman signals against solar backgrounds. One approach to overcome this problem is to operate in the solar blind region of the spectrum (wavelengths shorter than- 285 nm). This approach effectively reduces the solar background, but attenuation of the laser beam and the backscattered Raman radiation (primarily due to absorption by tropospheric ozone) greatly reduces the signal also. Alternatively, the background skylight reaching the detector can be reduced by using a narrow field-of-view receiver and narrowband spectral detection. We have pursued both of these approaches in our studies. This abstract touches briefly on the main components of our research program, summarizing the results of these efforts, and provides references for more detailed information. Two advanced lidar systems have been used to quantify the "real-world " capabilities of Raman lidar systems for profiling atmospheric water vapor in a variety of field campaigns.

We focus on northern spring and summer, using observations from 4 Martian years at local times of 4 - 5 and 15 - 17 h. We supplement the observations with results obtained from large-eddy simulations and through data assimilation by the UK spectral version of the LMD Mars Global Circulation Model. We previously investigated {{the depth of the}} daytime convective boundary layer (CBL) and its variations with surface elevation and surface properties. We are now examining unusual aspects of the temperature structure observed at night. Most important, predawn profiles in the Tharsis region contain an unexpected layer of neutral static stability at pressures of 200 - 300 Pa with a depth of 4 - 5 km. The mixed layer is bounded above by a midlevel temperature inversion and below by another strong inversion adjacent to the surface. The narrow temperature minimum {{at the base of the}} midlevel inversion suggests the presence of a water ice cloud layer, with the further implication that radiative cooling at cloud level can induce convective activity at lower altitudes. Conversely, <b>nighttime</b> <b>profiles</b> in Amazonis show no sign of a midlevel inversion or a detached mixed layer. These regional variations in the nighttime temperature structure appear to arise in part from large-scale variations in topography, which have several notable effects. First, the CBL is much deeper in the Tharsis region than in Amazonis, owing to a roughly 6 -km difference in surface elevation. Second, large-eddy simulations show that daytime convection is not only deeper above Tharsis but also considerably more intense than it is in Amazonis. Finally, the daytime surface temperatures are comparable in the two regions, so that Tharsis acts as an elevated heat source throughout the CBL. These topographic effects are expected to enhance the vertical mixing of water vapor above elevated terrain, which might lead to the formation and regional confinement of nighttime clouds...|$|R

40|$|The near-surface {{wind and}} {{temperature}} regime at three {{points in the}} Atacama Desert of northern Chile is described using two-year multi-level measurements from 80 -m towers located in an altitude range between 2100 and 2700 m ASL. The data reveal the frequent development of strong nocturnal drainage flows at all sites. Down-valley nose-shaped wind speed profiles are observed with maximum values occurring at heights between 20 m and 60 m AGL. The flow intensity shows considerable inter-daily variability and a seasonal modulation of maximum speeds, which in the cold season can attain hourly average values larger than 20 m s− 1. Turbulent mixing appears significant over the full tower layer, affecting the curvature of the <b>nighttime</b> temperature <b>profile</b> and possibly explaining the observed increase of surface temperatures in the down-valley direction. Nocturnal valley winds and temperatures are weakly controlled by upper-air conditions observed at the nearest aerological station. Estimates of terms in the momentum budget for the development and the quasi-stationary phases of the down-valley flows suggest that the pressure gradient force due to the near-surface cooling along the sloping valley axes {{plays an important role}} in these drainage flows. A scale for the jet nose height of equilibrium turbulent down-slope jets is proposed, based on surface friction velocity and surface inversion intensity. At one of the sites this scale explains about 70 % of the case-to-case observed variance of jet nose heights. Further modeling and observational work is needed, however, in order to better define the dynamics, extent and turbulence structure of this flow system, which has significant wind-energy, climatic and environmental implications...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{the stellar}} {{occultation}} instrument GOMOS is compared with ozonesondes from the SHADOZ network. We only used <b>nighttime</b> O 3 <b>profiles</b> and a requirement selection at 8 Southern Hemisphere stations. 7 years of GOMOS datasets (GOPR 6. 0 cf and IPF 5. 0) and 11 years of balloon-sondes {{are used in}} this study. A monthly distribution of GOMOS O 3 mixing ratios is performed in the upper-troposphere and in the stratosphere (15 - 50 km). A comparison with SHADOZ {{is done in the}} altitude range from 15 km to 30 km. In the 21 - 30 km altitude range, a satisfactory agreement is observed between GOMOS and SHADOZ although some differences are observed depending on the station. The range for monthly differences is generally decreasing with increasing height and is within ± 15 %. It is found that the agreement between GOMOS and SHADOZ degrades below ~ 20 km. The median differences are nearly within ± 5 % particularly above 23 km. But a large positive bias is found below 21 km compared to SHADOZ...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{compounds}} {{are a large}} {{component of}} aerosol mass, but organic aerosol (OA) sources remain poorly characterized. Recent model studies have suggested nighttime oxidation of biogenic hydrocarbons as a potentially large OA source, but analysis of field measurements to test these predictions is sparse. We present <b>nighttime</b> vertical <b>profiles</b> of nitrogen oxides, ozone, VOCs and aerosol composition measured during low approaches of the NOAA P- 3 aircraft to airfields in Houston, TX. This region has large emissions of both biogenic hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. The latter category serves {{as a source of}} the nitrate radical, NO 3, a key nighttime oxidant. Biogenic VOCs (BVOC) and urban pollutants were concentrated within the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL), which varied in depth from 100 – 400 m. Despite concentrated NO x at low altitude, ozone was never titrated to zero, resulting in rapid NO 3 radical production rates of 0. 2 – 2. 7 ppbv h − 1 within the NBL. Monoterpenes and isoprene were frequently present within the NBL and underwent rapid oxidation (up to 1 ppbv h − 1), mainly by NO 3 {{and to a lesser extent}} O 3. Concurrent enhancement in organic and nitrate aerosol on several profiles was consistent with primary emissions and with secondary production from nighttime BVOC oxidation, with the latter equivalent to or slightly larger than the former. Some profiles may have been influenced by biomass burning sources as well, making quantitative attribution of organic aerosol sources difficult. Ratios of organic aerosol to CO within the NBL ranged from 14 to 38 μg m − 3 OA/ppmv CO. A box model simulation incorporating monoterpene emissions, oxidant formation rates and monoterpene SOA yields suggested overnight OA production of 0. 5 to 9 μg m − 3...|$|R

40|$|The {{measurements}} reported {{were made}} of the O(1 S) emission line profile at 5577 A at high spectral resolution with the Fabry-Perot interferometer on the Dynamics Explorer spacecraft. It is found that the line profile has marked nonthermal characteristics in the nightglow. A simple collisional relaxation model is {{used to analyze the}} <b>nighttime</b> emission line <b>profiles,</b> measured in the equatorial region. The branching ratio is inferred for the dissociative recombination of O 2 (+) leading to O(1 S). The result reveals that the O(1 S) + O(1 D) channel is favored over the O(1 S). The result reveals that the O(1 S) + O(1 D) channel is favored over the O(1 S) + O(3 P) channel by a factor of 4; this does not agree with the ratio reported by Hernandez (1971). It is noted, however, that the result is consistent with the active channel for O(1 S) production being via the 1 Sigma u + repulsive state of O 2, as suggested by the theoretical calculations of Guberman (1983). In addition, a value is obtained for the excitation exchange cross section for O(1 S) ...|$|R
40|$|To ensure {{spectral}} consistency {{when comparing}} Nimbus 7 Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere Experiment (LIMS) NO 2 distributions {{with those from}} Atmosphere Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite Experiments (UARS), 1 day (May 5, 1979) of LIMS measurements were reprocessed using the NO 2 line list on the HITRAN 92 tape compiled by the Airforce Geophysics Laboratory (AFGL). The revised NO 2 mixing ratios are smaller by up to 20 %. The decrease is not constant with height, latitude, or time of day but depends on the absolute amount of NO 2 in the profile, {{as a result of}} a change in the degree of saturation for the strong NO 2 spectral lines. The revised NO 2 agrees better with correlative measurements and with NO 2 distributions from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) and Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) satellite experiments but not with those from ATMOS 85. Profiles of the day/night ratio of revised NO 2 are now larger near 5 hPa. There is also some improvement between observed and modeled ozone in the upper stratosphere, when the revised <b>nighttime</b> NO 2 <b>profile</b> is used as the estimate of NO(y) for the model calculations...|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{profiles}} of stratospheric NO 2 and NO 3 have been retrieved from moderately resolution atmospheric lunar transmission spectra measured by SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography) {{on board the}} ENVISAT (Environmental Satellite). The measurements were taken over the high Southern latitude (50 o S– 90 o S). The global spectra fitting method by differential optical depth approach were used to fit NO 2 and NO 3 using the spectral window of 430 – 460 nm and 615 – 680 nm respectively. To assess {{the accuracy of the}} retrieved NO 2 <b>profiles</b> the SCIAMACHY <b>nighttime</b> NO 2 <b>profiles</b> were compared with daytime NO 2 profiles measured by Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), using photochemical correction model. The validation results show that the quality of SCIAMACHY nighttime NO 2 is high within 5 – 20 % in the altitude range of 24 – 39 km. Our current understanding of NO 3 chemistry and {{the internal consistency of the}} retrieved NO 3 profiles were verified with a complex and a relatively simple model scheme. The complex model uses a comprehensive photochemistry of the stratosphere and the simple model uses only SCIAMACHY ozone and ECMWF temperature and pressure analyses as input. We found that the retrieved NO 3 profiles are in very good agreement with the model calculations within the expected accuracy of 20 – 35 %. 1...|$|R

Background: Melatonin is associated with a variety of diseases in advanced age, including insomnia, depression, and dementia, and its secretion is influenced by light exposure. Although studies in young and middle-aged subjects have shown that females tend to have higher melatonin levels than males, gender differences in melatonin levels among older people remain unclear. Methods: To determine the gender differences in melatonin levels among older people in home settings, we conducted a cross-sectional study in 528 older people. We measured overnight urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion (UME; an index of melatonin secretion), and ambulatory light intensity. Results: The mean age of females was 1. 8 years younger, and average intensity of daytime light exposure was half that in males (P < 0. 01). In a univariate comparison, UME was significantly lower in females than in males (P < 0. 01). A multivariate model using analysis of covariance showed that log-transformed UME remained significantly lower in females after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including age and daytime and <b>nighttime</b> light exposure <b>profiles</b> (males vs. females: 1. 90 vs. 1. 73 log µg; adjusted mean difference 0. 17 log µg [95...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} atmospheric thermal emission spectra {{obtained with}} the balloon-borne FIRS- 2 far infrared Fourier transform spectrometer during balloon flights from Palestine, Texas on May 12 - 13, 1988 and from Fort Sumner, New Mexico on September 26 - 27, 1989 and on July 4 - 5, 1990. Seven and two pure rotational transition lines in 100 - 205 cm(exp - 1) range are analyzed for deriving vertical profiles of stratospheric HCl and HF, respectively. We obtain both the daytime and <b>nighttime</b> average vertical <b>profiles</b> from 15 to 50 km. We compare these profiles with the ones obtained in June, 1983 {{with the first}} version of FIRS spectrometer during the Balloon Intercomparison Campaign (BIC- 2). BIC- 2 results were revised to be consistent with the present analysis which uses the latest spectral parameters. According to our comparison results no increase is recognized for HCl but about 3 percent per year increase for HF from 1983 to 1990, assuming a linear trend. These annual increase rates are smaller than those reported by other groups. Recently Rinsland et al. (1991) and Wallace and Livingston (1991) reported long term behavior of total HCl and HF observed on Kit Peak between 1977 and 1990. As Kit Peak is located near both balloon launching sites, Palestine and Fort Sumner, we think our results are favorably comparable with theirs. Comparison results with ours and ground-based measurements will be presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Low {{frequency}} (LF: 30 - 300 KHz) {{radio waves}} {{can be employed}} for communications purposes and {{as a means of}} probing the earth's lower ionosphere. In this thesis theoretical and experimental techniques are employed to investigate the propagation characteristics of LF waves in the spherical earth - ionosphere duct, with particular emphasis on high latitude conditions. The "wave-hop" theory of LF propagation, in conjunction with previously measured electron density and collision frequency profiles of the ionospheric D region, is used in a study of the behaviour of LF radio links under realistic operating conditions. The choice of frequency and receiver height is shown to have a critical effect on the received signal strengths during day - and night-time conditions. The influence of the geomagnetic field, ground conductivity, and ionospheric parameters on the occurence of regions of low signal strength are also assessed. The results of a series of airborne experiments are presented. Interference effects arising at a discontinuity in ground conductivity are demonstrated. Propagation data obtained at VLF and LF are interpreted in terms of D region models; the LF data are found to be considerably more sensitive to D region parameters than those obtained at VLF. Profiles providing a best fit for daytime conditions are derived; their accuracy and resolution and their photochemical implications are discussed. LF data are also employed to select a best fit <b>nighttime</b> electron density <b>profile</b> from a set of published profiles. An overall assessment of the theoretical and experimental aspects of this study concludes that an acceptable degree of consistency has been obtained...|$|R
