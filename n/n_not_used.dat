40|$|Inventory {{control is}} a process that is vital to the company 2 ̆ 7 s operations, with the aim to prevent the company from stock-outs and to keep costs as optimally as {{possible}} to the activities related to the provision. PT. Semen Indonesia as a national cement company in Indonesia has a problem in controlling inventory, including inventory value that exceeds the target, the value of deadstock which reached Rp. 80, 000, 000, and the number of items that reached 52, 700 items. MUSIC 3 D method is an approach that can overcome the problems of inventory control in PT. Semen Indonesia. This method is a theory to group items based on several aspects. In this study, only three elements in MUSIC 3 D are applied, which are ABC analysis (value based), SDE (lead time), and FSN (consumption rate) with the sample as many as 990 types of goods. The results show that the type of CDN products is goods that dominate in the warehouse of PT.

40|$|Human {{alteration}} {{of the global}} nitrogen (N) cycle has had major impacts on naturally N-limited ecosystems worldwide. Peatlands, dominated by peat mosses, Sphagnum species, represent one such sensitive ecosystem. I have studied how this ecosystem is affected by increased N availability, using a small-scale N fertilization experiment in combination with a gradient study of three peatlands with varying N deposition. I found both in the experiment and in the gradient a similar pattern of Sphagnum decline accompanied by an increase of vascular plants associated with enhanced N supply. For one common Sphagnum species - both in the experiment and in the gradient study - I also found an identical, linear increase in soluble amino acid N (NAA) accumulation. As soluble amino acids function as N storage compounds among Sphagna, NAA is a suitable measure for Sphagnum N status, and indicates accumulation of excess <b>N</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> for growth. My results show that NAA {{can be used as}} a sensitive indicator to signal N pollution before the slow, and gradual, regime shift from Sphagnum to vascular plant dominance is visible. In an N-uptake experiment using Sphagnum specimens from the three peatlands varying in N deposition, I found a reduced N-uptake by both investigated Sphagnum species from a high N deposition site, in south-western Sweden. This potential of Sphagna to adjust to high N loads through N uptake regulation will, however, not prevent tissue N accumulation, and as a result a shift from Sphagnum to vascular plant dominance. In general I found similar patterns of N induced changes both in Sphagnum tissue chemistry and vegetation structure in the experiment and along the gradient study. Thus, I conclude that long-term, small-scale field experiments seem to offer reliable estimates of both the direction and strength of key vegetation responses in Sphagnum dominated peatlands. This is likely related to the key role of Sphagna as ecosystem engineers. In the experiment I found a marked time lag in vegetation response to N application treatments. The closed Sphagnum carpet did not collapse until after eight years of continuous treatments. Another result was that dwarf shrubs, e. g. cranberry Vaccinium oxycoccos, first increased, but later declined due to severe attacks by fungal diseases. One important conclusion is that long-term, manipulative field experiments are necessary for our ability to understand how ecosystems will respond to environmental change...|$|E

Notorynchus cepedianus showed a consistent temporal trend in seasonal occurrence in Norfolk Bay characterized by high abundances in summer to near absence in winter. This pattern was less pronounced in the Derwent Estuary, where fish were still caught during winter. The absence of smaller total length (LT) classes (< 80 cm) from the catches suggests that <b>N.</b> cepedianus are <b>not</b> <b>using</b> these coastal habitats as nursery areas.

40|$|We {{consider}} the exploration {{problem with a}} single agent in an undirected graph. The problem requires the agent starting from an arbitrary node to explore all the nodes and edges in the graph {{and return to the}} starting node. Our goal is to minimize both the number of agent moves and the memory size of the agent, which dominate the amount of communication during the exploration. We focus on the local memory called the whiteboard of each node. There are several exploration algorithms which are very fast (i. e. the exploration is completed within a small number of agent moves such as 2 m and m+ 3 <b>n)</b> and do <b>not</b> <b>use</b> whiteboards. These algorithms, however, require large agent memory because the agent must keep the entire information in its memory to explore a graph.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study was undertaken {{to characterize the}} deformation behavior of a superplastic 3 mol% yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia (3 YTZ) {{over a wide range}} of strain rates, temperatures and grain sizes. The experimental data were analyzed in terms of the following equation for high temperature deformation: Image Full-size image ∞ σn d−pexp(−Q/RT), where Image Full-size image is the strain rate, σ is the flow stress, d is the grain size, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and n and p are constants termed the stress exponent and the inverse grain size exponent, respectively. The experimental data over a wide range of stresses revealed a transition in stress exponent. Deformation in the low and high stress regions was associated with <b>n</b> <b>not,</b> vert, similar 3 and p not, vert, similar 1, and <b>n</b> <b>not,</b> vert, similar 2 and p not, vert, similar 3, respectively. The transition stress between the two regions decreased with increasing grain size. The activation energy was similar for both regions with a value of not, vert, similar 550 kJ mol− 1. Microstructural measurements revealed that grains remained essentially equiaxed after the accumulation of large strains, and very limited concurrent grain growths occurred in most experiments. Assessment of possible rate controlling creep mechanisms and comparison with previous studied indicate that in the <b>n</b> <b>not,</b> vert, similar 2 region, deformation occurs by a grain boundary sliding process whose rate is independent of impurity content. Deformation in the <b>n</b> <b>not,</b> vert, similar 3 region is controlled by an interface reaction that is highly sensitive to impurity content. It is concluded that an increase in impurity content increases yttrium segregation to grain boundaries, which enhances the rate of the interface reaction, thereby decreasing the apparent transition stress between the <b>n</b> <b>not,</b> vert, similar 2 and <b>n</b> <b>not,</b> vert, similar 3 regions. This unified approach incorporating two sequential mechanisms can rationalize many of the apparently dissimilar results that have been reported previously for deformation of 3 YTZ...|$|R
