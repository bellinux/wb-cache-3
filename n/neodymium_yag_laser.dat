Then, these dopant atoms actually carry out the lasing process in the crystal.

In addition, the rare-earth element erbium can readily be used as the dopant rather than neodymium, giving a different wavelength of its output.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Ninety seven {{patients}} with tracheobronchial tumours {{have been treated}} with the <b>neodymium</b> yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd <b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> {{over a period of}} 33 months. Fifty one of these patients were treated under local anaesthesia and 46 under general anaesthesia. The results obtained with the two methods have been compared retrospectively. The numbers of patients responding to treatment, the magnitude of the response, and the duration of palliation were similar in the two groups; significantly more treatment sessions, however, were required during each course of treatment under local anaesthesia. This advantage of general anaesthesia was thought to arise from the ability to continue treatment for longer and with greater efficiency. The use of the rigid bronchoscope with jet ventilation under general anaesthesia was also thought to provide better control of the airway and to allow more efficient clearance of blood and mucus.

40|$|Currently {{more than}} 90 % of all {{common bile duct}} concrements can he removed via the {{endoscopic}} retrograde route by means of endoscopic papillotomy, stone extraction by baskets and balloon catheters, or mechanical lithotripsy. Oversized, very hard or impacted stones however often st ill resist conventional endoscopic therapy. Laser lithotripsy represents a promising new endoscopic approach to the nonsurgical treatment of those common bile duct stones. Currently only short-pulsed laser systems with high power peaks but low potential for thermal tissue damage are used for stone fragmentation. Systems in clinical applications are the pulsed free-running-mode <b>neodymium</b> <b>YAG</b> (Nd:YAG) <b>laser</b> (1064 nm, 2 ms) and the dye laser (504 nm, 1 to 1. 5 μs).

The aim {{of the study was to}} determine whether fibrinolysis of subretinal haemorrhage without concomitant removal would offer a simpler approach with similar photoreceptor sparing. METHODS: A <b>neodymium</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> was used to create experimental subretinal haemorrhages beneath the holangiotic retina of the cat.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endoscopic {{management}} of upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma has assumed {{an important role}} in diagnosis and treatment. The introduction of small diameter rigid and flexible ureteroscopes has permitted access to the upper tract. Biopsy techniques have been developed for accurate diagnosis, and the addition of lasers has given the urologists an excellent tool for treatment. METHODS: Medical literature available relative to the endoscopic laser treatment of upper tract neoplasms has been reviewed. RESULTS: Ureteroscopic treatment has been characterized by good success with high recurrence rates, both in the upper tract and in the bladder. Bladder recurrence rates are similar to those seen after surgical treatment of upper tract tumors. Surveillance has been ureteroscopic since the other diagnostic options are inadequate. The holmium and neodymium:YAG lasers are the devices most commonly used now for the endoscopic treatment of upper tract tumors.

40|$|AIMS: To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} of laser suture lysis in the promotion of filtration and bleb formation during the early postoperative period after trabeculectomy. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 20 eyes from 20 patients undergoing trabeculectomy. Patients were entered into the study if, after a trial period of ocular massage, the intraocular pressure (IOP) was greater than 21 mm Hg 48 hours after surgery. Other criteria for inclusion were a deep quiet anterior chamber, no bleb formation, and a patent internal ostium on gonioscopy. Suture lysis was performed using a frequency doubled <b>neodymium</b> <b>YAG</b> (532 nm) <b>laser</b> and a Hoskins lens. The IOP was measured within 5 minutes of lysis and gentle ocular massage was employed {{if there was no}} spontaneous bleb formation. A further suture was lysed if at this stage there was still no bleb associated with a high IOP. RESULTS: Suture lysis was successful in all cases in the early postoperative period. The mean IOP before lysis was 33. 8 (SD 8. 9) mm Hg and the IOP immediately after lysis was 13. 2 (7. 9) mm Hg. Eighteen (90 %) patients had successfully controlled IOP (mean 14. 1 (3. 6) mm Hg) without medication after a mean follow up of 6 months. CONCLUSION: Laser suture lysis is a safe and effective method of promoting filtration following trabeculectomy. It can avoid surgical manipulation of the scleral flap with its associated risks of bleb failure and thereby contributes to a successful operative outcome...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Endoscopic {{retrograde}} laser lithotripsy {{of common}} bile duct stones is a new technique which {{can be carried out}} through the endoscope without anaesthesia using ordinary endoscopic equipment. In the method described here a flashlamp pulsed <b>Neodymium</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> (wave length 1064 nm) was used.

In eight of the nine the concrements (maximum diameter 4 - 7 x 3 - 1 cm) could be fragmented and in six the fragments could be extracted from the common bile duct.

Since the introduction of endoscopic papillotomy ' 2 and the extension of the method by the addition of mechanical lithotripsy, 3 the endoscopic removal of bile duct stones has become a generally accepted therapeutic technique especially in aged patients or in those carrying an increased surgical risk. About 90 % of all bile duct stones can be removed, on the rectrograde way through the endoscope.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve {{selection}} of patients and the efficacy of endoscopic laser treatment, a bronchographic technique has been developed for patients with tumours causing complete endobronchial obstruction. This technique has shown patent distal airways in 16 out of 17 patients with a collapsed lung or lobe. These airways were abnormally dilated in each case, suggesting bronchiectasis. In one patient the appearances of bronchiectasis were sufficiently severe to decide against attempting treatment. Treatment was not attempted in another patient as a large cavity was seen within the collapsed lung and this was thought to carry a risk of postoperative infection and haemorrhage. Treatment with a <b>neodymium</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> under general anaesthesia successfully recanalised the airway in 12 of the 15 remaining patients and {{was associated with a}} substantial reduction in breathlessness. The procedure was abandoned prematurely in one patient because of life threatening haemorrhage. In the remaining two patients in whom treatment was unsuccessful bronchography had suggested very extensive endobronchial obstruction. Spirometry and radionuclide lung scans were performed before and after treatment in eight patients treated successfully and showed significant improvements. Four patients were investigated within two weeks of lung re-expansion by repeat bronchography (three patients) or computed tomography (one patient); in each case the calibre of the airways had returned almost to normal. Thus the radiological demonstration of bronchial dilation in a collapsed lung does not necessarily imply a diagnosis of irreversible bronchiectasis and should not be regarded as a contraindication to treatment. It is concluded that preoperative bronchography provides reliable data on the extent of tumour, the patency of the distal airways, and presence of extensive cavitation. This information should facilitate successful laser treatment...|$|E
