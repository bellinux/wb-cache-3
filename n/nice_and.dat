In Munich they were reunited with Victoria's mother and the family group moved to Zurich in September 1919.

In the following years the exiled family divided their time between these two places.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June, General Jean Lannes beat Feldmarschallleutnant Peter Ott in the Battle of Montebello. This caused Bonaparte {{to become}} overconfident. He became {{convinced}} that Melas would not attack, and further, that the Austrian was about to retreat. As other French forces closed from the west and south, the Austrian commander had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> Genoa to Alessandria on the main Turin-Mantua road.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} with a quiet, {{sensitive}} 15-year-old boy named Charlie writing letters about his life to an unknown recipient. Charlie chooses that person because {{he said that he}} heard the person was <b>nice</b> <b>and</b> thought that this person would not be judgmental. He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.|$|E
5|$|A month-long European trek began June 10 in Madrid, {{covering}} major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde. Matt Walker {{stood in}} for Vig {{for the rest}} of the summer. Garbage performed two shows in <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> Lyon supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a further two headlining French shows in Lille and Paris with Mercury Rev as support. The European leg ended at Espárrago Rock in Spain on July 12. Throughout the run, Manson was dogged by vocal problems, leading to the cancellation of a few festival appearances. After a six-week break, Garbage returned to the United Kingdom to perform their last European shows of the year – two intimate club gigs in London.|$|E

They also began their night DMZ, held {{every two months}} in Brixton, a part of London already strongly associated with reggae. DMZ has showcased new dubstep artists such as Skream, Kode9, Benga, Pinch, DJYoungsta, Hijak, Joe <b>Nice,</b> <b>and</b> Vex'd. DMZ's first anniversary event (at the Mass venue, a converted church) saw fans attending from places {{as far away as}} Sweden, the United States, and Australia, leading to a queue of 600 people at the event. This forced the club to move from its regular 400-capacity space to Mass' main room, an event cited as a pivotal moment in dubstep's history.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE's {{domestic}} market was deregulated on 1 April 1994. Since then, any airline within the European Economic Area {{is free to}} operate any domestic or international route. Braathens rejected a proposal from the main competitor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) for a merger; instead the helicopter division was sold and the company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. New routes were opened from Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated. International routes to Rome, <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> Jersey were introduced. In 1996, Braathens SAFE bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede, and started flying on the Oslo–Stockholm route. The following year, Transwede, with its five domestic routes, was merged into Braathens SAFE. The same year, KLM bought 30% of Braathens SAFE and the airlines started a partnership.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Enrico Tortonese {{examined}} the <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> Cayenne specimens of S. tudes (the Coromandel specimen having {{been lost in}} the interim) and concluded that they were not great hammerheads, but rather the same species as S. bigelowi. Carter Gilbert concurred in his 1967 revision of the hammerhead sharks, noting that while the lost Coromandel specimen was probably a great hammerhead, none of the existing material belonged to that species. Thus, Sphyrna tudes became the accepted name for the smalleye hammerhead, taking precedence over S. bigelowi because it was published earlier, and the great hammerhead received the next available name Sphyrna mokarran. Gilbert designated the Nice specimen as the lectotype that would define S. tudes, having priority over the Cayenne specimen (the paralectotype). This was meant to stabilize the name, but had the opposite effect.|$|E

Recuperating in <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> cared for by his companion, Emmy Eckstein, he missed Goldman's sixty-seventh birthday in Saint-Tropez in June. She wrote in sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call {{in the middle of}} the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose paralysis. He died later that evening.|$|E
5|$|In June and July 2002, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma {{sponsored}} the first National Intercollegiate Marching Band, which {{traveled to the}} French Riviera, including the cities of Nice, Grasse, Aix-en-Provence, Cannes, Antibes, and the Principality of Monaco. The thirty-five member band performed at Le Suquet in Cannes, in <b>Nice,</b> <b>and</b> {{in front of the}} Prince's Palace of Monaco. After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which was believed to be caused by a fear of traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

6000|$|The {{only man}} who {{disturbed}} her was Geoffrey Saxton, known throughout the interwoven sets of Brooklyn Heights as [...] "Jeff." [...] Jeff Saxton was thirty-nine to Claire's twenty-three. He {{was clean and}} busy; he had no signs of vice or humor. Especially for Jeff must have been invented the symbolic morning coat, the unwrinkable gray trousers, and the moral rimless spectacles. He {{was a graduate of}} a <b>nice</b> college, <b>and</b> he had a <b>nice</b> tenor <b>and</b> a <b>nice</b> family <b>and</b> <b>nice</b> hands <b>and</b> he was nicely successful in New York copper dealing. When he was asked questions by people who were impertinent, clever, or poor, Jeff looked them over coldly before he answered, and often they felt so uncomfortable that he didn't have to answer.|$|R
5|$|Napoleon's divisional commanders were {{immediately}} {{impressed by his}} capacity for hard work, {{from the beginning of}} Italy campaign. Subordinates could never say they would attend to something and then let it slide, and the staff who had been stationary in Nice for four years suddenly felt pulsating effect of Napoleon's energy. In the nine month between arrival in <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> the end of 1776 he sent more than eight hundred letters and despatches, covering everything from where drummer-boys should stand in parades to the conditions under which the 'Marseillaise' should be played. Augereu was first of his generals to be won over, followed Massena. 'That little bastard of a general actually frightened me!' Augereau would later tell Massena.|$|E
5|$|The Kenyan government's {{attempt to}} defer the cases at the ICC by {{appealing}} {{to members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, represented by British lawyers Geoffrey <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. The Kenyan government's application to Pre-Trial Chamber II that the two cases were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's stance, and a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|From 1987, Braathens SAFE {{was allowed}} to make {{international}} scheduled flights on certain routes. From 1989 to 1993, it opened routes to Billund, Malmö, Newcastle, London and Murmansk. In the same period, the airline replaced its fleet with Boeing 737-400 and -500s. The Norwegian airline market was deregulated in 1994, and Braathens SAFE was free to fly on any domestic and international route; it immediately opened routes to Harstad/Narvik. Within two years, international routes had been started to Jersey, <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> Rome. In 1996, Braathens bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede Airways, and started a route to Stockholm. The following year, Transwede was merged into Braathens SAFE, and the airline took over its domestic routes to Halmstad, Jönköping, Luleå, Sundsvall and Umeå, using Transwede's Fokker 100s. In 1997, KLM bought part of Braathens SAFE, and the two started a partnership; Braathens SAFE started flying from several Norwegian cities to KLM's hub in Amsterdam.|$|E

5|$|Monaco {{has been}} {{ruled by the}} House of Grimaldi since 1297. From 1793 until 1814, Monaco was under French control; the Congress of Vienna {{designated}} Monaco as being a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1815 until 1860, when the Treaty of Turin ceded the surrounding counties of <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> Savoy to France. Menton and Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, part of Monaco until the mid-19th century before seceding in hopes of being annexed by Sardinia, were ceded to France in exchange for 4,000,000 French francs with the Franco-Monegasque Treaty in 1861, which also formally guaranteed Monaco its independence. Until 2002, Monaco would {{have become part of}} France had the house of Grimaldi ever died out; in a treaty signed that year, the two nations agreed that Monaco would remain independent even in such a case. The current monarch is Albert II.|$|E

In mid-November, he assisted on game-winning goals in back-to-back weeks against <b>Nice</b> <b>and</b> Lens.|$|E
5|$|Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Mizuho Miyanokouji, a male high school student. After Mizuho's grandfather dies, his will is reviewed, which explains his desire to have his grandson transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho cross-dresses to attend the school. The headmistress, the deputy head teacher (visual novel only), Mizuho's homeroom teacher Hisako Kajiura and Mariya Mikado initially know his secret; Shion Jujo and Ichiko Takashima also eventually find this out. Mizuho is very popular among the other students, who often talk about how pretty, <b>nice,</b> <b>and</b> athletic Mizuho is. This rampant popularity escalates to him even being nominated against his will to join in on the Elder election. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, runs against Mizuho.|$|E
