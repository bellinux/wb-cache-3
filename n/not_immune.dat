5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes {{to great lengths to}} prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture, Drukair is <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large. In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war on 3 September 1939 and the rapid conquest of Poland, Shaw was accused of defeatism when, in a New Statesman article, he declared the war over and demanded a peace conference. Nevertheless, when he became convinced that a negotiated peace was impossible, he publicly urged the neutral United States to join the fight. The London blitz of 1940–41 led the Shaws, both in their mid-eighties, to live full-time at Ayot St Lawrence. Even there they were <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> from enemy air raids, and stayed on occasion with Nancy Astor at her country house, Cliveden. In 1943, {{the worst of the}} London bombing over, the Shaws moved back to Whitehall Court, where medical help for Charlotte was more easily arranged.

Magazine and newspaper publishers in Hong Kong distribute and print in both Chinese and English, with a focus on sensationalism and celebrity gossip. The media in Hong Kong is relatively free from official interference compared to Mainland China, although the Far Eastern Economic Review pointed to signs of self-censorship by media whose owners have close ties to or business interests in the People's Republic of China and states that even Western media outlets are <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to growing Chinese economic power.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, {{this period}} in Greek history is {{remarkable}} {{for the social}} and political upheaval in many Greek cities, particularly the establishment of the first democracy in Athens. The island of Naxos, part of the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea, was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by the tyrant Lygdamis, a protege of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos, until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the Spartans. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos {{became one of the most}} prosperous and powerful of the Aegean islands. Despite its success, Naxos was <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to class tensions and internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.|$|E

5|$|The Limousin breed {{was also}} <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to {{the wave of}} Anglomania {{affecting}} France {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. Some wealthy farmers maintained Durham cattle, which were prized by the elite of the time. However, this practice was criticised by the agricultural society of Limoges. The society encouraged farmers to continue selecting animals that were most consistent with the characteristics of the Limousin breed, which was perfectly adapted to the region's environment, rather than trying to adapt other breeds. Furthermore, the vast majority of Limousin breeders could not afford to raise livestock in addition to their working animals, as was the case on larger properties that practiced crossing with Durham cattle.|$|E
5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} reviewable, despite it having been established under prerogative powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law (or the prerogative) rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially reviewable, and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions was unfair, this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable.|$|E
5|$|Though {{they were}} influential, Pericles, Aspasia {{and their friends}} were <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> from attack, as preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Her relationship with Pericles and her subsequent political influence aroused many reactions. Donald Kagan, a Yale historian, believes that Aspasia was particularly unpopular {{in the years immediately}} following the Samian War. In 440 BC, Samos was at war with Miletus over Priene, an ancient city of Ionia in the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians. When the Athenians ordered the two sides to stop fighting and submit the case to arbitration at Athens, the Samians refused. In response, Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to Samos. The campaign proved to be difficult and the Athenians had to endure heavy casualties before Samos was defeated. According to Plutarch, it was thought that Aspasia, who came from Miletus, was responsible for the Samian War, and that Pericles had decided against and attacked Samos to gratify her.|$|E

40|$|The {{correlation}} immunity {{is known}} as an important cryptographic measure of a Boolean function with respect to its resist against the correlation attack. This paper generalizes the concept of correlation immunity to be of a fractional value, called fractional correlation immunity, which is a fraction between 0 and 1, and correlation immune function is the extreme case when the fractional correlation immunity is 1. However when a function is <b>not</b> correlation <b>immune</b> in the traditional sense, it may also has a nonzero fractional correlation immunity, which also indicates {{the resistance of the}} function against correlation attack. This paper first shows how this generalized concept of fractional correlation immunity is a reasonable measure on the resistance against the correlation attack, then studies the fractional correlation immunity of a special class of Boolean functions, i. e. majority functions, of which the subset of symmetric ones have been proved to have highest algebraic immunity. This paper shows that all the majority functions, including the symmetric ones and the non-symmetric ones, are <b>not</b> correlation <b>immune.</b> However their fractional correlation immunity approaches to 1 when the number of variable grows. This means that this class of functions also have good resistance against correlation attack, although they are <b>not</b> correlation <b>immune</b> in the traditional sense...|$|R
5|$|Compared {{to other}} Latin {{authors of the}} twelfth century, William is {{surprisingly}} favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of Alexius I Comnenus that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical {{of some of the}} crusaders' dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius' son John II Comnenus; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the Historia coincides with the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of Andronicus I Comnenus, and in his description of those events, William was certainly <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.|$|E
