500|$|The episode {{marked the}} return of Special Agent Monica Reyes, who was first {{introduced}} in the earlier season eight episode [...] "This is Not Happening". Although Reyes would later become Doggett's partner, the series attempted to differentiate the Doggett/Reyes relationship from the Mulder/Scully relationship. Robert Patrick later noted, [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> duplicate , we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> regenerate the magic chemistry." [...] However, he later did say [...] "that Gillian and I had our own chemistry that was unique unto itself, and likewise {{with the addition of}} Annabeth. It was different." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's label, Island Records, {{underwent}} changes {{while the}} group prepared to record, which postponed the studio schedule for three weeks. Bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz asserted that [...] "We're definitely writing all the time, so we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> squeeze every last {{drop out of}} the stone. That's part of what's been wrong with the rock industry: they keep fans waiting far too long, and bands go away and disappear {{off the face of the}} planet. That's not the way it's going to be for Fall Out Boy." [...] During this time off, Fall Out Boy contributed a cover of the song [...] "What's This?" [...] for the 2006 rerelease of The Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack, as well as a remix of their song [...] "Of All the Gin Joints in All the World" [...] for the Snakes on a Plane soundtrack. Wentz also purchased a house in Los Angeles, where he spent much time writing lyrics to new songs.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{financial}} problems and bankruptcy in 1987, Gwynn remained unfazed on the field. In the Padres home opener, Marvell Wynne, Gwynn, and John Kruk hit back-to-back-to-back homers {{to start the}} game for San Diego, the first time an MLB team had led off a game with three consecutive home runs. In June, he had 44 hits in 93 at-bats for a [...]473 average, the best month in his career. He finished fifth among NL outfielders voting for the All-Star game, which Padres manager Larry Bowa called [...] "a joke". However, Gwynn was unperturbed: [...] "People put a premium on the home-run hitters. I know what I am. I’m a contact hitter and not a home-run hitter ... I’m <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be something I’m not." ...|$|E
60|$|I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> any more. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{sit down}} on my {{posterior}} and sluther full speed down this Pisgah, even if it cost me my trouser seat. So ho!--away we go.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. C. {{is feeling}} {{so well that}} she is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> the New York doctor till we have gone {{around the world and}} robbed it and made the {{finances}} a little easier.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't know it. <b>Not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> till next week. Grind away {{over your}} old Greek {{as much as}} you like, but don't bother me," [...] {{answered}} Jack, frowning at the mere thought of the detested lesson.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{recording}} session {{occurred in}} April 2005 {{in the garage}} of Stevens' Nashville, Tennessee home, which {{was used as a}} temporary studio. [...] "It was so hot in that garage the first session", guitarist Chris Rohman recalled in an interview. [...] "We go in there and we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're not going to lie. We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good. I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of brokenness and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on God’s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has to be OK to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do that--you, yourself?" [...] And as she spoke, {{her voice}} trembled a little.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> persuade you. The czar {{has treated}} me well, and I love him. By the way, I {{have not given}} you my name after all. It's Terence Kelly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} skated since I was fifteen years old," [...] the good woman said placidly; [...] "and {{at my age}} and weight I am {{certainly}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> now, Ned. Just imagine me upon skates!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And while we're here {{together}} in this room you two must sit over near the window," [...] he concluded. [...] "You've <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> kill the boy once to-night; but you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it again--I'm {{taking care of him}} now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You believe me?" [...] he cried, {{turning to}} Quest. [...] "You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> that horrible thing on me--Professor Lord Ashleigh? I am all broken up. I am not fit for it. Look at my hands, how they shake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep up this dog-trot {{all the way}} to the house, are you?" [...] {{questioned}} the shipowner's son, after about a mile had been covered, and when they were passing over a rather rough portion of the trail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{improve the}} PEOPLE. It is Avonlea itself. There {{are lots of}} things which might be done to make it prettier. For instance, if we could coax Mr. Levi Boulter to pull down that dreadful old house on his upper farm wouldn't that be an improvement?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care," [...] he said, savagely. [...] "If you can't {{see what}} a cad you're making of yourself, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> show you. You {{can do what you}} jolly well please. I'm not {{dependent}} on you. I'll make this a decent house off my own bat without your help. If you like looking on, you'd better look on. I'll give you something to look at soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was annoyed}} {{as well as}} touched by her warning, for it proclaimed {{that he was still}} far from looking the brave {{forester}} he felt himself to be. He replied: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> anything wild, but I do intend to master the trailer's craft." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> any detective work; to {{find out}} if she is a woman with a past, with a husband living? You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put a live adder among the eels? I daresay drysalters eat eels. It is the reading of sensational novels that ruins our youth.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{seen the}} {{failures}} I've made. I took my last one home yesterday, and painted it out." [...] He looked at Cornelia, {{but if he}} expected her to give him any sort of leading, he was disappointed. He had to conclude unaided, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, say, Rover, {{you make}} me tired!" [...] sneered the bully, glaring at Jack. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> take your girl away from you. There are plenty of better girls around Haven Point. You go about your {{business}} and leave me alone;" [...] and, thus speaking, Slugger Brown passed into the moving-picture theater, followed a moment later by Nappy Martell. The two others watched them out of sight, and then {{looked at each other}} knowingly.|$|E
60|$|P. S. Don't {{imagine that}} I have lost my temper, because I swear. I swear all day, but I do not lose my temper. And don't imagine that I am {{on my way}} to the poorhouse, for I am not; or that I am uneasy, for I am not; or that I am uncomfortable or unhappy--for I never am. I don't know what it is to be unhappy or uneasy; and I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> learn how, at this late day.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think that's a {{beautiful}} plan, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> buy a fiddle any more; I'm {{going to get}} Dan his net all myself, {{and if there is}} any money left, I'll do something to please poor Billy. He's fond of me, and though he isn't poor, he'd like some little thing from me, because I can make out what he wants better than the rest of you." [...] And Nat fell to wondering how much happiness could be got out of his precious three dollars.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{off with}} both," [...] he insisted. [...] "You can't eat luncheon like that. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and bully you. If you've booked your passage to Timbuctoo {{and you really}} want to go--why, you must. I only want the chance of letting you know that I am coming after you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try,</b> if it's no use. But I didn't know it had {{got to be}} {{the fashion}} to give {{shavings}} instead of flowers. But there's some sense in it. They can be used for kindlings when they get old, and you can't do anything with old flowers. Perhaps he'll get to sending 'em by the barrel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> for {{the prize}} at all. I shoot {{so much better}} than the rest, having had more practice, you know, that it is hardly fair. Ben and Billy are next best, and about even, for Ben's strong wrist makes up for Billy's true eye, and both want to win. If I am out of the way Ben stands a good chance, for the other fellows don't amount to much." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} then arose, {{what was to}} be done. Forester proposed that they should get into the wagon and let Isaiah drive them to No. 3, but Marco said that he was commander, and he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get to No. 3 any more. He had been travelling back and forth through those woods long enough, and he declared that he would not vote to go through them again, if he had to go round the world to get {{to the other side of}} them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, boys, I shall {{ask each}} one of you a single question, and I want an honest answer. I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> frighten, bribe, or {{surprise}} the truth out of you, {{for every one of}} you have got a conscience, and know what it is for. Now is the time to undo the wrong done to Tommy, and set yourselves right before us all. I can forgive the yielding to sudden temptation much easier than I can deceit. Don't add a lie to the theft, but confess frankly, and we will all try to help you make us forget and forgive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR MISS SAUNDERS: I {{hear you}} are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get your [...] picture into the Exhibition. I will not {{pretend not to}} {{understand}} [...] why, and you would not wish me to; so I feel free {{to say that you}} [...] are making a mistake. You ought to offer your picture; I think it [...] would be accepted, and you have no right to forego the chance it [...] would give you, for the only reason you can have. I know that Mr. [...] Wetmore would be glad to advise you about it; and I am sure you [...] will believe that I have not asked him to do so.|$|E
5000|$|Braun {{is known}} for outspoken and flippant remarks in defense of his clients, such as calling the heavy boot an officer wore while kicking King a [...] "ballet slipper." [...] "Any {{high-profile}} client is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>tried</b> in the press," [...] Braun says. [...] "You can only neutralize the prosecution in the press. <b>To</b> say you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it in the press is like saying you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show up {{the first day of}} trial, because the trial starts the first day the prosecution starts leaking evidence." ...|$|R
5000|$|A khâgneux who {{repeats the}} khâgne twice is called bicarré (or bikhârré), {{commonly}} abbreviated as bica. So {{in a classroom}} of khâgne, {{half of the students}} may be carrés, a third may be cubes, plus a handful of bicas who are trying their last chance at the final examination. Using derived verbs, one can say Je vais cuber. (meaning [...] "I plan to give khâgne a second try"); or Je vais quand même pas bicater! ("I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> a third year in khâgne!").|$|R
6000|$|Blanche {{threw herself}} {{back in her}} chair, and flung her {{handkerchief}} resignedly over her face. [...] "The flies," [...] she explained. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sleep. <b>Try</b> the next page. Oh, dear me, try the next page!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's here! I've {{sent word}} saying, 'I am lunching in the café with ladies.' I think he'll come round. But don't {{be afraid of}} him. He's a good deal rougher on the outside than he is at heart. Of course, he's a bluff old {{business}} man, {{and not at all}} pretty, and he'll transfix you with a kind of estimating glare as if you were a tree; but he's actually very easy to manage {{if you know how to}} handle him. Now, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> explain everything to him at the beginning. I'm going to introduce him to you in a casual kind of way and give him time to take to you both. He forms his likes and dislikes very quickly." ...|$|E
60|$|I decline the task; I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{estimate}} {{either the}} eighteen of England or the sixty of the States. It {{is enough to}} speak about three living poets, {{in addition to those}} masters treated of in my last letter. Two of the three you will have guessed at--Mr. Swinburne and Mr. William Morris. The third, I dare say, you do not know even by name. I think he {{is not one of the}} English eighteen--Mr. Robert Bridges. His muse has followed the epicurean maxim, and chosen the shadowy path, fallentis semita vitae, where the dew lies longest on the grass, and the red rowan berries droop in autumn above the yellow St. John's wort. But you will find her all the fresher for her country ways.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] thought I, [...] "he is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> shave." [...] But so it was. Taking {{the piece}} of fat with which he had greased his boots, Good washed it {{thoroughly}} in the stream. Then diving again into the bag he brought out a little pocket razor with a guard to it, such as are bought {{by people who are}} afraid of cutting themselves, or by those about to undertake a sea voyage. Then he rubbed his face and chin vigorously with the fat and began. Evidently it proved a painful process, for he groaned very much over it, and I was convulsed with inward laughter as I watched him struggling with that stubbly beard. It seemed so very odd that a man should take the trouble to shave himself with a piece of fat in such a place and in our circumstances. At last he succeeded in getting the hair off {{the right side of his}} face and chin, when suddenly I, who was watching, became conscious of a flash of light that passed just by his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{make you}} love me." [...] His {{clutching}} fingers hurt her arm, and somehow {{she was not}} angry, but stirred. [...] "But I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> now. Forget the Alaskan caveman. Remember, I haven't even used the word 'love.' I've just chatted about fjords, or whatever they are, but one of these days---- No. I won't do it. I {{want to stay here}} in Seattle a few days, and take you on jolly picnics, but---- Would you rather I didn't even do that? I'm----" [...] He dropped her arm, kneaded his forehead with the heel of his palm. [...] "I can't stand being regarded as a bothersome puppy. I can't stand it! I can't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean to do}} what I 've undertaken, and not to {{be tempted}} away from my purpose by anything. I should n't be fit to give lessons if I was up late, should I? And how far would my {{earnings}} go towards dress, carriages, and all the little expenses which would come if I set up for a young lady in society? I can't do both, and I 'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try,</b> but I can pick up bits of fun as I go along, and be contented with free concerts and lectures, seeing you pretty often, and every Sunday Will is to spend with me, so I shall have quite as much dissipation as is good for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Neither {{would it}} assuage his torment {{in the least}} to be {{compelled}} to gaze up at the dark old pictures,--the ugly ghosts of what may once have been beautiful. I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> any more <b>to</b> receive pleasure from a faded, tarnished, lustreless picture, especially if it be a landscape. There were two or three landscapes of Claude in this palace, which I doubt not would have been exquisite {{if they had been}} in the condition of those in the British National Gallery; but here they looked most forlorn, and even their sunshine was sunless. The merits of historical painting may be quite independent of the attributes that give pleasure, and a superficial ugliness may even heighten the effect; but not so of landscapes.|$|R
