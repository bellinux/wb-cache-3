40|$|Entrepreneurship is in full-swing {{across the}} globe and it is widely {{regarded}} as a sustainable solution to long-unresolved economic issues like unemployment and poverty. Immigration is also a growing reality and the immigrating individuals can contribute to the new societies either by settling for a job or launching a business as an entrepreneur and in turn creating more jobs. However, social constraints are a key hurdle in the way of immigrant entrepreneurs. This paper aims to not only understand the social constraints faced by immigrant entrepreneurs but also provide a set of guidelines on how to overcome these social constraints. A qualitative research study focused on immigrant entrepreneurs in Sweden was designed around this purpose and was conducted in two cities of Sweden. Entrepreneurs in the study were from diverse <b>nationalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and business sectors. Key social constraints identified through the study are cultural differences, differences in business practices, and language – all acting as a wall for foreign entrepreneurs. Networking – both business and social – is regarded as the main solution to overcome these barriers and the weight for this lies equally on state, entrepreneurship industry, and the immigrant entrepreneurs. Immigrant entrepreneurs can overcome the social constraints by also researching their business area in detail as well as marketing themselves and their businesses especially by establishing a strong and trustable social media profile. Government needs to recognize the diversity of immigrant entrepreneurship communities and create tailor-made social interaction programs for different nationalities, educational backgrounds, and business sectors. It can also project positive image of successful immigrant entrepreneurs not only to inspire other immigrant entrepreneurs but also to increase trust regarding immigrant entrepreneurs among native population. Another important step by government could be early orientation for immigrant entrepreneurs to Swedish business market. Entrepreneurship advisory industry needs to understand immigrant entrepreneurs better and organize more multi-cultural events to lower the barriers between native and immigrant communities...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} two rapidly increasing aspects of the world’s higher education landscape: international student mobility and League Tables and Ranking Systems (LTRS) which evaluate higher education institutions (HEIs). This study utilized results from two recent large-scale student surveys which included over 5000 domestic and international graduate students at 82 HEIs in 19 European Union/European Free Trade Area (EU/EFTA) countries. Two primary areas of differences among respondents were analyzed: 1. Comparisons of the differing levels of importance domestic and international graduate students placed on rankings and other factors in their choice of a HEI. 2. Differences {{in the importance of}} rankings among different international graduate student demographic groups (age, country of study, discipline, gender, level <b>of</b> degree program, <b>nationality,</b> region <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> home country income level). In order to put the quantitative findings from this thesis into context, three background areas are presented. The first provides a conceptual background to international student mobility, by introducing relevant aspects of globalization and internationalization, rationales behind cross-border education, and the scope of student mobility worldwide and in the EU/EFTA region. The second area {{examines the}} rise of national and global LTRS. Lastly, prominent theoretical models created to understand domestic and international student decision-making, as well as the results from a comprehensive review of previous student choice studies are discussed. Among the major findings is that in 31 of 36 comparisons, international and domestic graduate students varied significantly in the importance placed on the included choice factors. In regards to LTRS, master and doctoral students from outside the EU/EFTA rated rankings as significantly more important than domestic students in both surveys. International students from the EU/EFTA only rated rankings higher than domestic students in the 2009 survey. The 2007 survey included biology, chemistry, math, and physics graduate students. Degree level and country of study were significant factors associated with the importance placed on rankings among both international students from the EU/EFTA region, and those from outside the region. Students from outside the region also placed significantly greater importance on rankings than the EU/EFTA international students. Comparisons combining those two groups showed significant differences based on <b>nationality,</b> region <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> and home country income level. Age, gender and discipline did not play a significant role within either group. In the 2009 survey, including economics, political science, and psychology, few significant differences were found in the importance of rankings between or among international students from the EU/EFTA region and those from other countries. While country of study was a significant factor within both groups, discipline was a significant factor only for EU/EFTA students. There was also a small negative correlation with age and the importance placed on rankings by international EU/EFTA doctoral students. Home country income level was a significant factor among the combined group of international students. However, degree level, gender, <b>nationality,</b> and region <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> were not significant for either international group. Multivariate analyses conducted using binary logistic regression were generally consistent with the bivariate analyses presented above for the 2007 and 2009 samples. The major exceptions were that home country income level and country of study were no longer significant predictors of the importance placed on rankings for international students in 2009.

The theory on "third way" transnational identity argues that migrants' and first generations' identifications with their heritage can protect them from discrimination.

40|$|Based on {{the studies}} on the socio-political aspect of transnationality, this {{research}} analyzes two exogenously designed political organizations (promoted and coordinated from a supralocal or supra-national scope and space), inspired by the existence of foreign residents in several Spanish municipalities, in this case Romanian nationality.

The electoral argument of sharing the same <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> does not seem enough, even if the political program tries to be transversal, avoiding ideological positions and appealing to generic elements such as common culture and its defense, and the possibility of helping to regenerate politics and democracy in the country of origin.

One of the most novel findings is the correlation between unemployment and the naturalizations: in those regions where the differential of the rate of unemployment between native foreigners and more is elevated are more naturalizations and, to inverse, where a particular advantage in the improvement of unemployment if the Spanish nationality is acquired, to the being does not seem to perceive itself the very similar rate between foreigners and Spaniards, there are less naturalizations...|$|E
