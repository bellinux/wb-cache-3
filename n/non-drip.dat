50|$|The {{most common}} {{products}} used today to measure spirits are the thimble measure and the <b>non-drip</b> measure, {{often referred to}} as an optic. The terms Optic, Optic Pearl, OpticJade and OpticOpal are all trademarks of Gaskell & Chambers owned by the company IMI Cornelius (UK) Ltd, but the word “optic” has become synonymous with inverted or <b>non-drip</b> spirit measures. Other manufacturers, such as Beaumont TM, also supply this type of measuring device.|$|E

50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{has since been}} discovered to be common in all shear-thinning liquids (liquids which thin under shear stress). Common household liquids with this property are liquid hand soaps, shampoos and <b>non-drip</b> paint. The effect usually goes unnoticed, however, because it seldom lasts more than about 300 milliseconds. The effect can be sustained by pouring the liquid onto a slanted surface, preventing the outgoing jet from intersecting the downward one (which tends to end the effect).|$|E
50|$|Newtonian fluids are the {{simplest}} mathematical models of fluids {{that account for}} viscosity. While no real fluid fits the definition perfectly, many common liquids and gases, such as water and air, can be assumed to be Newtonian for practical calculations under ordinary conditions. However, non-Newtonian fluids are relatively common, and include oobleck (which becomes stiffer when vigorously sheared), or <b>non-drip</b> paint (which becomes thinner when sheared). Other examples include many polymer solutions (which exhibit the Weissenberg effect), molten polymers, many solid suspensions, blood, and most highly viscous fluids.|$|E

50|$|The optic or <b>non-drip</b> {{measure is}} mounted beneath an {{inverted}} spirit bottle, {{so that a}} pre-defined volume of the bottle's contents drains into the measure. Lifting a lever {{on the side of}} the measure first closes off the measure from the bottle, then dispenses the measured liquid into the glass or mixing vessel held underneath. This mechanism ensures that a correct spirit measure can be dispensed each time, as the inverted bottle allows the measure to be replenished in the optic after each shot has been dispensed. These types of measures are commonly used for highly demanded drinks in professional bar settings, and are often incorporated into visually-appealing machines that serve both functional and marketing purposes for the liquor being poured. Bottles are available to the trade with their labels affixed upside down so that they will be the right way up when mounted on the optic.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{work was}} carried out at the {{research}} and development center of AkzoNobel Decorative Coatings bv in Sassenheim, The Netherlands. The main aim was understanding how to tune the rheology of waterborne paints in order to control their thixotropy and formulate a <b>non-drip</b> paint with good brush load and good levelling as well. The samples were tested via brush application and via rheological tests (such as flow curves and thixotropy tests), which were optimized, increasing their repeatability and reproducibility. By comparison of commercial products, the target paint was defined in terms of rheological values (viscosity with respect to the shear rate, shearing time and relaxation time). A screening {{was carried out}} on the main classes of rheology modifiers, namely chelates, clays, hydrophobically modified urethanes (HEUR) and cellulose derivatives. Each rheology modifier was tested in combination with binders having different chemistry (acrylic binders, alkyd binders and their polyurethane-modified version). The outcomes included a wide portfolio of rheology modifiers for different purposes and a guideline for future formulations...|$|E

Drip irrigation is widely promoted for water saving at the farm level. Moreover, it is easily adaptable to small-scale farming common in Africa. The use of low-cost drip irrigation, especially the low-cost medium head (LCMH) drip system, is growing rapidly in some Asian countries. However, the uptake of low-cost drip irrigation in general has been slow in Kenya, which has scarce water for irrigation. Using the theory of the adoption and diffusion of innovation, this research aimed to identify the factors affecting the rate of adoption and continued use of low-cost low head (LCLH) drip irrigation in Kenya. Following a review of experiences of low-cost drip irrigation from India and sub-Saharan Africa, primary information was obtained using informal interviews in a two-phase survey. A total of eighty-six respondents were interviewed in the two phases. Phase 1 examined the factors influencing the adoption of LCLH drip irrigation. The key respondents in phase 1 were irrigation farmers (drip and <b>non-drip),</b> government officials, irrigation industry representatives, and staff of non¬governmental organisations (NGOs). Phase 2 examined the factors affecting discontinuation of LCLH drip irrigation. In phase 2 only LCLH drip irrigation farmers and those who had discontinued using it were interviewed While the low-cost medium head drip irrigation was the dominant irrigation in India, the low-cost low head drip irrigation, gravity fed and in a kit form, was found to be the most common system on smallholder farms in Kenya. The results showed that for the rate of appropriate low-cost drip irrigation uptake to increase in Kenya, it was important to remove political and institutional inhibiting factors dominant during the implementation stages of the innovation-decision process. It was necessary for farmers to have a need to save irrigation water, reliable irrigation water resources, effective water user organisations, efficient marketing facilities, efficient technical support services, relevant cultural background, and good security for the kit. The LCLH drip irrigation kit appeared to have more maintenance problems than the alternative irrigation methods. Furthermore, government policies and extension services as well as irrigation industry efforts appeared limited. It appeared that the technology would most likely be adopted where farmers have a reliable but limited (in volume) water supply. In some situations, the LCLH drip technology, and particularly the smaller (bucket) kits, did not appear to be appropriate and should not be promoted. For other conditions, recommendations were made for helping to overcome the problems identified in the study. The Rogers innovation-decision model was shown to lack sufficient consideration of external factors. A revised model was proposed to suit the conditions of small-scale irrigation technology adoption in less developed countries. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
