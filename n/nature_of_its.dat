5|$|Adi Da {{published}} his fourth book, titled Garbage and the Goddess: The Last Miracles and Final Spiritual Instructions of Bubba Free John. It documented the relatively unexpurgated lectures {{and activities of}} this period. It quickly sold out its first print run, and a second was sent to bookstores. However, due to the controversial <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> contents, all available copies were quickly retrieved and ritually burned at Adi Da's behest.|$|E
5|$|Although The Castafiore Emerald {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} for making its characters follow a lead of false trails, {{it was not}} a commercial success due to the experimental <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> narrative. It was published as a book by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Flight 714 to Sydney, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains. Although in 1977 Khlebnikov suggested {{it was due to}} an epidemic, it was difficult to ascertain if such a large territory had been affected all at once. By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that had high alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became devoid of the species, due to its low reproductive rate and the insular <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> habitat.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|Several foreign governments, the United Nations, {{and human}} rights {{organizations}} such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have expressed their concerns over allegations of torture and ill-treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China. Nonetheless, some observers have noted that Falun Gong has failed to attract the level of sympathy and sustained international attention afforded to Tibetans, Chinese Christians or democracy activists. This {{has been attributed to}} the group's unsophisticated PR skills, the impact of the Communist Party's propaganda against the practice, or the foreign <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> teachings, which identify with Buddhist and Daoist traditions.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most of Fagen's {{previous}} work, The Nightfly {{is almost}} blatantly autobiographical. Many {{of the songs}} relate to the cautiously optimistic mood of his suburban childhood in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and incorporate such topics as late-night jazz disc jockeys, fallout shelters, and tropical vacations. Recorded over eight months at various studios between New York City and Los Angeles, the album is an early example of a fully digital recording in popular music. The nascent technology, {{as well as the}} perfectionist <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> engineers and musicians, made the album difficult to record.|$|E
5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which Peter S. Smedresman, {{writing in the}} Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce divides into three categories of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the Baltic Exchange, specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have {{no relation to the}} United Kingdom. London has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, due to the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal in habits, after dusk {{the leopard}} {{catshark}} hunts for small, benthic bony fishes and invertebrates in shallow water. In daytime, it generally rests inside caves and crevices, sometimes in groups. This species {{has been documented}} ambushing spawning chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi) within their spawning grounds. Reproduction is oviparous and proceeds year-round. Females produce rectangular, light-colored egg capsules two at a time, attaching them to structures on the sea floor. Small and harmless, the leopard catshark adapts well to captivity and is often exhibited in public aquariums. It is caught by commercial and recreational fishers as bycatch, and often killed as a pest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; its numbers {{do not seem to}} be declining, but heavy human activity occurs within its native waters. The possibly fragmented <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> distribution also merits caution for each local population.|$|E

5|$|In 1926–1927, a royal {{commission}} into bribery {{of members}} of the police by bookmakers was conducted, finding that it was probable that two detectives and several plainclothes constables were guilty of taking bribes. After considering the report of the royal commission, Leane submitted his own report to the government, in which he criticised the vague <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> findings, and while accepting that some police may have accepted bribes, he asserted that corruption was not widespread. One detective and three constables were offered the opportunity to resign and took it, and another plainclothes constable was returned to uniformed duty. During the course of the royal commission, several other plainclothes constables had resigned. Before the commission concluded, Leane recommended to the Chief Secretary, James Jelley, who was the minister responsible for the police, that the plainclothes branch of the police be abolished, with uniformed constables to be rotated through those duties as required. His recommendation was accepted. In January 1927, the design by Leane's brother-in-law, Louis Laybourne Smith, was selected for the National War Memorial in Adelaide. In early 1928, Leane became a foundation member and the inaugural president of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen.|$|E
