40|$|Under Nigerian law, every accused {{is presumed}} {{innocent}} until his guilt is proved. The legal {{burden of proving}} the guilt of the accused, unlike the evidential burden of proving specific facts, rests on the Prosecution and does not shift throughout the trial. At {{the close of the}} case for the prosecution, the accused is invited to make his defence. A number of options, of which the <b>no-case</b> submission is one, are open to the accused at this stage. This article discusses the <b>no-case</b> submission. It also examines the conditions required to be satisfied by the accused in order to succeed on the submission. The ways in which a judge/magistrate may rule on a <b>no-case</b> submission and the effects of those rulings are also examined. After a ruling has been made, subsequent evidence may be introduced by either party. What is the consequence of this? With the aid of statutory and judicial authorities, this article examines the basic rules relating to a submission of no case to answer as is applicable under Nigerian law...|$|E
40|$|Why do {{languages}} share structural properties? The functionalist {{tradition has}} argued that languages have evolved to suit {{the needs of their}} users. By what means functional pressures may come to shape grammar over time, however, remains unknown. Functional pressures could affect adults ’ production; or they could operate during language learning. To date, these possibilities have remained largely untested. We explore the latter possibility, that functional pressures operate during language acquisition. In an artificial language learning experiment we investigate the trade-off between word order and case. Flexible word order languages are potentially ambiguous if no case-marking (or other cues) are employed to identify the doer of the action. We explore whether language learners are biased against uncertainty in the mapping of form and meaning, showing a tendency to make word order a stronger cue to the intended meaning in <b>no-case</b> languages...|$|E
40|$|The Daily Assessment Form (OAF) {{retrospectively}} assessed {{symptoms of}} late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD), {{both at the}} beginning {{and at the end of}} a 2 -month time interval. Ninety-four women between the ages of 18 and 45 entered the study. Half of the subjects viewed a negative-case, stereotypic presentation of LLPDD prior to the pretest. sixty-eight subjects qualified on the pretest to complete the study. Half of the remaining <b>no-case</b> subjects and half of the remaining negative-case subjects completed 8 weeks 2 ̆ 7 prospective ratings via the OAF. Forty-eight subjects remained to complete the posttest at the end of that time interval. Pretest Total and Pretest Criteria scores revealed significant main effects for case-presentation condition (E[l, 63] = 7. 08, R =. 01) and (E[l, 63] = 8. 34, R =. 01) and completion level (E[l, 63] = 6. 76, R =. 01) and (E[l, 63] = 3. 76, R. 06). Effect sizes equalled 0. 48 and 0. 45 for case presentation and 1. 92 and 1. 98 for completion...|$|E
