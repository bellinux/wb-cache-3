40|$|Acoustic <b>noise</b> <b>canceling</b> {{methods are}} used to <b>cancel</b> out <b>noise</b> from a noise source. A {{frequently}} used algorithm is the filtered-X algorithm. This method uses {{an estimate of the}} acoustical path from secondary sound source to microphone. Because the secondary path can change due to movements or other circumstances it is desirable to track the secondary path online. In this paper several online modeling techniques are discussed and a new method is proposed, this new method uses additive noise to track the secondary path online. The power of the additional noise is dependent on the quality of <b>noise</b> <b>canceling.</b> Simulations show that this new online modeling method tracks the changes of the secondary path well.

As such, the relative effect of noise, at a level typical of an aircraft cabin was compared with varying levels of alcohol intoxication in the same subjects. Since the detrimental effect of noise is more pronounced on non-native speakers, both native English and non-native English speakers featured in the study. <b>Noise</b> <b>cancelling</b> headphones were also tested as a simple countermeasure to mitigate the effect of noise on performance. A total of 32 participants, half of which were non-native English speakers, completed a cued recall task in two alcohol conditions (blood alcohol concentration 0. 05 and 0. 10) and two audio conditions (audio played through the speaker and <b>noise</b> <b>cancelling</b> headphones). The results revealed that aircraft noise at 65 dB (A) negatively affected performance to a level comparable to alcohol intoxication of 0. 10.

40|$|Abstract. When {{applying}} certain adaptive algorithms, such as {{the popular}} LMS and NLMS algorithms, in adaptive <b>noise</b> <b>canceling</b> or adaptive equalization scenarios where a strong narrowband interference component is present, these algorithms exhibit nonlinear dynamic behaviors. The latter is expressed in filter weights – that are generally expected to converge to constants – exhibiting a dynamic component. Furthermore, the performance of these adaptive filters with dynamic weight behavior can exceed the performance of any filter of the same structure in which those weights are fixed. In adaptive <b>noise</b> <b>canceling</b> applications, the dynamic component of the weights can be unmistakably large. In adaptive equalization scenarios, however, the dynamic aspect of the weight behavior can easily be mistaken for low level noise. These various findings will be illustrated. 1...|$|R
