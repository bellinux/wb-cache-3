50|$|The first {{domestic}} airline company {{was set up}} in 1936. Later during the second World War, the runway was expanded. In 1962 the passenger terminal was completed, and Kai Tak became an international airport, renamed Hong Kong International Airport. But it continued to be referred to by its popular name, Kai Tak Airport. Within a couple of decades, {{it became clear that the}} current airport was inadequate. The airport itself was now surrounded by more private buildings, making further land acquisition and expansion impossible. To reduce the impact of <b>noisy</b> <b>aircraft</b> on nearby residents, there was a curfew in place. It was decided to look for a new area, which could fit a huge airport, built from scratch. In the early 90s, construction on a new airport outside the busy Hong Kong central area, began at Chep Lap Kok, 30 km to the west of Kai Tak. This new airport is built on reclaimed land and the reclamation process involved joining Lam Chau island with Chep Lap Kok island. The old airport at Kai Tak finally retired at midnight 5 July 1998, and the new Hong Kong International Airport and began service in the morning of the following day. Recently, a couple of new airport buildings were opened to help with the increasing number of travellers. There are many talks at present, to extend the current airport in the years to come.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the White Paper, the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ('Project Heathrow' for short) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required. A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if 'mixed mode' operations (the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures) are phased in gradually as <b>noisier</b> <b>aircraft</b> are retired. Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway. These issues are to be addressed as part of a three-month consultation beginning in December 2007, and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to evaluate the environmental trade-offs inherent in multi-criteria objectives of an integrated environmental policy. A probabilistic multi-attribute impact pathway analysis (MAIPA) was formulated to assess the environmental damages of US commercial aircraft operations from 1991 - 2003. The initial contribution of this work was demonstrating the feasibility of, and identifying requirements for, the FAA Aviation-environmental Portfolio Management Tool (APMT), an integrated assessment capability for US regulatory decision-making. Non-aircraft sources {{have been found to}} dictate marginal emissions costs. The implication is that aviation emissions reductions influence neither the magnitudes nor trends in per-unit marginal damages. In contrast, noise mitigation is the dominant influence on the value of per-unit marginal damages. Trends in sum damages were found to depend on the growth rates of air transport relative to other source emissions. Growth in air transport emissions outpaced non-aircraft sources from 1991 - 2003. Because growth in marginal costs is nonlinear over this period, aviation emissions damages grow faster than inventories. Applying methods similar to MAIPA to estimate damages for future scenarios suggests that stemming climate impacts is fast becoming the priority. A reassessment of the environmental benefits derived from mandated phase-outs of <b>noisy</b> <b>aircraft</b> during the 1990 's has been carried out. Previous studies estimated a - 80 % reduction in population exposure. In contrast, the reassessment estimates a ~ 2 % reduction, providing benefits 17 - 20 times lower than published estimates of abatement costs. (cont.) The primary environmental benefit of the noise phase-outs was found to be related to reductions in particulate matter inventories. One way to avoid trade-off inefficiencies is to identify options that bundle benefits. This action provides such an example, where the phase-outs led to reductions in both noise and air quality emissions. Other contributions in the thesis include the following: a treatment of air transport particulate matter emissions, environmental fate, and health impacts of particulate matter; identification that the major source of reducible uncertainty in emissions damages stems from the assumed extent of ozone and particulate matter production in the engine exhaust plume; and quantification of the environmental tradeoffs in decisions specifying aircraft performance for the technology in the US commercial fleet from 1991 - 2003. by Stephen P.

5000|$|Interior {{noise is}} lower than {{conventional}} turboprop aircraft, because the propellers and engine exhausts are behind the cabin. Piaggio quotes 68 dBA. However, due to the strongly disturbed flow in which the pusher propellers operate, the exterior noise is higher. The exterior noise level and its higher pitched sound {{has been shown to}} be the result primarily of the interaction of the turbine engine exhaust flows and the five-bladed pusher propellers (est. +9 dB). On takeoff, the Avanti has been measured at 81.9 dBA sideline noise level, slightly lower than the Beechcraft King Air at 82.8 dBA. This is below FAA stage 3 noise limits, which set a maximum of 89 EPNdB for takeoff. However, the P180 has been the subject of noise complaints at airports, such as Aspen-Pitkin County Airport in Colorado as well as Naples Municipal Airport, Florida, where that airport authority determined it was the <b>noisiest</b> <b>aircraft</b> using the facility.

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The effect of airport noise on communities surrounding airports presents a serious problem for airport operations and expansion. In order to resolve this problem, many {{attempts have been made}} to control airport noise over recent years all over the world. Of these, land use regulation is an important method for controlling' the adverse impacts of airport noise on airport environs. The success of the prevention of noise sensitive development depends on effective land use planning and control. This study reviews effective noise control through land use regulation at Kimpo International Airport, Korea. For the purpose of a more precise understanding of the noise problem, a review of the various aspects and causes of aircraft noise, the way noise is measured, its effects on people, and the methods to alleviate the adverse impact of airport noise is presented. In addition to these, the characteristics of effective land use planning around an airport, available land use control measures, and the compatible land use planning system practised in the United States, the United Kingdom and Korea are reviewed. The role of Kimpo International Airport will change to the exclusive use for domestic flights. With the opening of the new intemational airport in 2001, the noise analysis shows a significant reduction in the noise impacted area at Kimpo Airport following this change in role, due to the decrease of the number of aircraft operations and the elimination of <b>noisier</b> <b>aircraft,</b> However, the pressure for development in less impacted areas may make the airport noise problem worse in the future. In order to prevent encroaching development in the vicinity of Kimpo Airport, the following conclusions are presented: - More objective and efficient standards for land use regulation are desirable. - Compatible land use planning through the co-operative efforts of each of the various parties involved is essential for the prevention of noise sensitive development. - Developing a community relations programme is useful for the resolution of airport noise problems and the restoration of a community's confidence. - Systematic selection of noise control measures and monitoring programmes are essential for the effective management of the noise environment...|$|R
40|$|Aviation noise {{pollution}} {{in urban areas}} {{can be considered as}} a major problem and source of conflict between airport infrastructure and residents. Its effects could significantly limit the growth of aviation as well as affect public health, mainly when airports are located near residential areas. Noise control measures both at the source and at the receivers are often expensive and limited. Nevertheless, they represent the most viable solutions for contrasting this phenomenon due to the difficulty of finding suitable measures to reduce aircraft noise along its propagation path. This work is focused on the development, the assessment, and the management of mitigation actions regarding the noise action plan of Pisa’s “Galileo Galilei” International Airport. This airport has recently presented its noise action plan in order to give itself the possibility of expansion without incurring in air traffic limitations. The action plan includes both the construction of a runway link to increase the take-off run length and the introduction of a noise-abatement departure procedure. The effectiveness of these actions against {{noise pollution}} has been evaluated by means of noise numerical modelling. In particular, the noise impact produced by the airport and the related exposed population have been estimated by using the Integrated Noise Model (INM). New strategies to ensure an effective noise reduction {{as a response to the}} growing aircraft traffic have been proposed. Noise maps calculated for present and future scenarios, including those following the application of noise reduction measures, are shown. For many situations, people’s exposure and the percentages of highly annoyed and highly sleep-disturbed people have been determined also including military aircraft noise. Moreover, a novel methodology for managing airport noise in the closest urban areas based on the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology is presented. ADS-B helps to track the 3 D-flight paths with high data resolution and then to verify both the effectiveness of the action plan and the compliance with its provisions. A penetration gate has been strategically set considering the departures towards the city. The vertical distribution of the traffic crossing the gate and the correlation between take-off conditions and noise-related events have been investigated in order to establish rules for penalties due to the lack of compliance with the action plan requirements. The relationships between the operational characteristics of flight departures and aircraft noise by means of a statistical approach have been identified. Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression were performed in order to extrapolate a simplified predictive model at a specific point on the ground. The findings may be useful to point out the operational characteristics causing the <b>noisiest</b> <b>aircraft</b> flyovers. Consequently, scheduled flight departures could be re-organized by introducing departure-direction and departureprocedure restrictions in order to minimize noise impact on the urban areas. The results confirm that ADS-B system may be considered a smart tool providing cost-effective solutions for the airport noise management in urban areas and its sustainable development, particularly when the radar tracks are not available...|$|R
40|$|Along with an {{increase}} in the aircraft engine power and growth in air traffic, noise level at airports and their surrounding environs significantly increases.
