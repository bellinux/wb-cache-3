40|$|More {{than one}} million {{households}} in Australia are generating electricity from solar photovoltaic panels installed on their homes and they receive a credit or payment, namely a return in some form for the electricity generated. The {{focus of this article}} is on domestic households and the returns they receive from solar panels installed on their roofs. This article contends that such returns {{in the form of a}} credit or actual payment to households for electricity generated from solar panels is ordinary income from property and should be treated as assessable income. Where the electricity generated is fed back into the household it will <b>not</b> be <b>assessable</b> income, but in all those cases where the electricity is fed into the grid and a payment or credit is given, then that return is income according to ordinary concepts and assessable as such. If the government wants to encourage investment in solar energy by householders in Australia then it should clarify this issue by passing legislation exempting the returns from assessable income. Alternatively the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) could release a public ruling on the issue. This at least would provide greater certainty for households who now tentatively rely on private rulings given to taxpayers by the ATO that consider credits and payments <b>not</b> to be <b>assessable</b> income on the basis that the householder is not conducting a business or that the arrangement is of a private or domestic nature...|$|R

His business partner David Walsh believes that he does not owe them money as gambling on horse racing has never been a taxable source of income in Australia.

Appellant twice errs. Flint did not address personal income tax; it was concerned with corporate taxation. Furthermore, Flint is pre-sixteenth amendment and must be read in that light. At this late date, it seems incredible that we would again be required to hold that the Constitution, as amended, empowers the Congress to levy an income tax against any source of income, without the need to apportion the tax equally among the states, or to classify it as an excise tax applicable to specific categories of activities.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{non-destructive}} evaluation of structural components allows {{the detection of}} cracks {{and other types of}} flaws with a high resolution. When cracks are involved in mechanical failure events, fracture mechanics provides concepts for lifetime prediction of components when component geometry, material characteristics and load intensity under steady state or impact loading are known. Under fatigue loads additionally material laws have to be observed. Bringing together these disciplines, quantitative non-destructive testing for lifetime prediction is possible. Due to measurement uncertainties related to crack size geometry, material pa-rameters' inherent scatter and load history are <b>not</b> unambiguously <b>assessable.</b> Therefore, statistical distributions are assumed (e. g. Normal or Weibull) and probabilistic fitness for service assessment (FFS) is performed rather than a de-terministic one. This concept of combining quantitative non-destructive testing and probabilistic FFS assessment works well for metals. The fracture mechanics analysis under predominantly static loading has at its core the so called Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD). Hereby, an illustrative tool for condition monitoring is supplied which is also accepted in design rules and codes...|$|R

Twenty-eight patients underwent FNA of breast lesions under ultrasonographic guidance. After smearing slides for cytology, residual cells were rinsed with TRIzol to recover RNA. RNA yield ranged from 0. 78 to 88. 40 µg per sample. FNA leftovers from 23 nonpalpable breast cancers {{were selected for}} gene expression profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays.

Compliance with the Scandinavian head injury guidelines and possible reasons for non-compliance is explored. Methods From January 16 th 2006 to January 15 th 2007, 1325 computed tomography (CT) examinations due to minimal, mild or moderate head injury according to the Head Injury Severity Scale (HISS) were carried out at our University Hospital. When ordering a CT scan due to head trauma, physicians were asked {{to fill out a}} questionnaire. Results Guideline compliance was impossible to assess in 49. 5 % of all cases. This was due to non-assessable or missing key variables necessary in the decision making algorithm. One or more key variables for HISS classification were <b>not</b> <b>assessable</b> in 34. 4 % as it was unknown whether there had been loss of consciousness (LOC), duration of LOC was unknown or it was impossible to assess amnesia or focal neurologic deficits. Definite compliance with both CT and admittance recommendations in guidelines was seen in only 31. 2 %. In 54. 2 % of patients with minimal head injuries who underwent CT scans, imaging was not necessary according to guidelines. 59. 1 % of all patients were admitted to hospital, however only 23. 7 % of these were admitted because of the head-injury alone.

40|$|Echocardiographic {{strain and}} strain-rate imaging (deformation imaging) {{is a new}} {{non-invasive}} method for assessment of myocardial function. Due to its ability to differentiate between active and passive movement of myocardial segments, to quantify intraventricular dyssynchrony and to evaluate components of myocardial function, such as longitudinal myocardial shortening, that are <b>not</b> visually <b>assessable,</b> it allows comprehensive assessment of myocardial function and the spectrum of potential clinical applications is very wide. The high sensitivity of both tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) derived and two dimensional (2 D) speckle tracking derived myocardial deformation (strain and strain rate) data for the early detection of myocardial dysfunction recommend these new non-invasive diagnostic methods for extensive clinical use. In addition to early detection and quantification of myocardial dysfunction of different etiologies, assessment of myocardial viability, detection of acute allograft rejection and early detection of allograft vasculopathy after heart transplantation, strain and strain rate data are helpful for therapeutic decisions and also useful for follow-up evaluations of therapeutic results in cardiology and cardiac surgery.

40|$|Tuberous {{sclerosis}} complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominantly inherited {{disease with}} a high mutation rate. It is clinically a very variable disorder and hamartomas can occur in many different organs. TSC shows genetic heterogeneity; one gene, TSC 1, is on chromosome 9 q 34, and the second gene, TSC 2, on chromosome 16 p 13. 3. Clinical criteria for diagnosis have been established, but diagnosis of patients with minimal expression of the disease can be very difficult. In children the phenotype is often incomplete or <b>not</b> fully <b>assessable.</b> Hence mildly affected subjects, at risk for severely affected offspring, may remain undiagnosed.
