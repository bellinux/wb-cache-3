5|$|Other {{subnuclear}} structures {{appear as}} part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods {{has been reported in}} some cases of <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathy.</b> This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of this myopathy is very varied. Many mutations {{occur in}} the region of actin’s indentation near to its nucleotide binding sites, while others occur in Domain 2, or in the areas where interaction occurs with associated proteins. This goes some way to explain the great variety of clumps that form in these cases, such as Nemaline or Intranuclear Bodies or Zebra Bodies. Changes in actin’s folding occur in <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathy</b> as well as changes in its aggregation and there are also changes in the expression of other associated proteins. In some variants where intranuclear bodies are found the changes in the folding masks the nucleus’s protein exportation signal so that the accumulation of actin's mutated form occurs in the cell nucleus. On the other hand, it appears that mutations to ACTA1 that give rise to a CFTDM have a greater effect on sarcomeric function than on its structure. Recent investigations have tried to understand this apparent paradox, which suggests there is no clear correlation between the number of rods and muscular weakness. It appears that some mutations are able to induce a greater apoptosis rate in type II muscular fibres.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mutation}} {{alters the}} structure and function of skeletal muscles producing one of three forms of myopathy: type 3 <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathy,</b> congenital myopathy with an excess of thin myofilaments (CM) and Congenital myopathy with fibre type disproportion (CMFTD). Mutations have also been found that produce “core” myopathies). Although their phenotypes are similar, in addition to typical <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathy</b> some specialists distinguish another type of myopathy called actinic <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathy.</b> In the former, clumps of actin form instead of the typical rods. It is important to state that a patient can show {{more than one of}} these phenotypes in a biopsy. The most common symptoms consist of a typical facial morphology (myopathic faces), muscular weakness, a delay in motor development and respiratory difficulties. The course of the illness, its gravity and the age at which it appears are all variable and overlapping forms of myopathy are also found. [...] A symptom of nemalinic myopathy is that “Nemaline rods” appear in differing places in Type 1 muscle fibres. These rods are non-pathognomonic structures that have a similar composition to the Z disks found in the sarcomere.|$|E

CRL substrate adaptors have been established as players in muscle atrophy and <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathies.</b> This led to us to investigate whether CRLs are important for muscle development. C 2 C 12 muscle cells were treated with MLN 4924, an inhibitor of CRL activation. Treatment at the start of myoblast differentiation showed a defect in myotube formation due to an absence of cell commitment to the differentiation program, indicating that CRLs are important for early myogenesis. We obtained similar results for satellite cells isolated from mouse skeletal muscles, confirming the absolute necessity of CRL activity for normal myogenesis. The inhibition of CRL activity also led to a defect in acetylcholine receptor aggregation. Similarly, a receptor defect has also been observed in CRL-linked <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathies,</b> again indicating a possible role for these E 3 -ligases in the disease etiology. Currently, MLN 4924 is used as a cancer drug that is undergoing clinical trials. However, cancer patients typically experience cachexia, or muscle wasting, which would likely be further exacerbated by the use of MLN 4924. We observed a rescue of the MLN 4924 induced differentiation-blockage several days after removal of the inhibitor. We also found that treatment with 5 ’Aza’dC, a drug that stimulates Myogenin expression, alleviates the phenotype. Our data indicate significant roles for CRLs during muscle differentiation as well as negative side effects for the use of MLN 4924 in patients...|$|R

40|$|During myofibrillogenesis, many muscle {{structural}} proteins assemble to {{form the}} highly ordered contractile sarcomere. Mutations in these proteins can lead to dysfunctional muscle and various myopathies. We have analyzed the Drosophila melanogaster troponin T (TnT) up 1 mutant that specifically affects the indirect flight muscles (IFM) to explore troponin function during myofibrillogenesis. The up 1 muscles lack normal sarcomeres and contain "zebra bodies," a phenotypic feature of human <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathies.</b> We show that the up 1 mutation causes defective splicing of a newly identified alternative TnT exon (10 a) that encodes part of the TnT C terminus.

Functional differences between the 10 a and 10 b TnT isoforms {{may be due to}} different potential phosphorylation sites, none of which correspond to known phosphorylation sites in human cardiac TnT. The absence of TnT mRNA in up 1 IFM reduces mRNA levels of an IFM-specific troponin I (TnI) isoform, but not actin, tropomyosin, or troponin C, suggesting a mechanism controlling expression of TnT and TnI genes may exist that must be examined in the context of human myopathies caused by mutations of these thin filament proteins...|$|R

Clinical and pathological features were reviewed. During a period of 1. 5 years (Jan 2004 to June 2005), we received 750 muscle biopsies for various reasons. Of which, 15 were diagnosed as congenital myopathies and four as <b>nemaline</b> rod <b>myopathies.</b> Thus, NM comprises 0. 53 &#x 0025; of all muscle diseases and 22. 6 &#x 0025; of all congenital myopathies.

40|$|In many nonmuscle cells, nonsarcomeric alpha-actinin is {{distributed}} in the dense bodies of stress fibers, adhesion plaques, and adherens junctions. In striated muscle, a sarcomeric isoform of alpha-actinin (s-alpha-actinin) {{is found in the}} Z-bands of myofibrils and subsarcolemmal adhesion plaques. To understand the role(s) of the alpha-actinin isoforms in the assembly and maintenance of such cytoskeletal structures, full-length or truncated s-alpha-actinin cDNAs were expressed in PtK 2 cells and in primary skeletal myogenic cells. We found the following. (i) In transfected PtK 2 cells the truncated s-alpha-actinin was rapidly incorporated into preexisting dense bodies, adhesion plaques, and adherens junctions. With time these structures collapsed, and the affected cells detached from the substrate. (ii) In myotubes the truncated s-alpha-actinin was incorporated into nascent Z-bands. Many of these progressively hypertrophied, forming nemaline-like bodies. With time the affected myofibrils fragmented, and the myotubes detached from the substrate. (iii) In both cell types the truncated s-alpha-actinin was significantly more disruptive of the cytoskeletal structures than the full-length molecule. (iv) Pools of "over-expressed" full-length or truncated protein did not self-aggregate into homogeneous, amorphous complexes; rather the exogenous proteins selectively colocalized with the same cohort of cytoskeletal proteins with which the endogenous alpha-actinin normally associates. The similarity among the hypertrophied Z-bands in transfected myotubes, the nemaline bodies in patients with <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathies,</b> and the streaming Z-bands seen in various muscle pathologies raises the possibility that the genetically determined nemaline bodies and the pathologically induced Z-band alterations may reflect primary and/or post-translational modifications of s-alpha-actinin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background About 20 % of <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathies</b> {{are thus}} far related to {{skeletal}} muscle alpha-actin. Seven actin mutants located {{in different parts}} of the actin molecule and linked to different forms of the disease were selected and expressed as EGFP-tagged constructs in differentiated C 2 C 12 mytoubes. Results were compared with phenotypes in patient skeletal muscle fibres and with previous expression studies in fibroblasts and C 2 C 12 myoblasts/myotubes. Results Whereas EGFP wt-actin nicely incorporated into endogenous stress fibres and sarcomeric structures, the mutants showed a range of phenotypes, which generally changed upon differentiation. Many mutants appeared delocalized in myoblasts but integrated into endogenous actin structures after 4 – 6 days of differentiation, demonstrating a poor correlation between the appearance in myotubes and the severity of the disease. However, for some mutants, integration into stress fibres induced aberrant structures in differentiated cells, like thickening or fragmentation of stress fibres. Other mutants almost failed to integrate but formed huge aggregates in the cytoplasm of myotubes. Those did not co-stain with alpha-actinin, a main component of nemaline bodies found in patient muscle. Interestingly, nuclear aggregates as formed by two of the mutants in myoblasts were found less frequently or not at all in differentiated cells. Conclusion Myotubes are a suitable system to study the capacity of a mutant to incorporate into actin structures or to form or induce pathological changes. Some of the phenotypes observed in undifferentiated myoblasts may only be in vitro effects. Other phenotypes, like aberrant stress fibres or rod formation may be more directly correlated with disease phenotypes. Some mutants did not induce any changes in the cellular actin system, indicating the importance of additional studies like functional assays to fully characterize the pathological impact of a mutant. </p...|$|R

40|$|This PhD thesis {{has been}} focused on the {{identification}} and functional characterization of sequence variants in the RYR 1 gene, associated with Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and some congenital myopathies (CMs). MH is an autosomal dominant pharmacogenetic disorder caused by an altered intracellular Ca 2 + homeostasis. This pathology shows a life treatening hypermetabolic crisis after administration of anaesthetics and/or depolarizing muscle relaxants. MH is syntomatologic silent and until now the only sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of MH is the in vitro contracture test (IVCT), carried out on muscle byopsies. MH presents wide genetic heterogeneity: six genetic loci associated with the MH suscettible phenotype (MHS) have been identified. In more than 70 % of MHS patients the locus segregating with the pathology is MHS- 1, where the RYR 1 gene maps. The RYR 1 gene codifies for the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR 1), a calcium release channel localised in the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) membrane of skeletal muscle and B-lymphocytes. CMs are a heterogeneous group of inherited neuromuscular disorders characterized by hypotonia and muscle weakness, that usually present at birth or early childhood or rarely adulthood. Myophathies linked to RYR 1 mutations are differentiated {{on the basis of the}} histopathological features in: core myopathies (central core disease, multiminicore disease, <b>nemaline</b> rod <b>myopathy,</b> and centronuclear myopathy), characterized histologically by central cores, multi-minicores, nemaline rods, central nuclei in muscle fibers, respectively; and others myopathies (congenital neuromuscular disease with uniform Type 1 fibers, and congenital fiber-type disproportion myopathy) characterized histologically by the almost exclusive presence of Type 1 muscle fiber and relative hypotrophy of type 1 muscle fibers, respectively. Great phenotypic and histopathological overlap and marked phenotypic variability are present in different myopathies. So far more than 200 sequence variants have been identified in the RYR 1 gene, but only 28 variants have been investigated for their functional effect and included in the guidelines for molecular genetic detection of MH susceptibility (www. emhg. org). In this study, the mutation analysis of the RYR 1 gene was performed by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (dHPLC) and automatic sequencing in 24 MHS subjects, one CCD patient and one with minicores. 14 RYR 1 gene sequence variants, an in-frame insertion variant and several known and novel polymorphisms have been identified. We characterized the effect of nine RYR 1 variants on the channel function.

G 406 is located in alternatively spliced exon 8 A, encoding transmembrane segment S 6 of domain I. Here, we describe two individuals with a severe variant of TS (TS 2). Neither child had syndactyly. Both individuals had extreme prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiogram, with a QT interval corrected for heart rate ranging from 620 to 730 ms, causing multiple arrhythmias and sudden death. One individual had severe mental retardation and <b>nemaline</b> rod skeletal <b>myopathy.</b> We identified de novo missense mutations in exon 8 of CaV 1. 2 in both individuals.

The spliced form of CaV 1. 2 containing exon 8 is highly expressed in heart and brain, accounting for ≈ 80 % of CaV 1. 2 mRNAs. G 406 R and G 402 S cause reduced channel inactivation, resulting in maintained depolarizing L-type calcium currents.

5000|$|Muscle cells {{contract}} in complex mechanical and chemical processes. At the microscopic level, muscle cells have structures called sarcomeres. Diseases in the <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathy</b> group come about from {{the presence of}} rod-like structures running perpendicular to the sarcomeres in skeletal muscle fibers. The presence of these rods in muscle cells {{makes it more difficult}} for the muscles to contract. Normally, muscle cells contract by different fibers sliding past one another. All of the different gene mutations leading to NM that have been found so far are in genes that encode different components of the sarcomere. In normal muscle cells, the various parts of the muscle fibers that make up the sarcomere are distributed evenly in a pattern for effective muscle contraction. Evidence suggests that some kinds of NM affect the arrangement of these muscle fibers, causing the muscles to be unable to contract as efficiently or effectively.Nemaline myopathy is usually genetic and shows traits in the affected individual from birth or an early age. However, there are some cases of symptoms of <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathy</b> not showing up until adulthood. These cases are usually not genetic. Of the genes that have been linked to <b>nemaline</b> <b>myopathy,</b> most are also involved in encoding proteins in the sarcomeres in the muscle cells.

40|$|Myofibrillogenesis is {{a complex}} process, which {{involves}} assembly of hundreds of structural proteins in a highly ordered manner to form the contractile structural unit of muscle, the sarcomere. Several myopathic conditions reported in humans are caused due to abnormal myofibrillogenesis owing to mutations in the genes coding {{for many of these}} structural proteins. These myopathies have highly variable clinical features and time of onset. Since their aetiology is poorly understood, it becomes imperative to have a model system to study the muscle defects. Present study proposes to employ the Indirect Flight Muscle (IFM) system in Drosophila melanogaster as a model to analyse the development/onset of some of these myopathies and resulting pathophysiology. We have carried out a systematic study on mutations in two major proteins of the sarcomere, actin and myosin, to understand the pathophysiology associated with the disease conditions and in turn gain insights into the process of myofibrillogenesis. To verify whether the human muscle phenotypes are observed in flies, we analysed the IFM for functional and structural defects categorised by the presence of aberrant sarcomeric structures. An important question that we have addressed is whether mutants of the Drosophila IFM recapitulate human conditions and whether it can serve as a good genetic model to study the developmental mechanisms of the human skeletal myopathies in vivo. Mutations of the human ACTA 1 skeletal actin gene produce seven congenital myopathies – actin <b>myopathy,</b> <b>nemaline</b> rod <b>myopathy,</b> intranuclear rod myopathy, congenital fibre type disproportion, congenital myopathy with core-like areas, cap disease and zebra body myopathy. Four known mutations in Act 88 F—a Drosophila homologue of ACTA 1 —occur at the same actin residues mutated in ten ACTA 1 nemaline mutations, A 138 D/P, R 256 H/L, G 268 C/D/R/S and R 372 C/S. These Act 88 F mutants were examined for muscle phenotypes with nemaline structures. Mutant homozygotes show phenotypes ranging from lack of myofibrils to almost normal sarcomeres at eclosion. Whereas, heterozygotes do allow myofibrillar assembly to certain extent; however, atypical structures are seen adjacent to normal sarcomeres. Aberrant Z disc-like structures and serial Z disc arrays, ‘zebra bodies’, are observed in homozygotes and heterozygotes of all the four Act 88 F mutants. The electron-dense structures observed in electron micrographs show homologies to human nemaline bodies/rods, but are much smaller than those typically found in the human myopathy. A possible mechanism for the ‘zebra bodies’ is proposed based on this study. Analysis of IFM at early developmental stages shows that in three of the mutants, there is an abnormal myofibril assembly leading to malformed sarcomeres mirrored in the adult stages. In one of the Act 88 F mutants, normal myofibrils are seen post-eclosion but the IFM show activity dependant progression of muscle degeneration. All the Act 88 F mutants produce dominant disruption of muscle structure and function which cannot be rescued even by three copies of the wild type Act 88 F gene implying that the mutants are strong antimorphs. Myosin myopathies are a group of human muscle diseases with heterogeneous clinical features and are caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain. We identified two chemical mutagen generated flightless mutants, Ifm(2) RU 1 and ifm(2) RU 2 that map closely to myosin heavy chain gene (Mhc) region. Since there are no structural proteins predicted in the mapped region, it was likely that these two are Mhc mutations. We show that Ifm(2) RU 1 and ifm(2) RU 2 are indeed Mhc mutations and the molecular aberrations affect amino acid residues present in the myosin rod region. Human muscle myosin heavy chain (MyHC) mutations that cause Laing early onset distal myopathy and myosin storage myopathy occur in this domain of the protein. Even though mutations lie in the same region of myosin rod, Ifm(2) RU 1 is semidominant, whereas ifm(2) RU 2 is recessive. Both the mutants show IFM defects and the presence of abnormal myofibrils. Mutant myofibrillar structures can be rescued with an additional wild type Mhc gene copy. However, the restored myofibrillar structure is incapable of rescuing the flight ability of mutants. The muscle phenotypes are due to defects in thick filament assembly which manifest from the early stages of sarcomere development. The MHC protein rod region is an α-helix that forms coiled-coils which further self assemble to form thick filaments or aggregates as observed in in vitro conditions. Biophysical and biochemical analyses reveal that the coiled-coil structure of mutant rods is not affected, however the thermodynamic stability is altered in ifm(2) RU 2 mutation. Interestingly, rod aggregate size and stability are not affected in mutant rods. The Drosophila MHC mutant rods were studied along with four MHC mutant rods that harbour human rod mutations to compare the molecular consequences. The Drosophila mutations do not hamper the rod structure and assembly. Therefore, the defects may arise due to altered interactions with myosin rod binding proteins. Flightin is an extensively studied myosin rod binding protein. The amount and phosphorylation status of flightin are an extremely sensitive measure of thick filament assembly. Flightin phosphorylation is affected in the mutants suggesting a functional dependence on MHC and it also indicates MHC instability. In the light of the work done, we have assessed the mutations with respect to their structure-functional implications. The acto-myosin interactions responsible for the defects are also discussed. Formation of unusual myofibrillar structures are analysed with regards to the process of myofibrillogenesis. An understanding of this entire process with the information available from IFM is reviewed in detail. The work so far has helped in understanding the manifestation of myopathies at tissue/cellular levels with insights into the plausible mechanisms of origin of the disease phenotypes. Myopathic condition may arise due to developmental or functional defects. For therapeutic considerations, the fly provides a simple test to inspect the effects of adding extra copies of the wild type gene. We conclude that the Drosophila IFM provide a good model system for the study of human ACTA 1 and MyHC myopathies...|$|R
