2500|$|The last {{surviving}} {{member of}} the Alien Zetton race after SSSP destroyed them in their last invasion for Earth. Edo was approached by Ide to join the SSSP as he agreed, having lend a hand in developing the Ultraman Suits. As the presence of alien beings {{were supposed to be}} made secret, Edo bears a wristwatch that allows him to create holographic disguise of a human when walking out in the human world. Knowing that there are times when the Ultraman Suit cannot be deployed, he gave Shinjiro another mimicry system in his possession that allowed the boy to become [...] "Ultraman" [...] via holographic disguise. As humanity were initially unprepared for the arrival of aliens, Edo's residential area is in fact the Giant of Light Memorial. He often felt nostalgic whenever he watched the diorama display of Ultraman and Zetton, reminiscing his days as an invader. Being an Alien Zetton, Edo only <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for two minutes a day.|$|E
6000|$|Chief {{among the}} leaders of the smaller tribes - the little clans who knew to a penny the expense of moving white troops against them - was a priest-bandit-chief whom we will call the Gulla Kutta Mullah. His enthusiasm for Border murder as an art was almost dignified. He would cut down a mail-runner from pure wantonness, or bombard a mud-fort with rifle-fire when he knew that our men <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> In his leisure moments he would go on circuit among his neighbours, and try to incite other tribes to devilry. Also, he kept a kind of hotel for fellow-outlaws in his own village, which lay in a valley called Bersund. Any respectable murderer on that section of the {{frontier}} was sure to lie up at Bersund, for it was reckoned an exceedingly safe place. The sole entry to it ran through a narrow gorge which could be converted into a death-trap in five minutes. It was surrounded by high hills, reckoned inaccessible to all save born mountaineers, and here the Gulla Kutta Mullah lived in great state, the head of a colony of mud and stone huts, and in each mud hut hung some portion of a red uniform and the plunder of dead men. The Government particularly wished for his capture, and once invited him formally to come out and be hanged on account of the many murders in which he had taken a direct part. He replied: - ...|$|E

He later asked Tsukiko {{to check up on}} O-Chul and, after being dismissed by her, casually comments that the [...] "way complicated" [...] ritual she had been working on was actually half a ritual, despite having only seen it briefly. The Monster may have caused rainstorm in issue 550 and possibly issue 709 as a gift to O-Chul. In 550, they had just formally recognized each other as a friend when O-Chul said he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> before they played Go. When it starts to rain, the Monster remarks that rain helps O-Chul sleep and O-Chul agrees. In issue 709, the Monster is unsuccessful using magic to find O-Chul, and remarks, [...] "Don't worry, O-Chul, I'll find you someday. Until then, I hope wherever you are, the rain is helping you sleep." [...] The next panel shows O-Chul sleeping {{in the middle of a}} rainstorm; hundreds if not thousands of miles away.|$|E

50|$|From the {{bergschrund}} at {{the foot}} of the Southwest Face, the mountain slopes up at a steady angle of about 45°. Fixed ropes were to be set up from here for about a 5500 ft vertical height, to not far below the South Summit. Camp 3 was at 23000 ft as before. The positioning of Camp 4 was reconsidered because it had in earlier years been in a very exposed location. Bonington had the idea of trying to find a safer location at a much lower height. Climbers from Advanced Base Camp had required two days to reach Camp 4 so they had always <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at Camp 3. On the other hand, the Sherpas could get straight from ABC to Camp 4 but they then needed the next day for rest. By lowering Camp 4 to about 24000 ft, Camp 3 could be mostly by-passed and the Sherpas could manage with one rest day in three. Everyone, most importantly Pertemba, supported the idea. Estcourt and Braithwaite had been making the route higher up the face and Braithwaite had commented on one particular place as being suitable for a camp although at the time they had considered it to be at too low an elevation. This eventually became the location selected and Camp 5 would be lowered to about 25500 ft. Bonington was left the considerable task of recalculating the logistics.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} class attendance on exam performance by implementing a policy in three large economics classes that required students scoring below the median on the midterm exam to attend class. This policy generated a large discontinuity {{in the rate of}} post-midterm attendance. We estimate that near the threshold, the post-midterm attendance rate was 36 percentage points higher for those students facing compulsory attendance. The discontinuous attendance policy is also associated with a significant difference in performance on the final exam. We estimate that a 10 percentage point increase in a student’s overall attendance rate results in a 0. 17 standard deviation increase in the final exam score without adversely affecting performance on other classes taken concurrently. Given the large estimated effect of attendance on exam performance, we then consider what motivates student absenteeism by implementing two campus wide surveys of lecture attendance. First, we observe characteristics and attendance rates of 180 large lecture courses and find little relationship between attendance and factors within the instructor’s control. Next, we conducted a web survey of undergraduates. The three main reasons undergraduates report missing class is that they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> they felt the class was useless or they needed to prepare for another class...|$|E

40|$|Sleep has a {{substantial}} effect on health status where good sleeping habits proves positive on learning. The {{aim of the}} present study was to map the views and perceptions of sleep and its effects on health and school performance on 12 -year olds. The goal is to visualize these views to give teachers the possibility to better plan the education in concordance with the students’ abilities. The study is based on qualitative semi-structured interviews where 12 students aged 12 have partaken. The results show that while the majority of children interviewed know how long they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> for optimal performance but many think that they are not sleeping sufficiently due to temptation from digital media. The children have the perception that we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>to</b> gather energy and for the brain to rest. In agreement with this, they are aware that too little sleep can impact school performance in a negative way. However, they are unaware that bad sleeping habits can have a negative impact also on the physical health...|$|R
