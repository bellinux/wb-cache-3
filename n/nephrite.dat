25|$|<b>Nephrite,</b> {{otherwise}} known as Jade, is a mineral widely used throughout Asia as ornaments or for decorative purposes. The oldest jade artefacts in Asia (6000 BC) were found in China where they were used as the primary hardstone of Chinese sculpturing. In 3000 BC, jade production in the Hongsan and Liangzhu cultures of China reached its peak. During this period, the knowledge of jade craftsmanship spread across the sea to Taiwan and eventually to the Philippines. The artefacts discovered in several sites in the Philippines were made from <b>nephrite.</b> <b>Nephrite</b> excavated in the Philippines were of two types: white <b>nephrite</b> and green <b>nephrite.</b>|$|E

Type C <b>nephrites</b> consist chiefly of tremolite {{and have a}} distinctive botryoidal texture. Quartzite blocks in this mélange were also affected by Ca-metasomatism, and contain variable amounts of tremolite, hydrogarnet, chlorite, and clinozoisite.

40|$|Anti-α-galactosyl {{antibodies}} and immune complexes {{in children}} with Henoch–Schönlein purpura or IgA nephropathy. Episodes of hematuria in IgA nephropathy or Henoch-Schönlein purpura are frequently associated with microbial infections. Some of those infectious agents bear α-galactosyl residues on their cell surface. These observations prompted us to determine, by passive hemagglutination, the titers of natural anti-galactosyl antibodies in the serum of children presenting with Henoch–Schönlein purpura (10 cases) or IgA nephropathy (7 cases). Antibody titers of normal subjects (103 cases), children with a pharyngitis of unknown etiology (7 cases), and children exhibiting mesangial IgA deposits but no hematuria {{at the time of}} testing (6 cases) ranged from 1 : 20 to 1 : 80. Elevated titers (> 1 : 80) were observed in nine of 11 patients with mesangial IgA deposits and micro- or macroscopic hematuria, in nine of 19 children with other evolutive glomerular diseases (5 cases of acute glomerulonephritis and 4 cases of minimal change disease), and in most subjects presenting with a M. pneumoniae (4 / 5 cases) or a E. Coli (4 / 5 cases) infection. Antibody titers decreased after incubation of normal and pathological sera with D-galactose (10 mM) or with α-galactosyl-glucoside (10 mM), but not with D-glucose (10 mM). The anti-α-galactosyl antibodies purified, by affinity chromatography, from sera of 10 normal children, 10 pathological controls and four children with mesangial IgA deposits without hematuria belonged to IgG class.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{evolution of}} peridotites and felsic rocks included in or adjacent to them, and fluids during the hydrothermal alteration of these rocks {{is the subject}} of this study. Experiments using a flow-through hydrothermal apparatus, and studies of natural samples from the JM Asbestos chrysotile deposit in the Asbestos ophiolite, Quebec, were the means by which the various topics of this thesis were investigated. Open-system fluid-rock interaction was studied by flowing deionized water or a 0. 1 m CaCl 2 solution through olivine (Fo 91) and lherzolite at a temperature of 300 °C and a pressure of 300 bars. During these experiments, the original minerals (olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene) were altered to an assemblage, which consisted of serpentine-group minerals (conical, polygonal, and cylindrical fibers, and plates), brucite and magnetite. Reaction of lherzolite with deionized water and thermodynamic modelling indicate that the highest pH and calcium concentration are attained when pyroxenes are present in the unaltered rock, and that these parameters are at maximum in the presence of the buffering assemblage serpentine + brucite + diopside. Alteration of olivine by 0. 1 m CaCl 2 aqueous solution does not lead to the formation of secondary calcium phases. These results, supported by thermodynamic calculations, suggest that calcium-rich fluids can circulate through forsteritic olivine-rich lithologies without inducing calcium metasomatism. In the JM Asbestos mine, these Si-Al lithologies are largely felsic dykes, which, based on geological relationships, are interpreted to have been emplaced after serpentinization of the host peridotites began, but before obduction of the Asbestos ophiolite onto the Laurentian continental margin. Slates underlying and in thrust contact with serpentinite are also locally rodingitized. Mass balance calculations suggest that the calcium responsible for the rodingitization of the slates may have been derived locally, whereas the calcium responsible for the rodingitization of the felsic dykes was most probably derived from a source remote from the dykes. The strong dilution in rodingites and <b>nephrites</b> of the low-solubility minor and traces elements P, Cr and Zr suggests that very large amounts of fluids were involved in calc-silicate metasomatism of the felsic dykes and adjacent serpentinites. The absence of CO 2 and presence of hydrocarbons (alkanes from methane to pentane) in the fluid inclusions of both episodes is an indication that the fluids responsible for calc-silicate alteration were derived from the serpentinites.

[...] As [...] "quetzal" [...] jade, bright green jadeite from Guatemala was treasured by Mesoamerican cultures, and as [...] "kingfisher" [...] jade, vivid green rocks from Burma became the preferred stone of post-1800 Chinese imperial scholars and rulers.

30|$|Similar to {{the results}} {{observed}} in soil, Cr contents were highest in Berseem {{in comparison to the}} other metals (Fig.  1). Maximum amount of Cr was found in Berseem samples from Site II (43.43  mg/kg) and minimum content was observed at Site III (25.92  mg/kg). Cr contents were alarmingly higher than the maximum permissible limits for fodder set by Tolerance Limit of Heavy Metals for Feed of China (CERSPC 2009) in all the samples (Table  3). Cr content above the permissible limits can cause deleterious effects on plant physiological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration (Ahmad et al. 2013). Although trace amounts of Cr is required for glucose metabolism in animals, but Cr overdose can cause liver necrosis, <b>nephrites,</b> gastrointestinal irritation and ulcers (coetaneous, nasal and mucous membrane) (Edwards and Gregory 1991; ATSDR 2000). The contents of Cu and Cd ranged from 13.67 to 21.35 and 0.15 – 0.37  mg/kg respectively. Cu is an important element for plant nutrition but Cd despite being a non-essential element in plants gets highly accumulated in plants (Nadian 2004). Excess amount of Cd in animal fodder can result in renal tubule damage, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, ostomalacia and deleterious effects on calcium, phosphorous and bone metabolism (Katole et al. 2013). Co contents were found to be maximum at Site IV (1.07  mg/kg) and minimum at Site III (0.62  mg/kg) which can be due to minimum and maximum levels of Co at the same sites in soil samples. Pb contents ranged from 2.5 to 4.33  mg/kg which is found to be close to the maximum permissible limit of 5  mg/kg (Table  3) at Site II (4.33  mg/kg). Pb at high levels decreases root expansion by restricting cell division and elongation in plants. Excess amounts of Pb in animal fodder can cause acute or chronic poisoning in animals leading to decreased haemoglobin synthesis, neurobehavioral impairment, peripheral neuropathy reproductive effects and neurotoxic malfunctioning in infants (Allcroft and Blaxter 1950). In Punjab lower levels of Cr and Cd and higher level of Pb in Berseem were observed by Dheri et al. (2007). Very high levels of Pb (102 – 383  mg/kg) were observed in fodder feed to animals in industrial areas of Punjab by Sidhu et al. (1994) which resulted in Pb toxicity (blood) in bovine animals. Heavy metal toxicity (Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn etc.) in animals due to contaminated fodder has been observed by many researchers in other parts of India also (Dey et al. 2011; Gowda et al. 2003; Raj et al. 2006). Therefore the Berseem fodder from the studied areas was contaminated with heavy metals due to combined effect of several anthropogenic factors (such as pollution of irrigation water, excessive use of agrochemicals, etc.) and is a serious cause of concern for animal health.|$|R
