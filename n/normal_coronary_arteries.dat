40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{evaluated}} the magnitude, patterns and clinical correlates of atherosclerosis in angiographically “normal” reference segments in patients undergoing transcatheter therapy for symptomatic <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease. Background. Pathologic {{studies indicate that}} the extent of coronary atherosclerosis is underestimated by visual analysis of angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> segments. Intravascular ultrasound allows detailed, high quality cross-sectional imaging of the <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> in vivo. Methods. Intravascular ultrasound was used to study angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> reference segments in 884 patients evaluated for transcatheter therapy for symptomatic native <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease. The reference segment was the most visually normal intravascular ultrasound cross section within 10 mm proximal to the target lesion but distal to any major side branch. Results are presented as mean value ± 1 SD. Results. Only 60 (6. 8 %) of 884 angiographically normal reference segments were normal by intravascular ultrasound. Reference segment percent cross-sectional narrowing measured 51 ± 13 % and correlated poorly with the target lesion percent cross-sectional narrowing (r = 0. 166, p < 0. 0001). Reference segments contained less calcific and dense fibrotic plaque and proportionately more soft plaque elements. Independent predictors of reference segment percent cross-sectional narrowing were male gender, patient age, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and presence of multivessel disease. Independent predictors of reference segment calcification were patient age and serum creatinine levels. Reference segment percent cross-sectional narrowing in 723 patients undergoing transcatheter therapy {{was similar to that}} in patients studied for diagnostic purposes; however, reference segment arc of calcium was greater in treated patients (43 ± 81 vs. 25 ± 57, p = 0. 015). Reference segment disease was not an independent predictor of subsequent angiographic restenosis or clinical events within 12 months of follow-up. Conclusions. Atherosclerosis is ubiquitous in angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> reference segments. Reference segment disease parallels the severity of target lesion disease and is associated with many of the conventional risk factors for <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease. Because of its sensitivity in detecting atherosclerosis in angiographically normal reference segments, intravascular ultrasound should enhance the study of risk factors for atherosclerosis and the results of therapies to control disease progression...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Circulating matrix {{metalloproteinase}} (MMP) - 2, - 3 and - 9 {{are well}} recognized in predicting cardiovascular outcome in <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease (CAD), but their risks for {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) are lacking. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether circulating MMP levels could independently predict future kidney disease progression in non-diabetic CAD patients. METHODS: The prospective study enrolled 251 non-diabetic subjects referred for <b>coronary</b> angiography, containing <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> (n =  30) and CAD with insignificant (n =  95) and significant (n =  126) stenosis. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD-EPI formula. eGFR decline rate was calculated and the primary endpoint was a decline in eGFR over 25 % from baseline. RESULTS: The eGFR decline rate (ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2) per year) in patients with CAD (1. 22 [- 1. 27, 1. 05]) was greater than that in those with <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> (0. 21 [- 2. 63, 0. 47], P 20 % in eGFR from baseline or final eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2).

TIMI frame count method was used for SCF diagnosis.

All data were compared between two groups. Results: TIMI frame counts of left anterior descending artery, circumflex and right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> were significantly higher in CSF group (p< 0. 01). There were significant decrease in early and late diastolic maximum filling rates (E/A) (p< 0. 01), and significant prolongation at early deceleration time (p< 0. 01) on conventional echocardiography in CSF group. The tissue Doppler parameters which have been measured from the four region of mitral annulus were as follows: the mean Em velocity and mean Em/Am ratio were significantly lower in CSF patients (p< 0. 01), and mean Am velocity were significantly higher (p< 0. 01). E/Em, a non-invasive predictor of left ventricular filling pressures, is similar in both groups.

Intravenous dipyridamole is a potent coro-nary vasodilator that has been extensively investigated {{over the past several}} years in the non-invasive assessment of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. On the other hand, the ability of dipyridamole to provoke coronary artery spasm in patients with variant angina and angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> is less well known. Although the mechanisms of dipyridamole-induced coronary artery spasm remain unclear, this ‘false-positive ’ test response in patients with <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> can be induced by dipyridamole 3, 4 or by aminophylline. 5, 6 Aminophylline is a dipyri-damole antidote, routinely infused at the end of the test, which produces an abrupt withdrawal of coronary artery vasodilatation which may trigger coronary artery spasms in patients with variant angina. Fujita et al. 7 found a sensitivity of 69 % (11 of 16) for dipyridamole echocardiography in patients with coronary artery spasm and normal or nearly <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Sicari et al. 1 and Marwick 2 do not mention the ability of dipyridamole echocardiography to provoke coronary artery spasm in patients with normal or near <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> and variant angina.

So this study aimed at assessing the value of slow runoff in predicting CMD. Results: We studied 38 consecutive pts with angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> that underwent non-invasive assessement of CFR in the LAD. We found that 9 pts out of 38 (group 1) had slow runoff and the remaining 29 had normal runoff (group 2). The CFR evaluated in the the 2 groups was not significantly different (see graph). CFR was infact, in the group 1 (Mean +/- SD) = 2, 79 +/- 0, 8 and in the group 2 = 2, 89 +/- 0, 7 (p= ns). In addition considering a CFR value =< 2, 5 as index of coronary microcirculatory dysfunction, we found CMD in 3 pts of group 1 (33 %) and in 8 pts of group 2 (27 %) (p=ns). The calculated sensitivity and specificity of slow runoff in predicting CMD was at 44 % and 64 % respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe {{connection}} of the coronary vasculature to the aorta {{is one of}} the last essential steps of cardiac development. However, little is known about the signaling events that promote <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> formation. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway regulates multiple aspects of endothelial cell biology but has not been specifically implicated in coronary vascular development. BMP signaling is tightly regulated by numerous factors, including BMP-binding endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER), which can both promote and repress BMP signaling activity. In the embryonic heart, BMPER expression is limited to the endothelial cells and the endothelial-derived cushions, suggesting that BMPER may play a role in coronary vascular development. Histological analysis of BMPER−/− embryos at early embryonic stages demonstrates that commencement of coronary plexus differentiation is normal and that endothelial apoptosis and cell proliferation are unaffected in BMPER−/− embryos compared with wild-type embryos. However, analysis between embryonic days 15. 5 – 17. 5 reveals that, in BMPER−/− embryos, <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> are either atretic or connected distal to the semilunar valves. In vitro tubulogenesis assays indicate that isolated BMPER−/− endothelial cells have impaired tube formation and migratory ability compared with wild-type endothelial cells, suggesting that these defects may lead to the observed <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> anomalies seen in BMPER−/− embryos. Additionally, recombinant BMPER promotes wild-type ventricular endothelial migration in a dose-dependent manner, with a low concentration promoting and high concentrations inhibiting migration. Together, these results indicate that BMPER-regulated BMP signaling is critical for coronary plexus remodeling and <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> development...|$|R
