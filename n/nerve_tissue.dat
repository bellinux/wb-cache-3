5|$|Neuroblastoma (NB) {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that forms in certain types of <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue.</b> It most {{frequently}} starts from one of the adrenal glands, but can also develop in the neck, chest, abdomen, or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{three main}} {{characteristics}} of MS are {{the formation of}} lesions in {{the central nervous system}} (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown of <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue</b> and in turn the signs and symptoms of the disease. Additionally, MS is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes. Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system.|$|E

40|$|In this work, it {{is shown}} that the {{microwave}} radiation emitted from third generation cellu-lar phones causes clearly detectable physical changes on muscle and <b>nerve</b> <b>tissues.</b> The changes, caused by a warming effect, are shown to be larger than those measured previously, and relatively independent of many paramaters related to the transmission of radio signal. The results show {{that in addition to}} <b>nerve</b> <b>tissues,</b> cell phones are, in general, deterious to mus-cles. Although the results are yet to be con-firmed with clinical studies, it is probable that cellular phones are dangerous to a formerly un-predictable extent. ...|$|R
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue</b> in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E
25|$|The {{superstructure}} of {{a conduit}} or scaffold {{is important for}} simulating in vivo conditions for <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue</b> formation. The extracellular matrix, which is mainly responsible for directing tissue growth and formation, has a complex superstructure created by many interwoven fibrous molecules. Ways of forming artificial superstructure {{include the use of}} thermo-responsive hydrogels, longitudinally oriented channels, longitudinally oriented fibers, stretch-grown axons, and nanofibrous scaffolds.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the nerve}} {{autograft}} include the allograft and the xenograft. In allografts, the tissue for the graft {{is taken from}} another person, the donor, and implanted in the recipient. Xenografts involve taking donor tissue from another species. Allografts and xenografts have the same disadvantages as autografts, but in addition, tissue rejection from immune responses {{must also be taken}} into account. Often immunosuppression is required with these grafts. Disease transmission also becomes a factor when introducing tissue from another person or animal. Overall, allografts and xenografts do not match the quality of outcomes seen with autografts, but they are necessary when {{there is a lack of}} autologous <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue.</b>|$|E

40|$|Chemokines were {{originally}} {{identified as a}} family of small proteins having chemoattractive activities on inflammatory cells. Various chemokines are constitutively or inducibly expressed {{in the brain and}} are involved in physiological or pathological nerve functions [1, 2]. In brain ischemia, head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases, the expression of brain chemokines is altered, which modulates neu-roinflammation and the repair process of damaged <b>nerve</b> <b>tissues</b> [3]. Astrocytes are one of the chemokine-producing cells in the brain. Immunohistochemical observations on damaged <b>nerve</b> <b>tissues</b> showed that production of brain chemokines, including CCL 2 /monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and CXCL 1 /cytokine-induced neutro-phil chemoattractant- 1 (CINC- 1), increased in astrocytes [4 - 6].

25|$|A {{possible}} {{method for}} mind uploading is serial sectioning, {{in which the}} brain tissue and perhaps {{other parts of the}} nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer, which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome, thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections. The exposed surface of frozen <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue</b> would be scanned and recorded, and then the surface layer of tissue removed. While this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process, research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections. The scans would then be analyzed, and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into.|$|E
25|$|A highly publicised {{extension}} to the experiment, {{in which a}} simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick's wife—with the ultimate aim of one day creating a form of telepathy or empathy using the Internet to communicate the signal from afar—was also successful in-so-far as it resulted in the first direct and purely electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans. Finally, {{the effect of the}} implant on Warwick's hand function was measured using the University of Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). It was feared that directly interfacing with the nervous system might cause some form of damage or interference, but no measurable effect nor rejection was found. Indeed, <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue</b> grew around the electrode array, enclosing the sensor.|$|E
25|$|Neurotoxins are toxins {{that are}} {{poisonous}} or destructive to <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue</b> (causing neurotoxicity). Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue. The term {{can also be}} used to classify endogenous compounds, which, when abnormally contacted, can prove neurologically toxic. Though neurotoxins are often neurologically destructive, their ability to specifically target neural components is important in the study of nervous systems. Common examples of neurotoxins include lead, ethanol (drinking alcohol), manganese glutamate, nitric oxide , botulinum toxin (e.g. Botox), tetanus toxin, and tetrodotoxin. Some substances such as nitric oxide and glutamate are in fact essential for proper function of the body and only exert neurotoxic effects at excessive concentrations.|$|E

25|$|Aragonite {{scaffolds}} {{have recently}} been shown to support the growth of neurons from rat hippocampi. Shany et al. (2006) proved that aragonite matrices can support the growth of astrocytic networks in vitro and in vivo. Thus, aragonite scaffolds may be useful for <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue</b> repair and regeneration. It is hypothesized that aragonite-derived Ca2+ is essential for promoting cell adherence and cell–cell contact. This is probably carried out through the help of Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecules such as cadherins. Aragonite crystalline matrices have many advantages over hydrogels. They have larger pores, which allows for better cell growth, and the material is bioactive {{as a result of}} releasing Ca2+, which promotes cell adhesion and survival. In addition, the aragonite matrices have higher mechanical strength than hydrogels, allowing them to withstand more pressure when pressed into an injured tissue.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the cell}} membrane, {{cholesterol}} also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol {{is essential for}} the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrin-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using methyl beta cyclodextrin (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue.</b> For many neuron fibers, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. Demyelination (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed {{to be part of the}} basis for multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Surgery {{can be done}} in case a {{peripheral}} nerve has become cut or otherwise divided. This is called peripheral nerve reconstruction. The injured nerve is identified and exposed so that normal <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue</b> can be examined above and below the level of injury, usually with magnification, using either loupes or an operating microscope. If a large segment of nerve is harmed, as can happen in a crush or stretch injury, the nerve will need to be exposed over a larger area. Injured portions of the nerve are removed. The cut nerve endings are then carefully reapproximated using very small sutures. The nerve repair must be covered by healthy tissue, which {{can be as simple as}} closing the skin or it can require moving skin or muscle to provide healthy padded coverage over the nerve. The type of anesthesia used depends on the complexity of the injury. A surgical tourniquet is almost always used.|$|E
50|$|A third hypothesis, based {{primarily}} on molecular genetics, views the Placozoa as highly simplified eumetazoans. According to this, Trichoplax adhaerens is descended from considerably more complex animals that already had muscles and <b>nerve</b> <b>tissues.</b> Both tissue types, {{as well as the}} basal lamina of the epithelium, were accordingly lost more recently by radical secondary simplification.|$|R
30|$|Amputation neuromas (ANs) are {{reactive}} hyperplasia of <b>nerve</b> <b>tissues</b> {{that occur}} after a trauma or surgery involving the peripheral nerves.

We report {{the case of a}} patient with AN near the remnant stomach who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.|$|R
30|$|ANs, {{also known}} as {{traumatic}} neuromas, occur after a trauma or surgery involving the peripheral nerves. ANs are reactive hyperplasia of <b>nerve</b> <b>tissues,</b> rather than true neoplasms, and usually occur at the proximal end of severed nerves [1, 2]. Theoretically, any nerve that is encased by Schwann cells and whose continuities have been disrupted may subsequently form ANs [2].|$|R
25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon expansion chamber, linear motion table, stepper motor and controller. The <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue</b> culture is placed within the expansion chamber with a port for gas exchange and a removable stretching frame, which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus stretch their axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{produced}} the first vaccine for rabies by growing {{the virus in}} rabbits, and then weakening it by drying the affected <b>nerve</b> <b>tissue.</b> The rabies vaccine was initially created by Emile Roux, a French doctor and a colleague of Pasteur, who had produced a killed vaccine using this method. The vaccine had been tested in 50 dogs before its first human trial. This vaccine was used on 9-year-old Joseph Meister, on July 6, 1885, after the boy was badly mauled by a rabid dog. This was done at some personal risk for Pasteur, since {{he was not a}} licensed physician and could have faced prosecution for treating the boy. After consulting with physicians, he decided {{to go ahead with the}} treatment. Over 11 days, Meister received 13 inoculations, each inoculation using viruses that had been weakened for a shorter period of time. Three months later he examined Meister and found that he was in good health. Pasteur was hailed as a hero and the legal matter was not pursued. Analysis of his laboratory notebooks shows that Pasteur had treated two people before his vaccination of Meister. One survived but may not actually have had rabies, and the other died of rabies. Pasteur began treatment of Jean-Baptiste Jupille on October 20, 1885, and the treatment was successful. Later in 1885, people, including four children from the United States, went to Pasteur's laboratory to be inoculated. In 1886, he treated 350 people, of which only one developed rabies. The treatment's success laid the foundations for the manufacture of many other vaccines. The first of the Pasteur Institutes was also built on the basis of this achievement.|$|E
