40|$|The {{possibility}} of obtaining a detailed {{picture of the}} electronic structure makes surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) eminently suitable for bridging {{the gap between the}} chemical, physical, optical and electrical properties of semiconductors. In SPS, changes in band bending (both at the free semiconductor surface and at buried interfaces) are monitored as a function of external illumination. Surface photovoltage spectroscopy can provide detailed, quantitative information on bulk properties (e. g. bandgap and type, carrier diffusion length and lifetime) and can be used for complete construction of surface and interface band diagrams, including the measurement of energy levels in quantum structures. A particular strength is that a comprehensive analysis of surface and bulk defect state distributions and properties is made possible. Measurements using SPS are contactless and <b>non-destructive.</b> In <b>addition,</b> they can be performed both in situ and ex situ, at any reasonable temperature, on any semiconducting material, at any ambient and at any lateral resolution down to the atomic scale. This review starts with an overview of SPS-related surface and interface theory, describes the SPS experimental set-up and presents applications for surface and interface characterization {{of a wide variety of}} materials and structures, cross-correlating them wit...|$|R
40|$|The new LINAC 4 at CERN will {{accelerate}} H- particles to 160 MeV {{and allow}} high brightness proton beam transfers to the Proton Synchrotron Booster, via a charge-exchange injection scheme. This paper describes the conceptual {{design of a}} laser system proposed for transverse profile and emittance measurements based on photon detachment of electrons from the H- ions. The binding energy of the outer electron is only 0. 75 eV and can easily be stripped with a laser beam. Measuring the electron signal as function of the laser position allows the transverse beam profile to be reconstructed. A downstream dipole {{can also be used}} to separate the laser neutralized H 0 atoms from the main H- beam. By imaging these H 0 atoms as a function of laser position the transverse emittance can be reconstructed in the same way as in traditional slit-and-grid systems. By properly dimensioning the laser power and spot size, this method results in negligible beam losses and is therefore <b>non-destructive.</b> In <b>addition,</b> the absence of material intercepting the H- beam allows the measurement of a full power H- beam. This paper will focus on the general design and integration of both the laser and H 0 detector systems...|$|R
40|$|Metals and alloys, when {{subjected}} to tensile loading beyond a limiting value, can undergo plastic deformation resulting in lattice defects such as voids and dislocations. These imperfections may {{interact with the}} crystal lattice, producing a higher state of internal stresses characterized by reduced ductility. Residual stresses can also be generated in welded structures due to rapid rate of solidification, and dissimilar metallurgical microstructures between the weld and the base metals. Premature failures can be experienced in engineering metals and alloys due {{to the presence of}} these residual stresses. Specific thermal treatments commonly known as stress relief operations can relieve these internal stresses. This project is focused on the evaluation of residual stresses by the state-of-the-art destructive and <b>non-destructive</b> techniques.

These tools included fruit quality evaluation through physical, chemical and sensorial parameters and post-harvest storage evaluation. The {{development of a}} feasible method for an early testing of peach selections generated in breeding programs is also well described together with {{the discussion of the}} inheritance of the main fruit quality traits in peach. In <b>addition,</b> <b>non-destructive</b> evaluation methods such as near-infrared, electronic nose and non-destructive impact response were revised. Finally several strategies for the development of molecular marker associated to fruit traits were also revised. Methodologies for the analysis of marker-assisted selection include the use of mapping populations segregating for desired characters. To date, twenty five monogenic genes and QTLs have been mapped in different peach genetic linkage maps. Other markers being used included expressed sequences tags (ESTs) cloned gene analogs (CGAs) and single point mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs).

30|$|Biomarkers of eco-neurotoxicity include {{parameters}} reacting {{specifically to}} neurotoxic chemicals. The most well-known biomarker of effect for neurotoxicity is {{the measurement of}} AChE inhibition. This is the primary mechanism of action of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. Enzyme activity is quantified in brain or whole-body homogenates of exposed organisms, and compared to reference inhibitors, as has been shown, e.g. for zebrafish embryos [215], fish [216] and Daphnia magna [217]. In <b>addition,</b> <b>non-destructive</b> measurement of cholinesterase is possible, e.g. by determining butyrylcholinesterase in blood serum [218, 219]. Alternatively, commercially available isolated AChE {{can be used to}} test chemicals and complex environmental mixtures such as water samples. The tests applied are typically based on the Ellman assay [220], which is a colorimetric assay that detects the hydrolysis of the substrate acetylthiocholine. Despite its wide application in water quality assessment, the assay using isolated AChE should be used with caution because concentrations of organic matter as low as 2 mgC/L, when present in solid-phase extracts of typical surface water, can act as non-specific inhibitor of AChE [221]. This can lead to an overestimation of insecticidal activity in ambient samples. The application of cholinesterase biomarkers for environmental monitoring has been reviewed by Mineau [222].|$|R
40|$|International audienceOn {{the shop}} floor, as in laboratories, {{destructive}} testing remains the main means of quality control of spot welds. After hand or mechanized weld destruction, the so-called "plug diameter" is measured {{and is usually}} considered a good indicator of the weld quality. However, {{it turns out that}} the "plug" failure of spot welds is far from being the rule. Moreover, fracture may occur in different zones of the weld, leading to very different meanings of the plug diameter. Therefore, the plug diameter is most of the time not well-correlated with the weld strength, which is the main value of the spot weld. Partial or full interfacial failures (through the weld nugget) exhibit equivalent mechanical strengths and therefore should not be rejected. Through this work, it is shown that the failure type depends on various parameters (nugget diameter, sheet thickness, loading mode, [...] .), and consequently, it is not an intrinsic property of the steel grade. In this way, recommended quality criteria are based on weld strength, weld diameter (including the interfacial fracture area if any), or absorbed energy independently of failure occurrence.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technology capable of producing high-resolution, cross-sectional images through inhomogeneous samples, such as biological tissue. It has been widely adopted in clinical ophthalmology {{and a number of}} other clinical applications are in active research. Other applications of OCT include material characterization and <b>non-destructive</b> testing. In <b>addition</b> to current uses, OCT has a potential for a much wider range of applications and further commercialization. One of the reasons for slow penetration of OCT in clinical and industrial use is probably the cost and the size of the current systems. Current commercial and research OCT systems are fiber/free space optics based. Although fiber and micro-optical components have made these systems portable, further significant miniaturization and cost reduction could be achieved through the use of integrated photonic components. We demonstrate a Michelson interferometer using integrated photonic waveguides on nanophotonic silicon on insulator platform. The size of the interferometer is 1500 mu m x 50 mu m. The structure has been tested using a mirror as a reflector. We can achieve 40 mu m axial resolution and 25 dB sensitivity which can be substantially improved...|$|R

These imperfections {{interact with the}} crystal lattice, producing a higher state of internal stress, also known as residual stress, which {{can be associated with}} reduced ductility. Residual stresses are also generated in welded structures due to rapid solidification and resultant dissimilar metallurgical microstructures between the weld and the base metals. Development of these internal stresses is often influenced by incompatible permanent strain resulting from thermal and mechanical operations associated with welding and plastic deformation.

This project is focused on the evaluation of residual stresses in target structural materials by the state-of-the-art destructive and <b>non-destructive</b> techniques.

In vivo 13 C NMR provided information on the total seed oil content and fatty acid composition of the major storage lipids in a <b>non-destructive</b> manner. In <b>addition,</b> a number of monoterpenes were identified in the 13 C NMR spectra of conifer seeds containing oleoresin; these compounds showed marked variabil-ity in individual seeds of Pacific silver fir within the same seed lot.

The free amino acids arginine and asparagine, generated as a result of storage protein mobilization, were detected in vivo during seed germination and early seedling growth. The potential for NMR to profile metabolites in a non-destructive manner in single conifer seeds and seed populations is discussed. It is a powerful tool to evaluate seed quality because of its ability to assess reserve accumulation during seed development or at seed maturity; it {{can also be used to}} monitor reserve mobilization, which is critical for seedling emergence...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{procedure}} for estimation of effective modulus of a multilayered {{hot mix asphalt}} (HMA) pavement using intelligent compaction (IC) is investigated. The study is conducted during {{the construction of an}} interstate highway (I- 35) in Norman, OK. A complete coverage of the level of compaction of each of the asphalt pavement layers was recorded using the intelligent asphalt compaction analyzer (IACA). The collected IACA data allow determination of the level of compaction (density) at any selected location, for each layer, and provided a set of global positioning system (GPS) coordinates. Calibration procedures have previously been tested and validated by the authors to estimate the density of different types of pavements from IACA data. In this paper, a different calibration procedure is used to measure the dynamic modulus instead of the density of a pavement using IACA. Considering the IACA estimated density, the dynamic modulus of each of the selected locations for an individual pavement layer was measured from laboratory developed master curves. Thereafter, an effective modulus of the three-layer pavement system was calculated for all of the selected locations using Odemark's method. The proposed technique was verified by conducting falling-weight deflectometer (FWD) tests at these selected locations. Analyses of the results show that the proposed intelligent compaction technique may be promising in estimating the effective modulus of the pavement layers in a <b>non-destructive</b> manner. In <b>addition,</b> the Witczak model was used to estimate moduli of each of the pavement layers. The comparison of the Witczak model with FWD revealed that the model over-predicted the modulus significantly...|$|R

Of these non-conducting materials, biomolecules such as cells, organelles, proteins, and nucleic acids are of interest as we seek to describe laws of nature and life. However, it is not trivial to resolve structures or mechanics of biomolecules due to their small sizes and soft constructions. AFM enables one to obtain high-resolution images of biological structures in their native state both in air and in fluids as AFM is considered as a <b>non-destructive</b> technique. In <b>addition</b> to these advantages, AFM is providing the mechanical information of the sample surface. For these reasons, since the development of AFM, an expansion and re-assessment has led to significant discoveries and scientific enlightenment in biology. In this dissertation, I focus on the application of AFM to biological systems, which will add new scores {{in the field of}} both microscopy as well as a higher understanding of specific biological systems. I have explored the mechanical properties of mammalian cells and bacterial cells. I have examined mammalian cell stiffness in relation to cancer metastasis and the changes in extracellular biofilm adhesions from bacterial cells. I have resolved the high-resolution structure of exosomes which are 50 - 120 nm sized vesicles secreted from mammalian cells. With an accurate adjustment of the force applied to the sample, I have been able to observe and verify nanofilaments attached to exosomes.

40|$|Intermolecular {{interactions}} have {{a critical}} role in determining the molecular packing and orientation of conjugated polymers and organic molecules, leading to significant changes in their electrical and optical properties. Herein, we investigated the effects of intermolecular interactions of electron-donating small molecules on their structural, optical, and electrical properties, as well as on their performance in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A series of dithienosilole-based small molecule donors were synthesized by introducing different terminal groups of ester and amide groups combined with three different versions of alkyl side chains. In comparison to dithienosilole-based small molecules with ester terminal groups, those with amide terminal groups exhibit strong intermolecular interaction by hydrogen bonding in a <b>non-destructive</b> manner. In <b>addition,</b> in order to control the intermolecular distance during assembly and thus fine-tune the interaction between the small molecule donors, three different alkyl side chains (i. e., n-octyl, n-decyl, and 2 -ethylhexyl chains) were introduced into both small molecules with amide and ester terminal groups. The molecular packing and orientation of the small molecule donors were dramatically changed upon modifying the terminal groups and the alkyl side chains, as evidenced by grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) measurements. This feature significantly affected the electrical properties of the small molecules in OFETs. The trends in the activation energies for charge transport and the hole mobilities in OFETs were consistent with the molecular ordering and orientation propensity. In addition, the nano-scale morphology of small molecules blended with [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was also influenced by the intermolecular interaction of small molecule donors. Power conversion efficiencies of more than 4. 3 % in OPVs were obtained from dithienosilole-based small molecules with ester terminal groups and linear side chains due to the optimized intermolecular interaction and morphology of the active layer. close 2...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of {{existing}} reinforced concrete structure entails {{a series of}} steps, among which {{the evaluation of the}} mechanical properties of concrete can be considered a corner-stone. To this end, direct compression tests on cores extracted directly from a structure provide the most reliable estimation of the strength. Unfortunately, the number of cores usually accepted is often limited because the method is expensive and invasive. For this reason, non-destructive (ND) methods are mostly used, whose results are usually calibrated using a limited number of destructive tests, to provide some preliminary information about the homogeneity of the investigated concrete and possibly to suggest zones where to extract other cores. In <b>addition,</b> <b>non-destructive</b> tests may be used to enlarge the database for the estimation of concrete strength. The main drawback in using this approach is that a correlation formula between the in situ measures and concrete strength is required. In many cases, such formula cannot be easily generalized and must be restricted every time based on pairs of indirect and direct measures of strength. Moreover, the use of different experimental techniques (destructive and non-destructive) provides information with different reliability, and the results are thus difficult to combine. For these reasons, in this paper, a technique based on Bayesian inference is proposed to combine in a rational manner the results of direct and indirect measures, providing the probabilistic distribution of the concrete strength and some significant properties such as the median and characteristic value. In this paper, the proposed methodology is developed by considering the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) technique, {{one of the most popular}} non-destructive methods employed for the evaluation of concrete strength, although it may be easily extended to other types of in situ measures. To validate the proposed method, two real cases, for which experimental data are available, are analyzed and discussed. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{contend that}} {{composite}} repairs (or structural reinforcement doublers) offer numerous advantages over metallic patches including corrosion resistance, light weight, high strength, elimination of rivets, and time savings in installation. Their use in commercial aviation has been stifled by uncertainties surrounding their application, subsequent inspection and long-term endurance. The process of repairing or reinforcing airplane structures is time consuming {{and the design}} is dependent upon an accompanying stress and fatigue analysis. A repair that is too stiff {{may result in a}} loss of fatigue life, continued growth of the crack being repaired, and the initiation of a new flaw in the undesirable high stress field around the patch. Uncertainties in load spectrums used to design repairs exacerbates these problems as does the use of rivets to apply conventional doublers. Many of these repair or structural reinforcement difficulties can be addressed through the use of composite doublers. Primary among unknown entities are the effects of non-optimum installations and the certification of adequate inspection procedures. This paper presents on overview of a program intended to introduce composite doubler technology to the US commercial aircraft fleet. In this project, a specific composite application has been chosen on an L- 1011 aircraft in order to focus the tasks on application and operation issues. Through the use of laboratory test structures and flight demonstrations on an in-service L- 1011 airplane, this study is investigating composite doubler design, fabrication, installation, structural integrity, and <b>non-destructive</b> evaluation.

40|$|Three {{different}} mobile Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) core-scanners {{were used}} to measure porosity and permeability of water-saturated drill cores and core plugs in a <b>non-destructive</b> way. In <b>addition</b> to their use in the laboratory, the small and light-weight devices are conveniently shipped, e. g. to drilling platforms. They allow rapid wellsite analysis of large-size cores in a fresh state without prior preparation. The sensors are experimental prototypes and differ in their magnetic field strength and homogeneity. The magnetic field of the NMR-MOUSEÂ® {{is applied to the}} sample from one side and is inhomogeneous within the object. The two Halbach core-scanners enclose the samples in a large cylindrical volume with a nearly homogeneous magnetic field. Besides one-dimensional (1 D) relaxation measurements which can be performed with all sensors, the second version of the Halbach core-scanner is also suitable for two-dimensional (2 D) relaxation measurements on core plugs. 1 D transverse relaxation measurements were made on fully cylindrical and split, semi-cylindrical cores of limestone, sandstone, basalt, peridotite, shale and unconsolidated clay-rich sediments with varying values of porosity, pore size and magnetic susceptibility. Porosity calculated from amplitudes of transverse relaxation measurements with all instruments agrees well with porosity determined by independent methods. Transverse relaxation measurements within the homogeneous magnetic field of the Halbach core-scanners can be used for permeability prediction. In the case of sandstone and limestone samples with high porosity, a standard calculation scheme from NMR logging in the oil industry yields good results. However, standard methods cannot be applied for an accurate permeability prediction for samples with low porosity and small pore sizes associated with high internal magnetic field gradients. Therefore, a new model theory was developed, which describes the pore radius dependence of the surface relaxivity as both an analytical and a more practicable empirical equation. Regarding corrected surface relaxivity values, permeability can be predicted accurately from the logarithmic mean of the T 2 distribution from the physically based Kozeny-Carman equation...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-thin Whitetopping (UTW) {{involves}} {{placing a}} very thin concrete overlay 50 mm to 100 mm thick (2 â- 4 â) on the milled surface of a distressed asphalt pavement. To investigate the performance of UTW placed over a flexible pavement subjected to slow and heavy moving wheel loads, whitetopping mixes were placed over a milled pavement surface in the Accelerated Pavement Testing (APT) facility of the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) Research Division in West Lafayette Indiana {{in the fall of}} 1999. The UTW installation experiment consisted of four test âlanesâ of two different thicknesses; each utilizing plain and fiber reinforced concrete. The test âlanesâ were instrumented using strain gages, Variable Differential Transducers (LVDTs) and thermocouples to measure the strains, deflections, and to monitor the pavement temperatures respectively. The test âlanesâ were subjected to both static and dynamic tandem wheel loads of varying magnitudes. In addition, one of the test âlanesâ was also exposed to thermal load by applying a temperature gradient to the pavement. A mix design for the UTW was developed based on literature survey of previous UTW projects. The mechanical properties of concrete were evaluated in the laboratory before the UTW pavements were constructed at the APT facility. The pavements were monitored continuously during the testing period and the dynamic-load strains during the motion of the wheel, as well as the static strains due to the stationary wheel load were recorded. This data was analyzed to determine the maximum strains and their location, the degree of bonding between the UTW overlay and the underlying asphalt and the pavement performance under repeated loading. In <b>addition,</b> <b>non-destructive</b> test method was utilized to evaluate the pavement condition after the accelerated pavement testing was completed. In addition, cores obtained from the pavement were subjected to shear force to determine the quality of the bond. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed using a general finite element code, ABAQUS, to conduct an analysis of the response of the composite pavement to the wheel loads. The principal goal was to develop a simple and reliable model using reasonable geometry, boundary conditions and material properties, to verify the pavement response observed experimentally.

40|$|The use of geochemical {{analysis}} for characterization studies of archaeological material {{has been increasing}} for decades. In recent years, advancements in X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrumentation have led to hand-held portable XRF (pXRF) instruments capable of on-site, rapid, <b>non-destructive</b> analysis. The <b>addition</b> of pXRF to the archaeologist 2 Ì 7 s toolkit {{has the potential to}} revolutionize geochemical characterization studies as research design can be informed by field analysis, once off-limits museum collections may now be analyzable, and data can be gathered on in-situ objects without disturbing their context. This new instrumentation has shown promise in characterization studies on a variety of archaeological materials, including ceramics. Particularly, it has been shown to generate data useful in distinguishing the geochemical provenance of artifacts. While most existing provenance studies that employ pXRF involve obsidian, it is possible that pXRF is a suitable analytical tool for ceramics as well, since instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and laboratory XRF have both been used in provenance studies of obsidian and ceramics. This thesis reports research that utilized a Bruker hand held pXRF analyzer to study ceramics and plaster floors from Classic Period (ca. AD 250 - 1000) archaeological sites in southeast Mesoamerica. The data gathered from this analysis are used to examine the ability of pXRF to address archaeological questions of archaeological provenance on ceramic material and human activity patterns on archaeological plaster. The data gathered on ceramic material is analyzed to determine if 2 Ì 2 valley profiles 2 Ì 2 (or 2 Ì 2 chemical fingerprints 2 Ì 2) can be created for samples excavated in the same valley and to investigate inter-valley trade. Data from the plaster samples is examined to determine if pXRF can detect human activity patterns on plaster floors and, if so, if the activity is identifiable. The results suggest that, while pXRF results can be used to create 2 Ì 2 valley profiles 2 Ì 2 for provenance research, it is difficult to ascertain if {{it can be used to}} identify items of trade. This investigation also shows that, while pXRF data can identify human activity on plaster, it is difficult to determine what those activities were. This leads to the conclusion that pXRF has potential for both provenance and prospection studies on earthen materials. However, methodological development is necessary to fine tune research design. This thesis contributes to a greater understanding of the potentials and limitations of pXRF instrumentation in characterization studies of archaeological materials as well as understanding cultural-historical details in Classic southeast Mesoamerica...|$|R
