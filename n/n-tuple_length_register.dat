40|$|A {{frequency}} sampling filter {{which is}} a finite impulse response digital filter uses a recursive structure that requires exact pole zero cancellation on the unit circle. When implemented with digital technology, errors due to finite <b>length</b> <b>registers</b> and finite precision arithmetic can prevent exact pole zero cancellation making the filter unstable. To guarantee stability, the poles and zeros on the unit circle are moved to {{a circle of radius}} r where 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1. Most frequency sampling filter design techniques determine optimal frequency responses for r = 1 and then chose a value of r, 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1, near to 1 so that the filter 2 ̆ 7 s frequency response does not differ significantly. Recently, other techniques have been presented that determine optimal frequency responses for 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1. In this paper, the fixed point roundoff noise of Type 1 and Type 2 frequency sampling filters is determined as a function of <b>register</b> <b>length,</b> time and the value of r. An example demonstrates that for a fixed <b>register</b> <b>length</b> and output noise level, a frequency sampling filter designed with 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1 can approximate a linear phase filter better than a frequency sampling filter designed with r = 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{designing}} a digital filter, the coefficients of the transfer function are normally evaluated {{with a high degree}} of accuracy. To implement the designed filter in hardware, finite word <b>length</b> <b>registers</b> have to be utilized. This may bring about truncation of the filter coefficients to the limited word <b>length</b> <b>registers</b> employed, which in turn may affect the total response of the digital filter. To remedy this, filters are designed with the finite word length coefficients. In this thesis a review of existing techniques for the design of integer coefficients 1 -D FIR filters is presented. Where possible extension of these techniques to 2 -D are also presented. In this thesis two design methods for 1 -D and 2 -D FIR filter with integer coefficients based on the suboptimal approach of discretization and reoptimization techniques are presented. These two approaches are somewhat modified versions of the well known branch and bound optimization technique. This thesis also presents a technique for the design of 1 -D and 2 -D FIR filters with integer coefficients using Mixed integer linear programming. Delta modulation is also employed for a new filter structure for 1 -D FIR filter with its coefficients being $-$ 1, 0, and + 1. McClallan transformation is used for designing a class of 2 -D FIR filters with integer coefficients and a suitable realization structure. In this thesis, we also present a comparison of various techniques we have proposed in terms of complexity of the design issue, as well as the computational burden for each iteration.

This study analyzed some aspects of the reproductive biology of Poecilia sphenops from the Emiliano Zapata Reservoir, in Central Mexico. Specimens were collected using a 20 m-long seine with a 5 mm mesh size, from January to December 2006. A total of 581 specimens were collected: 407 females (70. 0 %), 83 males (14. 3 %) and 91 individuals with no differentiated sex (15. 7 %). Fish ranged from 20 to 96 mm in total length and 0. 01 to 13. 07 g in body weight. The female to male sex ratio (4. 9 : 1) deviated significantly from the unity (&# 967; 2 = 214. 2, p< 0. 05).

A uniform ADC, which {{is characterized by a}} sensible phase inaccuracy depending on frequency, is connected to a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor, that is especially affected by a round-off amplitude noise linked to both the FFT <b>register</b> <b>length</b> and samples number. If the <b>register</b> <b>length</b> is equal to 32 bits, then the round-off noise is entirely negligible, else, once bits are reduced to 16, a technique of compensation must occur. In fact, oversampling can be employed within a short time window, reaching a compromise between the needs of limiting the phase inaccuracy due to ADC and not raising too much the number of averaged FFT values sufficient to bound the round-off. Finally, the appendix presents an outline of somewhat lengthy demonstrations needed to calculate the amplitude and especially phase inaccuracies due to the round-off noise of FFT processors.

40|$|Examples of homomeric β-helices and β-barrels have {{recently}} emerged. Here we generalise the theory for the shear number in β-barrels to encompass β-helices and homomeric structures. We introduce {{the concept of}} the “β-strip”, the set of parallel or antiparallel neighbouring strands, from which the whole helix can be generated giving it n-fold rotational symmetry. In this context the shear number is interpreted as the sum around the helix of the fixed register shift between neighbouring identical β-strips. Using this approach we have derived relationships between helical width, pitch, angle between strand direction and helical axis, mass per <b>length,</b> <b>register</b> shift, and number of strands. The validity and unifying power of the method is demonstrated with known structures including α-haemolysin, T 4 phage spike, cylindrin, and the HET-s(218 - 289) prion. From reported dimensions measured by X-ray fibre diffraction on amyloid fibrils the relationships can be used to predict the register shift and the number of strands within amyloid protofilaments. This was used to construct models of transthyretin and Alzheimer β(40) amyloid protofilaments that comprise a single strip of in-register β-strands folded into a “β-strip helix”. Results suggest both stabilisation of an individual β-strip helix as well as growth by addition of further β-strip helices involves the same pair of sequence segments associating with β-sheet hydrogen bonding at the same register shift. This association would be aided by a repeat sequence. Hence understanding of how the register shift (as the distance between repeat sequences) relates to helical dimensions, will be useful for nanotube design...|$|R
50|$|User {{programs}} {{are restricted to}} use only a contiguous area of main memory. The portion of memory to which an executing program has access {{is controlled by the}} RA (Relative Address) and FL (Field <b>Length)</b> <b>registers</b> which are not accessible to the user program. When a user program tries to read or write a word in central memory at address a, the processor will first verify that a is between 0 and FL-1. If it is, the processor accesses the word in central memory at address RA+a. This process is known as base-bound relocation; each user program sees core memory as a contiguous block words with length FL, starting with address 0; in fact the program may be anywhere in the physical memory. Using this technique, each user program can be moved ("relocated") in main memory by the operating system, as long as the RA register reflects its position in memory. A user program which attempts to access memory outside the allowed range (that is, with an address which is not less than FL) will trigger an interrupt, and will be terminated by the operating system. When this happens, the operating system may create a core dump which records the contents of the program's memory and registers in a file, allowing the developer of the program a means to know what happened. Note the distinction with virtual memory systems; in this case, the entirety of a process's addressable space must be in core memory, must be contiguous, and its size cannot be larger than the real memory capacity.|$|R

In the specific case of Andalusia (Southern Spain), we are developing a capture-recapture experiment based in the use of PIT-tags in order to obtain information that we lack for the species in the study area. In this communication, we focus on the biology of the species. Firstly, we carried out an ex-situ experiment to check the effect of the PIT-tag on the individuals of the eel. Once we ascertained there were no significant effects in the survival, length, and weight of the marked eels, we proceeded with the study in situ (Guadiaro river). Between October 2014 and July 2015 we captured 1011 eels (539 tagged; 252 recaptured). Approximately 90 % of their lengths were between 16 - 40 cm (minimum 16. 3 cm; maximum 67 cm). Eel’s length in March, April and May was significantly lower than those captured in the rest of months, probably because longer eels migrated before spring and only small eels remained in the population.
