5|$|In all {{versions}} of the tale, after marrying Gautama, Ahalya settles into his ashram (hermitage), which generally becomes the site of her epic curse. The Ramayana records that Gautama's ashram is in a forest (Mithila-upavana) near Mithila, where the couple practices asceticism together for several years. In other scriptures, the ashram is usually <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> bank. The Brahma Purana {{says that it is}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Godavari and the Skanda Purana (701–1200 CE) places it <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Narmada. The Padma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) describe the ashram as near the holy city of Pushkar.|$|E

5|$|Hardee {{was born}} in Lewisham, South East London, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Thames, and came {{from a long line}} of lightermen who earned their living on tugs pulling barges on the river.

Atamasco lily, periwinkle, buttercup, Jack-in-the-pulpit, maypops, and jewelweed are sometimes {{found on the}} banks and in the shallows of Lake Phelps. The Scuppernong River provides a habitat for swamp dogwood, evening primrose, blue flag iris and cardinal flowers. The roughleaf dogwood is also found <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> This particular dogwood is rare in North Carolina and the type along the Scuppernong is rarer still.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided {{to throw a}} feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts decided to create trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> However, they only annoyed them enough that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish sooner than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E
5|$|After {{conferring with}} Desaix and Saint-Cyr at Renchen, Moreau mounted his assault on 9 July 1796. This {{decision}} preempted Archduke Charles, who {{had planned to}} attack the French on the 10th. The French commander planned to pin the Austrians in the Rhine plain while turning their left flank among the mountains of the Black Forest. For his part, Charles hoped to outflank the French left <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> and recapture Gernsbach. Latour held the Austrian right near the Rhine, Sztáray was posted in the center near Malsch, Kaim defended the left-center in the hills along the Alb River and Lindt's Saxons held the far left near Neuenbürg.|$|E

5|$|Although the Rogue Valley near Medford {{is partly}} urban, the average {{population}} {{density of the}} Rogue watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. Many public parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds are <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> which flows largely through forests, including national forests. Biodiversity {{in many parts of}} the basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate coniferous forests, which extend into the southwestern Rogue basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} few routes into hilly central Westchester, {{the river}} and its {{associated}} roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. The young men taunted their rivals, who beat them so severely that two later died. The survivor was awarded a pension, {{believed to be the first}} in U.S. history, by the Continental Congress.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{was largely}} forested in this period; {{widespread}} forest clearance {{did not occur}} in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from {{the vicinity of the}} White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was reported}} along the Florida Panhandle, peaking at over 10inches (254mm) {{in the extreme}} northwestern portion of the state. The rainfall caused the worst flooding in tenyears, and resulted in additional flooding to the already swollen Coldwater Creek and Blackwater River in Santa Rosa County. <b>Near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> 30homes were destroyed with an additional 50houses damaged, totaling about $320,000 (1988USD, $560,000 2007USD) in damage. Several roads were closed from the flooding, as well. The strong convective band associated with Florence extended across the Florida Panhandle, spawning nine tornadoes in Walton County and one waterspout in Bay County. Damage from the tornadoes amounted to about $100,000 (1988USD, $175,000 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{was born}} into the Kikuyu people {{in the village of}} Ngenda, which lay in an area of sugar cane and cattle pasture. His father was named Muigai, and his mother Wambui. They were shamba folk, living in a {{homestead}} built on a spur of land <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Thiririka; they were farmers, raising crops and breeding both sheep and goats. Muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he could afford to keep several wives, each of whom lived in a separate nyom ba (woman's hut).|$|E
5|$|Large {{animals that}} {{frequent}} the park include elk, deer, cougar, and pronghorn. Beaver, otter, mink, and raccoons {{are found in}} or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Coyotes, bats, and badgers are among the park's other mammals. Predators hunt smaller animals such as the rabbits, voles, mice, and shrews found in the park's grasslands and sagebrush-covered hills. Bushy-tailed woodrats inhabit caves and crevices in the monument's rock formations. Bighorn sheep, wiped out in this region in the early 20thcentury, were reintroduced in the Foree Area of the Sheep Rock Unit in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Like Trollope before him, Pope Hennessy took {{rooms at}} The Shannon Hotel, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{and set about}} trying to {{capture the essence of}} the town which had {{inspired}} Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He proved to be a very popular figure in the town, evidenced {{by the fact that he}} was asked to adjudicate at a local beauty pageant and the horse fair. Pope Hennessy gives particular mention to the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work. They sold the hotel in 1977.|$|E

It extends from the Scottish border in the north to <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Trent in the south, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three statistical regions: the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the 2011 Census and an area of 37,331km2 (14,414 sq mi).
