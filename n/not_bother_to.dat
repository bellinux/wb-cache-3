5|$|Vienne and Perez {{scheduled}} {{their race}} for Easter Sunday. The Roman Catholic Church objected to it being {{held on the}} most sacred day of the liturgical year, suggesting that riders would {{not have time to}} attend mass and that spectators might <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> attend either. Tracts were distributed in Roubaix decrying the venture.|$|E
5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E
50|$|In several north Louisiana parishes, {{the main}} {{competition}} in the 1960 general election was between Nixon and the unpledged electors, with the state and nationally victorious Kennedy/Johnson ticket <b>not</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> contest the region.|$|R

Frith produced the album and guested on four of the tracks. The band broke up in 1986.|$|R
5|$|Although Ibn Haukal {{reports the}} sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> occupy the Khazar heartlands {{north of the}} Caucasus Mountains permanently. On {{his way back to}} Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the Ossetians and force them into subservience. Therefore, Khazar {{successor}} statelets continued their precarious existence in the region. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria {{became a}} member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most {{recently}} from 2002 to 2003. Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. Polls carried out seven years after the country's accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from membership, with almost 40% of the population saying they would <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> vote in the 2014 EU elections. Euro-Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism, although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{had long}} seen a Senate seat as a logical next step once he {{concluded}} {{his time as}} governor. Senator Butler, whose term expired in March 1895, had soon after the 1890 election begun to shift his positions towards Tillman's, hoping to retain Conservative backing while appealing to the governor's supporters. The senator signed on to most demands of the Farmers' Alliance, and {{did not support the}} forces trying to prevent Tillman's re-nomination in 1892. Butler's seeming apostasy disheartened Conservatives, who did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> run candidates for the legislature in many counties in 1894, abandoning the field (and Butler's Senate seat) to the Tillmanites. The governor took nothing for granted, seeing to it that popular candidates, loyal to him, ran for the legislature. In addition to electing Tillman to the Senate, these legislators could help preserve his gubernatorial legacy, including the dispensary.|$|E
5000|$|Woodruff went to Harold Weaver, {{head of the}} Berkeley-based lab {{oversight}} committee, to {{tell his}} side of the story. He learned that the group had already investigated, by sending a liaison to meet with Batzel, but had <b>not</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>to</b> talk to Woodruff. He attempted to explain his concerns about the overselling of the technology, but as Weaver later put it, [...] "we were bamboozled by the laboratory".|$|R

5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was {{forfeited}} {{after he was}} caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in {{a change in the}} match score. Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.|$|E
5|$|They reached Laodicea on the Lycus {{early in}} January 1148, {{around the same}} time Otto of Freising's army had been {{destroyed}} in the same area. Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated {{from the rest of the}} army at Mount Cadmus, and Louis’ troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks. Louis himself, according to Odo of Deuil, climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> attack further and the French marched on to Adalia, continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and sail for Antioch. After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.|$|E

50|$|In 1997, Baton bought {{controlling}} interest in CTV, {{and became the}} sole corporate owner of the network later that year after the remaining station owners sold their shares.

25|$|In 2113 a {{referendum}} {{was held in}} which the people were allowed {{to decide whether to}} restore democratic government, but by this time the memory of democracy had become so distant that the majority of citizens did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> vote, and most of those who did opted to retain the status quo.|$|E
25|$|In many locations, the {{inability}} {{to recover from the}} events of the 1980s can still be seen. One building nearly in ruins from the 1985 earthquake stands on Praga Street on the corner of Chapultepec; another is on Londres Street near the Museo de Cera. On Amberes Street, between Londres and Liverpool, {{there are a number of}} tenements, which are not maintained and owners do <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> collect the tenants’ frozen rents.|$|E
25|$|One proclaimed {{a policy}} of {{bilingualism}} which was expressed only by the obligation made to Lithuanians to learn Russian while Russians did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> learn Lithuanian. If the written Lithuanian language {{were more or less}} protected by writers through newspapers and publishers, the spoken Lithuanian language was degraded. Often, in the institutions, it was only a language of oral communication, the greatest part of technical documentation and correspondence being written in Russian.|$|E

5000|$|Micro-buses are {{licensed}} by each governorate as taxicabs, and are generally operated privately by their drivers.

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other segmental scripts. For example, the Meroitic script of ancient Sudan did not indicate an inherent a (one symbol stood for both m and ma, for example), and is thus similar to Brahmic family of abugidas. However, the other vowels were indicated with full letters, not diacritics or modification, so the system was essentially an alphabet that did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> write the most common vowel.|$|E
25|$|The gwageo {{provided}} {{a basis for}} various forms of regionalism. Due {{to the strength of}} regional factions in Joseon Dynasty politics, scholars from out-of-favor factions often did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> take the examination at all. In addition, for much of the dynasty candidates from Hamgyong were forbidden to attempt the gwageo. In the late Joseon Dynasty, an increasing percentage of successful candidates came from the northern province of Pyongan, and the small county of Chŏngju came to produce more successful candidates than any other county.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} North v South matches in 1947, {{involving}} largely makeshift teams, and Playfair did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> report on them.

The second was played at the Leyland Motors Ground in Kingston-upon-Thames from 3 to 5 September and the South won by 4 wickets. The final match was played at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough from 6 to 9 September and was drawn.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, Paige {{assumed the}} {{position}} of deputy sheriff in Jackson County, Missouri, {{with the understanding that}} he need <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> actually come to work in the sheriff's office.

Soon after, he was running for a Missouri state assembly seat {{with the support of the}} local Democratic club against incumbent Representative Leon Jordan. Candidate Paige never gave a speech, and was never taken seriously. Jordan defeated Paige by the margin of 1,870 votes to 382 (83%–17%).|$|E
25|$|Specifically, {{opponents of}} Wilson protested his sale of grazing rights on tribal lands to local white ranchers at too low a rate, {{reducing}} income to the tribe as a whole, whose members held the land communally. They also complained of his land-use decision to lease nearly one-eighth of the reservation's mineral-rich lands to private companies. Some full-blood Lakota complained {{of having been}} marginalized {{since the start of}} the reservation system. Most did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> participate in tribal elections, which led to tensions on all sides. There had been increasing violence on the reservation, which many attributed to Wilson's private militia, Guardians of the Oglala Nation (informally called the GOONs), attacking political opponents to suppress opposition.|$|E
25|$|While in Madras, Peter {{decided to}} officialise his {{relationship}} with Ovtchinnikova. The pair were married in a Danish consulate in September 1939. Aware of his family's disapproval of the relationship, but also possibly wishing {{to take advantage of}} the turmoil created by the recently declared Second World War, the Prince did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> <b>to</b> inform either the Greek royal court or his parents about the marriage. The royal family learned of the mesalliance through the press a few weeks later. Prince George, affronted by his son's decision not to ask him or the King for permission to marry, disowned Peter and henceforward refused contact with him. Despite her own disappointment, however, Princess George remained in touch with her son and continued to regularly send him money.|$|E
