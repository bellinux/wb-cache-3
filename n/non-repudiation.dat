25|$|It is {{important}} to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in <b>non-repudiation</b> efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message and nobody else could have altered it in transit (data integrity). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender himself, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity; and, therefore, the sender may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for <b>non-repudiation).</b>|$|E
25|$|The CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and {{availability}} {{is at the}} heart of information security. (The members of the classic InfoSec triad—confidentiality, integrity {{and availability}}—are interchangeably referred to in the literature as security attributes, properties, security goals, fundamental aspects, information criteria, critical information characteristics and basic building blocks.) There is continuous debate about extending this classic trio. Other principles such as Accountability have sometimes been proposed for addition—it has been pointed out that issues such as <b>non-repudiation</b> do not fit well within the three core concepts.|$|E

2500|$|Cryptography [...] is the {{practice}} and study of techniques for secure communication {{in the presence of}} third parties (called adversaries). More generally, it is about constructing and analyzing protocols that overcome the influence of adversaries and that are related to various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and <b>non-repudiation.</b> Modern cryptography intersects the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.|$|E
2500|$|Cryptography {{provides}} information security with other useful applications as well including improved authentication methods, message digests, digital signatures, <b>non-repudiation,</b> and encrypted network communications. Older less secure {{applications such as}} telnet and ftp are slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as ssh that use encrypted network communications. [...] Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as WPA/WPA2 or the older (and less secure) WEP. Wired communications (such as ITU‑T G.hn) are secured using AES for encryption and X.1035 for authentication and key exchange. Software applications such as GnuPG or PGP {{can be used to}} encrypt data files and Email.|$|E
2500|$|Information {{assurance}} (IA) is {{the practice}} of assuring information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data and the systems and processes used for those purposes. Information assurance includes protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, <b>non-repudiation</b> and confidentiality of user data. It uses physical, technical and administrative controls to accomplish these tasks. While focused predominantly on information in digital form, {{the full range of}} IA encompasses not only digital but also analog or physical form. These protections apply to data in transit, both physical and electronic forms as well as data at rest in various types of physical and electronic storage facilities.|$|E
2500|$|Cryptography or {{cryptology}} (from Greek [...] kryptós, [...] "hidden, secret"; and [...] graphein, [...] "writing", or [...] -logia, [...] "study", respectively) is {{the practice}} and study of techniques for secure communication {{in the presence of}} third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and <b>non-repudiation</b> are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.|$|E

"Information Security is a {{multidisciplinary}} {{area of study}} and professional activity which {{is concerned with the}} development and implementation of security mechanisms of all available types (technical, organizational, human-oriented and legal) in order to keep information in all its locations (within and outside the organization's perimeter) and, consequently, information systems, where information is created, processed, stored, transmitted and destroyed, free from threats.Threats to information and information systems may be categorized and a corresponding security goal may be defined for each category of threats. A set of security goals, identified as a result of a threat analysis, should be revised periodically to ensure its adequacy and conformance with the evolving environment. The currently relevant set of security goals may include: confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy, authenticity & trustworthiness, <b>non-repudiation,</b> accountability and auditability."

50|$|Often, {{authentication}} {{and digital}} signing are applied in conjunction. In advanced electronic signatures, the signatory has authenticated and uniquely {{linked to a}} signature. In {{the case of a}} qualified electronic signature as defined in the eIDAS-regulation, the signer's identity is even certified by a qualified trust service provider. This linking of signature and authentication firstly supports the probative value of the signature - commonly referred to as <b>non-repudiation</b> of origin. The protection of the message on the network-level is called <b>non-repudiation</b> of emission. The authenticated sender and the message content are linked to each other. If a 3rd party tries to change the message content, the signature looses validity.|$|E
