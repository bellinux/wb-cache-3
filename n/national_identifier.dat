40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between group identification and political action in Indonesia. We made four contributions to the literature. First, we studied political action on behalf of religious groups and examined the role of religious identification alone and in combination with national identification. Second, we analyzed political action in a non-Western country where social cleavages occur primarily along religious lines and where a conflict and nonconflict region can be studied. Third, we compared Muslims and Christians, whose majority and minority status varies across the two regions, and fourth, we investigated both normative and nonnormative forms of political action (protest and violence). In line with the dual-identification model of politicization, we found that religious identification increased support for protest (but not violence) in the conflict region only and particularly among high <b>national</b> <b>identifiers.</b> In the nonconflict region, religious identification was not related to violence, and it was related to lower support for protest among high <b>national</b> <b>identifiers.</b> The patterns were largely similar for Muslims and Christians, but some differences were found depending on the majority-minority status. We conclude that particularities of the intergroup context should be taken into consideration when studying politicization...|$|R

In this paper we ask: Who chooses to ethnically identify {{in the name of the}} nation and why? In so doing we emphasise the constructed nature of ethnicity and ethnic groups, and the political context within which ethnic identification decisions are made. Our analysis suggests the New Zealander incline was a phenomenon driven primarily by multi-generational New Zealanders who formerly identified as European.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and seeks}} comment on legislative proposals {{to support the}} establishment and implementation of <b>national</b> healthcare <b>identifiers</b> and enhanced arrangements for the privacy of health information. E-Health All Australian governments recognise {{the potential benefits of}} changing how information is accessed and shared across the healthcare system through the use of electronic communication and information technology to ensure that information is available when it is needed to provide patient care. The adoption of this technology, commonly described as e-health, is expected to transform the way in which healthcare providers practise and consumers interact with the health system and improve the safety and quality of healthcare and patient outcomes. To achieve the most from e-health, a national approach is needed to ensure that the frameworks and key infrastructure components are coordinated and aligned across Australia. Two elements that are regarded as central to the successful implementation of a national e-health system are the establishment of <b>national</b> healthcare <b>identifiers</b> for consumers and providers and the establishment of robust regulatory arrangements to ensure appropriate safeguards for patient health information and encourage participation in e-health initiatives. Considerable work has been undertaken by all governments in relation to both the development of <b>national</b> healthcare <b>identifiers</b> and to address health information privacy issues nationally. <b>National</b> healthcare <b>identifiers</b> In 2006, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to a national approach to developing, implementing and operating systems for individual and healthcare provider identifiers as part of accelerating work on electronic health records to improve the safety of patients and improve efficiency for healthcare providers.

40|$|Personal data is {{collected}} and stored {{more than ever}} by the governments and companies in the digital age. Even though the data is only released after anonymization, deanonymization is possible by joining different datasets. This puts the privacy of individuals in jeopardy.

This is a serious privacy and security threat because (i) identity theft risk is now higher, and (ii) scammers are able to access more information about individuals.

40|$|International audienceAdministrative {{records in}} France, {{especially}} medical and social records, have huge potential for statistical studies. The NIR (a <b>national</b> <b>identifier)</b> {{is widely used}} in medico-social administrations, and this would theoretically provide considerable scope for data matching, on condition that the legislation on such matters was respected. The law, however, forbids the processing of non-anonymized medical data, thus {{making it difficult to}} carry out studies that require several sources of social and medical data. We would like to benefit from computer techniques introduced since the 70 s to provide safe linkage of anonymized files, to release the current constraints of such procedures. We propose an organization and a data workflow, based on hashing and cyrptographic techniques, to strongly compartmentalize identifying and not-identifying data. The proposed method offers a strong control over who is in possession of which information, using different hashing keys for each linkage. This allows to prevent unauthorized linkage of data, to protect anonymity, by preventing cumulation of not-identifying data which can become identifying data when linked. Our proposal would make it possible to conduct such studies more easily, more regularly and more precisely while preserving a high enough level of anonymity. The main obstacle to setting up such a system, in our opinion, is not technical, but rather organizational in that {{it is based on the}} existence of a Key-Management Authority...|$|E
40|$|Aims To assess {{potential}} change in medicine exposure and {{association with the}} risk of road traffic crash across a time period that started before {{the implementation of a}} grading system warning of the effect of medicine on driving performance. Methods Data from three French national databases were extracted and matched: the national health care insurance database, police reports and the national police database of injurious crashes. Drivers involved in such crashes in France, from July 2005 to December 2011 and identified by their <b>national</b> <b>identifier,</b> were included. Association with the risk of crash was estimated using a case?control analysis comparing benzodiazepine and z-hypnotic use among drivers responsible or not responsible for the crash. Results Totals of 69 ? 353 responsible and 73 ? 410 non-responsible drivers involved in an injurious crash were included. Exposure to benzodiazepine anxiolytics was associated with an increased risk of being responsible for a road traffic crash during the pre-intervention period (OR= 1. 42 [1. 24 ? 1. 62]). The association disappeared in the post-intervention period, but became significant again thereafter. The risk of being responsible for a crash increased in users of z-hypnotics across the study period. Conclusions Our results question the efficacy of the measures implemented to promote awareness about the effects of medicines on driving abilities. Prevention policies relating to the general driving population, but also to healthcare professionals, should be reviewed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe French {{system for}} ETDs {{presents}} many original features {{compared to other}} countries:- a national framework based on legal deposit of theses. Effective since the 80 s, the legal deposit originally concerned paper. In 2006, the legislation changed to strongly support ETD. Ten years later, ETD {{is going to become}} the rule: all French PhD will be ETDs in a few months. - a national institution, Agence bibliographique de l'enseignement supérieur – ABES, is in charge of metadata, full-text deposit, and allocation of a <b>national</b> <b>identifier.</b> - cooperation with other national actors : Centre informatique national pour l'Enseignement Supérieur - CINES for long-term preservation, HAL for open access. - the French system is a complete workflow from the idea of the doctoral project to the graduation, and even more. To cope with those issues, ABES launched 3 softwares : “STAR“ for ETDS, “STEP“ for theses and dissertations before defense, and “theses. fr“ search engine which gathers all French theses, from 1985 to present. Around 130 universities and IT schools use this national framework. If universities want it, “STEP“ and “STAR“ can be connected, upstream with their IT system to recuperate metadata, and downstream with their open repositories. Then, metadata, including the URL to access full-text, are widely disseminated. The poster is a comic strip focused on the whole “life-cycle” of a thesis from the subject being registered to the post-thesis period. A librarian explains the national framework to a PhD student, step by step. First, you can see the PhD student preoccupations before defense: how giving information about his thesis in progress ? Metadata extraction from IT system university enables automated cataloging in “STEP“. When necessary, the PhD student and the librarian complete cataloging. The PhD project description is then published on “theses. fr“ as an ongoing thesis. Three years later, more or less, the student graduates. Metadata are pushed from “STEP“ to “STAR“ and the PDF file is uploaded in “STAR“ which controls its quality and push it for long-term preservation to CINES. Meanwhile, the librarian helps the PhD to make up his mind : is open access a good choice to promote his/her theses ? is embargo relevant ? According to PhD wishes, the deposit of PDF file is made by “STAR“ in HAL or an another open repository. At the same time, “theses. fr“ is updated and provides both accurate description of ETD and access to full-text, when available. “theses. fr“ generates a personal HTML page for each person in relation with the thesis : the author of course, but also, the supervisor, the examiners. Each HTML page has a proper and persistent ID. A few years later, when the PhD becomes a researcher, the librarian will show him how “theses. fr“ promotes his thesis and the books written since the PhD defense.
