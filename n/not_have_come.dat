5|$|Teresa Elena De Simone (24 June 19575 December 1979) {{was murdered}} in Southampton, England, in 1979. Her murder led {{to one of the}} longest proven cases of a {{miscarriage}} of justice in English legal history. The murder occurred outside the Tom Tackle pub and {{was the subject of a}} three-year police investigation which resulted in the arrest of Sean Hodgson. Over the course of his 15-day trial it was revealed that Hodgson was a pathological liar and had confessed to numerous crimes, including some that he could not have committed and others that did not appear to have happened. Hodgson was convicted of the murder by a unanimous jury verdict in 1982 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 27 years in prison he was exonerated and released in March 2009. DNA analysis of semen samples that had been preserved from the original crime scene showed that they could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from him.|$|E
5|$|Bunning's {{perfect game}} {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished {{at the top and}} the Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, in his first season with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game. Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> at a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E
5|$|Daphnomeles {{participated in}} the {{subsequent}} conflicts against Tsar Samuel, but his greatest feat was the capture of the Bulgarian leader Ibatzes in 1018, {{for which he is}} given a prominent position in Skylitzes's work. Following the defeat at the Battle of Kleidion in 1015, Bulgarian resistance began to collapse. By 1018, most Bulgarian commanders had surrendered, and only Ibatzes, who had retreated with his followers to the royal estate of Pronista, a naturally strong and defensible highland position, continued to resist. He rejected both bribes and threats from the Byzantines, and for 55 days, the Byzantine army under Emperor Basil II remained encamped at Deabolis nearby, waiting for his surrender. At that point, and as local crowds gathered to Ibatzes's palace for the feast of the Dormition, Daphnomeles, now strategos of nearby Achrida, on his own initiative, resolved to end the impasse. With only two escorts, he climbed the way to the estate, and announced himself to Ibatzes. Ibatzes, believing that Daphnomeles would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> alone unless he intended to forge an alliance against Basil, retreated with the strategos to a secluded wooded glade in the gardens for a private discussion. There, Daphnomeles and his two hidden associates sprang on the Bulgarian general, blinded him, and carried him to the upper story of the palace, through the assembled crowds who were too stunned to react. When the Bulgarians recovered, they gathered underneath the building crying for revenge. Daphnomeles, however, addressed them and managed to convince them of the futility of further resistance, and to lay down their arms and seek the emperor's pardon.|$|E

The {{government}} crisis in Prague lasted from 20 to 27 February, just when Western foreign ministers were meeting in London.

25|$|According to {{geologist}} Aryeh Shimron {{the tomb}} could be authentic and {{linked to the}} James Ossuary. He believes that the tomb is {{the tomb of the}} family of Jesus - Jesus, Mary Magdalene and their son Judah. However, Prof. Amos Kloner, who oversaw the archaeological work at Talpiot tomb disagrees. According to Prof Kloner, the James Ossuary could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from the Talpiot tomb, because the so-called missing ossuary of the Talpiot tomb had no inscription and was of different dimensions.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, during Romário's {{successful}} {{season at}} PSV Eindhoven, {{he was called}} up to the national team for a friendly match against Germany on 16 December 1992 in Porto Alegre– Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira left Romário as a reserve, after which he expressed his dissatisfaction, saying he would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> over from Netherlands if he had known {{he was not going}} to play. These declarations caused Parreira to ban Romário from the Brazilian team.|$|E

25|$|The relics, {{some long}} bones, are now {{enshrined}} on the Altar of St Chad's Cathedral. They were {{examined by the}} Oxford Archeological Laboratory by carbon dating techniques in 1985, and {{all but one of}} the bones (which was a third femur, and therefore could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from Bishop Chad) were dated to the seventh century, and were authenticated as 'true relics' by the Vatican authorities. In 1919, an Annual Mass and Solemn Outdoor Procession of the Relics was held at St Chad's Cathedral in Birmingham. This observance continues to the present, on the Saturday nearest to his Feast Day, 2 March.|$|E
25|$|The {{return trip}} to Brazil in 2014 could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> at a worse {{time from the}} Club's perspective, having been placed under a {{transfer}} embargo for taking out a loan of £100,000 from the PFA on 3 June. On 15 August, City paid of the PFA loan and lifted the transfer embargo that came with it. Later that day, City announced Graham Cummins as their first signing of the summer. On 21 August, Christian Ribeiro became City's second and final summer signing. City were later able to permanently sign loanees Ryan Harley, David Noble and Alex Nicholls; whilst also adding Clinton Morrison and Tom McCready to the squad.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{pubic hair}} that Christie {{collected}} from his victims, {{it has been}} speculated that {{he was responsible for}} more murders than those carried out at 10Rillington Place. Christie claimed that the four different clumps of hair in his collection came from his wife and the three bodies discovered in the kitchen alcove, but only one matched the hair type on those bodies, Ethel Christie's. Even if two of the others had come from the bodies of Fuerst and Eady, which had by then decomposed into skeletons, there was still one remaining clump of hair unaccounted for—it could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from Beryl Evans, as no pubic hair had been removed from her body.|$|E

25|$|Eichmann's {{defense lawyer}} argued that Israel did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{jurisdiction}} {{on account of}} Israel <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>come</b> into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.|$|R
25|$|The Near East has, since Roman times, been {{recognized}} as a center of quality glassware and crystal. 9th century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms. The types of objects made were bottles, flasks, vases, and cups utilized for domestic use. Decorations on these domestic items include molded flutes, honeycomb patters, and inscriptions. Other styles seen that may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from the Sassanians were stamped items. These were typically round stamps, such as medallions or disks with animals, birds, or Kufic inscriptions. Colored lead glass, typically blue or green, {{have been found in}} Nishapur, along with prismatic perfume bottles. Finally, cut glass may have been the high point of Abbasid glass-working, decorated with floral and animal designs.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{have been}} found with the maps as free leaves, rather than pasted down. Invariably these have been a library edition. Most of those seen have been bound in orange cloth. The front cover mimics the first edition dust jacket, silk-screened in black. Because several {{identical}} examples of the library edition have been reported, and because the endpaper maps show no evidence of having been glued down originally, it would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> about as ad hoc rebinds by libraries. Rather, a major bindery is assumed to have sourced the text block directly from the publisher. Not enough specimens have been examined to know if library bindings were supplied for all the printings. This library edition trimmed a full 5mm from the text block's outside margin and a combined 3mm vertically.|$|E
25|$|In December 1999, the FBI was {{investigating}} how China obtained {{plans for a}} specific nuclear device. Wen Ho Lee was accused of stealing nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory for the People's Republic of China. Federal officials, including then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, publicly named Lee as a suspect before {{he was charged with}} a crime. The U. S. Congress held hearings to investigate the Department of Energy's mishandling of his case. Republican senators thought that an independent agency should be in charge of nuclear weapons and security issues, not the Department of Energy. All but one of the 59 charges against Lee were eventually dropped because the investigation finally proved that the plans the Chinese obtained could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from Lee. Lee filed suit and won a $1.6 million settlement against the federal government and news agencies.|$|E

25|$|The unusual body {{structure}} of elasmosaurids would have limited the speed {{in which they}} could swim and their paddles may have moved in manner similar to birds wings but could not twist and were thus held rigidly. A 2015 study concluded that locomotion was mostly done by the fore-flippers while the hind-flippers function in maneuverability and stability, while a 2017 study concluded that the hind-flippers of plesiosaurs produced 60% more thrust and had 40% more efficiency when moving along in harmony with the fore-flippers. The paddles were so rigid and specialized for swimming that they could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> on land to lay eggs like sea turtles. Thus they most likely gave live birth to their young like sea snakes. Evidence for viviparity in plesiosaurs {{came in the form of}} a fossil of an adult Polycotylus with a single fetus inside.|$|E
25|$|Several months later, Dr. Lee {{released}} {{a report on the}} evidence and suggested to the CIB to trace the suspect according to the casings and bullets. In March 2005, Chen Yi-hsiung, a local Tainan resident, was the main suspect for the shooting but allegedly committed suicide 8 days after the election. The CIB closed the case in August 2005 implicating him as the shooter. But in 2006, James Chun-i Lee, a professor at National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of Forensic Medicine, led an investigation and concluded that Chen Yi-hsiung was most likely murdered, because his body, wrapped in a fishing net, was dumped into the water only after he died. Another report reached by the CIB task force concludes that the two bullets could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from the same pistol because a 9.1mm bullet would not fit into a 9mm pistol that the police said was used by the suspect. The KMT continues to claim that it was all engineered by Chen to this day.|$|E
25|$|The police {{eventually}} {{identify the}} victim's clothing as being of French manufacture. Emma tells {{the police that}} she had received a letter claiming to be from Martine, a French girl whom her brother Edmund had wanted to marry. He had written about Martine and their impending marriage days {{before his death in}} the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. The letter purporting to be from Martine claims that she was pregnant when Edmund died and that she now wishes their son to have all of the advantages to which his parentage should entitle him. The police conclude that the body in the sarcophagus is that of Martine but this proves not to be the case when Lady Stoddart-West, mother of James Stoddart-West, reveals that she is Martine. Although she and Edmund had intended to marry, Edmund died before they could do so and she later married an SOE officer and settled in England. She adds that she would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> forward until learning from her son of the forged letter to Emma.|$|E
