No statistically significant difference was found after 30 minutes of lens wear between the hydration levels at the front and back surfaces of Permathin (42. 5 % <b>nominal</b> <b>water</b> content) and Snoflex 50 (50 % <b>nominal</b> <b>water</b> content) hydrogel lenses; however, {{there was a significant difference}} for Gelflex 60 (60 ^ <b>nominal</b> <b>water</b> content) lenses, the back surface being more hydrated than the front surface. These findings suggest that there may be a water gradient between the front and back surfaces of higher water content hydrogel lenses during wear. Whilst the magnitude of the difference between surface hydration levels is small and of little consequence in the routine clinical measurement of water content using a hand refractometer, this phenomenon could be of aetiological significance with respect to the occurrence of multiple corneal erosions observed in patients wearing very thin, high water content lenses...|$|R

40|$|The water soft path (WSP) {{has been}} {{formulated}} as a progressive paradigm in water management. The WSP {{has four main}} principles: water {{should be viewed as}} a service; ecological sustainability is of utmost importance; water quantity and quality should be conserved; and planning should be done from the future backwards, not projected from the present. It may be possible to use conservation-based water pricing programs, especially at the residential level, in order to incrementally implement the WSP. Moreover, the implementation of residential seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> has been suggested as a method to curb peak demand in municipal water systems, thereby deferring infrastructure expansion. The purpose of this thesis is to answer the question: what are the barriers to implementing residential seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> in the Region of Waterloo? This question is addressed using a variety of data sources, with the majority of the information coming from academic and non-academic literature, and from interviews with water professionals and local councillors. The results provide a descriptive case study concerning the barriers to implementing seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> in one particular region of southwestern Ontario, but the conclusions can be generalized to describe some of the barriers to the implementation of seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> in Ontario. Results suggest that some barriers are more severe than others, and that the more serious ones may be addressed by: expounding the potential for seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> to curb peak demand; carefully designing a rate study to be administered with non-price programs; and implementing the designed rate structure as a pilot study. It is suggested that the implementation of seasonal <b>water</b> <b>rates</b> can be used as an incremental step towards the adoption of WSP principles, but not without first envisioning a desirable future...|$|R

This configuration has been selected due to merits in terms of environment-friendliness and energy efficiency. The solar-assisted multi-effect distillation system comprises 849 m 2 of evacuated-tube collectors, 280 m 3 water storage tanks, auxiliary heater, and six effects and a condenser. The present analysis employs a baseline configuration, namely; (i) the local solar insolation input (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia), (ii) a coolant flow rate through the headers of collector based on ASHRAE standards, (iii) a heating water demand, and (iv) the augmentation of water temperature by auxiliary when the supply temperature from the solar tank drops below the set point. It is observed that the annual collector efficiency and solar fraction decrease from 57. 3 to 54. 8 % and from 49. 4 to 36. 7 %, respectively, with an increase in the heating water temperature from 80 to 90 °C.
