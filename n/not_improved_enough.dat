500|$|After {{flying to}} Australia in February 2014 {{to operate on}} her heel and knee, Jackson {{committed}} {{to return to the}} Opals in time for the 2014 FIBA World Championship for Women. However, the delayed recovery of Jackson's knee led her to give up on the tournament to have her right hip operated on to fix a torn labrum in September 2014. She had gotten the tear while playing for Ros Casares Valencia in 2012 but went without surgery to not miss the then-upcoming Olympics. Jackson would later express interest in attending her fifth Olympic tournament during the 2016 Summer Olympics as a way to close her career, while also pursuing her long-standing dream of a gold medal.

5000|$|The {{literacy}} {{rates in}} Africa vary significantly between countries. The highest registered literacy {{rate in the}} region is in Equatorial Guinea and Libya (both 94.2%), while the lowest literacy rate is in South Sudan (27%). [...] Poorer youth in sub-Saharan Africa have fewer educational opportunities to become literate compared with wealthier families. They often must leave school because of being needed at home to farm or care for siblings.In sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of literacy has <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> <b>enough</b> to compensate for the effects of demographic growth. As a result, the number of illiterate adults has risen by 27% over the last 20 years, reaching 169 million in 2010. Thus, out of the 775 million illiterate adults in the world in 2010, more than one fifth were in sub- Saharan Africa - in other words, 20% of the adult population. The countries with the lowest levels of literacy in the world are also concentrated in this region. These include Niger (28.7%), Burkina Faso (28.7%), Mali (33.4%), Chad (35.4%) and Ethiopia (39%), where adult literacy rates are well below 50%. There are, however, certain exceptions, like Equatorial Guinea, with a literacy rate of 94%.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Despite the {{abundance}} of literature on management {{it seems that the}} quality of management has <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> <b>enough</b> to prevent scandals which have occurred in recent years. It could be that either the results of these studies have not been put to use in practice or that the results were biased because of the rather one-sided focus on US managers in much of the leadership literature. As national cultures signal different determinants of high performance, {{there is a need for}} leadership research into the effectiveness characteristics of managers in non-US countries. This article aims to develop an empirically validated profile of high performing managers in The Netherlands using a leadership framework developed in Asia. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a sample of 808 Dutch managers and using the cross-cultural framework of Excellent Leadership by Selvarajah et al., the profile of an excellent Dutch manager was derived. Findings: The paper reveals that this profile can be described by a four-dimensional factor structure consisting of managerial behaviours, environmental influences, personal qualities and organisational demands. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of the research is that the findings are based on reports from a single source; namely managers' perceptions. Hence, common-method effects may have inflated the correlations. Practical implications: The results of the research can serve as guidelines for developing an empirically validated profile of high performance managers (HPMs) in other Western countries. They also have practical implications in that organizations can use the HPM profile to tailor their management development programs, evaluation and coaching programs, and recruiting processes in order to improve the quality of their managers. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time a leadership framework developed in the Eastern world has been applied on Western managers, making this research one of the first of its kind. This is important because, as stated before, there is a strong need for research which extends the theoretical and practical basis of leadership theories from a solely Western focus to a more balanced Western-Eastern focus. The results from this type of research can provide guidance for improving quality of management worldwide...|$|E

40|$|To the authors' {{knowledge}} {{there are}} relatively few studies {{that try to}} answer this question: "Are humans able to add value to computer-generated forecasts and warnings?". Moreover, the answers are not always positive. In particular some postprocessing method is competitive or superior to human forecast. Within the alert system of ARPA Piemonte {{it is possible to}} study in an objective manner if the human forecaster is able to add value with respect to computer-generated forecasts. Every day the meteorology group of the Centro Funzionale of Regione Piemonte produces the HQPF (Human Quantitative Precipitation Forecast) in terms of an areal average and maximum value for each of the 13 warning areas, which have been created according to meteo-hydrological criteria. This allows the decision makers to produce an evaluation of the expected effects by comparing these HQPFs with predefined rainfall thresholds. Another important ingredient in this study is the very dense non-GTS (Global Telecommunication System) network of rain gauges available that makes possible a high resolution verification. In this work we compare the performances of the latest three years of QPF derived from the meteorological models COSMO-I 7 (the Italian version of the COSMO Model, a mesoscale model developed in the framework of the COSMO Consortium) and IFS (the ECMWF global model) with the HQPF. In this analysis it is possible to introduce the hypothesis test developed by Hamill (1999), in which a confidence interval is calculated with the bootstrap method in order to establish the real difference between the skill scores of two competitive forecasts. It is important to underline that the conclusions refer to the analysis of the Piemonte operational alert system, so they cannot be directly taken as universally true. But we think that some of the main lessons that can be derived from this study could be useful for the meteorological community. In details, the main conclusions are the following: – despite the overall improvement in global scale {{and the fact that the}} resolution of the limited area models has increased considerably over recent years, the QPF produced by the meteorological models involved in this study has <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> <b>enough</b> to allow its direct use: the subjective HQPF continues to offer the best performance for the period + 24 h/+ 48 h (i. e. the warning period in the Piemonte system); – in the forecast process, the step where humans have the largest added value with respect to mathematical models, is the communication. In fact the human characterization and communication of the forecast uncertainty to end users cannot be replaced by any computer code; – eventually, although there is no novelty in this study, we would like to show that the correct application of appropriated statistical techniques permits a better definition and quantification of the errors and, mostly important, allows a correct (unbiased) communication between forecasters and decision makers...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of and the subjects' overall satisfaction with the implementation of an internally created performance appraisal system. The system was implemented at a major technology consulting firm in the US. The subjects of this study were manager level employees of the firm.

Eight years of managers' responses to six key questions in the Career Development category were analyzed. Managers' perceptions of their contribution to the firm, their understanding of what career paths are available to them, their understanding of the requirements for promotion, as well as their overall satisfaction with the implementation of the performance appraisal system were captured by this survey. Trend analysis indicates that managers at the firm perceived their career path knowledge improved and their understanding of promotion criteria improved as a result of the implementation.

40|$|The {{present study}} firstly aimed to {{identify}} children with delayed reading who were missing the component skills of decoding fluency and who also displayed antisocial behaviour in the classroom. It also aimed to replicate with them an intervention designed by Church, Nixon, Zintl and Williams (2005). The study finally {{aimed to explore}} {{the question of whether}} children who have both a reading delay and a disruptive behaviour disorder require a reinforcement scheme to maintain their engagement in learning activities. Six participants worked with same-age peer tutors on specially-designed practice activities for approximately 20 minutes a day, four times a week, for 8 - 18 sessions. Improvement in decoding fluency and prose reading fluency was tracked for each child throughout the intervention. Results showed that the six participants gained, on average, sixteen months on their age-equivalent score for reading rate. Decoding fluency scores increased from a pre-test average of 16 correct graphemes per minute to 32 correct graphemes per minute at the post-test measure. Reading accuracy improved by an average of five months and reading comprehension by an average of six months. The gains in reading rate are most likely due to the practice opportunities afforded by the testing procedures as decoding fluency scores did <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> <b>enough</b> to have had a direct impact on the learners’ prose reading ability. Implications for remedial reading interventions with children with behaviour problems are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{identify}} and obtain structural results {{from two different}} issues that are motivated by new electronic commerce services and technologies. We study all problems from the consumer switching cost perspective. ^ Analyzing protection strategies for online software distribution {{is the subject of}} the first study. We consider a market that has two software producers, one of which protects its software while the other does not. Economic models are used to analyze different scenarios, and the result shows that when the software protection environment is fast improving, software firms should not protect their software products, since piracy can help them to lock in customers now and make higher profit in the near future. However, if the protection environment does <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> <b>enough</b> or even gets worse, firms that do not protect their software {{will not be able to}} benefit from the customers locked-in by pirate software, and they will be better-off protecting their software products. ^ The second part of the thesis addresses a new mobile electronic commerce model called Bar Code Shopping (BCS). By using BCS, a consumer can get price information from his or her mobile device by just scanning the Universal Product Code (UPC) on the product. Economic models are presented to analyze market segmentation and store 2 ̆ 7 s optimal pricing strategies when consumer switching costs are present. We are able to derive the conditions under which the Price Information Broker (PIB) has incentives to introduce the BCS service, stores have incentives to adopt the service, and consumers are willing to pay for the service. ...|$|R

30|$|Based on the {{performance}} analysis of this section, we can conclude that the proposed methods provide significant gains in all analyzed situations. In practical systems, however, there exists a tradeoff {{between the amount of}} signaling information and the achievable data rate in downlink. In general, the proposed 1 -bit scheduling method provides very remarkable gains when the criterion is max-min rate. However, if we had focused on maximizing the sum rate, the conclusions would have been different.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of digital {{photography}} {{and the proliferation of}} cell phone cameras, photography has become an everyday activity, leading to a dramatic increase in the amount of photos that people take. Even though the photo capturing technology has improved, the methods and tools with which consumers handle this increase in photo volume have <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> fast <b>enough.</b> Many consumers find moving photos from device to device to be unnecessarily difficult and time-consuming. For this thesis, we built a prototype of a service using existing technologies that automated the transferral of photos from a capture device - a Nokia N 900 cell phone - to an online service that the users could use to browse and share their photos. The prototype was deployed to a group of test users for a trial period. Their experiences and feedback were collected with the help of interviews. Based on our results, we concluded that there is a demand for such a service. The prototype that we built did not have enough functionality as to being a viable commercial service, but with improvements users would generally have been willing to pay for it. Giving end-users control over their photos and building their trust are central themes that are critical for such a service...|$|R
40|$|The C and Ku {{bands that}} have been the {{backbone}} of satellite telephony and data networks in the past are limited in the amount of bandwidth they provide. Consequently, some broadband Internet services have started to move into the Ka band in order to utilise the bandwidth at these higher frequencies. The use of higher frequencies led to fade mitigation design considerations that had not previously been necessary, as fixed power margins had been sufficient to guarantee high availability. This thesis reviews the majority of fade mitigation techniques that are available and simulates a scenario with several combined in a hybrid scheme. The simulations were made possible by several innovative components, including a near-optimum short-term fade predictor, a procedure capable of simulating the effect ofsite diversity with a single time series of attenuation and a dual-channel protocol structure that is able to increase availability of control information at Vband. The near-optimum short-term fade predictor is compared with several other short-term fade predictors and is shown to perform better in terms of the root-mean-square error and by the cumulative distribution of over-predictions. Also noteworthy is the fact that predictors based on fade slope perform very poorly when compared with signal processing and statistical methods ofprediction. The procedure capable of producing the effects of site diversity on a single time series of attenuation is described. The results of this procedure are compared with the ITU-R model for site diversity improvement and an acceptable fit is shown. A dual-channel protocol structure capable of increasing control information availability at V band is presented and the availability of this scheme is compared to the availability ofcurrent fixed-margin C and Ku band satellite links. While the availability at V band improves via this technique, it does <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> <b>enough</b> to compare favourably with that found in the lower frequency bands. A software turbo decoder capable of decoding the DVB-RCS turbo code is also described in this work since this was not available through other means. The fade dynamics at V band are reviewed and compared with the ITU-R models. The fade slope model gives a good visual fit but the fade duration model is very inaccurate. Finally, the simulation results show that high availability satellite communication is possible at V band, critically, if both site diversity and frequency diversity are available to mitigate the hub and VSAT fading respectively. Signal processing and power control are also found to be complementary techniques. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

In 1977, with The Storm, Jonah released his first single Sabhuku, which showcased Jonah's unique approach to the mbira-guitar style. It was also {{during the period from}} 1976-77 that Jonah started specializing in mbira music (Turino, p. 300). It was the authenticity of his chimurenga sound that prompted Thomas Mapfumo to disband his Acid Jazz (with the exception of guitarist Leonard Pickett Chiyangwa) and approach Jonah in 1978 to reform the Blacks Unlimited. Jonah Sithole also played guitar on Thomas Mapfumo's first album, Hokoyo! (recorded in 1977)although he was not officially part of the Acid Band. As Thomas and Jonah moved towards a more mbira-based repertoire, Thomas felt that Leonard Chiyangwa was <b>not</b> <b>improving</b> quickly <b>enough</b> in this new style, largely because his heavy drinking left him struggling with the hours of rehearsal. Leonard Chiyangwa was dismissed from the Blacks Unlimited as a consqequence.

It was also during this period that Thomas Mapfumo was incarcerated for three months by the Ian Smith regime for his subversive lyrics.

Patients filled out three questionnaires: at inclusion, at 3 months, and at 6 months. Information on sick leave was gathered from occupational health services. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Fifty-six patients with LBP were enrolled in each region. There was little collaboration between physicians during the project.
