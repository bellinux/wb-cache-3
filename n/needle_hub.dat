30|$|The {{bacterial}} {{contamination of}} <b>needle</b> <b>hubs</b> may occur upon {{the opening of}} injection needles when the push-off top method is used and may be affected by hands contaminated with saliva under clinical conditions.|$|R
30|$|Based {{on these}} findings, {{clinical}} conditions were examined. The causes of needle contamination were {{assumed to be}} the anesthesiologist’s hands with or without saliva. Since anesthesiologists have many opportunities to touch the intraoral saliva of a patient, human saliva {{is considered to be}} a colonizing source of puncture sites/needles [13]. Contaminated mounts due to a gloved finger with saliva contaminated <b>needle</b> <b>hubs</b> significantly more than in the hand contamination group.|$|R
30|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} in infusion lines causes sepsis, resulting in prolonged artificial respiration and an extended stay {{in intensive care}} units or hospitals [1, 2]. The valves of infusion lines or syringes for drug injection are involved in bacterial contamination of infusion lines [3, 4]. Injection needles, which are used to aspirate drug solutions, may contaminate infusion lines through syringes when the syringes are contaminated with bacteria [5]. The present study focused on the contamination of <b>needle</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
30|$|Using the push-off top method, {{contamination}} of the <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> increased with the concentration of S. aureus applied to the opening portions. Contamination of the <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> was rare at a concentration of ≤[*] 104 CFUs/ml. The number of contaminated needle hubs was 5 % (1 out of 20 needles) at a concentration of 104 CFUs/ml, and 0 % (0 out of 20 needles) at a concentration of 103 CFUs/ml.|$|E
30|$|No {{significant}} differences were noted in the <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> contamination between mount materials (paper and plastic) (Fig.  4 b).|$|E
30|$|The push-off method {{increased}} bacterial concentration, and wet needle mounts {{and hands}} may {{all contribute to}} <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> bacterial infection.|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{emulated}} clinical contamination data, {{the number}} of bacteria was compared between mounts using the Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test considering the anesthesiologist and wet/saliva hands as strata, excluding dry hand data because all were zero. The numbers of bacteria on the lateral surfaces, bottom surfaces, inner lumens, and total surface of <b>needle</b> <b>hubs</b> were compared between dry/wet/saliva hands using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test considering anesthesiologist as a stratum. The mount was not included into stratum because a large p value was obtained for the mount comparison. Pairwise comparisons were also performed. The family-wise error rate was controlled using the closed testing procedure; first, data was compared between dry, wet, and saliva hands with a significance level of 5 % and the testing procedure was stopped if not significant. Second, pairwise comparisons were performed with a significance level of 5 % for each test if {{the first step was}} significant. A p value of <[*] 0.05 was considered to be significant.

30|$|A {{total of}} 240 {{injection}} needles, including 120 each adherently packaged with a paper-mount and transparent plastic blister (18 G: Terumo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) {{or with a}} plastic (combination of polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate) mount and transparent plastic blister (18 G: NIPRO Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) were used. The injection needle {{was taken out of}} the box just before the initiation of experiments and was stored on a clean bench after disinfection. Injection needles were classified into two groups according to the opening methods: the peel-apart and push-off top methods (60 needles each). Experiments were conducted separately for 10 needles each at six different concentrations of the bacterial suspension. To assess the risk of needle contamination by various quantitative concentrations under clinical settings, 10  μl of each of the bacterial suspensions (108, 107, 106, 105, 104, and 103 CFUs/ml) was applied to the part near the <b>needle</b> <b>hub’s</b> opening at the mount of an unopened injection needle product using a pipette tip on a clean bench (shaded parts in Fig.  1 a, b). Using the peel-apart method, the bacterial suspension was applied to the gripped part of the mount (shaded parts in Fig.  1 a). Using the push-off method, the bacterial suspensions were applied to the part potentially touching the mount when removing the needle (shaded parts in Fig.  1 b).|$|R
30|$|The lateral {{surfaces}} of needle hubs were contaminated using the push-off top method, {{but not by}} the peel-apart method, {{in a manner that}} was dependent on S. aureus concentrations. No significant differences were observed between mount materials. <b>Needle</b> <b>hub</b> contamination was significantly more severe for the wet than for the dry opening portion. The clinically assumed condition study revealed that the lateral and bottom {{surfaces of}} the <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> were contaminated significantly more in the saliva contamination group than in the dry and wet hand groups.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the rare}} {{occurrence}} of <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> contamination in the previous experiment using the peel-apart method, various conditions (i.e., dry or wet hands, saliva contamination) were examined to evaluate the clinical risk of <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> contamination using the push-off top method. Five anesthesiologists {{were included in the}} present study. This investigation was conducted in accordance with the current Declaration of Helsinki. The authors’ own samples were collected, and patients and volunteers were not included. All samples were anonymized after collection for the impossibility to identify the specific individual. A total of 150 injection needles, including 75 each in the paper-mount group and plastic-mount group, were used.|$|E

40|$|To {{develop an}} {{expedient}} procedure for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in conscious mice, we first established a simple technique for repeated blood collections from the tail vein using a microcapillary tube {{attached to a}} 24 -gauge <b>needle</b> without the <b>hub.</b> Then, we devised a definition equation for estimation of the GFR using the contrast medium iodixanol as a test tracer. Iodixanol was administered as a bolus injection at 1500 mg I/kg to ddY mice, and the GFR {{was determined by the}} conventional multisample strategy. Based on cumulative data from the multisample method, an equation for the single-blood-sample method including the iodixanol dose, estimated distribution volume (Vd), and plasma iodixanol concentration at 60 min later was sought. The GFR values from the multisample method were in good agreement with those calculated using the equation. In clinically healthy mice, the GFR decreased gradually with ages from 11 weeks old in both sexes, suggesting the necessity of the corresponding control in each protocol. In nephropathy mice induced by cisplatin, the GFR values decreased with rises in serum BUN and creatinine concentrations, and serum creatinine became elevated when the GFR decreased to approximately 70 % of the basal value. The results suggest that the simplified equation using iodixanol, allowing for the repeated use of the same mice, is a versatile procedure for research purposes...|$|R
30|$|We also {{examined}} the effects of various concentrations of S. aureus as one of the risk factors. Contamination of the lateral and bottom surfaces of the <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> was enhanced by increasing concentrations of S. aureus. However, the inner lumen contamination did not significantly increase under wet conditions, even at 108 CFUs/ml, which is the presumed concentration after exposure to human saliva [11].|$|E
30|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{upon the}} opening of injection needles was examined in two materials, paper and plastic. Various concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus were applied to the mount and were maintained under wet or dry conditions. Injection needles were opened using the peel-apart or push-off top method. <b>Needle</b> <b>hub</b> contamination was examined using agar medium colony counting. Clinically assumed conditions (the hands and saliva of anesthesiologists) were also evaluated. Data were statistically examined using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, Jonckheere, and Fisher’s exact tests.|$|E
30|$|Two opening {{methods are}} used for {{injection}} needle products: the “peel-apart method” where the adhesive surface of the packaging mount is peeled off, and the “push-off top method,” where the <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> is pressed against the mount to break it.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the bacterial contamination of needle hubs upon the opening of injection needles by the peel-apart or push-off top method under various conditions.|$|E
40|$|Solid-phase {{extraction}} (SPE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular sample preparation techniques for the isolation and preconcentration of organic compounds from aqueous samples. Modified porous polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) resins containing polar groups are superior for SPE of organic solutes from aqueous samples. These modified resins display excellent surface hydrophilicity and improved extraction efficiencies. Silicalite is a hydrophobic molecular sieve with an unusual crystal structure. Because of its unique structure, Silicalite adsorbs organic analytes from aqueous samples due to hydrophobic interactions;The ability of Silicalite and a lightly sulfonated PS-DVB resin to extract various organic test compounds from aqueous samples was compared using identical small cartridges packed with the adsorbents. Both types of resins were incorporated into membranes for more efficient extractions. The percentage recoveries were calculated for the test compounds and used as a measure of SPE efficiency;Heightened awareness of the hazards and pollution caused by the use of organic solvents has led to a search for a more efficient SPE technique. To reduce sample size, elution volume, and time, semi-micro solid-phase extraction (SM-SPE) was developed. The entire SPE process was miniaturized. The apparatus for SM-SPE consisted of a Teflon luer lock syringe as the sample reservoir and fluorocarbon <b>hubbed</b> <b>needles</b> as the extraction columns;Therapeutic drug monitoring usually incorporates high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate and quantitate drugs from biological samples. Direct injection of biological samples onto HPLC columns is advantageous in terms of its time and labor saving capabilities. Because of its unique structure and characteristics, Silicalite was employed for the determination of drugs and metabolites in serum and urine using direct injection. Silicalite possesses a hydrophobic interior and hydrophilic exterior. The hydrophilic surface allows passage of small molecules to the hydrophobic interior, while sterically preventing large molecules from entering the pores. Silicalite was able to separate and quantitate various drugs in urine and serum...|$|R
30|$|The {{present results}} showed that the risk of {{bacterial}} contamination was higher with the push-off top method than with the peel-apart method. Needle products are opened without contact between bacterially contaminated mounts and sterile needle hubs using the peel-apart method. However, needle products are opened due to rupture by pressing the <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> to the mount using the push-off top method. The contaminated lateral and bottom surfaces of needle hubs appeared to be attributed to contact between bacterially contaminated mounts and sterile needle hubs.|$|E
30|$|The {{number of}} {{bacteria}} in the inner lumen of a <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> was classified into contaminated (≥[*] 1 colony) or uncontaminated (no colony), and this binary response was compared between opening methods, the dryness/wetness of the bacterial solution, and mount materials using Fisher’s exact test without considering the concentration of S. aureus. A trend test for the S. aureus concentration-contamination relationship {{in the number of}} {{bacteria in the}} inner lumen was not performed because of only five hubs were contaminated. Fisher’s exact test was instead applied to compare S. aureus concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Background: Liquid-based {{cytology}} technique enables {{cells to}} be suspended in a liquid medium and spread in a monolayer, making better morphological assessment. Automated techniques {{have been widely}} used, but limited due to cost and availability. Aim: The aim was to establish manual liquid-based cytology (MLBC) technique on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) material and compare its results with conventional technique. Materials and Methods: In this study, we examined cells trapped in needles hub used for the collection of FNAC samples. 50 cases were examined by the MLBC technique and compared with the conventional FNAC technique. By centrifugation, sediment was obtained and imprint was taken on defined area. Papanicolaou (Pap) and May-Grünwald Giemsa (MGG) staining was done. Direct smears and MLBC smears were compared for cellularity, background, cellular preservation, and nuclear preservation. Slides were diagnosed independently by two cytologists with more than 5 years′ experience. Standard error of proportion was used for statistical analysis. Results: Cellularity was low in MLBC as compared with conventional smears, which is expected as remnant material in the <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> was used. Nuclei overlap {{to a lesser extent}} and hemorrhage and necrosis was reduced, so cell morphology can be better studied in the MLBC technique. P value obtained was < 0. 05.

30|$|The {{numbers of}} {{bacteria}} on the lateral surfaces, bottom surfaces, and total surface (sum of the lateral surface, bottom surface, and inner lumen) of needle hubs were compared between the opening methods, dryness/wetness of bacterial solution, and mount materials using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test considering {{the concentration of}} S. aureus as a stratum. By comparing the dryness/wetness of bacterial solution and mount materials, only data obtained using the push-off top method was used because only one <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> was contaminated in the peel-apart method. The trend test for the concentration of S. aureus-contamination relationship was performed using the push-off top method data with the Jonckheere test.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{retrospectively}} {{examine the}} success and complication rates associated with image-guided percutaneous bone biopsy with a simulated Van Sonnenberg removable hub system. Materials and Methods: During a 3. 5 -year period, 27 bone lesions at different anatomic locations with an indication for biopsy based on plain film, computed tomography (CT) and/or {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) findings were determined, {{and a total of}} 28 image-guided (fluoroscopy or CT) percutaneous biopsies were performed using a simulated Van Sonnenberg-removable hub system. This technique entailed the use of a cut-out Chiba <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> that per-formed as a guide for the insertion of a larger needle. Either core and aspiration biopsy or core biopsy alone was utilized. Results: The procedure yielded diagnostic material 89 % of the cases (48 % infection, 22 % benign lesions, and 19 % malignant lesions). Com-bined use of core and aspiration biopsy resulted in a higher diagnostic accuracy as compared to core biopsy alone. No false positive or false negative diagnoses were observed. No serious complications such as neurological deficits, bleeding, or organ injury were observed. Conclusion: The simulated Van Sonnenberg removable hub system provides a useful technique for percutaneous bone biopsies and is particulary suitable for deep seated (such as vertebral) lesions with its ability to facilitate the accessibility of the lesion with its built-in guidance needle. The procedure is safe in light of the literature data...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{health workers}} {{including}} residents and fellows {{do not have}} a suitable phantom model to practice the fine- needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) procedure. In the past, we standardized a model consisting of latex glove containing fresh cattle liver for practicing FNAB. However, this model is difficult to organize and prepare on short notice, with the procurement of fresh cattle liver being the most challenging aspect. Handling of liver with contamination-related problems is also a significant draw back. In addition, the glove material leaks after a few needle passes, with resulting mess. We have established a novel simple method of embedding a small piece of sausage or banana in a commercially available silicone rubber caulk. This model allows the retention of vacuum seal and aspiration of material from the embedded specimen, resembling an actual FNAB procedure on clinical mass lesions.

40|$|Objectives: To {{improve the}} smear {{microscopy}} for detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of lymph node using the bleach method {{and also to}} compare this with cytological diagnosis and the conventional Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) method. Study Design: In 99 consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of tuberculosis (TB) presenting with lymphadenopathy, FNACs were performed. Smears from the aspirates were processed for routine cytology and the conventional ZN method. The remaining material in the <b>needle</b> <b>hub</b> and/or the syringe {{was used for the}} bleach method. The significance of the bleach method over the conventional ZN method and cytology was analyzed using the &# 967; 2 test. Results: Of 99 aspirates, 93 were studied and the remaining six were excluded from the study due to diagnosis of malignancy in 4. 04 &#x 0025; (4 / 6) and inadequate aspiration in 2. 02 &#x 0025; (2 / 6). Among the 93 aspirates, 33. 33 &#x 0025; (31 / 93) were positive for AFB on conventional ZN method, 41. 94 &#x 0025; (39 / 93) were indicative of TB on cytology and the smear positivity increased to 63. 44 &#x 0025; (59 / 93) on bleach method.

40|$|The use of {{intrathecal}} {{drugs to}} produce either analgesia or anaesthesia has been limited, in part, by {{the problem of}} post-spinal headache. The headache, which may be disabling, has dis-couraged the use of "spinal anaesthesia", especi-ally in younger patients in whom the incidence {{is said to be}} greater. However, the introduction of fine gauge needles has decreased the risk to less than 1 % with 0. 5 -mm (25 -gauge) and 0. 45 -mm (26 -gauge) needles (Bonica, 1970). One problem in using fine gauge needles (especially for the inexperienced operator) is visualization of the free-flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to confirm the position of the needle tip in the subarachnoid space. The only previous study which examined the in vitro performance of spinal needles (Messahel, Robinson and Mathews, 1983) found considerable differences in flow through two types of 0. 5 -mm (25 -gauge) needle. We have related the dimensions of some currently available spinal needles (0. 7 -, 0. 5 - and 0. 45 -mm; 22 -, 25 - and 26 -gauge) to CSF flow at "high " and "low " pressures (equivalent to the sitting and lying positions for lumbar puncture).

40|$|A new {{percutaneous}} {{treatment of}} tic douloureux has been developed. Transovale injection of glycerol into the retro-gasserian trigeminal fibers in Meckel cave results in com-plete pain relief in 77 %- 89 % of patients [1 - 3]. The major advantages of percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhi-zotomy include simplicity, radiograph ic confirmation of ac-curate need le placement, {{and a much}} reduced incidence of postoperative facial sensory loss. The technique is depen-dent upon proper intraoperative recognition of the trigeminal cistern for placement of the glycerol, which is identified in postoperative radiographs by tantalum dust mixed with the glycerol as a permanent marker of Meckel cave. Technique Percutaneous retrogasserian rhizotomy is performed with the patient awake after light premedication that includes an anxiolytic and an anticholinergic to reduce possible vaso-vagal symptoms. The patient rests on any x-ray or operating room table that can be brought from the supine to the semi-sitting position during the procedure. A C-arm fluoroscopic image intensifier equipped with video storage capacity is positioned in the anteroposterior (AP) sku ll projection. The submentovertex view is not used since neck hyperextension is often difficult for elderly patients, and since the foramen ovale is usually identifiable in the frontal projection. After local xylocaine skin infiltration, a 20 gauge (9 cm) standard spinal needle is inserted through the cheek at a point 2. 5 cm {{from the corner of}} the mouth. The needle is directed to a point 2. 5 cm anterior to the external auditory canal (patient's AP coordinate and superoinferior coordi-nate) at the medial aspect of the ipsilateral pupil (Hartel technique). Deep injection of 1 ml xylocaine just anterior to the foramen ovale reduces pain associated with needle penetration of the cistern. After fluoroscopy confirms appro-priate needle position, the stylet is removed to observe for flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

30|$|The fibrin glue sealant, Baxter Tisseel©, {{was used}} {{due to its}} {{similarity}} to the fibrin product used in 2 previous publications (Franzini et al. 2010, 2013). Our protocol also required fluoroscopically accessing the L 1 — 2 epidural space with an 18 gauge Tuohy needle (using a midline, interlaminar approach). Needle placement was then confirmed with Isovue contrast administration, in both the lateral and anterior-posterior fluoroscopic views. Next, 10  ml of autologous blood was sterilely withdrawn from the patient and briefly set aside after mixing the obtained blood with 3  ml of additional Isovue contrast. The Tisseel© syringe was attached to extension tubing connected to the Tuohy epidural <b>needle</b> <b>hub,</b> and fibrin glue was then injected rapidly into the posterior epidural space until a pressure paresthesia of at least 2 – 3 out of 10 intensity or greater was experienced by the patient. Note that pressure paresthesia was defined as significant pressure sensations felt by the patient in the head, back, buttock or legs (whether unilateral or bilateral). Up to 10  ml of fibrin glue injectate was available to inject (the full capacity of the Tisseel© syringe), although the actual fibrin glue volume utilized was dependent upon the onset and intensity of patient paresthesia response alone (i.e., fibrin glue was injected until the patient experienced this paresthesia response). Thereafter, the previously prepared blood-Isovue mixture was injected immediately afterward through a new connection tube. Only enough blood mixture was injected to clear the epidural needle from fibrin glue (less than 1  cc), while immediately ceasing further injection until the patient’s pressure paresthesia had fully resolved to its pre-procedural baseline. Once the patient’s paresthesia had fully resolved, additional blood-Isovue admixture was injected until the patient again experienced a pressure paresthesia of at least 2 – 3 out of 10 intensity. The epidural needle was then gently flushed with saline or 1  % lidocaine as it was withdrawn from the epidural space and fully removed from the skin. Patients were asked to remain supine in our recovery area for about 30  min post-procedurally to allow further stabilization of the injectate in the epidural space.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: One of {{the factors}} that {{contribute}} to the total needle-targeting error in medical procedures is needle deflection, which can lead to e. g. hemorrhage, prolonged intervention time and decreased treatment efficiency. This deflection can be defined as the deviation of the needle from its suspected straight insertion path. In this study, we focused on the effect of tissue heterogeneity on needle deflection. We hypothesized that needle deflection would be bigger for insertions into heterogeneous than homogeneous specimens, due to an unequal force distribution on the needle. Method: the inner needle of a 18 Gauge trocar needle with triangular tip was inserted (5 mm/s) multiple times at several positions into 4 gelatin-, 4 animal liver-, and 2 human liver specimens. Deflection in X- and Y-direction was measured using sliding gauges and axial forces acting on the needle were captured using a force sensor mounted onto the <b>needle</b> <b>hub.</b> Axial force analysis was used to give a rough estimation of the mechanical properties of the specimens. Results: Results show an increase in magnitude and variance for needle insertions into the liver specimens (Animal: Mean = 1. 01 mm, SD = 0. 54, Human: Mean = 0. 83 mm, SD = 0. 48) compared with those into gelatin specimens (Mean = 0. 59 mm, SD = 0. 26 mm). Differences between the median and maximal needle tip forces for insertions into gelatin were almost zero (Mean = 0. 08, SD = 0. 04 N), whereas those differences were bigger for insertions into tissue specimens (Mean = 0. 58, SD = 0. 23 N), indicating the homogeneous nature of gelatin and heterogeneous nature of tissue. Discussion: The results obtained in this study suggest that heterogeneity causes the needle to deflect from its straight path. Both magnitude and variance of needle deflection are bigger for insertions into heterogeneous tissue specimens than into homogeneous gelatin specimens. A suggestion for future research is to study the effect of pathologic tissue on needle deflection, as this type of tissue is known for being more heterogeneous than healthy tissue.

40|$|PHOTOS 1 - 2 : The {{bone marrow}} biopsy needle {{is used to}} perform biopsies of bone marrow but not the bone. It has a large handle facilitating {{introduction}} of the needle into bone and a stylet to prevent tissue coring. PHOTOS 3 - 4 : Bone marrow aspiration biopsy provides information on the condition and activity of the haemopoietic cells in bone marrow. Bone marrow aspiration biopsy is indicated in cases where there is obvious or suggested dysfunctioning of the haemopoietic system but there is insufficient change in peripheral blood to make a diagnosis. Conditions where a bone marrow evaluation is necessary include non regenerative anaemia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, proliferative abnormalities, suspected malignancies and cell maturation problems. Bone marrow aspiration {{can be done with}} only light restraint and local anaesthetic. Bone marrow aspiration is a relatively safe procedure with very few contraindications. Bone marrow samples are used for the study of cell markers, cytogenetic study, ultrastructural examination, culture for microorganisms and to culture haemopoietic precursors for the preparation of histological sections. Bone marrow aspirates are the best samples for cytological examination. Bone marrow aspiration is especially useful for investigating suspected aplastic or hypoplastic anaemia, lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma and diseases of bone. The sites that are most commonly used for bone marrow aspiration in small animals are the head of the humerus and the wing of the ilium. It can be done with only light restraint and local anaesthetics. The skin directly over the selected site is clipped and cleaned with a surgical scrub. The area is anaesthetized using a local anaesthetic. An incision just large enough for the bone marrow aspiration needle to pass through is made. The needle is inserted and rotated into the bone. When the needle feels firmly inserted into the bone, the stylet is withdrawn and a plastic syringe is attached to the <b>needle</b> <b>hub.</b> Negative pressure is applied until a few drops of red bone marrow appear in the tip of the syringe. The syringe is removed and the stylet replaced, the needle is then repositioned for another aspiration attempt. The needle is withdrawn from the patient. Cytology smears are made right away to avoid clotting, the slides can be air dried and stained with any Romanowsky stain. Bone marrow samples can also be obtained via open biopsy under general anaesthetic. Complications of bone marrow aspiration are rare but cardiac and great vessel laceration may occur. Haemorrhage is uncommon but prolonged firm pressure may be necessary after the procedure to ensure bleeding stops in patients with bleeding disorders. Biopsy needles may break in patients that have osteosclerosis. REFERENCES: PHOTOS 1 - 4 : 1.
