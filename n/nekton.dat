25|$|The orange-spotted {{trevally}} is a strong-swimming predator {{that takes}} a variety of prey, including fish, crustaceans, and <b>nekton.</b> They reach sexual maturity at 24.7cm on average, with studies in the Persian Gulf indicating the species' main spawning periods occur between June and September. Whether this differs throughout their range is currently unknown. The same study also showed the species has a strong seasonal oscillation in the growth rate, which was fastest during November–April and slowest during May–September.|$|E

2500|$|The orange-spotted trevally, Carangoides bajad (also {{known as}} the gold-spotted trevally) is a species of inshore marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is fairly common in {{tropical}} to subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, ranging from Madagascar {{in the west to}} Japan in the east, typically inhabiting inshore reefs. The species has characteristic orange-yellow spots on its sides, although counts of fin rays and scutes are needed to distinguish it from related species with similar colouring. Orange-spotted trevallies are powerful predators, taking a variety of small fish, <b>nekton,</b> and crustaceans, and reach sexual maturity [...] around 25cm long. It is a moderately large fish, reaching a maximum known length of 55cm. The species is occasionally taken by fishermen throughout its range, and is generally considered to be bycatch. The exception to this is in the southern Persian Gulf, where it makes up {{a large proportion of the}} fishery.|$|E

40|$|Fish are {{the aquatic}} animals which are studied {{under the heading}} of <b>Nektons.</b> They feed upon all type of food {{including}} phytoplankton, zooplanktons as well as <b>nektons</b> of smaller than their size either belonging to same species or other. Most of the culture able fish are omnivorous. Schaperclaus (1933). But the specificity in respect of selection of food is found in fresh water fish as well as marine forms. It is due to their habits and ecological area in which they live. The fresh water fish of Haryana are found either in river Yamuna as well as fresh water lakes like Karan Lake at Karnal, Badkhal Lake at Faridabad, Sukhana Lake at Chandigarh and in river Ghagar, Beside this the fresh water fish in Haryana are in abundance in Paddy fields from district Panchkula to District Rohtak and canal irrigated area of Jhajjar and Bhiwani districts. The fresh water fish cultivated in these districts are indigenous species and well adapted to food habits either in some areas artificial food is also provided by the fish farmer in order to over come the shortage of food where the population of fish in an area exceed to a particular limit. Material and Method: General survey on various fish culture sites was carried on in order to know the food habits and availability of food for fresh water fish in Haryana. The type of food found in gut of various fish in different fisheries was studied. The fisheries visited during the survey were taken into consideration from variou...|$|R

40|$|A {{biochemical}} mode of formation, {{controlled by}} {{the configuration of the}} sea floor, is here advocated for bedded deposits of marine phosphates. Decaying organisms on the bottom of depressions of an otherwise open sea produce ammonium phosphate and ammonia. Nitration bacteria oxi-dize ammonia into nitrates that act as fertilizers for the phytoplanktons on which other <b>nektons</b> and planktons flourish. On death, the biota fall to the bottoms of the sea-floor depressions, where the amounts of soluble phos-phates increase in due course beyond the needs of the animals and plants living above. The sheltered depressions preserve the solutions from dis-sipation in the open sea. The ammonium phosphate reacts with Ca ions or with precipitating CaCOa to give calcium phosphate. Two general kinds of phosphates are recognized: a dark-colored, fine-grained type contains pyrite and bituminous material, and its grains are elongated and angular. It is formed in the deeper, more sheltered sea-floor depressions with a negative Eh. A light-colored, coarse-grained type con-tains little pyrite and organic material, and is at least partly oxidized. The grains are rounded and the deposits contain detrital quartz. They are formed in relatively shallow depressions, where they are brecciated by strong waves that also roll the fragments into rounded pellets and nodules. It is suggested that phosphates are deposited in a medium whose pI-I is around 7. 8, the limestone fence...|$|R

50|$|As a guideline, <b>nekton</b> were {{larger and}} tend to swim largely at biologically high Reynolds numbers (>10³ and up beyond 10⁹), where {{inertial}} flows are the rule, and eddies (vortices) are easily shed. Plankton, on the other hand, are small and, if they swim at all, do so at biologically low Reynolds numbers (0.001 to 10), where the viscous behavior of water dominates, and reversible flows are the rule. Organisms such as jellyfish and others were considered plankton when they are very small and swim at low Reynolds numbers, and considered <b>nekton</b> as they grew large enough to swim at high Reynolds numbers. Many animals considered classic examples of <b>nekton</b> (e.g., Mola mola, squid, marlin) start out life as tiny members of the plankton and then, it was argued, gradually transitioned to <b>nekton</b> as they grew.|$|E

5000|$|Biologically {{there is}} an {{important}} distinction between plankton and <b>nekton.</b> Plankton are the aggregate of relatively passive organisms which float or drift with the currents, such as tiny algae and bacteria, small eggs and larvae of marine organisms, and protozoa and other minute predators. <b>Nekton</b> are the aggregate of actively swimming organisms which are able to move independently of water currents, such as shrimps, forage fish and sharks.|$|E

50|$|The {{project name}} was {{proposed}} by oceanographer Dr. Robert S.

It is in reference to ocean life that actively swims (<b>nekton)</b> as opposed to the plankton organisms that only drift. The bathyscaphe Trieste to be used for Project <b>Nekton</b> was able to move independently, in contrast to tethered bathyspheres. The Trieste featured two electric motors, each with a propeller, of two horsepower each. These allowed it to move forward, backward and to turn horizontally. A maximum speed of 1 knot was attainable over a few miles distance.|$|E
