He ascended the gadi (throne) at Baroda, 16 June 1875 but being a minor reigned under a Council of Regency until he came of age and was invested with full ruling powers on 28 December 1881. During his minority he was extensively tutored in administrative skills by Raja Sir T.

25|$|The medium {{began to}} develop in England {{in the latter part}} of the 18th century—especially around the time of the French Revolution—under the {{direction}} of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon. Calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account, many of Gillray's satires were directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of Revolutionary France and Napoleon. The times in which Gillray lived were peculiarly favourable to the growth of a great school of caricature. Party warfare was carried on with great vigour and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bitterness; and personalities were freely indulged in on both sides. Gillray's incomparable wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him the first place among caricaturists.|$|E

A decade later, the makers of Urunana invited Finch to record a guest appearance as Ruth for the show. Ruth's scenes saw her married to a shopkeeper named Munyakazi, who was reluctant to let her train as a community health worker. Of the storyline, Finch said [...] "Although all this seemed <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bizarre for strong-willed, independent Ruth, when I cast my mind back, it wasn't a million miles away from David's (my Archers husband of more than 20 years) reaction to having a female student arrive to work alongside him at Brookfield in 1987." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1916, the 4th General Council met in St. Louis {{to resolve}} the [...] "new issue". In a move that caused <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> anxiety, a {{committee}} introduced the Statement of Fundamental Truths. Oneness proponents and others saw this as {{an attack on the}} authority of the Bible, yet it was adopted along with a recommendation that AG ministers use the Trinitarian baptismal formula. Old preaching credentials were recalled and new ones issued with the Fundamental Truths included. Oneness believers, including a third of the fellowship’s ministers, were forced to withdraw, a loss especially felt in the South where the Oneness doctrine had the most influence. A side effect of this was a transition in leadership from former Apostolic Faith leaders, many of whom accepted the Oneness teaching, to men with Christian and Missionary Alliance backgrounds. The Oneness dissenters formed the General Assembly of the Apostolic Churches, which later merged with another group to form the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Gibson {{contributed to}} [...] "Visionary San Francisco", an {{exhibition}} at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art shown from June 14 to August 26. He wrote a short story, [...] "Skinner's Room", set in a decaying San Francisco in which the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge was closed and {{taken over by the}} homeless – a setting Gibson then detailed in the Bridge trilogy. The story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, solar-powered towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge. The architects exhibit featured Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from [...] "Skinner's Room". The New York Times hailed the exhibition as [...] "one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade", despite calling Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to Gibson's contribution [...] "a powerful, but sad and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cynical, work".

500|$|He then {{quotes a}} Mr. Townson's {{account of how}} crossbills feed on pine cones, {{inserting}} their beaks between the scales and then forcing them sideways, opening the cone. Yarrell then immediately returns to anatomy, describing in detail (nearly a page) how the tongue is used to extract the seed from between the cone scales. Only then does he return to Mr. Townson, quoting him as saying [...] "The degree of the lateral power is surprising, and they are fond of exercising it for amusement; they are, therefore, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> mischievous. My pets would often come to my table whilst I was writing, and carry off my pencils... and tear them to pieces in a minute." [...] Yarrell then adds an observation of his own, and contradicts an opinion of a famous scientist: [...] "Notwithstanding Buffon's assertion to the contrary, they can pick up and eat the smallest seeds... so perfect and useful is this singular instrument." [...] He goes on to criticise Buffon's description of the crossbill's beak as [...] "an error and defect of Nature, and a useless deformity" [...] as [...] "an erroneous and hasty conclusion". Yarrell concludes by writing [...] "I have never met with a more interesting, or more beautiful example, of the adaptation of means to an end, than {{is to be found}} in the beak, the tongue, and their muscles, in the Crossbill".|$|E
500|$|In July 1651, the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{was visited}} by three Rhode Islanders {{who had become}} Baptists: [...] John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall. [...] Massachusetts reacted harshly against the visit, imprisoning the three men, while Cotton preached [...] "against the heinousness" [...] of the Anabaptist {{opinions}} of these men. [...] The three men were given exorbitant fines, despite public opinion against punishment. [...] Friends paid the fines for Clarke and Crandall, but Holmes refused to allow anyone to pay his fine. [...] As a result, he was publicly whipped in such a cruel manner that he could only sleep on his elbows and knees for weeks afterwards. [...] News of the persecutions reached England and met with a negative reaction. [...] Sir Richard Saltonstall, a friend of Cotton's from Lincolnshire, wrote to Cotton and Wilson in 1652 rebuking them for the practices of the colony. [...] He wrote, [...] "It doth <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grieve my spirit to heare what sadd things are reported dayly of your tyranny and persecutions in New-England as that you fyne, whip and imprison men for their consciences." [...] He continued, [...] "these rigid wayes have layed you very lowe {{in the hearts of}} the saynts." [...] Roger Williams also wrote a treatise on these persecutions which was published after Cotton's death.|$|E
500|$|Promoted to captain on August 5, 1853, Grant was {{assigned}} to command Company F, 4th Infantry, at the newly constructed Fort Humboldt in California. He arrived at the fort on January 5, 1854, and reported to its commander Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan. Grant was bored and depressed about being separated from his wife Julia, {{and he began to}} drink. An officer who roomed with Grant said he [...] "fell too much under the influence of liquor to properly perform his duties. Colonel Buchanan demanded he should resign." [...] Historian Jean Edward Smith says, [...] "The story rings true." [...] When Grant was reprimanded by Buchanan for one drinking episode, Grant told Buchanan if he did not reform he would resign. One Sunday, Grant was rumored to have been found at his company's paytable influenced by drink. Keeping his pledge to Buchanan, Grant resigned, effective July 31, 1854, without explanation. Buchanan endorsed Grant's letter of resignation but did not submit any report that verified the incident. Grant was neither arrested nor faced court-martial, while the War Department stated, [...] "Nothing stands against his good name." [...] Grant said years later, [...] "the vice of intemperance (drunkenness) had <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to do with my decision to resign."

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+, considering {{that despite the}} [...] "convoluted plot" [...] the episode [...] "pays off in white-knuckle tension." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club labeled the episode as a [...] "good" [...] stand-alone story. He described it as [...] "a memorable episode, due {{in no small part}} to its humor", praising the [...] "simultaneously absurd and frightening" [...] story with scenes that make the viewer [...] "snicker even as you shudder". In addition, Handlen praised William Sanderson's performance, as well as the ending, calling it [...] "the punchline [...] of Mulder's deepest fears, a group [...] so secret that you never be sure they exist at all". Starpulse named the episode the tenth best of the series, defining it as [...] "very creepy" [...] and what turned The X-Files [...] "from a mere creepfest to a show that offered real psychological thrills". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. [...] The two wrote positively of the episode's flourishes, noting [...] "minute by minute, there is tons to enjoy." [...] However, Shearman and Pearson argue that the premise is [...] "disjointed and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> frustrating" [...] {{due to the lack of}} overall coherence and narrative. The plot for [...] "Blood" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin, under the title Fear.|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, Treves {{examined}} Merrick, {{observing that}} he was [...] "shy, confused, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> frightened, and evidently much cowed." [...] At this point, Treves assumed that the Elephant Man was an [...] "imbecile". He measured Merrick's head circumference at the large size of , his right wrist at [...] {{and one of his}} fingers at [...] in circumference. He noted that his skin was covered in papillomata (warty growths), the largest of which exuded an unpleasant smell. The subcutaneous tissue appeared to be weakened and caused a loosening of the skin, which in some areas hung away from the body. There were bone deformities in the right arm, both legs, and, most conspicuously, in the large skull. Despite the corrective surgery to his mouth in 1882, Merrick's speech remained barely intelligible. His left arm and hand were not large and were not deformed. His penis and scrotum were normal. Apart from his deformities and the lameness in his hip, Treves concluded that Merrick appeared to be in good general health. Norman later recalled that Merrick went to the hospital for examination [...] "two or three" [...] times and during one of their meetings, Treves gave Merrick his calling card. On one of the visits, Treves had photographs taken, and he provided Merrick with a set of copies which were later added to his autobiographical pamphlet. On 2 December, Treves presented Merrick {{at a meeting of the}} Pathological Society of London in Bloomsbury. Eventually, Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was [...] "stripped naked and felt like an animal in a cattle market." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} in trade publications. The Moving Picture World remarked that the play itself was not well-known, {{but that the}} plot was depicted adequately enough that it may encourage a re-perusal of the play. There was no fault found by the reviewer who stated, [...] "The characters of Hardcastle, Kate and Marlow are admirably done and seem to correctly interpret the original. The staging and costuming are {{in harmony with the}} play and reproduce the scenery of the time depicted with accuracy. The usefulness of a work of this sort does not end with the presentation of the play itself. There is an educational value which includes the costuming and reproduction of the surroundings of the time. These are so unfamiliar now that they afford <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> addition to the interest and pleasure of such a film. The work has been done so well that the company deserves commendation for undertaking the task. It is not an easy manner to reproduce a play of this character, and when it is well done the company performing it deserves praise." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed on almost all points, [...] "In numerous details the illusion is dispelled, for the scenery is manifestly not of the eighteenth century. No contemporary of Goldsmith ever rode in such a barouche as appears in this film, nor lived in such a house as Mr. Hardcastle. The final tableau is as artificial as set pieces which have gone out of style at funerals. With all of its imperfections there is considerable of virile comedy in the film." [...] Though the Mirror reviewer stated that despite the elimination of the Hastings and Constance Neville subplot, the acting is clear enough that audiences do not need prior knowledge of the play to appreciate the film.|$|E
