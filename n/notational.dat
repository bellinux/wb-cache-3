5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a <b>notational</b> error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another <b>notational</b> error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.|$|E
5|$|The Dietrich {{hypothesis}} interprets rongorongo {{not as a}} script, but as a <b>notational</b> {{system for}} astronomical, calendrical, and navigational data. This hypothesis rests on {{an analysis of the}} graphical qualities of rongorongo, alongside an understanding of Polynesian history, language, and culture.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, Takemitsu {{began to make}} use of {{traditional}} Japanese instruments in his music, and even took up playing the biwa—an instrument he used in his score for the film Seppuku (1962). In 1967, Takemitsu received a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, to commemorate the orchestra's 125th anniversary, for which he wrote November Steps for biwa, shakuhachi, and orchestra. Initially, Takemitsu had great difficulty in uniting these instruments from such different musical cultures in one work. Eclipse for biwa and shakuhachi (1966) illustrates Takemitsu's attempts to find a viable <b>notational</b> system for these instruments, which in normal circumstances neither sound together nor are used in works notated in any system of Western staff notation.|$|E
5|$|The passage {{beginning}} at bars 231 ("NUN: Scrutemur vias nostras") presents a rhythmic texture new to Stravinsky, which strongly resembles the multilayered rhythms of Stockhausen's Zeitmaße, which Robert Craft was rehearsing in Stravinsky's home {{at precisely the}} time of composition (16 January to 14 February 1958). Stravinsky attended not only these rehearsals but also the recording sessions for Zeitmaße, following the score with great interest. The published score of Threni is also the first of Stravinsky's works to adopt the <b>notational</b> device of replacing the staves in silent measures with whites space on the page, a feature frequently found in Stravinsky's manuscripts as early as 1916, but only in print from this point onward. This feature {{is also found in}} Stockhausen's score.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} in applications of linear algebra to physics, the Einstein notation or Einstein summation convention is a <b>notational</b> convention that implies summation over {{a set of}} indexed terms in a formula, thus achieving <b>notational</b> brevity. As part of mathematics it is a <b>notational</b> subset of Ricci calculus; however, it is often used in applications in physics that do not distinguish between tangent and cotangent spaces. It was introduced to physics by Albert Einstein in 1916.|$|E

25|$|Medieval scribes {{who wrote}} in Latin {{increased}} their writing speed by combining characters and by introducing <b>notational</b> abbreviations. Others conjoined letters for aesthetic purposes. For example, in blackletter, letters with right-facing bowls (b, o, and p) and those with left-facing bowls (c, e, o, d, g and q) were written with the facing edges of the bowls superimposed. In many script forms, characters such as h, m, and n had their vertical strokes superimposed. Scribes also used <b>notational</b> abbreviations {{to avoid having to}} write a whole character in one stroke. Manuscripts in the fourteenth century employed hundreds of such abbreviations.|$|E
25|$|According to statute, one silver yuan {{is worth}} three New Taiwan dollars. Despite decades of inflation, this ratio {{has not been}} adjusted. This made the silver yuan a purely <b>notational</b> {{currency}} long ago, nearly impossible to buy, sell, or use.|$|E
25|$|Pachelbel {{employed}} white mensural notation {{when writing}} out numerous compositions (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias); a <b>notational</b> system that uses hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). The system had been widely used since the 15th century but was gradually being replaced {{in this period}} by modern notation (sometimes called black notation). In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity.|$|E
25|$|A {{number is}} a {{mathematical}} object used to count, measure, and label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth. A <b>notational</b> symbol {{that represents a}} number is called a numeral. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). In common usage, number may refer to a symbol, a word, or a mathematical abstraction.|$|E
25|$|Most {{languages}} {{only have}} one phonemic rhotic consonant (only about 18% of the world's languages {{have more than one}} rhotic). As a result, rhotic consonants are generally transcribed with the < r > character. This usage is common practice in Americanist and also other <b>notational</b> traditions (such as the IPA). This lack of detail, although economical and phonologically sound, requires a more careful reading of a given language's phonological description to determine the precise phonetics. A list of rhotics is given below.|$|E
25|$|Isidore of Seville {{wrote about}} the local music in the 6th century. His {{influences}} were predominantly Greek, and yet he was an original thinker, and recorded {{some of the first}} details about the early music of the Christian church. He perhaps is most famous in musical history for declaring that {{it was not possible to}} notate sounds, an assertion which revealed his ignorance of the <b>notational</b> system of ancient Greece, suggesting that this knowledge had been lost with the fall of the Roman Empire in the west.|$|E
25|$|The musical {{notation}} (melekket) {{used for the}} chants, is not a typical <b>notational</b> system since it does not represent pitch or melody. Rather, it is as a mnemonic. Most studies conclude {{that there has been}} impressive consistency since the 1500s. It is likely that Ethiopian liturgical chants have undergone an evolution similar to that of European liturgical chants. It can be assumed that the notations have become more and more complex as time has passed. Regional varieties may have become standardized over time, and more symbols and segments of music have become available for composers.|$|E
25|$|Handbells can {{be played}} as a handbell tree where the handles are {{interlaced}} within each other, allowing multiple bells to be played with mallets to obtain an undamped sound. This performance technique was invented by Louise Frier in the 1980s. It was further developed by Barbara Brocker who developed a standardized bell layout. It is used by many soloists. The <b>notational</b> symbol used for Handbell Tree features a series of interlocking diagonal lines, one for each handbell. The pitch is placed at the lowest point of each diagonal line.|$|E
25|$|Just as the {{signature}} of the metric is differently defined in the literature, this quantity is not consistently named. The interval (as defined here) is {{sometimes referred to as}} the interval squared. Even the square root of the present interval occurs. When signature and interval are fixed, ambiguity still remains as which coordinate is the time coordinate. It may be the fourth, or it may be the zeroth. This is not an exhaustive list of <b>notational</b> inconsistencies. It {{is a fact of life}} that one has to check out the definitions first thing when one consults the relativity literature.|$|E
25|$|Viadana is {{important}} {{in the development of the}} early Baroque technique of basso continuo, and its <b>notational</b> method, known as figured bass. While he did not invent the method—figured basses occur in published sources from at least as early as 1597 —he was the first to use it in a widely distributed collection of sacred music (Cento concerti con il basso continuo), which he published in Venice in 1602. Agostino Agazzari in 1607 published a treatise describing how to interpret the new figured bass, though it is clear that many performers had by this time already learned the new method, at least in the most progressive musical centers in Italy.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{suppose we}} wish to divide by the regular number 54 = 2133. 54 is a divisor of 603, and 603/54 = 4000, so {{dividing}} by 54 in sexagesimal {{can be accomplished by}} multiplying by 4000 and shifting three places. In sexagesimal 4000 = 13600 + 660 + 401, or (as listed by Joyce) 1:6:40. Thus, 1/54, in sexagesimal, is 1/60 + 6/602 + 40/603, also denoted 1:6:40 as Babylonian <b>notational</b> conventions did not specify the power of the starting digit. Conversely 1/4000 = 54/603, so division by 1:6:40 = 4000 can be accomplished by instead multiplying by 54 and shifting three sexagesimal places.|$|E
25|$|Babylonian {{mathematics}} {{were written}} using a sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, {{as well as}} the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. It is likely the sexagesimal system was chosen because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30. Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the decimal system. The power of the Babylonian <b>notational</b> system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different than multiplying integers, similar to our modern notation. The <b>notational</b> system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the Renaissance, and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computation accuracy and power; for example, the Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of √2 accurate to five decimal places. The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context. By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however it was only used for intermediate positions. This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions, thus the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.|$|E

The marriage was a lasting one, and Danuta's drafting skills were of great value to the composer: she became his copyist, and she solved some of the <b>notational</b> challenges of his later works.|$|E
500|$|Euler {{introduced}} and popularized several <b>notational</b> conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced {{the concept of}} a function and was the first to write f(x) to denote the function f applied to the argument x. He also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric functions, the letter [...] for the base of the natural logarithm (now also known as Euler's number), the Greek letter Σ for summations and the letter [...] to denote the imaginary unit. The use of the Greek letter π to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with Welsh mathematician William Jones.|$|E
500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onward, Stockhausen {{designed}} (and {{in some cases}} arranged to have printed) his own musical scores for his publisher, Universal Edition, which often involved unconventional devices. The score for his piece Refrain, for instance, includes a rotatable (refrain) on a transparent plastic strip. Early in the 1970s, he ended his agreement with Universal Edition and began publishing his own scores under the Stockhausen-Verlag imprint [...] This arrangement allowed him to extend his <b>notational</b> innovations (for example, dynamics in Weltparlament [...] are coded in colour) and resulted in eight German Music Publishers Society Awards between 1992 (Luzifers Tanz) and 2005 (Hoch-Zeiten, from Sonntag aus Licht) [...] The score of Momente, published just before the composer's death in 2007, won this prize for the ninth time [...]|$|E

Schwartz, in the May 1992 edition of Smithsonian, praised Houle's prose in Wings for My Flight, and wrote that the story is [...] "told with a charming simplicity in fewer than 200 pages".

500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for <b>notational</b> conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E
