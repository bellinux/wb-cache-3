40|$|Self-operation {{concept is}} {{proposed}} {{to learn the}} past experiences of network operations and apply the learned operation experiences to solve new but similar problems. It works based upon the observation that actions appropriate for achieving an objective resemble each other in similar network contexts. Plenty of such similarities exist {{at the level of}} <b>network</b> <b>elements,</b> <b>functions,</b> and their relations. Similarity measure definition and application are essential components for the self-operation to apply the learned operation experiences. This paper provides a solution for self-operation to define and apply two types of similarity measures for two self-operation use cases. The first use case answers how to select a best suitable function to achieve any given objective. The second use case tells how the selected function should be configured with the most optimal parameter values so that the given objective could be achieved. This solution is realized on a demonstrator implementing the self-operation concept. Corresponding experiments are made with the demonstrator. The experimental results show that the solution works well for self-operation as expected. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In network {{management}} applications, load balanc-ing has typically been achieved by manually configuring the appli-cation in-situ or using configuration information generated using offline tools. As networks increase in scale and heterogeneity, management applications are being {{designed to take}} advantage of scalable computer hardware and often have multiple instances, each of which bears a portion of the management load of the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> or <b>functions</b> being managed. The communica-tion between management applications and the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> they are managing is often stateful, posing a challenge for load balancing because connections must be managed if responsibility for managing some <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> change from one instance to another during load balancing. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that enables load balancing of telecommunication management applications for an arbitrary number of VNFs (Virtual Network Functions). The algorithm, triggered by NFV (Network Function Virtualisaton) orchestration, is horizontally scalable and there is no single point of failure once two or more management application instances are running.

30|$|The RAN of FNA {{consists}} of two <b>network</b> <b>elements.</b> By decomposing the traditional BS into centralized processing entity (CPE) and antenna element (AE), the RAN of FNA {{consists of}} two new <b>network</b> <b>elements.</b> The <b>function</b> of the CPE is to maintain the networking, implement the signal processing, handle the CP and UP, manage the radio resources including the connected AEs, and construct on-demand user-centric serving set for specific users. The CPE can be located at a macro BS or at another type of BS that has the required processing ability. The CPE mainly lies as a logical node. The AE {{is responsible for the}} radio signals’ transmission/reception. The backhaul links between the CPE and AE could be the fiber, wireless backhaul, wired connections, and so on. The capacity and latency abilities for different backhaul links are different, which also pose challenges to resource allocations. The backhaul issues will be focused on for future researches.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Most {{of network}} {{management}} systems {{adhere to the}} centralized and passive approach. For large and heterogeneous multimedia networks, the centralized approach are increasingly incapable of providing required and efficient management and of measuring up to requirements of some emerging services. What come after that is the distributed approach which require the individual <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> be {{responsible for their own}} simple management chores such as performance monitoring, or fault detection. Current distributed approach are inadequate in managing of the multimedia networks where the applications are contentious to the bandwidth and sensitive to the transmission delay. In this paper, we study a new approach to multimedia network management. The new approach, which relies on the active networking technology and thereof called active approach, enables the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> executing <b>functions</b> or programs. In contrast to the traditional network management strategies which resort to the centralized approach, following this approach yields a decentralized framework, which accedes the <b>network</b> components or <b>elements</b> be responsible for their own administrative chores. The administrative activities are implemented by a group of management functions embedded in the <b>network</b> <b>elements.</b> After analyzing several functions of such kind, we realize that the communication between the managed elements or stations is of serious security concern.

40|$|Abstract]: Though being centralized, {{traditional}} {{approaches of}} network management have accomplished their overall mission {{that is to}} provide efficient management of underlying heterogeneous distributed networks. However the size of networks has been growing, and so has the number of novel applications and protocols running on the networks. These new services raise more stringent requirements, and significantly increase the complexity of network administration. Apparently the traditional approaches to network management are no longer adequate {{for the management of}} multimedia networks. Much research has been carried out in past years which mainly deployed the decentralization technique. These decentralized approaches are at most a step toward improving the centralized approach, but still not capable of efficiently managing multimedia networks. In this paper, we study a new approach to multimedia network management. The new approach, which relies on active networking technology and therefore called active approach, enables the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> to execute <b>functions</b> or programs.

40|$|For {{the study}} of {{psychological}} processes in cognitive science modelling two general approaches rule nowadays research: Artificial Intelligence (top-down) functional symbolic models, and Connectionist (bottom-up) neural networks modelling. Our goal in {{this paper is to}} show that analyzing the theoretical level of description and explanation of this models an important theoretical gap between both is found. Connectionist modelling through neural networks face at present several theoretical problems that have to be accounted in order to build realistic and feasible models of the brain. The lack of biological constraints, network stability or serial behaviour, for example, are relevant issues to bear in mind. Our proposed model, conceptual networks, can be located halfway between the traditional semantic networks and artificial neural networks modelling, and is presented as an attempt of building a necessary bridge between this levels of description, focussing on the correspondence between the functional level and the level that can be modelled by artificial neural <b>networks.</b> The <b>elements</b> and <b>functioning</b> of conceptual networks are based in biological and psychological constraints necessary to build realistic models of actual cognitive processes in brain functioning...|$|R

Several aspects are addressed. A first part is devoted to the clarification and the improvements of the performance bounds computed using this theory: the different typesof service curves and the relation between them are clarified; a new operator of packet curves introduced, in order to describe the packetsizes {{the same way as the}} flows; and we improve the way of computing worst-case performance bounds, that is classically based on the(min,plus) operators, by introducing linear programs that compute the exact worst-case performances in some cases and improve the bounds inthe other cases. The second part presents some examples other application of the results first developed for networks calculus: algorithms of convolution of (min,plus) functions have received a lot of attention by the network calculus community in order to compute bounds efficiently. We show here an example of use for approximating the numerical solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Another example is to use the concept of arrival curve to supervise a flow.
