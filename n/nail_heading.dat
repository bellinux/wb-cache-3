40|$|Soil nailing {{has been}} widely used for {{improving}} slope stability {{over the last three}} decades around the world and is currently the predominant method used for upgrading the stability of existing soil cut slopes in Hong Kong. Although interaction between soil and nails has been investigated widely, only few studies were conducted on the role of <b>nail</b> <b>heads.</b> Therefore, the objectives of this research are to further improve the fundamental understanding of the behaviour of nailed slopes and to investigate the role of <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> in improving slope stability and reducing ground deformation. In this research, a series of CDG dense fill model slopes reinforced with different sizes of <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> including grillage were destabilized by controlling long-term transient seepage in centrifuge. The prototype slope angle and height were 650 and 15 m, respectively. Pore water pressures, slope deformation, axial nail forces and contact pressures between soil and <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> were measured. Pore water pressure transducers were modified into tensiometers to measure high suction in centrifuge. A four-stage procedure was developed to saturate the tensiometers. Furthermore, an experimental framework was estabilished to identify whether a tensiometer had been desaturated or not. Three-dimensional coupled numerical simulations using ABAQUS were conducted to back-analyse the centrifuge test results. The three-dimensional numerical simulations considered the coupled effects of soil deformation and pore water pressure changes. It is found that, a global failure was evident in the unreinforced slope after being subjected to long-term transient seepage. Installation of soil nails prevented the formation of the global failure but not a tension crack at the crest. The presence of <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> prevented the global failure and the formation of the crack after even over two years of transient seepage. With the greater sizes of <b>nail</b> <b>heads,</b> (a) crest settlements decreased, (b) the mobilised axial force at the <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> on each <b>nail</b> and a total of each mobilised maximum axial nail force (Tmax) increased, (c) the location of the Tmax shifted towards the slope surface, and (d) the normalized contact pressures increased at the quasi-steady state. The global failure which occurred in the unreinforced slope in centrifuge was reasonably consistent with numerical simulations. General trends in crest settlements and axial forces at the quasi-steady state were also captured in the numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|Soil nailing {{has been}} one of the most popular {{techniques}} for improving the stability of slopes, in which rows of nails and a structural grillage system connecting <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> are commonly applied. In order to examine the spatial-reinforcement effect of soil nails in slopes, a three-dimensional (3 D) numerical model has been developed and used to back-analyze a field test slope under surcharge loading. Incremental elastoplastic analyses have been performed to study the internal deformation within the slope and the development of nail forces during the application of top surcharge loads. Different treatments of the grillage constraints at <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> have been studied. It is shown that the numerical predictions compare favorably with the field test measurements. Both the numerical and the field test results suggest that soil nails are capable of increasing the overall stability of a loose fill slope for the loading conditions considered in this study. The axial force mobilization in the two rows of soil nails presents a strong dependence on the relative distance with the central section. With the surcharge loads increased near the bearing capacity of the slope, a grillage system connecting all the <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> can affect the stabilizing mechanism to a notable extent...|$|R

25|$|As {{development}} {{began on}} the nail, there were three major causes of failure to be overcome. These were having the <b>nail</b> — <b>head</b> and all — rip through the sheathing, having the entire nail {{pull out of the}} frame, and having the nail's midsection snap under stress. Early research showed that the larger the head, the less chance there was of the nail being ripped through the sheathing. However, the difficult task was increasing the <b>nail's</b> <b>head</b> while still making it compatible with popular nail gun models. After finding the ideal <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> size, the next task to conquer was preventing the entire nail from pulling out of the frame. This was overcome by adding barbed ring shanks around the lower portion of the nail. During the testing of the shanks, it was noted that above a certain point the shanks no longer strengthened the nail but instead weakened the nail by making it more susceptible to shearing. The final touch to the original prototype was a special high-carbon alloy designed by a metallurgist that had the perfect combination of stiffness and pliability, giving it the highest possible strength.|$|R

50|$|The {{protective}} {{nature of}} asphalt shingles primarily {{comes from the}} long-chain hydrocarbons impregnating the paper. Over time in the hot sun, the hydrocarbons soften and when rain falls the hydrocarbons are gradually washed out of the shingles and down onto the ground. Along eaves and complex rooflines more water is channeled so in these areas the loss occurs more quickly. Eventually {{the loss of the}} heavy oils causes the fibers to shrink, exposing the <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> under the shingle flaps. The shrinkage also breaks up the surface coating of sand adhered {{to the surface of the}} paper, and eventually causes the paper to begin to tear itself apart. Once the <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> are exposed, water running down the roof can seep into the building around the nail shank, resulting in rotting of roof building materials and causing moisture damage to ceilings and paint inside.|$|R

25|$|Soil nailing is a {{technique}} in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements – normally steel reinforcing bars.

30|$|With {{the recent}} concern toward wood {{utilization}} in large-scale structures, increasing the strength performance of structural elements is important. Developing structural elements using board materials {{is one of}} the measures to increase the strength performance. A high-performance nailed joint to resist shear loading is necessary to increase the strength performance of wooden structural elements using board materials. This study was conducted {{in order to understand the}} shear properties of nailed joints intended for large-scale structures. Shear tests were conducted with nailed joints using structural plywood, medium density fiberboard, or particleboard. The yield resistance was determined from experimental load-slip displacement curves, and was also calculated using European yield theory (EYT). Consequently, the nailed joint specimens using MDF showed an experimental yield resistance higher than those using structural sugi plywood. The nailed joint specimens using PB also showed a high value similar to that of the joints using structural karamatsu plywood. The yield resistance of most of the joint specimen series calculated using European yield theory showed slightly higher values than the experimental yield resistance. This study observed the deformation behavior around <b>nail</b> the <b>head</b> under shear loading. No deformation was observed from the appearance at the initial region of the test. The <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> started a rotational deformation when the joint started yielding. Moreover, the side panel became partially embedded. The <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> was completely embedded at the maximum load of the specimen. Nail pull-out from the base material was not remarkably evident. This deformation behavior was observed in all the board materials used in this study.|$|R

40|$|Finite {{difference}} {{analyses were}} conducted to explore the possible behaviour of soil nails in loose fill slopes which were formed by strain-softening materials. Numerical models simulating a 20 m high 35 degrees loose fill slope were set up. With the use of an undrained strain-softening soil model, the behaviour of a loose fill slope reinforced with soil nails subjected to rainfall infiltration was studied. Results indicated that soil nails together with a proper facing structure may reduce the deformation of a loose fill slope caused by rainfall infiltration and hence maintain the stability of the slope. Tensile forces in the soil nails were mobilised through the effective connections between the facing structure and the <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> when a potential slide was being initiated. Through this mechanism, the development of a flow slide at shallow depths could be avoided by the pull out resistance between the soil and the nails at deeper locations of the slope. Results also showed that, if the soil nails were not connected to a facing structure or <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> at the slope surface, a global failure mechanism involving the development of a flow slide could be observed, which was similar to that of a loose fill slope without soil nails.

40|$|Soil nails may be {{installed}} at various inclinations to the horizontal for different practical purposes. Different inclinations result in different effects on behaviour of nailed slopes. The orientation of soil nails {{plays an important}} role in the development of axial forces. When a soil nail is placed in the direction of tensile strain of soil, tensile forces will be developed. Consequently, there is an increase in shear resistance of the reinforced soil. When the soil nail is oriented in the direction of compressive strain of the soil, compressive forces will be developed. This leads to a decrease in shear resistance of the reinforced soil. In order to investigate the effects of nail inclinations on the stability of a densely compacted completely decomposed granite (CDG) slope, four centrifuge tests were conducted with soil nails inclined at 10 °, 20 °, 45 ° and 55 ° to the horizontal together with <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> size of 600 mm x 600 mm (in prototype). Each CDG filled slope was compacted to a relatively density of 95 % and every slope was inclined at 65 ° to the horizontal. For each test, soil nails were installed in nine rows and in five columns with horizontal spacing of 2. 0 m (in prototype) and vertical spacing of 1. 5 m (in prototype). The thickness of each <b>nail</b> <b>head</b> was 0. 2 m (in prototype). At 30 g, each model slope was equivalent to 15 m in height and it was destabilized by both transient and quasi-steady state seepage conditions in flight. Particle image velocity method was used to analyze deformation of soil developed in the centrifuge modelling. In addition, three dimensional coupled finite element (FE) analyses of slopes with nails inclined at 10 °, 20 °, 45 ° and 55 ° were carried out to assist in the interpretation of results from the centrifuge model tests. Centrifuge test results reveal that cracks were observed at the crest in slopes with nails inclined at 45 ° and 55 °. However, no crack was observed at the crest in slopes with nails inclined at 10 ° and 20 °. It is evident that an increase in the nail inclination could not prevent the formation of crack on the crest. Both centrifuge test results and FE analyses show that no continuous slip plane and no yielding of any nail were observed in each nailed slope at the end of the quasi-steady state. Measured settlements increased with angles of nail inclination since smaller tensile forces were mobilized to restrain slope movements in the slopes. FE analyses reveal that horizontal displacements increased with an increase in angles of nail inclination. Both centrifuge test results and FE analyses show that greater tensile forces were mobilized in slopes with a small inclination angle of nails. On the other hand, greater compressive forces were mobilized in slopes with a large inclination angle of nails. Greater measured and computed contact pressures were observed in slopes with small inclination of nails. It is evident that the loads were substantially carried by the <b>nail</b> <b>heads.</b> Small loads were carried by <b>nail</b> <b>heads</b> in slopes with a large inclination angle of nails...|$|R

50|$|Another nailing {{system is}} the soil nail and root {{technology}} (SNART). Here, steel nails are inserted very rapidly into a slope by percussion, vibration or screw methods. Grid spacing is typically 0.8 to 1.5 m, nails are 25 to 50 mm in diameter and may be as long as 20 m. Nails are installed perpendicular to and through the failure plane, and are designed to resist bending and shear (rather than tension) using geotechnical engineering principles. Potential failure surfaces less than 2 m deep normally require the nails to be wider near the top, which may be achieved with steel plates fastened at the <b>nail</b> <b>heads.</b> Plant roots often form an effective and aesthetic facing to prevent soil loss between the nails.|$|R
