40|$|We {{show that}} typical Renyi's {{statistical}} mechanics' quantifiers exhibit poles. We are {{referring to the}} partition function Z and the mean energy. Renyi's entropy {{is characterized by a}} real parameter α. The poles emerge in a <b>numerable</b> <b>set</b> of rational numbers belonging to the α-line. Physical effects of these poles are studied by appeal to dimensional regularization, as usual. Interesting effects are found, as for instance, gravitational ones. Comment: 22 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of steering complex dynamical systems among equilibria in their state space in efficient ways. Efficiency is considered as the possibility of compactly representing the (typically very large, or infinite) set of reachable equilibria and quickly computing plans to move among them. To this purpose, {{we consider}} the possibility of building lattice structures by purposefully introducing quantization of inputs. We consider {{different ways in which}} control actions can be encoded in a finite or <b>numerable</b> <b>set</b> of symbols, review different applications where symbolic encoding of control actions can be employed with success, and provide a unified framework in which to study the many different possible manifestations of the idea.

40|$|In this paper,we first give {{arguments}} {{supporting the}} idea that a B. T. Z black hole can face a transplanckian problem even when its mass is small. K. M. M quantum theory is applied to the Hawking evaporation of Schwarzchild and B. T. Z black holes. Working in the physically safe quasi position representation, we argue that the oscillating term present in a previous analysis is removed so that actually one doesn’t need an average procedure. We expand the s wave function as the exponential of a series in the minimal length of the new quantum theory. This reduces an infinite order differential equation to a <b>numerable</b> <b>set</b> of finite order ones. We obtain the striking result that the infinity of arbitrary constants induced by the order of the wave equation has no physical meaning due to normalisation. We finally construct gaussian wave paquets and study their trajectories. We suggest a quantitative description of the non locality zone and its dependance on the K. M. M energy scale. Potential incidences on unitarity are briefly evoked. ...|$|E

40|$|Discrete {{mathematics}} is characterized as {{the branch of}} mathematics dealing with finite and <b>numerable</b> <b>sets.</b> Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and real-life problems. In particular the graph theory has numerous applications in logistics. Throughout this project some of the knowlegde adquired from the course “Matemática Discreta” {{will be given a}} computational implementation. The code will be written in Haskell language and a free version of it will be available in GitHub under the name: MDenHaskell. The work will focus on the graph theory and will provide some examples and algorithms in order to give an introduction of it and how it can be implemented in Haskell. At first, two chapters will be presented as a gentle reminder of basic concepts related to the set theory and the relations that can be established among them. The third chapter will introduce the main topic, graph theory, with different representations, definitions and examples on graphs. It will go through aspects such as morphism, connectivity and paths in graphs. Finally some properties and advantages of working with adjacency matrices will be presented in the fourth chapter. This project leaves the door open for the community of programmers to continue and improve it. It {{can be used as a}} self-learning tool as well as to make calculations that by hand would be tedious. Universidad de Sevilla. Grado en Matemática...|$|R

40|$|When an {{isolated}} quantum system is {{driven out of}} equilibrium, expectation values of general observables start oscillating in time. This article reviews {{the general theory of}} such temporal fluctuations. We first survey some results on the strength of such temporal fluctuations. For example temporal fluctuations are exponentially small in the system's volume for generic systems whereas they fall-off algebraically in integrable systems. We then concentrate on the the so-called quench scenario where the system is driven out-of-equilibrium under the application of a sudden perturbation. For sufficiently small perturbations, temporal fluctuations of physical observables can be characterized in full generality and can be used as an effective tool to probe quantum criticality of the underlying model. In the off-critical region the distribution becomes Gaussian. Close to criticality the distribution becomes a universal function uniquely characterized by a single critical exponent, that we compute explicitly. This contrasts standard equilibrium quantum fluctuations for which the critical distribution depends on a <b>numerable</b> <b>set</b> of critical coefficients and is known only for limited examples. The possibility of using temporal fluctuations to determine pseudo-critical boundaries in optical lattice experiments is further reviewed.

40|$|Nonlinear initial-boundary value {{problem on}} deep-water gravity waves of finite {{amplitude}} is solved approximately (up to small terms of higher order) {{assuming that the}} waves are generated by an initial disturbance to {{the water and the}} horizontal dimensions of the initially disturbed body of the water are much larger than the magnitude of the free surface displacement. A <b>numerable</b> <b>set</b> of specific free surface waves is obtained in closed form and it is shown that free surface waves produced by an arbitrary initial disturbance to the water is a combination (not superposition: the waves are nonlinear) of the specific waves. A set of dispersive wave packets is found with one-to-one correspondence between the packets and positive integers, say, packet numbers, such that any initial free surface displacement gradually disintegrates into a number (limited or unlimited, depending on initial conditions) of the wave packets. The greater the packet number, the shorter the wavelength of the packet’s carrier wave com-ponent, the slower the packet travels, the slower the packet disperses; evolution of any of the packets is not influenced by evolution of any other one. It is found that in case of infinitesimal wave amplitude the present theory is in agreement with linear wave theory. On the other hand, the behaviour of wave packets of large numbers and asymptotic behaviour of solutions of Schrödinger equation for weakly nonlinear waves are found to be similar, except for dis-persion The theory is tested against experiments performed in a water tank...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a two agents {{asymmetric}} stag hunt game. The model has an in. nity of strict, Pareto rankable Nash equilibria. The equilibrium selection problem is solved {{by appealing to}} the stochastic stability concept put forward by Young (1993). We prove two main results. When the action <b>sets</b> are <b>numerable</b> in. nite <b>sets,</b> then for any value of the distributive parameter we can expect {{the emergence of a}} norm involving less than maximal cooperation.

40|$|How {{much is it}} {{possible}} to compare continuous entities with discrete entities? Generally speaking, the difference between analog and digital corresponds to the difference between continuous and discrete representations of given entities; a continuous, or analog, representation is, for example, the one provided by the movement of a needle on the dial of an instrument, or by the one who operates on the continuum of matter, while a digital representation is mediated only by numbers. What is digital is different from what is analog, that is not numerable and not representable by a discrete set of elements. The term digital is then referred to discrete mathematics, that works with a discrete set of elements, while analog entities are managed by continuous mathematics, that deals with an infinite (<b>numerable</b> or not) <b>set</b> of elements. In the field of survey, integration between measurement techniques of different nature (direct and indirect instrumentation) results {{in the use of the}} numeric common denominator to manage and focus the nature of the collected data. In this scenario, it is necessary to consider the combined action of these techniques in order to have more than a simple collection and summation of data. As an example of this, the survey experience of the “Complesso Monumentale del Verlasce” in Venafro will be described in the following...|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} of strain {{localization}} and damage band formation, inspired by population dynamics, is introduced in this paper. The basic assumption is that strain at nanoscales can be described {{by means of a}} kinetic model of molecular interaction. The strain energy induced by external sources concentrates at a <b>numerable</b> <b>set</b> of mobile entities, hereby called “strainions”. Under normal conditions these strain energy accumulators are uniformly distributed within the body. If the energy level between some molecules increases too sharply, for instance due to increasing strains, the strainions begin to dissipate heat energy and strain localization may occur. By coupling the Fick’s law for diffusion and a classical conservation law for heat production, the random motion of heat energy can be modelled. A number of physical parameters are introduced in the model. These are a proportionality constant k that measures the strength of heat attraction (called the “thermotaxis ” coefficient), a “motility ” constant c, and a diffusion constant D. A differential system of two nonlinear equations is obtained, which admits the uniform solution, corresponding to the equilibrium state. Then, we investigate, through the method of small perturbations, if a sudden small disturbance to the uniform state remains local and extinguishes, or propagates in space and time, leading to strain localization and damage. We found that strain localization occurs if the motility c of the strainions or the decay rate of the heat concentration are small or, inversely, if the rate of heat production or the thermotaxis coefficient k are large. ...|$|E
40|$|Can we reduce Quantum Field Theory (QFT) to {{a quantum}} computation? Can physics be {{simulated}} by a quantum computer? Do {{we believe that}} a quantum field is ultimately made of a <b>numerable</b> <b>set</b> of quantum systems that are unitarily interacting? A positive answer to these questions corresponds to substituting QFT with a theory of quantum cellular automata (QCA), and the present work is examining this hypothesis. These investigations {{are part of a}} large research program on a "quantum-digitalization" of physics, with Quantum Theory as a special theory of information, and Physics as emergent from the same quantum-information processing. A QCA-based QFT has tremendous potential advantages compared to QFT, being quantum "ab-initio" and free from the problems plaguing QFT due to the continuum hypothesis. Here I will show how dynamics emerges from the quantum processing, how the QCA can reproduce the Dirac-field phenomenology at large scales, and the kind of departures from QFT that that should be expected at a Planck-scale discreteness. I will introduce the notions of linear field quantum automaton and local-matrix quantum automaton, in terms of which I will provide the solution to the Feynman's problem about the possibility of simulating a Fermi field with a quantum computer.
