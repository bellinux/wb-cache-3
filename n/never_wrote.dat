5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he never}} {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} composing a full opera, and considered many subjects– including that of the Nibelung saga later adapted by Wagner, about which he corresponded with his sister Fanny– he <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> {{more than a few}} pages of sketches for any project. In Mendelssohn's last years the opera manager Benjamin Lumley tried to contract him to write an opera from Shakespeare's The Tempest on a libretto by Eugène Scribe, and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847, the year of Mendelssohn's death. The libretto was eventually set by Fromental Halévy. At his death Mendelssohn left some sketches for an opera on the story of the Lorelei.|$|E

He states: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>write</b> anything down, since I've been in the song writing business – 20 years, I <b>never</b> <b>write</b> anything on paper, everything comes {{off the top of}} my head. I get in there, do the track, and whatever the track feels like, that's what I do." ...|$|R

5|$|From August 1953, Montalban ceased {{working for}} London Life, {{publishing}} {{her work in}} the magazine Prediction, one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on the uses of the tarot, in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for Prediction. Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines. Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's Your Stars and Love and Madeline Alvarez's Love and the Stars. She <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate her views, and was critical of those books that taught the reader how to perform their own horoscopes, believing that they put professional astrologers out of business.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greek Aristotle (384 BC–322 BC) {{wrote in}} his Meteorology of how the earth had the {{potential}} for physical change, including the belief that all rivers and seas at one time did not exist where they were, and were dry. The Greek writer Xenophanes (570 BC–480 BC) wrote of how inland marine fossils were evidence that massive periodic flooding had wiped out mankind {{several times in the}} past, but <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> of land formation or shifting seashores. Du Yu (222–285) a Chinese Jin Dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills. The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284–364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how what was once the Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands. The later Persian Muslim scholar Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) hypothesized that India was once covered by the Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.|$|E

25|$|As a rule, the {{simplest}} representation is always chosen. A double vowel is <b>never</b> <b>written</b> {{in an open}} syllable, and a double consonant is <b>never</b> <b>written</b> {{at the end of}} a word or when next to another consonant. A double vowel is rarely followed by a double consonant, as it could be simplified by writing them both single.|$|R

25|$|Bruckner <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> an opera, {{and as much}} as he was a fan of Wagner's music dramas, he was {{uninterested in}} drama. In 1893 he thought about writing an opera called Astra based on a novel by Gertrud Bollé-Hellmund.|$|E
25|$|Thirty {{people were}} present. Soubirous {{reported}} {{later that the}} lady had taught her a prayer, which she said every day of her life, but <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> down or repeated to anyone. By this time, the news was spreading to other towns, and many people assumed that Soubirous's lady was the Virgin Mary.|$|E
25|$|A.N. Whitehead {{planned a}} fourth volume of Principia Mathematica, on geometry, but <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> it. His 1914 {{correspondence}} with Bertrand Russell reveals that his intended approach to geometry can be seen, {{with the benefit}} of hindsight, as mereological in essence. This work culminated in Whitehead (1916) and the mereological systems of Whitehead (1919, 1920).|$|E

25|$|Though {{the novelist}} and essayist Jerome K. Jerome {{was born in}} the town, he <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> about it. Some writers have, {{including}} the Walsall born John Petty (1919–1973) who set a number of his books in Walsall, most famously Five Fags a Day (1956). More recently the comic novelist Paul McDonald has used Walsall as a location for Surviving Sting (2001) and Kiss Me Softly, Amy Turtle (2004).|$|E
25|$|This final {{critique}} of writing {{with which the}} dialogue concludes {{seems to be one}} of the more interesting facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> a thing.|$|E
25|$|Despite having invented {{much of the}} {{technology}} of software, Dijkstra eschewed {{the use of computers}} in his own work for many decades. Even after he succumbed to his UT colleagues' encouragement and acquired a Macintosh computer, he used it only for e-mail and for browsing the World Wide Web. Dijkstra <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> his articles using a computer. He preferred to rely on his typewriter and later on his Montblanc pen. Dijkstra's favorite writing instrument was the Montblanc Meisterstück fountain pen. He repeatedly tried other pens, but none ever displaced the Montblanc.|$|E

25|$|Though Symmes himself <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> a {{book about}} his ideas, several authors {{published}} works discussing his ideas. McBride wrote Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres in 1826. It appears that Reynolds has an article that appeared as a separate booklet in 1827: Remarks of Symmes' Theory Which Appeared in the American Quarterly Review. In 1868, a professor W.F. Lyons published The Hollow Globe which put forth a Symmes-like Hollow Earth hypothesis, but failed to mention Symmes himself. Symmes's son Americus then published The Symmes' Theory of Concentric Spheres in 1878 to set the record straight.|$|E
25|$|Rawlings won {{the case}} and enjoyed a brief vindication, but the verdict was {{overturned}} in appellate court and Rawlings was ordered to pay damages {{in the amount of}} $1 US. The toll the case took on Rawlings was great, in both time and emotion. Reportedly, Rawlings had been shocked to learn of Cason's reaction to the book, and felt betrayed. After the case was over, she spent less time in Cross Creek and <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> another book about Florida, though she had been considering doing a sequel to Cross Creek.|$|E
25|$|Robert A. Heinlein {{reported}} that Smith had planned a seventh Lensman novel, set {{after the events}} described in Children of the Lens, which was unpublishable at that time (the early 1960s). Smith told Heinlein that the new novel proceeded inexorably from matters left unresolved in Children, a statement easily supported by a careful reading of Children. Careful searches by people who knew Smith well (including Frederik Pohl, Smith's editor, and Verna Smith Trestrail, Smith's daughter) have failed to locate any material related to such a story. Smith apparently <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> any of it down.|$|E
