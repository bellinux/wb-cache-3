5|$|Structural DNA nanotechnology, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as SDN, {{focuses on}} synthesizing and characterizing <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> complexes and materials where the assembly has a static, equilibrium endpoint. The <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> double helix has a robust, defined three-dimensional geometry {{that makes it}} possible to predict and design the structures of more complicated <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> complexes. Many such structures have been created, including two- and three-dimensional structures, and periodic, aperiodic, and discrete structures.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> strand.|$|E

5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E

5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> thermodynamics and <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E
50|$|Spherical <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> (SNAs) - {{defined as}} {{structures}} that are {{an arrangement of}} densely packed, highly oriented <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in a spherical geometry - were first introduced in 1996 by the Mirkin group at Northwestern University. The unique arrangement and orientation of one-dimensional linear <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> within this three-dimensional framework results in fundamentally new chemical, biological, and physical properties, which represent a paradigm shift {{in the use of}} <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> for intracellular gene regulation, molecular diagnostics, and materials synthesis applications.|$|R

5|$|Morpholinos are {{synthetic}} {{molecules that}} {{are the product of}} a redesign of natural <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> bases, those bases are bound to morpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological pH range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> {{design has}} similar goals to protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. <b>Nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> design {{has the advantage of}} being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. <b>Nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
50|$|The {{quaternary}} structure of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> {{is similar to}} that of protein {{quaternary structure}}. Although some of the concepts are not exactly the same, the quaternary structure refers to a higher-level of organization of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b> Moreover, it refers to interactions of the <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> with other molecules. The most commonly seen form of higher-level organization of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> is seen in the form of chromatin which leads to its interactions with the small proteins histones. Also, the quaternary structure refers to the interactions between separate RNA units in the ribosome or spliceosome.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{building}} on the discovery of circulating DNA in human blood by Mandel and Metais, Leon and his collaborators developed a radioimmunoassay for measuring nanogram quantities of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in serum. This technique enabled them to observe that cancer patients tended to possess a greater quantity of circulating DNA in serum (on average) than their healthy counterparts. This led Stroun to explore if other methods could be developed to not only detect the overall abundance of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in patients with disease (and specifically cancer) but to also detect the disease-specific components of such circulating <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> themselves. Unlike bacterial transformations in plants and animal cells involving clear transfer of separately identifiable <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids,</b> {{it was not clear}} how malignancy in cancer arose, although there were many competing theories. Stroun’s postulate that neoplastic malignancy was associated with the presence of tumor specific <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids,</b> led to extensive research by his group of circulating <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in cancer patients in the late 1980s.|$|R

40|$|In {{honor of}} Avner Friedman on the {{occasion}} of his 80 th birthday. Abstract. SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment) is an iterative separation process by which a pool of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> that bind with varying specificities to a fixed target molecule or a fixed mixture of target molecules, i. e., single or multiple targets, can be separated into one or more pools of pure <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b> In its simplest form, as introduced in [6], the initial pool is combined with the target and the products separated from the mixture of bound and unbound <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b> The <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> bound to the products are then separated from the target. The resulting pool of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> is expanded using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to bring the pool size back up to the concentration of the initial pool and the process is then repeated. At each stage the pool is richer in <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> that bind best to the target. In the case that the target has multiple components, one obtains a mixture of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> that bind best to {{at least one of the}} components. A further refinement of multiple target SELEX, known as alternate SELEX, i...|$|R

5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which tumor microenvironments modulate nucleic acid-mediated innate immunity remain unknown. Here, we identified the receptor TIM- 3 as key to circumventing the stimulatory effects of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in tumor immunity. TIM- 3 is highly expressed on tumor-associated dendritic cells (DC) in murine tumors and cancer patients. DC-derived TIM- 3 suppresses innate immune responses through Toll-like receptor and cytosolic sensor recognition of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> via a galectin- 9 independent mechanism. Instead, TIM- 3 interacts with the HMGB 1 to interfere with recruitment of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> into DC endosomes and attenuates the therapeutic efficacy of DNA vaccination and chemotherapy by reducing immunogenicity of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> released from dying tumor cells. Together, these findings define a novel mechanism by which tumor microenvironments suppress antitumor immunity mediated by <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R
40|$|The innate {{immune system}} has evolved endosomal and cytoplasmic receptors for the {{detection}} of viral <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> as sensors for virus infection. Some of these pattern recognition receptors (PRR) detect features of viral <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> that are not found in the host such as long stretches of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and uncapped single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in case of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and RIG-I, respectively. In contrast, TLR 7 / 8 and TLR 9 are unable to distinguish between viral and self <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> on the grounds of distinct molecular patterns. The ability of these endosomal TLR to act as PRR for viral <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> seems to rely solely on the mode of access to the endolysosomal compartment in which recognition takes place. The current dogma states that self <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> do not enter the TLR-sensing compartment under normal physiological conditions. However, it is still poorly understood how dendritic cells (DC) evade activation by self <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids,</b> in particular with regard to specific DC subsets, which are specialized in taking up material from dying cells for cross-presentation of cell-associated antigens.
