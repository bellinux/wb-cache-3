5|$|The only {{television}} series Murphy starred in was the 1961 Whispering Smith {{in which he}} played the title character. Based on the film of the same name, the show was about a 19th-century Denver railroad investigator. Episodes were gleaned from real-life cases of the Denver Police Department. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency {{was concerned about the}} violent content in the show and leveled charges against the network. 26 episodes had been filmed, but <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> aired.|$|E
5|$|Behnke in his {{salmon and}} trout {{handbook}} of 2002 recognized 14 subspecies of cutthroat trout that are each native to a separate geographic area. <b>Not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were scientifically described, and different views on the taxonomic identities have been presented in some cases. It {{has been suggested that}} the cutthroat trout evolved from a common Oncorhynchus ancestor that migrated along the Pacific coast and into the mountain west primarily via the Columbia and Snake river basins 3-5million years ago, in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene epochs. These epochs had repeated glacial and interglacial periods that would have caused repeated fracturing and isolation of cutthroat trout populations, eventually resulting in the different subspecies found today. The 14 subspecies are found in four evolutionary groups—Coastal, Westslope, Yellowstone and Lahontan.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February 2008 the Australian Family Association (AFA), was {{publicly}} {{outraged that}} Underbelly would be screening at 8:30pm, well {{within reach of}} children, after clips of the series were leaked onto the internet. The clips highlighted the use of extreme profanities, and scenes that show a violent bashing, a cold-blooded murder, and a sexual encounter. The Nine Network defended the timeslot and the M classification, saying the clips, leaked from the Network's production department, were indeed from the series, but <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> made the final cut. The Network set its own classification, under the accepted rules of the Australian Commercial Television Code of Conduct. The Australian Family Association threatened to take the matter to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy if {{the content of the}} show was anything near that of an unauthorised promotional clip leaked from Nine's production department.|$|E

50|$|The end of {{the kingdom}} is seen by some {{scholars}} as a slow, gradual process, while traditionally it was the abrupt expulsion of the king. This event brought about the abrogation of the leges regiae. However certainly <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as e.g. the auspicium and Servius Tullius's reform of the eighteen equites survived.|$|R
5|$|The {{men in the}} Castle Inn {{retreated to}} Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial {{reinforcements}} from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned {{about the quality of}} the opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell into the hands of the insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|The overtures {{from the}} Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular, {{and there are}} many {{recordings}} of them. Most of them are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas. They are generally well-orchestrated, but <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were composed by Sullivan. However, even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided, and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections. Sullivan invariably conducted them (as well as the entire operas) on opening night, and they were included in the published scores approved by Sullivan.|$|E

50|$|While {{startups}} vary {{wildly in}} work environment quality and employee autonomy, {{one of the}} main selling points of technology startups in the early 21st century has been a claim - demonstrably true of the best startups, but <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> - that employees enjoy a high level of autonomy, at a level traditionally only seen in basic research labs.|$|R
