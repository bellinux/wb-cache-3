[...] Unlike the later case of Thomas Becket, St-Calais received little sympathy from his fellow bishops. Most of the bishops and barons that judged the case seem to have felt that the appeal to Rome was made to avoid having to answer an accusation that St-Calais knew was true.

[...] The extant De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi, or Of the Unjust Persecution of the Bishop William I, details the trial of St-Calais before the king. This work is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial; some have doubted its authenticity, however, claiming St-Calais would not have been as knowledgeable in canon law as the work portrays him. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of the canon law, the False Decretals, which still survives.|$|E

2500|$|In reality [...] "Mother Hutton" [...] {{was created}} in 1928 in an {{illustration}} by William Meade Prince {{as part of an}} advertising campaign by Parke-Davis who marketed Digitalis preparations. There is no mention of a Mother Hutton in Withering's works or anyone else's and no mention of him meeting any old woman directly. In his account he states that he is merely asked to comment on a family recipe that was originally in old woman's receipt or recipe (that she had long kept secret) by a colleague. Since 1928, Mother Hutton's status has grown from being an image in an advertising poster to an acclaimed Wise Woman, Herbalist, Pharmacist and Medical Practitioner in Shropshire who was cheated out of her true recognition by Dr. Withering's unscrupulous methods. The story often written around this is also totally apocryphal. [...] Withering was in fact informed of the Brazenose College case by one of his medical colleagues Dr. Ash at Birmingham Hospital and the Dean was treated with Digitalis Root not Leaves. The details are in Witherings Account. The myth of Mother Hutton and how Withering chased her around Shropshire has been created by authors <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to primary sources but instead copying and then embellishing the unreferenced work of others. See [...] "Withering and The Foxglove; the making of a myth" [...] by D.M. Krikler Br Heart J 1985 54: 256-257. In Withering's Account of the Foxglove printed in 1785 Withering mentions 7 different occasions when foxglove was brought to his attention. Recognising that Foxglove was the active ingredient in a family recipe (that was long kept secret by an old woman in Shropshire) would not have been difficult with his expert botanical knowledge. Withering had first published his Botanical Arrangement(in English in 1776 and in it suggested Foxglove deserved looking at in more detail. Erasmus Darwin tried to take the credit for Foxglove and failed. Erasmus Darwin then attempted to try and discredit Withering behind the scenes with the unwitting help of his son Robert having earlier used the thesis of his dead son Charles to try and establish priority. Charles Darwin in fact had been friendly with Withering (As had Robert) and had talked in Edinburgh University about Witherings experiments with the Foxglove. Erasmus Darwin was probably jealous that Withering had become the most famous and sought after doctor outside London and that Witherings English Botanical Arrangement became the standard reference source and far exceeded the botanical publications of Erasmus (all published semi-anonymously)in popularity. Witherings Botanical Arrangement, although now almost forgotten, became the standard reference for English Botany for almost the next 100 years.|$|E
