In secret, the Dutch {{military}} command, partly acting on its own accord, <b>negotiated</b> <b>with</b> both Belgium and France via the Dutch military attaché in Paris, Lieutenant-Colonel David van Voorst Evekink to coordinate a common defence to a German invasion. This failed because of insurmountable differences of opinion {{about the question of}} which strategy to follow.|$|E
5000|$|Another area of {{criticism}} is that, even though not <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> terrorists is the announced policy of a country, often a country does <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> terrorists; whether a country does {{or does not}} <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> terrorists often depends on which political party rules the country.

5|$|A riot {{occurred}} on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening.

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who <b>negotiated</b> <b>with</b> the team but were unable to come to terms.

5|$|Alarmed at the Brazilian move, Argentina and Chile quickly nullified their 1902 pact {{and sought}} dreadnoughts of their own.

They borrowed the necessary money, and Armstrong laid down Rio de Janeiros keel in March 1910.|$|E

5|$|Although the Third Crusade, in the end, {{failed to}} retake Jerusalem, a three-year truce was {{eventually}} <b>negotiated</b> <b>with</b> Saladin.

Both sides had become exhausted by the struggle, Richard needed to return to Europe in order to protect his patrimony from the aggression of Philip of France, and Palestine was in a ruinous state.|$|E
