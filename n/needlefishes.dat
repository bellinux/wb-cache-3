5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, allowing it to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth allowing it to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, <b>needlefishes,</b> and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E

Furthermore, the existing theory that because juvenile needlefish pass through a developmental stage where the lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw (the so-called [...] "halfbeak stage") the theory that halfbeaks are paedomorphic needlefish is untenable. In fact the unequal lengths of the upper and lower jaws of halfbeaks appears to be the basal condition, with needlefish being relatively derived in comparison.|$|E

5000|$|Considered a gamefish, houndfish can {{be caught}} {{by use of}} {{artificial}} lights, similar to other <b>needlefishes.</b> Although they are considered good to eat, and usually sold fresh, the market is small because houndfish flesh has a greenish colour similar to the Flat needlefish. Houndfish are considered somewhat dangerous and are feared by fishermen because of their size and tendency to leap out of the water, causing puncture wounds with their beaks, when frightened or attracted to the very lights used to catch them.|$|E
5000|$|Needlefish (family Belonidae) or Long Tom are piscivorous fishes {{primarily}} {{associated with}} very shallow marine habitats or {{the surface of}} the open sea. Some genera include species found in marine, brackish, and freshwater environments (e.g., Strongylura) while a few genera are confined to freshwater rivers and streams, including Belonion, Potamorrhaphis, and Xenentodon. Needlefish closely resemble North American freshwater gars (family Lepisosteidae) in being elongated and having long, narrow jaws filled with sharp teeth, and some species of <b>needlefishes</b> are referred to as gars or garfish despite being only distantly related to the true gars.

50|$|While the houndfish has no spines, its {{dorsal fin}} has 21-25 soft rays, and its anal fin has 19-22. They are also {{known to have}} 80-86 vertebrae. A key way of {{distinguishing}} the houndfish from {{other members of the}} Tylosurus genus is that the houndfish's teeth point anteriorly when the fish is a juvenile. The teeth of other species are straight at all ages. The houndfish also has a more stout, cylindrical body and a shorter head than other <b>needlefishes.</b> They have dark blue backs and silver-white sides and are plain white ventrally. A houndfish has a distinct keel on the caudal peduncle, and the caudal fin itself is deeply forked. Juvenile houndfish possess an elevated, black lobe on the posterior of their dorsal fins. The longest recorded houndfish was 150 cm, and the largest recorded weight was 6.35 kg.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. To {{investigate}} jaw {{evolution in}} beloniform fishes, we reconstructed the phylogeny of 54 species using fragments of two nuclear (RAG 2 and Tmo- 4 C 4) and two mitochondrial (cytochrome b and 16 S rRNA) genes. Our total molecular evidence topology refutes the monophyly of <b>needlefishes</b> (Belonidae) and half-beaks (Hemiramphidae), but supports the monophyly of flyingfishes (Exocoetidae) and sauries (Scombere-socidae). Flyingfishes are nested within halfbeaks, and sauries are nested within <b>needlefishes.</b> Optimization of jaw characters {{on the tree}} reveals a diverse array of evolutionary changes in ontogeny. During their development, <b>needlefishes</b> pass through a ‘‘halfbeak’ ’ stage that closely resembles the adult condition in the hemiramphid halfbeaks. The reconstruction of jaw transitions falsifies the hypothesis that halfbeaks are paedomorphic derivatives of <b>needlefishes.</b> Instead, halfbeaks make up a basal paraphyletic grade within beloniforms, and the needlefish jaw morphology is relatively derived. The parallel between needlefish on-togeny and beloniform phylogeny is discussed, and clades amenable to future morphological analysis are proposed...|$|E

5000|$|Injury and/or {{death by}} <b>needlefish</b> {{have also been}} {{documented}} in more recent years. A young snorkeler in Florida was nearly killed when a houndfish (Tylosurus crocodilus) leapt from the water and impaled her in the heart. In 2012, The German kitesurfer Wolfram Reiners, was seriously wounded in the foot by a <b>needlefish</b> near the Seychelles. In October 2013, a Saudi Arabian news website also reported {{the death of an}} unnamed young Saudi man who died of hemorrhaging that resulted from being hit by a <b>needlefish</b> {{on the left side of}} his neck. [...] In 2014, a Russian tourist was nearly killed by a <b>needlefish</b> in the waters outside Nha Trang, in Vietnam. The fish bit her neck and left pieces of its teeth inside her spinal cord, paralyzing her. In early January 2016, a local 39-year old Indonesian woman from Palu, Central Sulawesi was deeply wounded when a half-metre long <b>needlefish</b> jumped and pierced her just above the right eye. She was swimming in 80-cm deep water in Tanjung Karang, a popular recreational spot in the Donggala Regency, Central Sulawesi. She was subsequently pronounced dead a few hours later despite efforts to save her at a local hospital. Shortly after, pictures of her horrific injury spread through instant messaging applications, while several local news websites also reported the incident, some erroneously attributed the attack to a marlin instead. The Japanese film All About Lily Chou-Chou has a brief scene about <b>needlefish</b> and shows an actual picture from a nature guidebook of a <b>needlefish</b> who impaled a man in his eye.|$|R

40|$|The 40 life history, myological, and osteological {{characters}} that Tibbetts (1992) {{used in his}} study of the hemiramphids are evaluated for both saury genera (Cololabis and Scomberesox) to determine if the Scomberesocidae are more closely related to the Zenarchopteridae, to the <b>needlefishes</b> (Belonidae), or to the halfbeaks (Hemiramphidae) and flyingfishes (Exocoetidae). Data were analyzed using PAUP*, and eight equally parsimonious trees were found (70 steps, CI 0. 814, RI 0. 938). This analysis indicates that sauries are most closely related to <b>needlefishes,</b> supporting the historical concept of the superfamily Scomberesocoidea as a monophyletic assemblage. A caudal displacement of the origin of the retractor dorsalis muscle is a tentative additional synapomorphy for all four saury species. Zenarchopteridae is strongly supported as a valid family sister to the Scomberesocoidea (decay index = 19, bootstrap = 100).

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} Tylosurus <b>needlefishes</b> {{together}} with common Belone <b>needlefishes</b> appeared in Thermaikos Gulf (North Aegean Sea, Greece) from 2012 to 2014, especially from May to August. The Tylosurus individuals were identified {{because of the}} absence of gill rakers and the presence of black thin lateral keel on caudal peduncle. From June 2013 to July 2014, 112 specimens of Tylosurus <b>needlefishes</b> were collected from commercial fisheries and a detailed morphometric and meristic analysis was applied for species identification. Measurements were recorded on each specimen, for six distance characters (TL, SL, FL, BL, HL, MBH). The length of fins (pectoral, ventral, dorsal, anal) was measured, various proportions between body and fin length were estimated and the number of fin rays was counted. Total length (TL) ranged from 59. 3 to 111. 6 cm. The soft rays in ventral fins were 6, in dorsal fin were 23 - 26 (mainly 24 with 53 %) and in anal fin were 21 - 23 (mainly 22 with 51 %). Body length to head length (BL/HL) ranged from 2 to 2. 82, BL to pectoral fins length (BL/P) ranged from 8. 3 to 10. 8, BL to ventral fins length (BL/V) ranged from 10. 9 to 17. 7, BL to anterior dorsal fin lobe height (BL/D) ranged from 10. 5 to 15. 3 and BL to anterior anal fin lobe height (BL/A) ranged from 9. 3 to 14. 3. The anal fin lobe ranged from 4. 9 to 7. 4 % of standard length. Moreover, the specimens had greater size in length, greater values in morphometrics (i. e. BL/P etc) and higher values in meristics than those reported for the congeneric species Tylosurus choram (Rüppell, 1837) and Tylosurus crocοdilus (Péron & Lesueur, 1821). The resulted diagnostic features are in accordance to the literature for the systematics of Tylosurus acus imperialis (Rafinesque, 1810). Thus, specimens were identified as T. acus imperialis confirming its occurrence in Thermaikos Gulf waters appearing the northern geographic expansion in the Aegean Sea...|$|E
