40|$|New {{leaching}} process removes uncured polymer from <b>nitroso</b> <b>rubber,</b> elastomer used {{in presence}} of nitrogen tetroxide. Uncured portion is removed by controlled soaking of polymer slab in Freon TF. Leaching with Freon TF prevents <b>nitroso</b> <b>rubber</b> from adhering to adjoining surfaces and limiting its usefulness in either static or dynamic applications...|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the design}} and fabrication of candidate flame-resistant woven and knitted fabrics, tapes, webbings, and cords as replacements for those items used in the Apollo spacecraft which were previously made of nylon and polyester. Structures made from Chromel R metal fibers (74 % Ni, 20 % Cr, 2 - 1 / 2 % Fe, 2 - 1 / 2 % Al, 1 / 2 % Si, 1 / 2 % Mo), Beta glass fibers and high-temperature organic fibers such as PBI (polybenzimidazole) were developed and evaluated. The feasibility of improving the performance of selected fabrics by using CNR (carboxy <b>nitroso</b> <b>rubber)</b> or other nonflammable coatings were also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Research {{conducted}} {{during this period}} is reported. Studies presented include: (1) diffusion and permeation of CO 2, O 2, N 2, and NO 2 through polytetra fluoroethylene; (2) diffusion, permeation and solubility of simple gases (CO 2, O 2, N 2, CH 4, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 8, and C 2 H 4) through a copolymer of hexafluoro propylene and tetrafluoro ethylene (FEP); (3) viscous flow and diffusion of gases throug small apertures; (4) diffusion and permeation of O 2, N 2, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 H 6, and C 3 H 8 through nitroso rubber; and (5) results of gas transport studies with carborane siloxane, <b>nitroso</b> <b>rubber,</b> silicone membrane, krytox coating on teflon, and FEP coated glass cloth.
