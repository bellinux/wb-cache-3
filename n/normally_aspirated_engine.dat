25|$|The 2013 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 {{is powered}} by a 5.0 liter V8 engine offered in both natural and {{supercharged}} versions. The naturally aspirated model delivers a total of 430 HP, but Shelby is also offering a new cold air package that will increase the carâ€™s output to 450 HP. In the supercharged version, the GT350 is offered in either a Ford Racing supercharged 525 HP or a 624 HP version. The engine can be combined with a manual gearbox with a short throw shifter as standard, or an automatic transmission for the <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine</b> as an option.|$|E
25|$|Yet the {{majority}} of World War II engines used superchargers, because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers, which were larger, involved extra piping, and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the piping alone is a serious issue; American fighters Vought F4U and Republic P-47 used the same engine, but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was, in part, needed to hold the piping {{to and from the}} turbocharger {{in the rear of the}} plane. Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines. Pilots must make smooth, slow throttle adjustments to avoid overshooting their target manifold pressure. The fuel/air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid pre-ignition or detonation in the engine when running at high power settings. In systems using a manually operated wastegate, the pilot must be careful not to exceed the turbocharger's maximum rpm. The additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine's size, weight, complexity and cost. A turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine.</b> The great majority of World War II American heavy bombers used by the USAAF, particularly the Wright R-1820 Cyclone-9 powered B-17 Flying Fortress, and Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp powered Consolidated B-24 Liberator four-engine bombers both used similar models of General Electric-designed turbochargers in service, as did the twin Allison V-1710-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning American heavy fighter during the war years.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 Ford Mustang GT from Shelby was {{previously}} only offered {{in a white}} exterior color with Guardsman Blue Le Mans racing stripes running {{the length of the}} vehicle, but 2012 will see two new colors in Race Red with white LeMans stripes and Kona Blue with white LeMans stripes. These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible will offer a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit includes a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced. The 2012 Shelby GT350 will deliver the same performance numbers as the 2011 model with a 5.0L V8 delivering 430 hp normally aspirated, 525 hp supercharged, or 624 hp supercharged version. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take {{on a life of its}} own. An automatic transmission is optional with the <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine,</b> but some will go towards the short throw shifter manual transmission because they actually enjoy to drive. Keeping the powerful engine under control will be an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes.|$|E

It crashed on 21 September 1973 during spin trials. and the aircraft was redesigned with a taller tailfin.

50|$|Super Boats - {{engines in}} the Super Boat class have no maximum size, but instead {{have a minimum}} size restriction. <b>Normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engines</b> must have a {{displacement}} of 6.5 litres (400 cubic inches), while forced induction (turbocharged or supercharged) engines {{must be at least}} 3.8 liters (235 cubic inches) in displacement. These engines typically are fuel injected and run methanol fuel. The small-block engines typically produce 950+ horsepower, while the big blocks can produce between 1000 and 1600 horsepower.|$|R
5000|$|The Renault RS10 was a Formula 1 car {{developed}} {{to compete in}} the 1979 Formula One season, which became the first turbocharged F1 car to win a Grand Prix. This changed the framework of F1 as this car spurred the development of the [...] turbocharged cars of the 1980s and rang the death knell for <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engines.</b> This car, along with its predecessor, the Renault RS01, {{was one of the most}} revolutionary Grand Prix cars of all time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{supercharged}} engine {{is different from}} the <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine,</b> owing to a slight decrease in compression ratio and stronger engine internals. The supercharger is engaged on-demand by an electromagnetic clutch, based on input from the engine management system computer (the Engine Control Unit, or ECU).|$|E
50|$|The Speed Eight engine {{has a high}} {{specific}} output for a <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine</b> with 83.3 bhp/L for the 4.2L, 93.3 bhp/L for the 4.5L, and 97.7 bhp/L for the Red Rose-specification 4.5L engine. Another notable aspect is {{the weight of the}} engine, which is 267 lb dry.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine,</b> {{at the start of the}} {{compression}} stroke the cylinder air / fuel volume is very high, this translates into a low starting pressure. As the piston travels upward, abnormally high cylinder pressures may result in the mixture auto-igniting or detonating, which is why conservative compression ratios are used in consumer vehicles. In a forced induction engine where at the start of the compression stroke the cylinder pressure is already raised (having a greater volume of air/fuel) Exp. 202kPa (29.4Psi) the starting pressure or air / fuel volume would be 2 times that of the <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engine.</b> This would translate into an effective compression ratio of 20:1 vs. 10:1 for the normally aspirated. This is why many forced induction engines have compression ratios in the 8:1 range.|$|E
50|$|However, {{with the}} {{announcement}} from the FIA that Group C engine regulations were {{to change to}} only allow 3.5 litre <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engines</b> from 1991, There was not the budget available {{to develop a new}} engine and Protech was disbanded and closed in February 1990 before the chassis AMR2/06 could be completed. AMR2/06 was later built up from left over parts and fitted with an AMR1 body. Aesthetically AMR2/06 looks exactly the same as an AMR1 even with the same Mobil 1 livery.|$|R
50|$|Jones {{was seriously}} {{injured in a}} {{practice}} crash for the IRL race at Walt Disney World Speedway in January 1997. This was the first race where the IRL used their brand new cars with <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engines.</b> The accident left him with an injured neck, and led to his brief retirement from racing. Jones' withdrawal from the Team Joest squad {{to compete in the}} 1997 Le Mans 24 Hours allowed Tom Kristensen to take over the vacant seat, and win his first Le Mans enduro.|$|R
25|$|Racing {{versions}} of the Alfetta GT and GTV were built by Autodelta, initially with the <b>normally</b> <b>aspirated</b> <b>engines</b> from the earlier GTAm racer based on the 105 series coupÃ©, for homologation under FIA Group 2. There were some variations ranging from the Alfetta GT 1800 cc engines with 8 plugs heads or even 16-valve heads to the powerful 2-litre GTAm engine. In this form they were rallied with moderate success in 1975, winning the Elba and Costa Brava rallies overall, as well as winning the Group 2 category in the World Rally Championship's Corsican event.|$|R
