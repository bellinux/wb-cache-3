40|$|ABSTRACT. During {{the past}} 150 years, the mining {{industry}} discharged {{more than a}} billion tons of tailings along Lake Superior shorelines and constructed numerous smelters in the watershed. Given the vast size of Lake Superior, were sediment profiles at locations far offshore impacted by nearshore activi-ties? Did copper and associated precious metal mining modify regional fluxes for copper and mercury? Samples from thirty sediment cores document that background concentrations of copper are high (mean 60. 9 ± 7. 0 µg/g), due to the proximity of natural ore sources. Anthropogenic inventories uncorrected for focusing also are high, ranging from 20 to 780 µg/cm 2 (mean 187 ± 54 µg/cm 2). Focusing factor correc-tions decrease the mean estimate and reduce variance (144 ± 24 µg/cm 2). Several approaches to estimat-ing inputs suggest that only 6 to 10 % of historic copper deposition originated directly from atmospheric sources, emphasizing terrestrial sources. Moreover, coastal sediment cores often show synchronous early increases in copper and mercury with buried maxima. Around the Keweenaw Peninsula, twenty-two cores trace high copper and mercury inventories back to mill and smelting sources. Direct assays of ores from thirteen mine sites confirm a <b>natural</b> <b>amalgam</b> source of mercury in the stamp mill discharges. Core records from inland lakes (Michigamme Project) also reveal patterns of copper and mercury inputs from a variety of mining sources: historic tailing inputs, amalgam assay releases, and atmospheric smelter plumes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Anthropogenic {{inventories}} for copper (229 ± 89 ug/cm 2, N = 30), {{and mercury}} (470 ± 307 ng/cm 2, N = 25) in Lake Superior sediments are {{much greater than}} inventories in remote lakes (Cu 50 ± 31 ug/cm 2, Hg 64 ± 34 ng/cm 2, N = 16) that receive inputs largely from long-distance atmospheric sources. Whereas the absolute concentration of mercury in Lake Superior sediments is not high (80 – 110 ng/g), enrichment ratios along coastal margins indicate industrial sources. An example of previously unreported mining-related inputs comes from native copper mining on the Keweenaw Peninsula. Around the peninsula, sediment inventories for mercury, silver, and copper are highly correlated and {{can be traced back}} to shoreline tailing piles, smelters, and parent ores. Elemental mercury occurs as a <b>natural</b> <b>amalgam</b> or solid solution substitution in native metal (copper, silver, gold) deposits and associated gangue minerals (e. g., sphalerite, ZnS) at µg/g or higher concentrations. Native copper stamp mills discharged more than 364 million metric tons of “stamp sand ” tailings, whereas copper smelters refined five million metric tons of copper, liberating together at least 42 metric tons of mercury. Release of trace mercury from Lake Superior mining deserves regional attention as preliminary estimates resemble EPA Region # 9 patterns and could help explain the 4 – 7 fold sediment inventory discrepancies. We show that the Keweenaw situation is not unique geographically, as mineral-bound trace mercury is commonplace in U. S. and Canadian Greenstone Belts and of worldwide occurrence in precious (gold, silver) and massive base metal (copper, zinc) ore deposits...|$|E
