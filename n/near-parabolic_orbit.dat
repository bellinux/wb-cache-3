2500|$|Impact {{cratering}} involves {{high velocity}} collisions between solid objects, typically {{much greater than}} the velocity of sound in those objects. [...] Such hyper-velocity impacts produce physical effects such as melting and vaporization that do not occur in familiar sub-sonic collisions. [...] On Earth, ignoring the slowing effects of travel through the atmosphere, the lowest impact velocity with an object from space is equal to the gravitational escape velocity of about 11km/s. The fastest impacts occur at about 72km/s in the [...] "worst case" [...] scenario in which an object in a retrograde <b>near-parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> hits Earth. (Because kinetic energy scales as velocity squared, Earth's gravity only contributes 1km/s to this figure, not 11km/s). The median impact velocity on Earth is about 20km/s.|$|E
40|$|The unusual object 1996 PW was {{discovered}} on 1996 August 9 by the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking automated search camera operating from Haleakala in Hawaii. Although asteroidal in appearance, {{it was soon}} determined that the object is in a <b>near-parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> {{similar to that of}} a long-period comet. No object that was not an active comet has ever been discovered on such an eccentric orbit. The discovery of 1996 PW prompted us to examine and evaluate its possible origins, including the intriguing possibility that it is an asteroid from the Oort cloud. Current models for the formation of the Oort cloud argue that most of the material there should be from the Uranus-Neptune region and thus cometary, not asteroidal, in composition. We better quantify these models and show that approximately 1 % of the Oort Cloud population should be asteroids. We find that 1996 PW has almost certainly been a resident of the Oort cloud. However, we find it equally likely that 1996 PW is an extinct comet or an asteroid. Although not conclusive, our results represent a significant change in our understanding of the Oort cloud, because they suggest that the ejection process sampled material from as close to the Sun as the asteroid belt in the primordial solar nebula and hence much warmer formation temperatures than previously thought. This diverse sample is preserved in the Oort cloud...|$|E
40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} how a close stellar fly-by encounter of a symmetrical circumstellar planetesimal disc can give rise to the many kinds of asymmetries and substructures attributed to the edge-on dusty disc of Beta Pic. In addition we present new optical coronagraphic observations of the outer parts of Beta Pic's disc, and report that the radial extent is significantly greater than was found in previous measurements. The northeasterly extension of the disc's midplane is now measured out to 1835 au from the star; the southwesterly component is measured out to 1450 au. Hence we use the length asymmetry induced in a distribution of simulation test particles as the principal diagnostic feature when modelling the disc response, in order to constrain fly-by parameters. In particular we favour a low inclination prograde and <b>near-parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> perturber of mass approximately 0. 5 Solar masses. These initial conditions suggest that the perturber could have been physically associated with Beta Pic prior to the encounter. Thus we also {{consider the possibility that}} the perturber could be bound to Beta Pic: a consideration also of general interest where dust discs are known to exist in binary star systems. In some of our models, we can relate groupings of perturbed particles to the large-scale structure of the Beta Pic disc. The groupings correspond to: high eccentricity and inclination particles that reach apocentre and maximum height in the southwest, moderately eccentric and low inclination particles that reach apocentre in the northeast, and relatively unperturbed particles inside approximately 200 au radius.

50|$|The {{periodicity}} of P/2007 R5 {{was predicted}} by Sebastian F. HÃ¶nig, a German graduate student and prolific asteroid discoverer, in 2006. The {{announcement of the}} new periodic comet was made after the predicted return was confirmed by SOHO and observer B. Zhou on 10 September 2007. Out of approximately 1,350 SOHO-observed sungrazer comets, {{this is the first}} to be verified as a short-period comet; most sungrazers are long-period comets on <b>near-parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> that do not repeat for thousands of years, if at all.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{difficulty}} {{with this approach}} is that it can take prohibitively long to converge for the extreme elliptical <b>orbits.</b> For <b>near-parabolic</b> <b>orbits,</b> eccentricity [...] is nearly 1, and plugging [...] into the formula for mean anomaly, , we find ourselves subtracting two nearly-equal values, and accuracy suffers. For near-circular orbits, it is hard to find the periapsis in the first place (and truly circular orbits have no periapsis at all). Furthermore, the equation was derived on the assumption of an elliptical orbit, and so it does not hold for parabolic or hyperbolic orbits. These difficulties are what {{led to the development of}} the universal variable formulation, described below.|$|R
5000|$|Comets {{have very}} {{different}} values of eccentricity. Periodic comets have eccentricities mostly between 0.2 and 0.7, {{but some of them}} have highly eccentric elliptical orbits with eccentricities just below 1, for example, Halley's Comet has a value of 0.967. Non-periodic comets follow <b>near-parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> and thus have eccentricities even closer to 1. Examples include Comet Hale-Bopp with a value of 0.995 and comet C/2006 P1 (McNaught) with a value of [...] As Hale-Bopp's value is less than 1, its orbit is elliptical and it will in fact return. Comet McNaught has a hyperbolic orbit while within the influence of the planets, but is still bound to the Sun with an orbital period of about 105 years. As of a 2010 Epoch, Comet C/1980 E1 has the largest eccentricity of any known hyperbolic comet with an eccentricity of 1.057, and will leave the Solar System indefinitely.|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest a}} new picture of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in galaxy centers. Momentum-driven {{feedback}} from an accreting hole gives significant orbital energy but little angular momentum {{to the surrounding}} gas. Once central accretion drops, the feedback weakens and swept-up gas falls back towards the SMBH on <b>near-parabolic</b> <b>orbits.</b> These intersect near the black hole with partially opposed specific angular momenta, causing further infall and ultimately {{the formation of a}} small-scale accretion disk. The feeding rates into the disk typically exceed Eddington by factors of a few, growing the hole on the Salpeter timescale and stimulating further feedback. Natural consequences of this picture include (i) the formation and maintenance of a roughly toroidal distribution of obscuring matter near the hole; (ii) random orientations of successive accretion disk episodes; (iii) the possibility of rapid SMBH growth; (iv) tidal disruption of stars and close binaries formed from infalling gas, resulting in visible flares and ejection of hypervelocity stars; (v) super-solar abundances of the matter accreting on to the SMBH; and (vi) a lower central dark-matter density, and hence annihilation signal, than adiabatic SMBH growth implies. We also suggest a simple sub-grid recipe for implementing this process in numerical simulations. Comment: accepted for publication in ApJ Letters, 5 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
25|$|The Principia deals {{primarily}} with massive bodies in motion, initially under {{a variety of}} conditions and hypothetical laws of force in both non-resisting and resisting media, thus offering criteria to decide, by observations, which laws of force are operating in phenomena that may be observed. It attempts to cover hypothetical or possible motions both of celestial bodies and of terrestrial projectiles. It explores difficult problems of motions perturbed by multiple attractive forces. Its third and final book deals with the interpretation of observations about the movements of planets and their satellites. It shows how astronomical observations prove the inverse square law of gravitation (to an accuracy that was high by the standards of Newton's time); offers estimates of relative masses for the known giant planets and for the Earth and the Sun; defines the very slow motion of the Sun relative to the solar-system barycenter; shows how the theory of gravity can account for irregularities in the motion of the Moon; identifies the oblateness of the figure of the Earth; accounts approximately for marine tides including phenomena of spring and neap tides by the perturbing (and varying) gravitational attractions of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's waters; explains the precession of the equinoxes as an effect of the gravitational attraction of the Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge; and gives theoretical basis for numerous phenomena about comets and their elongated, <b>near-parabolic</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R
40|$|Some {{results of}} the International Heliophysical Year (IHY) Coordinated Investigation Program (CIP) number 65 Meteors in the Earth Atmosphere and Meteoroids in the Solar System are presented. The problem of {{hyperbolic}} and <b>near-parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> is discussed. Some possibilities for the solution of this problem {{can be obtained from}} the radar observation of faint meteors. The limiting magnitude of the Kharkov, Ukraine, radar observation program in the 1970 s was + 12, resulting in {{a very large number of}} meteors being detected. 250, 000 orbits down to even fainter limiting magnitude were determined in the 1972 - 78 period in Kharkov (out of them 7, 000 are hyperbolic). The hypothesis of hyperbolic meteors was confirmed. In some radar meteor observations 1 10 % of meteors are hyperbolic meteors. Though the Advanced Meteor Orbit Radar (AMOR, New Zealand) and Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR, Canada) have accumulated millions of meteor orbits, there are difficulties in comparing the radar observational data obtained from these three sites (New Zealand, Canada, Kharkov). A new global program International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI) has begun in 2010 ([URL] Today it is necessary to create the unified radar catalogue of nearparabolic and hyperbolic meteor orbits in the framework of the ISWI, or any other different way, in collaboration of Ukraine, Canada, New Zealand, the USA and, possibly, Japan. Involvement of the Virtual Meteor Observatory (Netherlands) and Meteor Data Centre (Slovakia) is desirable too. International unified radar catalogue of near-parabolic and hyperbolic meteor orbits will aid to a major advance in our understanding of the ecology of meteoroids within the Solar System and beyond...|$|R
