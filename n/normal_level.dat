5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E

40|$|To {{elucidate}} hemostatic condition, plasma {{levels of}} antithrombin Ⅲ antigen (AT Ⅲ), heparin cofactor Ⅱ antigen (HC Ⅱ), protein C antigen (PC), protein S antigen (PS : Ag), PS activity (PS : Act) and C 4 b-binding protein (C 4 bp) were measured both in acute phase and in remission phase of 25 children with freshly developed minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). The {{results indicated that}} AT Ⅲ levels in acute phase were lower than <b>normal</b> <b>levels</b> and in remission phase were not different from <b>normal</b> <b>levels.</b> PC and C 4 bp levels were higher than <b>normal</b> <b>levels</b> in both phases. PS : Ag levels in acute phase were higher than <b>normal</b> <b>levels</b> and in remission phase not different from <b>normal</b> <b>levels,</b> while PS : Act and HC Ⅱ levels in both phases were not different from <b>normal</b> <b>levels.</b> These findings suggest that anticoagulant factors, especially PC could {{play an important role}} to prevent thromboembolic events...|$|R

5|$|Owing to the {{non-specific}} {{nature of}} the presentation of symptoms, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires {{a high degree of}} suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, enlarged spleen, fever, low number of platelets in the blood, and higher-than-normal levels of bilirubin in the blood combined with a <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> of white blood cells. Reports in 2016 and 2017 from countries were malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or inaccurate laboratory testing.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E
5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} seizure (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after a focal seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.|$|E

5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its <b>normal</b> <b>level.</b> Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a <b>normal</b> <b>level</b> of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E

A meteorological drought (normally measured in terms of rainfall deciles) occurs when the rainfall, over a period of time, is substantially below <b>normal</b> <b>levels.</b> An agricultural drought (measured, for example, by the moisture deficit in the top 200  mm of soil) occurs when the soil moisture, over a period of time, is substantially below <b>normal</b> <b>levels.</b> A hydrological drought (measured, for example, by water availability) occurs when drinking water impoundments, over a period of time, are substantially below <b>normal</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R
