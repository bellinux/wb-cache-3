500|$|The eastern small-footed Myotis is {{believed}} to feed primarily on flying insects such as beetles, mosquitoes, moths, and flies, (Barbour and Davis 1969; Harvey et al. 1999; Linzey 1998; Merritt 1987) and are capable of filling their stomachs {{within an hour of}} eating. They are nighttime foragers and usually forage in and along wooded areas at and below canopy height, over streams and ponds, and along cliffs. Moths compose nearly half of their diet, and they forage primarily on soft-bodied prey [...] It {{is believed}} that the avoidance of hard prey is due to their small, delicate skulls. The Food habits of M. leibii {{are similar to those of}} the closely related California (M. californicus) and western small-footed bats (M. ciliolabrum), as well as other North American Myotis (e.g., little brown bat, (M. lucifugus), and <b>northern</b> <b>bat,</b> (M. septentrionalis).|$|E

50|$|<b>Northern</b> <b>bats</b> are nocturnal, {{and fast}} flying, adapted to hunting {{airborne}} insects using echolocation. The species hunts in open spaces with speed of 5-6 m/s. The sound pulse consists of 10-13ms in normal foraging habitats, sometimes up to 18ms of steeply frequency-modulated(FM) component (about 40-30 kHz). The bats send out the pulse about every 200ms, and the steep FM {{are used to}} locate obstacles or targets, allowing them to fly indoors.In high latitude areas, female <b>northern</b> <b>bats</b> fly during daytime because of the short nights, but their foraging peaks after dusk and sometime before dawn.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a field study examining roost tree selection and roosting ranges of the <b>northern</b> long-eared <b>bat</b> (Myotis septentrionalis) in an experimental ecosystem of two southern Indiana state forests comprised of differing timber harvesting treatments. The <b>northern</b> long-eared <b>bat</b> is anticipated {{to be added to the}} Endangered Species list in the fall of 2014, so understanding its habitat selection is important to aid in minimizing their population decline. <b>Northern</b> long-eared <b>bats</b> were captured in Morgan-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests, and females were fitted with transmitters. We tracked these bats to their maternity roost trees during the day, and measured vegetation characteristics around those trees. Roost tree locations were plotted in ArcMap (ArcGIS 10. 2) to find roosting ranges, and the roosting range size for this species was found to average 5. 4 ha. Bats roosted in the unharvested forest more often than in trees within the harvested areas, and selected areas containing more vegetation obstruction, or clutter, in both areas. However, <b>northern</b> long-eared <b>bats</b> are roost generalists when compared to other species for many vegetative characteristics, and may tolerate smaller forest harvests as long as adequate roost trees remain available on the landscape.

50|$|In the fall, <b>northern</b> long-eared <b>bats</b> {{migrate to}} caves to hibernate.

50|$|No {{inventory}} of amphibians {{has been made}} in the stream itself, but most species common to the Stockholm area have been documented in the surrounding area with an abundant number of European vipers.

50|$|The {{deciduous}} forest {{north of the}} lake and the shallow reeds there is an important biotope for bats, as the area produces a plenitude of insects while offering favourable milieux for hibernation.

Amphibians are represented by moor frog, common frog, true toad, and smooth newt. There are several bats present by the lake: <b>northern</b> <b>bat,</b> Daubenton's bat, common noctule, and whiskered bat.

50|$|Birds {{reported}} include Eurasian coot, great crested grebe, tufted duck, common moorhen, pochard, and Slavonian grebe. The dense vegetation {{surrounding the}} lake contains nightingales, blackcaps and marsh warblers hiding from sparrowhawks, goshawks, and tawny owls. The lake {{is also an}} important breeding ground for frogs, including common frog, moor frog, and common toad. The presence of great crested newt is threatened and all frog species are protected by law. Grass snake was observed in 1996. Surrounding buildings and deciduous forest forms a great habitat for bats such as <b>northern</b> <b>bat,</b> soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's bat, and Nyctalus.|$|E
50|$|An {{inventory}} of lakebed fauna in 1997 documented 47 species/taxa, predominately freshwater gastropods, beetles, and dragonflies.

Except for seabirds such as the mallard and Eurasian coot, the thrush nightingale is present on the southern shore. Species of bats documented includes the <b>northern</b> <b>bat,</b> Nyctalus, Daubenton's bat, and Brandt's bat.
