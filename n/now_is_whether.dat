25|$|In a 2013 interview, Cardinal Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, {{designer}} of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms {{now that he was}} no longer the pontiff. “The problem <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter {{from the back of the}} coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.|$|E
2500|$|As much as Saadia's Judeo-Arabic {{translation}} of the Pentateuch (Tafsīr) has brought relief and succor to Jews living in Arabic-speaking countries, his identification of places, fauna and flora, and the stones of the breastplate, has found him at variance with some scholars. Abraham ibn Ezra, in his own commentary of the Pentateuch, wrote scathing remarks on Saadia's commentary, saying: [...] "He doesn't have an oral tradition [...] perhaps he has a vision in a dream, while he has already erred with respect to certain places therefore, we will not rely on his dreams." [...] However, Saadia assures his readers elsewhere that when he rendered translations for the twenty odd unclean fowl that are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Leviticus 11:1319; Deuteronomy 14:1218), his translation {{was based on an}} oral tradition received by him. In fact, Saadia's method of conveying names for the fowls based on what he had received by way of an oral tradition, prompted him to add in his defense: [...] "Every detail about them, had one of them merely come unto us , we {{would not have been able}} to identify it for certain, much less recognize their related kinds." [...] The question often asked by scholars <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> Saadia applied this principle in his other translations. Ra'em (Heb. [...] ), as in Deut. 33:17, improperly translated as [...] "unicorn" [...] in some English translations, is a word that is now used in Modern Hebrew to represent the [...] "oryx," [...] although Saadia understood the same word to mean [...] "rhinoceros", and writes there the Judeo-Arabic word אלכרכדאן for the creature. He interprets the zamer (Heb. [...] ) in Deuteronomy 14:5 as meaning the giraffe.|$|E

A government wanting “to examine the operation of media and communications regulation in Australia and assess its effectiveness in achieving appropriate policy objectives” had many places to focus.

I know you think it was uncalled for and in extremely bad taste for me to tell you what I did the other day; and I have thought so too. There is only one thing that could justify it--that is, I think it might justify it--if you thought so. But I do not feel sure {{that you would like to}} know it, or, if you knew it, would like it.

40|$|Once {{considered}} the nation's most regulated industry, the electric utility industry is evolving {{into a more}} competitive environment. At the current time, {{the focus of this}} development is the generating sector, where the advent of new generating technologies, such as gas-fired combined cycle, has lowered both entry barriers to competitors of traditional utilities and lowered the marginal costs of those competitors below those of some traditional utilities. This technological advance has been combined with legislative initiatives, such as the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), to encourage the introduction of competitive forces into the electric generating sector. The questions <b>now</b> <b>are</b> <b>whether</b> further legislative action is desirable to encourage competition in the electric utility sector and how the transition between a comprehensive regulatory regime to a more competitive electric utility sector can be made with the least amount of economic and service disruption...|$|R

60|$|The {{question}} <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the fugitives {{had been}} observed, but suffered to advance, as every foot they descended the stream was taking them nearer to their foes.

Such was, indeed, the fact, as was afterward ascertained; but the young men who had seen Peter and Margery had given the alarm, passing the word where the fugitives were to be found, and the sentinels along this portion of the stream had deserted their stations, in order to be in at the capture.
