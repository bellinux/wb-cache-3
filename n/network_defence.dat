5000|$|The Military of Estonia is {{introducing}} a new 21st century based cyber warfare and defence formation {{in order to}} protect the vital infrastructure and e-infrastructure of Estonia. Currently the leading organization in the Estonian cyber defence is the CERT (the Computer Emergency Response Team of Estonia), established in 2006, as an organisation responsible for the management of security incidents in [...]ee computer networks. Its task is to assist Estonian internet users in the implementation of preventive measures in order to reduce possible damage from security incidents and to help them in responding to security threats. The unit deals with security incidents that occur in Estonian networks, are started there, or have been notified of by citizens or institutions either in Estonia or abroad. On 25 June 2007, Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves met with the president of United States, George W. Bush. [...] Among the topics discussed were the attacks on Estonian e-infrastructure.The attacks triggered a number of military organisations around the world to reconsider the importance of network security to modern military doctrine. On 14 June 2007, defence ministers of NATO members held a meeting in Brussels, issuing a joint communiqué promising immediate action. First public results are estimated to arrive by autumn 2007.In the aftermath of the Cyberattacks on Estonia 2007, plans to combine <b>network</b> <b>defence</b> with Estonian military doctrine, and related NATO plans to create a Cybernetic Defence Centre in Estonia, have been nicknamed the [...] "Tiger's Defence" [...] (Tiigrikaitse), in reference to Tiigrihüpe.|$|E

Along the way he recruits Lisa's friend Joystick (Sergio Rubini) and tech wizard Naima (Stefania Rocca) to help him avoid suspicious representatives of Okasama Star, who employ increasingly forceful methods to stop him. By the end, Jimi hacks into one of the company's servers. This hack is in the world of virtual reality interpreted as encounters with persons from Jimi's life; the network defends itself by projecting virtual representations of people such as Jimi's father and Lisa. It tries to keep the hacker's mind in the loop of his own memories as it burns the hacker's brain. Jimi manages to pass through the <b>network</b> <b>defence</b> mechanism by freeing his mind, forgetting about life before or after, about bodily feelings, and entering a state of pure concentration where one focuses only on the target (in this case the server with the company's bank account). It is similar to meditation where one tries to concentrate on breathing; people who are able to do this are referred to as angels (they are invisible to the system, can go anywhere they want, and their possibilities are limitless) in the film. In the end, Jimi feels enlightened and at inner peace with himself. He successfully deletes Solo, comes to terms with Lisa's leaving him, and understands why things happened the way they did. He is in the state of Nirvana.|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian Armed Forces are {{supposed}} to implement <b>Network</b> Based <b>Defence</b> within {{the next couple of}} decades to achieve information superiority and to enable speed of command during operations. The process of implementing <b>Network</b> Based <b>Defence</b> is however suffering from different obstacles, challenging and slowing down the process. The delayed implementation affects the entire Norwegian Armed Forces, and puts soldier lives and operations at stake. Studied literature emphasizes that technology, procedures and intellectual capital are not aligned to each other, introducing gaps between technology implemented and knowledge needed to utilize it. Similar obstacles have been identified during practical research in this project. Inappropriate technological solutions, education of operators at random, complex information collection together with inadequate level of trust among the operators, suggest that technology, procedures and intellectual capital are not aligned to each other. Comparable challenges can be found in Integrated Operations in the oil sector. In this project, adapted system dynamic models primarily developed for Integrated Operations, were employed as preliminary hypothesis. The adapted models also supported results obtained during interviews and questionnaires conducted in two different army units. The purpose of the research was to identify factors delaying the implementation process of <b>Network</b> Based <b>Defence,</b> and to investigate if the models would support future implementations. The results in total suggest that knowledge is not very well adjusted to the operation transition of <b>Network</b> Based <b>Defence.</b> A knowledge gap might be introduced, affecting the operators' perceived trust level. Inadequate level of trust might result in inappropriate use of the technological platform, which again increase the probability of incidents during military operations. If the knowledge development and operation transition is not aligned to each other, the implementation process will most likely be delayed and suffer from increased cost. Empirical studies have shown significant cost benefit utilization when employing system dynamic models in parallel with new technology adoption. The project therefore suggests employing a full-fledged system dynamic model in parallel with the implementation process of <b>Network</b> Based <b>Defence.</b> Technological implementations can then be simulated in advance to identify possible difficulties. Hence, system dynamic models of sufficient detail can support the implementation of <b>Network</b> Based <b>Defence</b> to ensure implementation in time, within the estimated cost and with reduced risk...|$|R

Combined with factor space definition and the formal description of factor state space expression and analyzing attack factors, skill and attack aim, analysis and expression method of network attack and defense factors is developed. On the basis of analysis and expression of network attack and defense factors, equivalence class partition formal description is presented. For illustration, an attack simulation experiment is utilized to show the feasibility of the proposed method in solving <b>network</b> attack and <b>defence</b> knowledge expression. By introducing factor space canes, objects class can be represented. Empirical results show that our proposed method can effectively improve accuracy of attack classification.

40|$|Autonomic Computer <b>Network</b> <b>Defence</b> aims {{to achieve}} {{self-protection}} capability of IT networks {{in order to}} limit the risk caused by malicious and accidental events. To achieve this, networks require an automated controller with a policy, which allows selecting the most appropriate action in any undesired network state. Due to the complexity and constant evolution of the Computer <b>Network</b> <b>Defence</b> environment, a-priori design of an automated controller is not effective. A solution for generating and continuously improving decision policies is needed. A significant technical challenge in Autonomic Computer <b>Network</b> <b>Defence</b> is finding a strategy to efficiently generate, trial and compare different policies and retain the best performing one. To address this challenge, we use Reinforcement Learning to explore Computer <b>Network</b> <b>Defence</b> action and state spaces and to learn which policy optimally reduces risk. A simulated Computer <b>Network</b> <b>Defence</b> environment is implemented using Discrete Event Dynamic System simulation and a novel graph model. A network asset value assessment technique and a dynamic risk assessment algorithm are also implemented to provide evaluation metrics. This environment is used to train two Reinforcement Learning agents, one with a table policy {{and the other with}} a neural network policy. The resulting policies are then compared to three other empirical policies for their risk performances. These empirical policies serve as evaluation baseline and include: letting risk grow without any action, randomly selecting valid actions, and selecting the next action based on the pre-computed asset value of the affected assets and choosing the one with the highest value first. We found that in all test scenarios, both Reinforcement Learning policies evaluated improved the overall risk when compared to random selection of valid actions. In one simple scenario, both Reinforcement Learning policies converged to the same optimum policy with better risk performance than other assessed policies. Generally, we found that, for the tested scenarios and training strategies, a simple policy addressing affected assets in the order of their asset values, can generally yield superior results...|$|E
