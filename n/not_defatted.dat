40|$|The {{impact of}} various milk {{handling}} stressors {{were analyzed using}} a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test measuring Ostertagia ostertagi antibodies in milk from dairy cattle (Svanovir). An indirect ELISA {{has the ability to}} determine the amount of milk production losses related to intestinal parasitism. The ELISA test recommends fresh defatted milk, however, milk collected from Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI) programs in North America undergo many stressors, including, heating, freezing and are <b>not</b> <b>defatted.</b> Normalized optical density ratios (ODRs) were compared between fresh defatted milk and milk subjected to one or more stressors with a linear mixed model accounting for differences in variation between the fresh and the frozen samples. Concordance correlation coefficients were also analyzed for comparisons to other similar studies. After accounting for random cow and container effects, the treatment factors interacted with each other (p< 0. 001). Biologically interesting contrasts were created to explain the interaction. The estimated difference in ODR between the milk samples handled according to recommendations of the manufacturers of Svanovir and the whole milk samples that were subjected to the most extreme treatment (heated, frozen, thawed, and re-frozen for 4 weeks) was 0. 062 (p< 0. 001). This difference represented less than 5 % of the range, and was thus considered biologically negligible. Frozen whole milk processed by DHI programs, the most likely method of collecting on-farm samples in North America, will likely yield reliable results for the indirect ELISA tests, particularly, Svanovir.

40|$|The {{aetiology}} {{of breast}} cancer is multifactorial. While there are known genetic predispositions to the disease {{it is probable that}} environmental factors are also involved. Recent research has demonstrated a regionally specific distribution of aluminium in breast tissue mastectomies while other work has suggested mechanisms whereby breast tissue aluminium might contribute towards the aetiology {{of breast cancer}}. We have looked to develop microwave digestion combined with a new form of graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry as a precise, accurate and reproducible method for the measurement of aluminium in breast tissue biopsies. We have used this method to test the thesis that there is a regional distribution of aluminium across the breast in women with breast cancer. Microwave digestion of whole breast tissue samples resulted in clear homogenous digests perfectly suitable for the determination of aluminium by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The instrument detection limit for the method was 0. 48 μg/L. Method blanks were used to estimate background levels of contamination of 14. 80 μg/L. The mean concentration of aluminium across all tissues was 0. 39 μg Al/g tissue dry wt. There were no statistically significant regionally specific differences in the content of aluminium. We have developed a robust method for the precise and accurate measurement of aluminium in human breast tissue. There are very few such data currently available in the scientific literature and they will add substantially to our understanding of any putative role of aluminium in breast cancer. While we did not observe any statistically significant differences in aluminium content across the breast it has to be emphasised that herein we measured whole breast tissue and <b>not</b> <b>defatted</b> tissue where such a distribution was previously noted. We are very confident that the method developed herein could now be used to provide accurate and reproducible data on the aluminium content in defatted tissue and oil from such tissues and thereby contribute towards our knowledge on aluminium and any role in breast cancer...|$|E

Animal Production Science, 54 (2), 275 - 280. The effect of including full-fat Colombian rice polishings, at 250 or 500 g/kg dry matter (DM) or defatted Colombian rice polishings (at 500 g/kg DM) on the fermentation of a basal diet of dried grass and medium-quality hay, in the rumen simulation technique (Rusitec), was investigated. With diets which contained 0, 0. 25, 0. 50 full-fat or 0. 50 defatted, proportions of rice polishing, values for pH were depressed (7. 22, 7. 19, 7. 11, 7. 06 (s. e. d. 0. 05)) and total volatile fatty acid concentrations were increased (52. 8, 52. 5, 75. 5, 75. 4 (s. e. d. 2. 1) mmol/l) at {{the high levels of}} inclusion of rice polishings. Concentrations of ammonia (130, 140, 228, 209 (s. e. d. 6. 4) mg/l) and total bacterial numbers (2. 32, 2. 70, 3. 55, 4. 42 (s. e. d. 0. 82) X 10 (8) per ml) were elevated by rice polishings inclusion. Numbers of cellulolytic bacteria (2. 52, 1. 74, 1. 84, 2. 10 (s. e. d. 0. 60) X 10 (6) per ml) and protozoa (19. 8, 16. 2, 15. 8, 22. 2 (s. e. d. 1. 51) X 10 (3) per ml were depressed (the latter significantly P < 0. 01) by the inclusion of full-fat, but <b>not</b> by <b>defatted,</b> rice polishings.

40|$|Soybean is an {{important}} Brazilian agricultural commodity that contains {{a high concentration of}} isoflavones. Many studies showed that isoflavones are active in the prevention of many human diseases. However, the correct processing techniques used to prepare the soy foodstuffs are important to maintain the active forms. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of gamma irradiation on the isoflavone contents of the defatted soybean flour when compared with soybean molasses, a derivative from the soybean food production. After extracting phenolic compounds with methanol aqueous solution (80 %), isoflavones were detected by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detector. The radiation doses of 2 and 5 kGy presented a small effect on the isoflavones content of defatted soy flour. Samples irradiated at 50 kGy showed lower isoflavone contents. The observed reduction in the concentration of isoflavones-daidzein, glycitein and genistein-induced by gamma radiation in soy molasses was <b>not</b> significant in <b>defatted</b> soy flour, thus suggesting that isoflavones in defatted soy flour were not eliminated by gamma radiation at rates up to 50 kGy.
