5|$|In 1997, {{a studio}} theatre was {{built at the}} rear of the {{building}} on Monmouth Street, called the Ustinov Studio, named after the actor Peter Ustinov. The front of the building is decorated with a bronze winged figure which was designed by his son, Igor Ustinov, entitled Hopefully. The 150-seat auditorium was originally a space for the youth theatre and small-scale touring productions, but the Ustinov programme soon expanded to encompass classical concerts, stand-up comedy (including high-profile acts such as Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee and Lucy Porter) and in-house productions. To accommodate the technical <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> productions, a refurbishment was planned to take place throughout 2007, improving the backstage & technical facilities, the foyer, bar and auditorium. The Ustinov Studio re-opened in February 2008, with their own production of Breakfast With Mugabe, starring Joseph Marcell, Miles Anderson and Nicholas Bailey.|$|E

25|$|Overidentification of students, {{in order}} to {{increase}} state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth.

In 2015, this expansion effort was significantly increased, in order to better-enable the company to fulfill the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> industries and markets. Expansion plans were in part based upon company projections predicting that many company employees will be retiring between 2006 and 2018. In 2015, 173 of the company's employees are qualified for retirement. Expansion plans include the introduction and implementation of more modern equipment, which requires fewer personnel to operate, and an increased capacity for storage. In 2013, as part of the plans to keep the company moving forward into the future, a new research and development facility was built that cost over $6 million. The company plans for the expansions to conclude by fall 2017.

25|$|Mother Katharine Drexel, {{who founded}} the American order of Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People, corresponded with Pius XI, as she had with his papal predecessors. (In 1887, Pope Leo XIII had {{encouraged}} Katharine Drexel—then a young Philadelphia socialite— to do missionary work with America's disadvantaged people of color). In the early 1930s, Mother Drexel wrote Pius XI asking him to bless a publicity campaign to acquaint white Catholics with the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> disadvantaged races among them. An emissary had shown him photos of Xavier University, New Orleans, LA, which Mother Drexel had established to educate African-Americans {{at the highest level}} in the USA. Pius XI replied promptly, sending his blessing and encouragement. Upon his return, the emissary told Mother Katharine that the Pope said he had read the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin as a boy, and it had ignited his lifelong concern for the American Negro.|$|E
500|$|Animals used as {{livestock}} {{are predominantly}} herbivorous, the main exception being the pig {{which is an}} omnivore. The herbivores {{can be divided into}} [...] "concentrate selectors" [...] which selectively feed on seeds, fruits and highly nutritious young foliage, [...] "grazers" [...] which mainly feed on grass, and [...] "intermediate feeders" [...] which choose their diet from the whole range of available plant material. Cattle, sheep, goats, deer and antelopes are ruminants; they digest food in two steps, chewing and swallowing in the normal way, and then regurgitating the semidigested cud to chew it again and thus extract the maximum possible food value. The dietary <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> animals is mostly met by eating grass. Grasses grow {{from the base of the}} leaf-blade, enabling it to thrive even when heavily grazed or cut. In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass). Other forage crops are also grown and many of these, as well as crop residues, can be ensiled to fill the gap in the nutritional needs of livestock in the lean season.|$|E
