5|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{reliable}} geostationary satellite coverage in 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated.

5|$|A {{scientific}} {{description of}} the silky shark was first published by the German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle under the name Carcharias (Prionodon) falciformis, in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus. Because Müller and Henle's type specimen was a 53-cm-long female fetus from Cuba, adult silky sharks were historically <b>not</b> <b>recognized</b> as C.falciformis and were described as a separate species, Carcharhinus floridanus, by Henry Bigelow, William Schroeder, and Stewart Springer in 1943. Jack Garrick, Richard Backus, and Robert Gibbs, Jr. synonymized C.floridanus with C.falciformis in 1964.|$|E
5|$|After the 1907 season, Stricklett {{returned}} to the California League to pitch for the San Jose Prune Prickers and Sacramento Sacts, and refused to report to Brooklyn in 1908 as his wife wanted him to remain closer to their California home. As the California League was <b>not</b> <b>recognized</b> in organized baseball at this time, Stricklett was banned by MLB for four years. Though he applied for reinstatement, his banishment was upheld. Stricklett continued to pitch for San Jose through 1910, pitching to a 23-12 record in 1909 and a 19-14 record in 1910.|$|E
