30|$|CANOVA is {{a measure}} for <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> <b>correlation</b> between two {{continuous}} variables, as an extension to ANOVA for continuous variables by making generalization on “within category variance”. CANOVA first define a neighborhood for each data point of response variable based on its predictor value, and then the variance of the response value within the neighborhood is calculated. The hypothesis of CANOVA “similar neighbor predictor values lead to similar response values” is tested for smaller value of statistic “within neighborhood sum square” compared to “random expectation”. Since, a statistic “within neighborhood variance” does not follow any familiar distribution, its significance is tested by permutation test. The grid of a larger K has more power on slow-varying functions, while a smaller K has more power on quick-oscillating functions depending on the data. The suggested choice for the neighborhood structure of the dataset is n/ 20 [20]. CANOVA is related to local regression (like, K nearest neighbor (kNN) regression), and CANOVA {{can be viewed as}} an analogy of the model fitness test of the kNN model as Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be viewed as the model fitness test of a linear regression model. This method reduce algorithm complexity to O(nlogn+np) by ordering the data values of response with respect to the ordered value of predictors, and can easily explore the <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> <b>correlation</b> between two continuous variable.|$|E

40|$|The road {{transport}} {{has become the}} major source of environmental degradation in urban centres. It produces negative externalities (i. e. pollution, delay, etc.) that are usually connected with the queues of traffic flows and the congestion of the road network. The quantitative estimation of roadside pollutant levels is very complex. Many variables are involved such as the type of vehicle (characterized by different antipollution devices, used fuels, engine temperatures, maintenance level of engines, etc.), the different cinematic conditions of the flows, the urban/road network structure, the weather conditions, etc. Therefore it is important to develop scientific tools able to predict roadside pollutant levels, in order to apply the best strategy to improve air quality and to obtain atmospheric pollution levels within the regulatory limits. So traffic management measures can help public administrations to reach their objectives in the field of traffic pollutant reduction in the urban centres.

We investigated {{the relative importance}} of Eh and pH on P cycling in reforested mangroves. Sediment P compounds, pH and Eh were analysed over depth along five transects of two areas in the Saigon River Delta and compared with leaf P levels. A three-dimensional spatial approach was used to investigate pH and Eh effects on P compound distribution at different sediment depth and locate layers of predominant P uptake. Along an inundation gradient, submergence durations of 254 to 2 days per year caused a large Eh gradient within the top 20 cm, whereas Eh response was small within 20 – 45 cm depth. At individual layers, a correlation between Eh andAl/Fe–Pwas only found in the upper depth interval (0 – 20 cm). No significant effect of Eh or Al/Fe–P on Morgan-P (available P) was detected. Minor effects on P composition changes by the Eh were caused through generally strongly reduced sediment at deeper layers ([20 cm). In contrast, pH variations produced extreme differences in both, Ca–P and available P content at layers of apparently predominant P uptake ([20 cm). As available P was correlated with Ca–P (p 0. 001), leaf P (p 0. 001) and pH (<b>non</b> <b>linear</b> <b>correlation)</b> {{it is likely that the}} pH sensitive Ca–P fraction is a more effective source for mangrove tree growth than Al/Fe–P.

Sequencing of the 11 {{additional}} Drosophila Fallen, 1823 species marks substantial progress in comparative genomics of this genus. By comparison, practically nothing is known about the genome size or genome sequences of parasitic wasps of Drosophila. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of genome size and karyotype structures of Drosophila parasitoids of the Leptopilina Förster, 1869 and Ganaspis Förster, 1869 species. The gametic genome size of Ganaspis xanthopoda (Ashmead, 1896) is larger than those of the three Leptopilina species studied. The genome sizes of all parasitic wasps studied here are also larger than those known for all Drosophila species. Surprisingly, genome sizes of these Drosophila parasitoids exceed the average value known for all previously studied Hymenoptera. The haploid chromosome number of both Leptopilina heterotoma (Thomson, 1862) and L. victoriae Nordlander, 1980 is ten. A chromosomal fusion appears to have produced a distinct karyotype for L. boulardi (Barbotin, Carton et Keiner-Pillault, 1979) (n = 9), whose genome size is smaller than that of wasps of the L. heterotoma clade. Like L. boulardi, the haploid chromosome number for G. xanthopoda is also nine.

40|$|State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are {{increasingly}} interested in developing new {{strategies for the}} design and construction of transportation projects. As a result, they are adopting more integrated process. Projects that previously used separate steps and parties may now {{be included in a}} single Design-Build system. When making a decision between a traditional Design-Bid-Build delivery system or a more integrated project delivery system like Design-Build, the DOTs consider potential more cost savings, time savings, and quality improvement. In order to maximize success in Design-Build project delivery, state DOTs need {{to pay attention to the}} initial steps, like procurement. DOTs should prepare the procurement phase carefully based on project size, complexity, risks, timing, external factors, environmental issues, selection methods, etc. To assist in improving the success of Design-Build projects, this paper analyzes the relationship between procurement duration and Design-Build project success. Schedule growth, cost growth and total project time growth are used to measure project success in this paper. Linear regression analysis is used to analyze the relationship between procurement duration and each of the three project success factors. The results of the linear regression analyses show that there is a strong linear correlation between procurement duration and schedule growth. The longer the procurement duration, the less the schedule growth as a percent of the total project schedule. However, the research results do not indicate any linear or <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> <b>correlation</b> between procurement duration and cost growth. There is no evidence to indicate that a longer procurement duration will reduce cost growth. The research also shows that the effects of procurement duration on project success are variable based on different selection methods and project complexities.

40|$|This work aims {{to compare}} the {{performance}} of new methods to estimate the Soil Moisture Content (SMC) of bare soils from their spectral signatures in the reflective domain (0. 4 – 2. 5 µm) in comparison with widely used spectral indices like Normalized Soil Moisture Index (NSMI) and Water Index SOIL (WISOIL). Indeed, these reference spectral indices use wavelengths located in the water vapour absorption bands and their performance are thus very sensitive {{to the quality of}} the atmospheric compensation. To reduce these limitations, two new spectral indices are proposed which wavelengths are defined using the determination matrix tool by taking into account the atmospheric transmission: Normalized Index of Nswir domain for Smc estimatiOn from Linear correlation (NINSOL) and Normalized Index of Nswir domain for Smc estimatiOn from <b>Non</b> <b>linear</b> <b>correlation</b> (NINSON). These spectral indices are completed by two new methods based on the global shape of the soil spectral signatures. These methods are the Inverse Soil semi-Empirical Reflectance model (ISER), using the inversion of an existing empirical soil model simulating the soil spectral reflectance according to soil moisture content for a given soil class, and the convex envelope model, linking the area between the envelope and the spectral signature to the SMC. All these methods are compared using a reference database built with 32 soil samples and composed of 190 spectral signatures with five or six soil moisture contents. Half of the database is used for the calibration stage and the remaining to evaluate the performance of the SMC estimation methods. The results show that the four new methods lead to similar or better performance than the one obtained by the reference indices. The RMSE is ranging from 3. 8 % to 6. 2 % and the coefficient of determination R 2 varies between 0. 74 and 0. 91 with the best performance obtained with the ISER model. In a second step, simulated spectral radiances at the sensor level are used to analyse the sensitivity of these methods to the sensor spectral resolution and the water vapour content knowledge. The spectral signatures of the database are then used to simulate the signal at the top of atmosphere with a radiative transfer model and to compute the integrated incident signal representing the spectral radiance measurements of the HYMAP airborne hyperspectral instrument. The sensor radiances are then corrected from the atmosphere by an atmospheric compensation tool to retrieve the surface reflectances. The SMC estimation methods are then applied on the retrieve spectral reflectances. The adaptation of the spectral index wavelengths to the HyMap sensor spectral bands and the application of the convex envelope and ISER models to boarder spectral bands lead to an error on the SMC estimation. The best performance is then obtained with the ISER model (RMSE of 2. 9 % and R 2 of 0. 96) while the four other methods lead to quite similar RMSE (from 6. 4 % to 7. 8 %) and R² (between 0. 79 and 0. 83) values. In the atmosphere compensation processing, an error on the water vapour content is introduced. The most robust methods to water vapour content variations are WISOIL, NINSON, NINSOL and ISER model. The convex envelope model and NSMI index require an accurate estimation of the water vapour content in the atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three chapters that propose some novel approaches on tail risk for financial market and forecasting in finance and macroeconomics. The {{first part of this}} dissertation focuses on financial market correlations and introduces a simple measure of tail correlation, TailCoR, while the second contribution addresses the issue of identification of non- normal structural shocks in Vector Autoregression which is common on finance. The third part belongs to the vast literature on predictions of economic growth; the problem is tackled using a Bayesian Dynamic Factor model to predict Norwegian GDP. Chapter I: TailCoRThe first chapter introduces a simple measure of tail correlation, TailCoR, which disentangles linear and <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> <b>correlation.</b> The aim is to capture all features of financial market co- movement when extreme events (i. e. financial crises) occur. Indeed, tail correlations may arise because asset prices are either linearly correlated (i. e. the Pearson correlations are different from zero) or non-linearly correlated, meaning that asset prices are dependent at the tail of the distribution. Since it is based on quantiles, TailCoR has three main advantages: i) it is not based on asymptotic arguments, ii) it is very general as it applies with no specific distributional assumption, and iii) it is simple to use. We show that TailCoR also disentangles easily between linear and non-linear correlations. The measure has been successfully tested on simulated data. Several extensions, useful for practitioners, are presented like downside and upside tail correlations. In our empirical analysis, we apply this measure to eight major US banks for the period 2003 - 2012. For comparison purposes, we compute the upper and lower exceedance correlations and the parametric and non-parametric tail dependence coefficients. On the overall sample, results show that both the linear and non-linear contributions are relevant. The results suggest that co-movement increases during the financial crisis because of both the linear and non- linear correlations. Furthermore, the increase of TailCoR at the end of 2012 is mostly driven by the non-linearity, reflecting the risks of tail events and their spillovers associated with the European sovereign debt crisis. Chapter II: On the identification of non-normal shocks in structural VARThe second chapter deals with the structural interpretation of the VAR using the statistical properties of the innovation terms. In general, financial markets are characterized by non- normal shocks. Under non-Gaussianity, we introduce a methodology based on the reduction of tail dependency to identify the non-normal structural shocks. Borrowing from statistics, the methodology can be summarized in two main steps: i) decor- relate the estimated residuals and ii) the uncorrelated residuals are rotated {{in order to get a}} vector of independent shocks using a tail dependency matrix. We do not label the shocks a priori, but post-estimate on the basis of economic judgement. Furthermore, we show how our approach allows to identify all the shocks using a Monte Carlo study. In some cases, the method can turn out to be more significant when the amount of tail events are relevant. Therefore, the frequency of the series and the degree of non-normality are relevant to achieve accurate identification. Finally, we apply our method to two different VAR, all estimated on US data: i) a monthly trivariate model which studies the effects of oil market shocks, and finally ii) a VAR that focuses on the interaction between monetary policy and the stock market. In the first case, we validate the results obtained in the economic literature. In the second case, we cannot confirm the validity of an identification scheme based on combination of short and long run restrictions which is used in part of the empirical literature. Chapter III :Nowcasting NorwayThe third chapter consists in predictions of Norwegian Mainland GDP. Policy institutions have to decide to set their policies without knowledge of the current economic conditions. We estimate a Bayesian dynamic factor model (BDFM) on a panel of macroeconomic variables (all followed by market operators) from 1990 until 2011. First, the BDFM is an extension to the Bayesian framework of the dynamic factor model (DFM). The difference is that, compared with a DFM, there is more dynamics in the BDFM introduced in order to accommodate the dynamic heterogeneity of different variables. How- ever, in order to introduce more dynamics, the BDFM requires to estimate a large number of parameters, which can easily lead to volatile predictions due to estimation uncertainty. This is why the model is estimated with Bayesian methods, which, by shrinking the factor model toward a simple naive prior model, are able to limit estimation uncertainty. The second aspect is the use of a small dataset. A common feature of the literature on DFM is the use of large datasets. However, there is a literature that has shown how, for the purpose of forecasting, DFMs can be estimated on a small number of appropriately selected variables. Finally, through a pseudo real-time exercise, we show that the BDFM performs well both in terms of point forecast, and in terms of density forecasts. Results indicate that our model outperforms standard univariate benchmark models, that it performs as well as the Bloomberg Survey, and that it outperforms the predictions published by the Norges Bank in its monetary policy report.

A <b>Non</b> <b>Linear</b> Generalized Maxwell Model (NLGMM), with only 4 independent parameters is proposed. The proposed NLGMM {{is based on}} the decomposition between the linear viscoelasticity and the <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> stiffness. This assumption is validated on a large range of experimental measures. The efficiency of the NLGMM is shown for different kinds of excitations in <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> dynamics : periodic, transient or random excitations. The <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> stiffness is represented by a simple polynomial function. Comparisons between measures and computed values have been carried on several viscoelastic samples. The NLGMM shows a good accordance with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} a <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> viscoelastic constitutive model: it involves both <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> elasticity {{as well as}} <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> viscous behaviour. The main objective of this model is to reproduce the(γGand) and (γD) curves synthesizing the dependence of both the shear modulus and damping on the excitation level. To do so, the <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> elastic part of the model is described by a hyperbolic law. The <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> viscous part combines a NCQ for linear damping (generalized Maxwell body, Moczo et Kristek, 2005) and a <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> viscous contribution described by a hyperbolic variation with the strain level. Furthermore, this model complies with the thermodynamic principles of continuum mechanics (e. g. derivation from potentials and dissipation function). Starting from this mechanical formulation, the analysis of 1 D strong motion amplification is then performed thanks to a discretization by the finite element method. Various numerical issues have been carefully considered to describe the whole algorithmic procedure (for both elastic and viscous <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> components of the constitutive law). Detailed validations of the model have shown its ability to recover low amplitude ground motion response. For larger excitation levels, since the model includes the main features of soil <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> behaviour, the analysis of seismic wave propagation in soil layers leads to interesting results : at the free-surface the amplification peaks are shifted to lower frequency values (when compared to the input motion); higher frequency components are not overdamped as for the equivalent linear model; the amplification level is generally lower...|$|R

The Takagi-Sugeno's model combines <b>linear</b> models with <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> membership functions.

They behave as nano-antennas providing multiple resonances which {{are driven by}} independent geometrical parameters. Coexistence of multiple wavelengths that respect the energy conservation conditions of second order frequency conversion schemes is thus possible in these structures. Such antennas also confines incoming electric field at resonance therefore favoring <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> processes {{through the creation of}} greater quantities of <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> polarization in cavities filled with a <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> material.

The <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> character comes from the highly deformable structure of the bearing made of thin steel sheets and from the Coulomb friction forces arising during dynamic displacements. The present work shows the <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> response of a rigid rotor supported by a pair of such bearings and entrained at 82 krpm. The measurements performed during the coast down revealed sub synchronous and asynchronous vibrations of the rotor and their multiples.

40|$|Although non {{linearity}} characterizes most real control problems, {{methods for}} analysis and control design are considerably {{more powerful and}} theoretically founded for linear systems than for <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> ones.

In this paper we propose a hybrid architecture for the indirect control of <b>non</b> <b>linear</b> discrete time plants from their observed input-output behaviour.
