60|$|He did not answer, he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, but lay as she {{had left}} him. She wiped {{her face with her}} handkerchief, waiting. Then she bent over him. He did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. She saw his {{forehead}} was swollen and inflamed with the sun. Very gently she wiped from it the glistening sweat. He closed his eyes, and she wiped his cheeks and his mouth. Still he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. She bent very close to him, feeling her heart crushed with grief for him.|$|R

25|$|Discourse {{functions}} such as turn taking {{are largely}} regulated through head movement and eye gaze. Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.|$|E
25|$|Web sites produce traffic rankings and {{statistics}} {{based on those}} people who access the sites while using their toolbars and other means of online measurements. The difficulty with this is that it's <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the complete traffic picture for a site. Large sites usually hire the services of companies such as the Nielsen NetRatings or Quancast, but their reports are available only by subscription.|$|E

25|$|While {{waiting for}} their turn in the {{electric}} chair, Makley and Pierpont carved a pair of revolvers from large bars of soap, and blackened them with shoe polish. On September 22, 1934, the two used these props to attempt an escape. They assaulted a guard and freed Clark from his cell nearby. Before they had gone far, Clark, who was <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> an imminent death sentence, lost his nerve and retreated to his cell. Moments later, armed guards arrived and shot Makley and Pierpont. Makley, hit in the thorax and abdomen, died on the scene. Pierpont was seriously wounded, but survived and was later executed. Makley's death certificate states that internal hemorrhaging from these wounds caused his death. He is buried in the Sugar Ridge Cemetery in Leipsic, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|British Trotskyite publication, the Socialist Review, praised Chomsky's {{discussion}} {{of the impact of}} neoliberalism in the US, however they asserted that [...] "when it comes to crucial questions - how do we fight and what are we fighting for - Chomsky's response is lacking." [...] They assert that his claims that communities can challenge the Republican and Democrat domination of the electoral system are [...] "somewhat bizarre" [...] given that he has already established how [...] "corrupt and biased" [...] that system is. Criticising him for <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the concept of a potential revolution, they also express disagreement with his view that the [...] "solution for the 99%" [...] can be found within [...] "the framework of capitalism".|$|E
500|$|Mega Man X {{received}} {{criticism from}} some publications as well. Ed Semrad, Danyon Carpenter, and Al Manuel of the EGM review panel all {{noted that the}} game may have too low a difficulty level; Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well. Super Play editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging. [...] "A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see you through the harder bits," [...] Nicholson explained. [...] "Within the level you'll also find restart points, extra lives, and no harsh time limit {{to put pressure on}} your performance. Couple this with a password system that records your level completion, status and weapon accumulation and you'll see we're <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a lasting challenge for the experienced player." [...] Nintendo Power criticized how little the game had changed stating that [...] "the theme remains the same as the Game Boy and NES Mega Man titles." ...|$|E

500|$|Cinema Blend Amanda Krill said Stevens' wig {{looked like}} a [...] "Stepford Wives wig", adding: [...] "Everyone {{has a hard time}} <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it. She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2007, {{just before}} Worcestershire's 2007 {{campaign}} got underway, Hick said that despite being contracted {{only for the}} season, {{he did not want}} to retire at the end of the summer. He said, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it as my last season ... a lot of people say you are a long time retired ...

2500|$|While on the December 12, 2010, {{episode of}} Meet the Press, Bloomberg ruled out {{a run for}} the {{presidency}} in 2012, stating: [...] "I'm not going to run for president," [...] further adding [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the possibility of running... no way, no how." [...] On July 24, 2011, in the midst of Democrats' and Republicans' inability to agree on a budget plan and thus an increase in the federal debt limit, the Washington Post published a blog post about groups organizing third party approaches. It focused on Bloomberg as the best hope for a serious third-party presidential candidacy in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Cortez motioned {{the fighters}} back {{together}} {{to resume the}} fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his hands up and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, {{and was unable to}} beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather. After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was [...] "blindsided" [...] by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that [...] "In the ring, you have to protect yourself at all times".|$|E
2500|$|Davidman {{was a child}} prodigy, {{who scored}} above 150 on IQ testing, with {{exceptional}} critical, analytical and musical skills. She read H. G. Wells's The Outline of History {{at the age of}} eight and was able to play a score of Chopin on the piano, after having read it once and <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it again. At an early age, she read George MacDonald's children's books and his adult fantasy book, Phantastes. [...] She wrote about the influence of these stories: [...] "They developed in me a lifelong taste for fantasy, which led me years later to C. S. Lewis, who in turn led me to religion." [...] A sickly child, suffering from a crooked spine, scarlet fever and anemia throughout her school years, and attending classes with much older classmates, she later referred to herself at this time as being [...] "bookish, over-precocious and arrogant".|$|E
2500|$|During {{a conference}} call Ergen stated after being asked about the removal of AMC channels, [...] "Our {{customers}} are <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> zombies in New York City.

And for whatever reason, our customers don't watch some of those critically acclaimed channels at the level that we read about in the paper, perhaps because we skew a bit rural or whatever." [...] Ergen also said [...] "I've had satellite television {{for as long as}} satellite television has been around, and there's never been one minute that I know of that anybody in my family or anybody who's came to my house has ever watched one second of any of those channels. They have no clue about zombies in New York City marching around saying, 'Where is my AMC?'" [...] Soon after the call, Business Insider blared the headline, [...] "Dish CEO says customers don't care about AMC because they live on 'farms and ranches.'" ...|$|E
