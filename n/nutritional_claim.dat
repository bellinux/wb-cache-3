The objective {{of this paper is}} to assess consumers’ valuation of some <b>nutritional</b> <b>claims</b> (‘high in fiber’ and ‘reduced saturated fat’) in a European country and to test for differences among consumers. An artefactual non-hypothetical experiment was carried out in a realistic setting (mock/real brick-and-mortar supermarket) with a sample of 121 Spanish consumers stratified by gender, age, and body mass index. A latent class model was specified and estimated with the data from the experiment. Results indicate that consumers positively valued both <b>nutritional</b> <b>claims,</b> but the valuation was heterogeneous, and three consumer segments were detected. Two of them positively valued both <b>nutritional</b> <b>claims</b> (named ‘nutritional claim seekers’), while the third segment’s valuation was negative (named ‘nutritional claim avoiders’). This last segment is characterized by being younger males with university studies who give the least importance to health, natural ingredients, and the calorie/sugar/fat content when shopping.

30|$|The local {{chain case}} study is {{expected}} to perform better on other aspects of sustainability. For example, biodiversity is emphasized as a management strategy and the farmer explicitly refers to biodiversity protection when describing the farming system, seeds’ selection, and bread wheat processing. In addition, farmer’s added value received for wheat and bread {{is expected to be}} higher than in the other chains. The local bread is a niche product, with peculiar features and the farmer asserts that the price is fixed on the basis of production costs, which allows him to be economically sustainable. This however does not imply economic efficiency, as the farmer states that he activates the milling plant in relation to market demand for flour and bread, but quite below the production potential. In terms of information and communication, at the local level a much less costly communication strategy occurs, based on the “word of mouth” and direct social relationships. The role of trust between consumers and producer plays here a crucial role, and it is strongly related to the territorial identity of products and processes. The nutritional value of the local bread is object of particularly intense information transfers, also supported by the collaborations of supply chains with researchers – also in the medical fields – although there isn’t any formal <b>nutritional</b> <b>claim</b> on the products.|$|E
40|$|In food {{industry}} ozone is an emerging technology {{applied in the}} sanitization of food plant equipment and reuse of waste water. First of all, it acts as antimicrobial agent since the broad spectrum of action combined with the total absence of by-products makes ozone a good substitute for other disinfectants. Moreover ozone has been officially recognized as a GRAS additive and it {{is considered to be}} an ecological gas leaving the foodstuff treated free from residues. At the same time, ozone is an oxidizing agent and therefore an high concentration of ozone could alter the nutritional composition of the food especially lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and vitamins. In particular lipid oxidation can cause the deterioration of color, flavor, texture compromising the shelf-life. As this regard, a key factor is also the dose employed which should be determined {{from time to time in}} function of its specific application. In this study the oxidative stability of different vegetable oils (corn, olive, peanut, seed, soy and sunflower) treated with ozone for increasing time periods (1, 3 and 5 minutes) at room temperature were analyzed. Oxidative stability was expressed in hours using a Rancimat apparatus which measured conductometrically the formation of volatile acids produced by the free radical chain reaction. Results showed that ozone always reduced significantly (p < 0, 001) the oxidative stability of vegetable oils especially peanut, corn and soy in comparison to corresponding controls. In addition ozone was clearly associated with time exposure. Further analysis will be performed to assess the effect of ozone on the chemical-physical behaviour of treated oils and on their lipid profile to find potential <b>nutritional</b> <b>claim...</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Nutritional</b> <b>claims</b> {{have become}} a major {{instrument}} for providing consumers with information {{at the point of}} purchase, enabling them to make nutritionally appropriate choices. This paper deals with two public policy issues linked to the implementation of <b>nutritional</b> <b>claims,</b> i. e. efficiency and equity, in terms of nutritional outcomes and in terms of population targeting. We consider the French breakfast foods market at the household level using 2004 TNS Worldpanel data. We estimate a demand system taking into account the selection issue. For this we use the Shonkwiler and Yen’s procedure which, unlike Heckman’s, allows participation on every market of products to be controlled for. We propose a modification of this approach to address the methodological issue of satisfying the additivity constraint. This procedure is estimated on a set of dairy and cereal-based products which have different health attributes. Our results show that products with health claims play the role they are expected for. The light variants of dairy foods considered here appear to target households with members at health risk, obese or overweight. But interactions between products suggest some limits to efficiency on nutritional grounds. A higher probability of purchasing light products and with higher quantities coincides with higher purchases of biscuits and dairy desserts. Moreover, since lower income discourage the use of products with health claims, equity is not obtained and this should be stressed for policy implications. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>claims,</b> Food policy, Healthy diet, Censored Demand system, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
40|$|Healthy diet is {{generally}} {{believed to have}} a major influence on both the prevention and development of chronic non-communicable diseases like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular events, cancer, and osteoporosis. Actually, most food-derived macro and micronutrients, as well as phytochemicals, are able to regulate key metabolic pathways and modulate oxidative stress and inflammatory signalling. Accordingly, interventions designed for healthy eating have become a hot topic in nutritional research and the intake of a number of food is nowadays highly recommended to get and maintain physical and mental health. 1 The potential of pulses to address nutritional needs, for example, has been recently acknowledged by UN General Assembly, which declared 2016 International Year of Pulses. Although recognizing their important role in healthy diet, the full set of benefits that pulse crops can offer has not been fully characterized yet, and this results in an intriguing research opportunity. To raise awareness about the important role of pulses in healthy diets and their contribution to nutrition, we focused our attention on Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Zolfino Landraces), a small, pale yellow Tuscan bean coming from the very small mountainous region of Pratomagno, between the provinces of Arezzo and Florence. 2, 3 This particular variety of bean differs from the other ones for the high content of flavonoids, known for their antioxidant and chelating properties. However, it contains also a number of amphiphilic compounds, represented by saponins, whose functional activities have not been thoroughly studied yet. Being characterized by a rigid hydrophobic group, connected via glycoside bonds to hydrophilic oligosaccharide chain, these compounds are acknowledge as natural surfactants able to exert beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels. However, investigated in depth, saponins proved also to modulate the activity of aldose reductase, a key enzyme of glucose metabolism involved in long term diabetic complications, thus opening up a novel <b>nutritional</b> <b>claim</b> for this kind of pulse...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} how inferences play a role in consumers 2 ̆ 7 understanding of product claims. Graeff and Olson (1994) suggest that inferences occur in consumers 2 ̆ 7 interpretation of all product information. Past research has focused on missing information (e. g., Huber 2 ̆ 6 McCann, 1982; Kardes, 1988 b) and conclusion drawing (Hovland 2 ̆ 6 Mandell, 1952) paradigms; however this study encompasses both situations and tests the idea that consumers make inferences in all situations. ^ A (2 x 2 x 3) between-subjects design, manipulating involvement and claim specificity and measuring product knowledge, was used to study inferences from product claims that are either specific or vague. Omission detection was used as the framework of the study. Two types of product claims were tested: nutritional and environmental. ^ The results indicate that for environmental products there was no difference in product attitude in high and low involved consumers after seeing specific product claims. However, the high involvement group had a more positive product attitude after seeing the vague claim than the low involvement group after seeing the vague claim. The high knowledge group had significantly more positive attitude toward the product when shown a specific claim supporting the hypothesis. No difference was found, however, between the knowledge groups 2 ̆ 7 product attitude after seeing the vague claim. ^ Results from the nutritional data show few significant findings. Only further analysis of the attitude toward the claim produced significant results. These tests indicated that consumers with relatively higher levels of knowledge had a significantly more positive attitude toward nutritional claims. Specific claims themselves are evaluated significantly more positively than vague claims by all consumers regardless of their level of knowledge. ^ The strongest factor in both parts of the study is the knowledge variable. In the case of environmental claims, high and low knowledge consumers viewed the vague and specific claims differently; higher knowledge subjects regard specific claims as more positive. The results of the nutritional claims were more broad based; higher knowledge groups viewed either type of <b>nutritional</b> <b>claim</b> positively. ^ It is proposed that current theories be evaluated and additional variables perhaps be added to account for differences not discovered here. Further, it is clear that the issue of claim specificity is product specific and must be evaluated accordingly. ...|$|E
