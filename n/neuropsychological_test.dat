500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of minimal hepatic encephalopathy requires neuropsychological testing by definition. Older tests include the [...] "numbers connecting test" [...] A and B (measuring {{the speed at}} which one could connect randomly dispersed numbers 1–20), the [...] "block design test" [...] and the [...] "digit-symbol test". In 2009 an expert panel concluded that <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>test</b> batteries aimed at measuring multiple domains of cognitive function are generally more reliable than single tests, and tend to be more strongly correlated with functional status. Both the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and PSE-Syndrom-Test may be used for this purpose. The PSE-Syndrom-Test, developed in Germany and validated in several other European countries, incorporates older assessment tools such as the number connection test.|$|E

40|$|The CAMCOG, ADAS-cog, and MMSE, {{designed}} to grade global cognitive ability in dementia have inadequate {{precision and accuracy}} in distinguishing mild dementia from normal ageing. Adding <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> to their scale might improve precision and accuracy in mild dementia. We, therefore, pooled neuropsychological test-batteries from two memory clinics (ns = 135 and 186) with CAMCOG data from a population study and 2 memory clinics (n = 829) and ADAS-cog data from 3 randomized controlled trials (n = 713) to estimate a common dimension of global cognitive ability using Rasch analysis. Item difficulties and individuals' global cognitive ability levels were estimated. Difficulties of 57 items (of 64) could be validly estimated. <b>Neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> were more difficult than the CAMCOG, ADAS-cog, and MMSE items. Most <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> had difficulties in the ability range of normal ageing to mild dementia. Higher than average ability levels were more precisely measured when <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> {{were added to the}} MMSE than when these were measured with the MMSE alone. Diagnostic accuracy in mild dementia was consistently better after adding <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> to the MMSE. We conclude that extending dementia specific instruments with <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> improves measurement precision and accuracy of cognitive impairment in mild dementia.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the identification of a series of <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> suitable to be used to assess an individual’s ability to drive and especially of those individuals that are questionably demented or are in a subtle state of cognitive decline (and therefore are the most difficult to identify). The relative ability of the <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> to discriminate between “poor-driving” and “not-poor-driving” and the effect of other factors such as age and a composite cognitive measure (based on all nine <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests)</b> was also evaluated in discriminating “poor-drivers” and “not-poor-drivers”.|$|R
2500|$|Clinical neuropsychology is the {{application}} of neuropsychological knowledge to the assessment (see <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>test</b> and neuropsychological assessment), management, and rehabilitation {{of people who have}} suffered illness or injury (particularly to the brain) which has caused neurocognitive problems. In particular they bring a psychological viewpoint to treatment, to understand how such illness and injury may affect and be affected by psychological factors. They also can offer an opinion as to whether a person is demonstrating difficulties due to brain pathology or as a consequence of an emotional or another (potentially) reversible cause or both. [...] For example, a test might show that both patients X and Y are unable to name items that they have been previously exposed to within the past 20 minutes (indicating possible dementia). [...] If patient Y can name some of them with further prompting (e.g. given a categorical clue such as being told that the item they could not name is a fruit), this allows a more specific diagnosis than simply dementia (Y appears to have the vascular type which is due to brain pathology but is usually at least somewhat reversible). [...] Clinical neuropsychologists often work in hospital settings in an interdisciplinary medical team; others work in private practice and may provide expert input into medico-legal proceedings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSeveral {{investigators}} have {{reported on the}} relationship between metabolism, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and function, using <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients, but the opinions regarding the results remain in contention. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the relationship between metabolism, using proton MRS (1 H-MRS), and function using several <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> in the temporal lobes of TLE patients. We studied 29 TLE patients at our hospital using 1 H-MRS and <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests.</b> We used a clinical 1. 5 T MR unit. We conducted five <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> to examine the function of the left or right temporal lobe. There were significant correlations between the N-acetylaspartate/creatine + phosphocreatine (NAA/Cr) ratios and the scores of almost all of the <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> for the temporal lobe function ipsilateral to the spike focus. However, in two Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) subtests we found no significant correlation in the ipsilateral side. These findings suggest that the NAA/Cr ratios, which reflect neural metabolism, are closely related to function in the temporal lobes of TLE patients. The disparity between the results in two subtests of WMS-R show that several tests may be necessary in order to assess temporal lobe function...|$|R
40|$|Elderly {{patients}} may present with prominent cognitive complaints and have performances in <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> within {{the normal range}} for the age and education, and thus do not fulfill the criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). There is insufficient {{evidence to support the}} clinical decision in these cases (“pre-MCI”). Forty-three subjects, 11 controls, 15 “pre-MCI,” and 17 MCI, were followed for about three and half years with <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>testing</b> and magnetic resonance imaging including volumetric measurements of the hippocampus and amygdala. Two of the “pre-MCI” subjects suffered cognitive and functional deterioration and were diagnosed with dementia. Although the “pre-MCI” subjects as a group had no significant deterioration in <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests,</b> they suffered a decline in the total hippocampal volume (P = 0. 04) along the follow-up time. In contrast, all control subjects remained stable and had no volumetric decreases. As expected, MCI patients underwent significant deterioration in several <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests,</b> often progressed to Alzheimer’s disease, and showed decreases both in total hippocampal and amygdalar volumes.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated 31 patients with multiple sclerosis with brain MR imaging and <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>testing.</b> Impairment was determined by comparison with demographically matched healthy controls. MR imaging generated measures of lesion burden (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense volume), general atrophy (brain parenchymal fraction), central atrophy (lateral ventricle volume), and lobar atrophy (regional brain parenchymal fraction of frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes in each hemi-sphere). <b>Neuropsychological</b> <b>testing</b> emphasized measures of processing speed and memory, because these are commonly affected in multiple sclerosis.

40|$|The {{orbitofrontal cortex}} (OFC) plays {{a crucial role}} in {{behavior}} and is a common site for damage due to different types of injuries, e. g., closed head injuries, cerebrovascular accidents, tumors, neurosurgical interventions. Despite the (severe) behavioral changes following OFC lesions, persons with damage to the OFC appear to be cognitively intact, i. e., at least when assessed by means of standard <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests.</b> Meanwhile, <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> addressing reversal learning, gambling, and social cognition show a decline in these patients. The goal of the present review is to link the performance of these latter <b>neuropsychological</b> <b>tests</b> to behavior. The results suggest that in patients with orbitofrontal lesions, reversal learning is more associated with behavioral disinhibition and that impairment in recognition of expressed emotion is more associated with social inappropriate behavior. The faux pas test (theory of mind) appears not to be sensitive to orbitofrontal lesions.
