40|$|Stratigraphic {{units with}} the {{potential}} for carbonate-hosted asbestos account for < 3 % of the land area of South Australia. Known asbestos occurrences are small, low grade and commonly weathered. The main mode of occurrence is as cross-fibre and slip-fibre veins of asbestiform magnesio-riebeckite (AMR) in metasomatised dolomites, and fibrous tremolite associated with talc mineralisation in the Adelaide Geosyncline. Small occurrences of chrysotile asbestos are hosted by dolomites in the Hutchison Group in the eastern Gawler Craton. Hyperspectral mapping could be used to locate additional asbestos mineralisation. Disturbance of natural asbestos-bearing materials in South Australia has been through mining, agriculture and natural weathering processes. Release of respirable <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> from rocks and soils is feasible and could potentially account for some cases of mesothelioma in South Australia. Only a very small portion of the population is considered at risk of being exposed to fibres from disturbance of <b>natural</b> <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres.</b> Persons considered most at risk of potential exposure include: rural workers and communities residing close to areas of intense agricultural disturbance of asbestos-bearing soils; construction workers involved in large-scale earthworks projects in areas underlain by asbestos-bearing rocks and soils; and quarry workers who unwittingly disturb asbestos-bearing materials. Populations regularly exposed to amphibole fibres {{for a long period of}} time are at greatest risk with respect to mesothelioma. Epidemiological studies suggest that the risks of mesothelioma for those exposed to chrysotile fibres alone are negligible. Toxicological studies are required to better understand the potential health risks associated with AMR. Current medical reporting of asbestos in South Australia does not include detailed residential or occupational histories required to undertake a statistically significant study of the possible health effects of <b>asbestos</b> from <b>natural</b> sources. Government authorities and private enterprises need to take geological factors into account to reduce the likelihood of unplanned disturbance of natural asbestos-bearing materials. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|SEM and {{elemental}} analysis techniques (EDS, WDS) {{are widely used}} for geological materials analyses for providing morphological and chemical information. Other techniques coupled to SEM are also useful, such as cathodoluminescence, EBSD [...] . Raman micro-spectroscopy is also a useful technique for geomaterials characterisation. This technique {{is based on the}} study of the inelastic diffusion of the light. The interaction of vibrational energy levels of molecules and incident beam photons provides a spectra which permits to provide structural information on the sample atomic structure. In particular, Applying Raman spectroscopy to geological samples allows differentiating between different polymorphs (same elemental composition, different crystallography), between oxide and hydroxide or to check the level of order of the crystal. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy and SEM/EDS are complementary techniques. Data collected from these techniques are essential for many studies in different fields of geosciences (mineralogy, petrography, soil pollution, environmental science [...] .). Moreover, these informations can be obtained at a similar scale (micrometre). But, in numerous cases, it is difficult to collect information on the same object, for several reasons : differences of imaging mode (optical microscopy for Raman, SE/BSE imaging for SEM) which make difficult to connect optical and electronic imaging observations, size of the analysed object vs resolution of optical microscopy [...] . In 1988, Truchet and Delhaye [1] proposed a description of an optical system for simultaneous Raman spectroscopy and {{elemental analysis}} in an electron microprobe. Such system is now available for installation on any SEM. This combination offers new opportunities for analysing the same object at the same scale without facing the problems associated with using separate tools. Thus, coupling this two techniques in the same system constitute a powerful analytic set which allows to save time in the analytical process. But the main interest is that this coupled system allows to perform analyses at the same scale, coupling information on morphology, elemental chemistry and structural chemistry. Such a combined system has been successfully used on different fields like forensic applications [2], biological samples characterization [3, 4]. The aim {{of this study is to}} present the value of combining SEM and Raman analysis of geological samples characterisation. We will describe the system combining a Raman spectroscope installed on a Low Vacuum FEG-SEM and the interest in combining Raman spectra with SE/BSE/CL images and EDS/EBSD data. We will present several applications examples of the combined use of Raman and SEM on geological samples such as <b>natural</b> <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> identification, minerals identification or biominerals analyses.

METHODS: Case-control study; 147 confirmed cases of mesothelioma and 122 controls identified from deaths occurring in four districts of Yorkshire between 1979 and 1991. Surviving relatives were interviewed to determine lifetime exposure history to <b>asbestos.</b> Mineral <b>fibre</b> analysis was carried out on lung tissue from postmortem examinations. RESULTS: Odds on high concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> were greater in cases than controls. After excluding subjects with occupational and paraoccupational exposure, the odds on high concentrations were still greater in cases than controls, but only significantly so for amphiboles. There was only a weak relation between probability of occupational exposure to asbestos and concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres,</b> and no significant difference in fibre concentrations was found between subjects who had been exposed to asbestos through different routes: these comparisons were only based on small groups. There was considerable overlap in concentrations of retained <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> between cases and controls with and without histories of occupational exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The study has confirmed previous results of higher concentrations of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> in cases than controls, and has shown that this is still found in subjects with little evidence of occupational and para-occupational exposure.

Since the 1970 s, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> have been considered carcinogenic in humans i. e as a known cancer-causing agent. In the environment, <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> are inactive and naturally resist biodegradation. In time, fibres can only be ground into smaller particles by mechanical force.

Among these are diseases with long latency periods of 10 to 40 years such as: asbestosis, mesothelioma and lung cancer. Asbestos is the generic, industrial name for a group of six minerals determined by common size and inherent physical properties. Crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite and actinolite are all asbestos minerals from the amphibole mineral group.

The highest concentrations were noted on Farm B was 529 fibres•m [sup]- 3 [/sup], on average; on farm A the mean concentration of respirable fibres was 328 fibres•m [sup]- 3 [/sup], whereas the lowest mean concentration of airborne respirable <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibres</b> was noted on farm C, where there were no asbestos products (30 fibres•m [sup]- 3 [/sup]). ...|$|R
