40|$|Sleep {{disturbances}} are {{prevalent in}} clinical anxiety, {{but it remains}} unclear whether they are cause and/or consequence of this condition. Fear conditioning constitutes a valid laboratory model for the acquisition of normal and pathological anxiety. To explore the relationship between disturbed sleep and anxiety in more detail, the present study evaluated the effect of partial sleep deprivation (SD) on fear conditioning in healthy individuals. The neural correlates of 1) <b>nonassociative</b> <b>learning</b> and physiological processing and 2) associative learning (differential fear conditioning) were addressed. Measurements entailed simultaneous functional MRI, EEG, skin conductance response (SCR), and pulse recordings. Regarding <b>nonassociative</b> <b>learning,</b> partial SD resulted in a generalized failure to habituate during fear conditioning, as evidenced by reduced habituation of SCR and hypothalamus responses to all stimuli. Furthermore, SCR and hypothalamus activity were correlated, supporting their functional relationship. Regarding associative learning, effects of partial SD on the acquisition of conditioned fear were weaker and did not reach statistical significance. The hypothalamus plays an integral role in the regulation of sleep and autonomic arousal. Thus sleep disturbances may play a causal {{role in the development}} of normal and possibly pathological fear by increasing the susceptibility of the sympathetic nervous system to stressful experiences...|$|E

40|$|Feeding a {{novel food}} (Fonzies) to rats fed ad libitum with {{standard}} food increased extracellular dopamine (DA) in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFCX) {{and in the}} medial nucleus accumbens (NAc). Previous Fonzies feeding, although it {{did not affect the}} increase of extracellular DA in the PFCX in response to Fonzies feeding, blunted that increase in the NAc (habituation); recovery from habituation in the NAc was complete 5 d after previous Fonzies feeding. Predictive association of an otherwise neutral stimulus extrinsic to Fonzies (empty plastic box) with Fonzies feeding resulted in the acquisition by the stimulus of the property to elicit incentive responses directed toward the stimulus and to increase extracellular DA in the PFCX. However, the same stimulus, or a more complex stimulus including intrinsic stimuli (Fonzies-filled plastic box), failed to acquire the ability to modify extracellular DA in the NAc. Pseudoconditioning, i. e., nonpredictive association of the extrinsic stimulus (empty box) with Fonzies feeding, did not result in acquisition by the stimulus of the property to elicit incentive responses and to increase extracellular DA in the PFCX. Repeated nonreinforced presentation of previously conditioned extrinsic stimuli (empty box) resulted in extinction of the property to elicit incentive responses and to increase extracellular DA in the PFCX. These results indicate that in rats fed ad libitum, phasic activation of mesocortical and mesolimbic DA systems by motivational stimuli is differentially influenced by associative (conditioning) and <b>nonassociative</b> (habituation) <b>learning</b> mechanisms and is differentially related to acquisition and expression of incentive motivation...|$|R
40|$|As {{summarized}} {{in the present}} volume, the mechanisms that underlie learning and memory in invertebrates {{are the subject of}} intense study. Behavioral studies encompass many learning protocols, ranging from simple forms of <b>nonassociative</b> and associative <b>learning</b> such as habituation, sensitization, and classical and operant conditioning to higher forms of learning, such as observational learning. Moreover, mechanistic analyses span levels of biological organization ranging from gene regulatory networks to signal transduction cascades, single cells, and neural networks, as well as spanning temporal domains ranging from milliseconds to days. The vast amounts of data, their diversity, and their inherent complexity make it difficult to arrive at an intuitive and comprehensive understand of relationships among molecular, cellular, and network properties and cognitive processes such as learning and memory. p 0030 Mathematical models and computer simulations provide quantitative and modifiable frameworks for representing, integrating, and manipulating complex data sets. The development and analyses of computational models of learning and memory mechanisms are helping to elucidate biological principles that are common in diverse species, common to more than one form of learning, and common to learning-induced changes in different types of behaviors.

40|$|The two {{closely related}} parasitoids Cotesia glomerata and C. rubecula (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) coexist in The Netherlands where they occupy {{slightly}} different niches. When searching for their caterpillar hosts, they use host plant odours that are released upon feeding by the caterpillars. The species {{differ in their}} preference for plant odours during host searching after an associative learning experience. Cotesia glomerata changes its preference for the odour of a particular plant species after an oviposition experience on that plant, whereas C. rubecula does not alter its naïve preference. Using no-choice wind tunnel bioassays we tested, for both species, to what extent oviposition induces memory formation and whether this results from associative learning. In experiment 1 we characterized the temporal dynamics of the memory trace. In both species, oviposition experience induced increased response levels compared to those of naïve wasps. Memory dynamics differed between the species. A single associative learning experience induced a stable long-lasting memory trace that persisted for at least 5 days in C. glomerata. In C. rubecula a memory trace for the odour was present during the first day after the oviposition experience but waned over the following days. From a second experiment we concluded that the increased response {{could be attributed to}} a combination of <b>nonassociative</b> and associative <b>learning.</b> We furthermore formulate the learning paradigm for the parasitoids and hypothesize that adaptation to different spatial distributions of the preferred host species has led to the observed differences in memory dynamic...|$|R
40|$|Nucleus accumbens {{dopamine}} {{is known}} {{to play an important}} role in motor activity and in behaviours governed by drugs and natural reinforcers, as well as in <b>nonassociative</b> forms of <b>learning.</b> At the same time, activation of D- 1 and D- 2 dopamine receptors has been suggested to promote intracellular events related to neural plasticity. Therefore, in this study we wished to investigate the role of the two classes of dopamine receptors within the nucleus accumbens on the consolidation of spatial information. On day 1, CD 1 male mice were placed in an open field containing five different objects and, immediately after three sessions of habituation, the animals were focally injected within the nucleus accumbens with either the D- 1 antagonist SCH 23390 (12. 5, 25 or 50 ng/side), or the D- 2 antagonist sulpiride (25, 50, 75 or 100 ng/side). Twenty-four hours later the ability of mice to discriminate an object displacement was assessed. Both the D- 1 and the D- 2 antagonists impaired the ability of mice to detect the spatial change. If the highest doses of the two antagonists were injected 2 h after the end of the last of the habituation sessions, no effect was observed in the reactivity to spatial change examined 24 h later. These data demonstrate that activation of both D- 1 and D- 2 receptors within the accumbens is necessary in the early stages of the consolidation of spatial information. The data are discussed in terms of involvement of nucleus accumbens dopamine in information processing in the absence of explicit reinforcers. (C) 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{modulation}} of memory, {{as well as}} {{the mechanisms}} underlying memory formation, has become a key issue in neuroscience research. Previously, we found that the formation of long-term, but not short-term, memory for a <b>nonassociative</b> form of <b>learning,</b> sensitization, was modulated by the circadian clock in the diurnal Aplysia californica. To define the scope of circadian modulation of memory, we examined an associative operant learning paradigm, learning that food is inedible (LFI). Significantly greater long-term memory of LFI occurred when A. californica were trained and tested during the subjective day, compared with animals trained and tested in the subjective night. In contrast, animals displayed similar levels of short-term memory for LFI when trained in either the subjective day or night. Circadian modulation of long-term memory for LFI was dependent on the time of training, rather than the time of testing. To broaden our investigation of circadian modulation of memory, we extended our studies to a nocturnal species, Aplysia fasciata. Contrary to the significant memory observed during the day with the diurnal A. californica, A. fasciata showed no long-term memory for LFI when trained during the day. However, A. fasciata demonstrated significant long-term memory when trained and tested during the night. Thus, the circadian clock modulates memory formation in phase with the animals' activity period. The results from our studies of circadian modulation of long-term sensitization and LFI suggest that circadian modulation of memory formation may be a general phenomenon with potentially widespread implications for many types of long-term learning...|$|R

40|$|Habituation is a {{universal}} form of <b>nonassociative</b> <b>learning</b> that results in the devaluation of sensory inputs that have little information content. Although habituation is found throughout nature and has been studied in many organisms, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We performed a forward genetic screen in Drosophila to search for mutations that modified habituation of an olfactory-mediated locomotor startle response, and we isolated a mutation in the glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3) homolog Shaggy. Decreases in Shaggy levels blunted habituation, whereas increases promoted habituation. Additionally, habituation acutely regulated Shaggy by an inhibitory phosphorylation mechanism, suggesting that a signal transduction pathway that regulates Shaggy is engaged during habituation. Although shaggy mutations also affected circadian rhythm period, this requirement was genetically separable from its role in habituation. Thus, shaggy functions in different neuronal circuits to regulate behavioral plasticity to an olfactory startle and circadian rhythmicity...|$|E
40|$|A {{long-term}} {{bias in the}} head-waving {{behavior of}} Aplysia can be induced using bright lights as an aversive stimulus: coupling onset of the lights with head movements to one side results in a bias away from that side (Cook & Carew, 1986).

40|$|This work reviews {{research}} on neural mechanisms of {{two types of}} associative learning in the marine mollusk Aplysia, classical conditioning of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex and operant conditioning of feeding behavior. Basic classical conditioning is caused in part by activity-dependent facilitation at sensory neuron–motor neuron (SN–MN) synapses and involves a hybrid combination of activity-dependent presynaptic facilitation and Hebbian potentiation, which are coordinated by trans-synaptic signaling. Classical conditioning also shows several higher-order features, whichmight {{be explained by the}} known circuit connec-tions in Aplysia. Operant conditioning is caused in part by a different type of mechanism, an intrinsic increase in excitability of an identified neuron in the central pattern generator (CPG) for feeding.

To determine whether {{the time course of}} presynaptic facilitation might be due to a persistent increase in activity of adenylate cyclase (EC 4. 6. 1. 1) itself, persistence of the transmitter, or yet other processes, we developed a perfused-membrane method to analyze the time course of activation of adenylate cyclase by transient stimuli. After stimulation by a pulse of stimulatory transmitter, activation of adenylate cyclase decayed within 60 sec. This finding indicates that the enzyme does not remain persistently active in the absence of transmitter and suggests that short-term retention is likely to be due to other mechanisms. Possible additional mechanisms include continued activation of the cyclase by transmitter, cellular factors extrinsic to the cyclase that prolong the time course of its activation, and persistence of processes downstream from the cyclase...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the role of}} {{serotonin}} (5 HT) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) in sensitization and dishabituation of swim induction (SI) has been investigated in the leech Hirudo medicinalis. Electrical stimulation of the body wall evokes swimming activity with a constant latency. In animals with a disconnection between head ganglion and segmental ganglia, repetitive stimulation induces habituation of swimming whereas brushing on the dorsal skin provokes sensitization of a naïve response or dishabituation of a previously habituated response. Our findings indicate that 5 HT is the neurotransmitter underlying both sensitization and dishabituation of SI. Injection of the 5 HT receptor blocking agent methysergide impaires the onset of sensitization and dishabituation induced by brushing. Moreover, injection of 5 HT mimics these forms of <b>nonassociative</b> <b>learning,</b> whereas injection of dopamine does not. Finally, the effects of 5 HT are mediated by cAMP: (1) after injections of specific adenylate cyclase inhibitors such as MDL 12. 330 A or SQ 22536, brushing becomes ineffective in facilitating the SI in either non-habituated or habituated animals. (2) 8 Br-cAMP application mimics both sensitization and dishabituation of SI. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The Drosophila mutant turnip (tur) was {{isolated}} {{on the basis}} of its poor performance in an olfactory learning task, and also has a reduction in protein kinase C (PKC) activity. PKC has been found in the nervous systems of a wide range of organisms and appears to have an important role in learning and memory-related processes. Unfortunately, previous reports documenting the learning defect of tur lacked the controls required to assess the origins of the poor performance of the mutant. We have analyzed the effects of the tur mutation on both associative and <b>nonassociative</b> <b>learning</b> as well as on PKC activity. Additionally, the effects of the mutation on the task-relevant sensorimotor abilities of the flies were assessed. Although we were able to replicate previous behavioral and biochemical results obtained with tur, we discovered that the tur mutation also affected response to electric shock and caused a drastic reduction in the locomotor ability of the flies. Because locomotion is an essential component of the learning assays, this result makes it impossible to conclude that tur specifically affects learning and demonstrates the crucial importance of sensorimotor controls in conditioning experiments...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{findings}} indicate that synaptic facilitation, a cellular mechanism underlying sensitization of the siphon withdrawal response (SWR) in Aplysia, depends on a cascade of postsynaptic events, including activation of inositol triphosphate (IP 3) receptors and release of Ca 2 + from postsynaptic intracellular stores. These findings suggest that phospholipase C (PLC), the enzyme that catalyzes IP 3 formation, may {{play an important role}} in postsynaptic signaling during facilitation and learning in Aplysia. Using the PLC inhibitor U 73122, we found that PLC activity is required for synaptic facilitation following a 10 -min treatment with 5 -HT, as measured at 20 min after 5 -HT washout. Prior work has indicated that facilitation at this time is supported primarily by postsynaptic processes. To determine whether postsynaptic PLC activity is involved in 5 -HT–mediated facilitatory actions, we examined the effect of U 73122 on enhancement of the response of motor neurons isolated in cell culture to glutamate, the sensory neuron transmitter. A 10 -min application of 5 -HT induced persistent (> 40 min) enhancement of glutamate-evoked potentials (Glu-EPs) recorded from isolated motor neurons, and this enhancement was blocked by U 73122. Finally, we showed that injecting U 73122 into intact animals before behavioral training impaired intermediate-term sensitization, indicating that PLC activity contributes to this form of <b>nonassociative</b> <b>learning...</b>|$|E
40|$|Autoradiography with [14 C] 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -DG) {{was used}} to examine the {{functional}} activity of the rat auditory system during long- and short-term habituation of the acoustic startle reflex. The data showed that presentation of the acoustic stimulus to long-term habituated rats resulted in a learning-related metabolic enhancement that was significantly greater than the response evoked by the same acoustic stimulus in the inexperienced rats. This enhancement was localized to brainstem and midbrain auditory nuclei and no significant changes occurred at thalamocortical levels of the auditory pathway. The largest difference in 2 -DG uptake between long- and short-term habituated rats was in the lateral superior olivary nucleus (LSO). The LSO activation suggests that olivocochlear efferents may operate in a central feedback control of peripheral auditory input during long-term habituation. Findings of enhanced metabolism from the cochlear nuclei to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus indicated that active processes of neuronal plasticity take place in the lower auditory system during long-term habituation. The results provide the first demonstration of how a <b>nonassociative</b> <b>learning</b> experience such as long-term habituation modifies the metabolic activity of the auditory system. The findings support the conclusion that auditory responses of behaving animals to acoustic stimuli are dependent not only on the physical parameters of a stimulus, but also on its learned behavioral significance...|$|E
