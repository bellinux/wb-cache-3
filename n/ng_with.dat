2500|$|In the extinct South Island dialects, ng {{merged with}} k in many regions. Thus Kāi Tahu and Ngāi Tahu are {{variations}} {{in the name of}} the same iwi (the latter form is the one used in acts of Parliament). Since 2000, the government has altered the official names of several southern place names to the southern dialect forms by replacing <b>ng</b> <b>with</b> k. New Zealand's highest mountain, known for centuries as Aoraki in southern Māori dialects that merge <b>ng</b> <b>with</b> k, and as Aorangi by other Māori, was later named [...] "Mount Cook", in honour of Captain Cook. Now its sole official name is Aoraki/Mount Cook, which favours the local dialect form. Similarly, the Māori name for Stewart Island, Rakiura, is cognate with the name of the Canterbury town of Rangiora. Likewise, Dunedin's main research library, the Hocken Collections, has the name Uare Taoka o Hākena rather than the northern (standard) Te Whare Taonga o Hākena. Goodall & Griffiths say there is also a voicing of k to g – this is why the region of Otago (southern dialect) and the settlement it is named after – Otakou (standard Māori) – vary in spelling (the pronunciation of the latter having changed over time to accommodate the northern spelling).|$|E

5000|$|In Indonesia, few {{works have}} been written dealing with lesbianism. To address that, {{beginning}} in August 2007 the LGBT website SepociKopi.com began collecting short stories published up to ten years previously with said theme, both those published in mass media and those published in individual short story anthologies. These works were first republished on the website. Several of the authors published in the anthology had previously written works dealing with lesbianism, including Clara <b>Ng</b> <b>with</b> her novel Gerhana Kembar (Twin Eclipses; 2007) and Linda Christanty with her short story [...] "Mercusuar" [...] ("Lighthouse").|$|E
