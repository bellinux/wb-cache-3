[...] The FAA is invested {{with the authority}} to control traffic in <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace</b> and create operational and safety regulations on aircraft in <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace.</b> According to the FAA, [...] "a <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace</b> free from inconsistent state and local restrictions {{is essential to the}} maintenance of a safe and sound air transportation system." [...] With respect to <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace</b> and the aircraft operating in that airspace, federal regulations have preempted the field and the ability of state and local laws to regulate use of UAVs is limited.|$|E

40|$|<b>Navigable</b> <b>airspaces</b> are {{becoming}} more crowded with increasing air traffic, {{and the number of}} accidents caused by human errors is increasing. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the relationship between air traffic volume and human error in air traffic control (ATC). First, the paper identifies categories and elements of ATC human error through a review of existing literature, and a study through interviews and surveys of ATC safety experts. And then the paper presents the results of an experiment conducted on 52 air traffic controllers sampled from the Korean ATC organization to find out if there is any relationship between traffic volume and air traffic controller human errors. An analysis of the experiment clearly showed that several types of ATC human error are influenced by traffic volume. We hope that the paper will make its contribution to aviation safety by providing a realistic basis for securing proper manpower and facility in accordance with the level of air traffic volume...|$|R
50|$|The world's <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace</b> {{is divided}} into {{three-dimensional}} segments, {{each of which is}} assigned to a specific class. Most nations adhere to the classification specified by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and described below, though they might use only some of the classes defined below, and significantly alter the exact rules and requirements. Similarly, individual nations may also designate special use airspace (SUA) with further rules for reasons of national security or safety.|$|E
5000|$|The {{low cost}} of {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (also called drones) in the 2000s re-raised legal questions regarding whose permission {{is required to}} fly at low altitudes; the landowner, the FAA or both. [...] Although the FAA reestablished that <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace</b> is the space above 500 feet, the FAA also set regulations which allow drones to fly below 400 feet {{in order to prevent}} interference with planes above that height. [...] The FAA's actions are expected to see challenges in the judiciary.|$|E
5000|$|Open-access {{property}} (res nullius) is not 'owned' by anyone. It is non-excludable (no one can exclude {{anyone else}} from using it) {{but may be}} rival (one person's use of it reduces the quantity available to other users). Open-access property is not managed by anyone, and access to it is not controlled. There is no constraint on anyone using open-access property (excluding people is either impossible or prohibitively costly). Examples of open-access property are the upper atmosphere (<b>navigable</b> <b>airspace)</b> or ocean fisheries (navigable waterways).|$|E
50|$|In general, one cannot have a {{reasonable}} expectation of privacy in things held out to the public. A well-known example {{is that there are}} no privacy rights in garbage left for collection in a public place. Other examples include: pen registers that record the numbers dialed from particular telephones; conversations with others, though there could be a Sixth Amendment violation if the police send an individual to question a defendant who has already been formally charged; a person's physical characteristics, such as voice and handwriting; what is observed pursuant to aerial surveillance that is conducted in public <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace</b> not using equipment that unreasonably enhances the surveying government official's vision; anything in open fields (e.g., a barn); smells that can be detected by the use of a drug-sniffing dog during a routine traffic stop, even if the government official did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion to suspect that drugs were present in the defendant's vehicle; and paint scrapings on the outside of a vehicle.|$|E
40|$|The JPL Optical Communications Telescope Laboratory (OCTL) is a 200 sq-m {{located at}} 2. 2. km {{altitude}} in Wrightwood California and houses a state-of-the-art 1 -m telescope. The OCTL team {{is involved in}} the development of operational strategies for ground-to-space laser beam propagation for future NASA optical communications missions. Strategies include safe beam propagation through navigable air space, line of sight optical attenuation monitoring, adaptive optics, and multi-beam scintillation mitigation. This paper presents the results of recent operations at the OCTL facility including telescope characterization data and laser beam propagation experiments to Earth-orbiting retro-reflecting satellites; experiments that validate the telescope's tracking and blind-pointing performance and safe laser beam transmission procedures for propagating through <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace...</b>|$|E
40|$|This order {{specifies}} {{procedures for}} use by all personnel in the joint administration of the airspace program. The guidance and procedures herein incorporate into one publication as many orders, notices, and directives of the affected services as possible. Although every effort {{has been made to}} prescribe complete procedures for the management of the different airspace programs, it is impossible to cover every circumstance. Therefore, when a situation arises {{for which there is no}} specific procedure covered in this order, personnel must exercise their best judgment. The order consists of six parts: a. Part 1 addresses general procedures applicable to airspace management. b. Part 2 addresses policy and procedures unique to Objects Affecting <b>Navigable</b> <b>Airspace.</b> c. Part 3 addresses policy and procedures unique to Airport Airspace Analysis. d. Part 4 addresses policy and procedures unique to Terminal and En Route Airspace. e. Part 5 addresses policy and procedures unique to Special Use Airspace. f. Part 6 addresses policy and procedures regarding the integration of Outdoor Laser Operations, High Intensity Light Operations, and integration of Rocket and Launch-Vehicle Operations into the National Airspace System.

40|$|The {{strategic}} routing {{of aircraft}} through navigable and controlled airspace to minimize adverse noise impact over sensitive areas {{is critical in}} the proper management and planning of the U. S. based airport system. A major objective of this phase of research is to identify, inventory, characterize, and analyze the various environmental, land planning, and regulatory data bases, along with potential three dimensional software and hardware systems that can be potentially applied for an impact assessment of any existing or planned air route. There are eight data bases {{that have to be}} assembled and developed in order to develop three dimensional aircraft route impact methodology. These data bases which cover geographical information systems, sound metrics, land use, airspace operational control measures, federal regulations and advisories, census data, and environmental attributes have been examined and aggregated. A three dimensional format is necessary for planning, analyzing space and possible noise impact, and formulating potential resolutions. The need to develop this three dimensional approach is essential due to the finite capacity of airspace for managing and planning a route system, including airport facilities. It appears that these data bases can be integrated effectively into a strategic aircraft noise routing system which should be developed as soon as possible, as part of a proactive plan applied to our FAA controlled <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace</b> for the United States...|$|E
40|$|In 2002 Australia {{became the}} first nation to {{promulgate}} certification standards for the commercial use of drones or unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Since that time the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has {{played a key role}} both domestically and internationally through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in assisting to develop technical guidance materials that will enable contracting states to develop UAS regulations. An arduous component of this task is the fact that all existing aircraft are capable of being unmanned. Moreover, given the unbounded nature of aircraft operations, UAS regulations necessarily require international harmonisation. But the objective of developing universal UAS standards is still far from being finalised while the accelerating pace of UAS technological development continues to challenge traditional regulatory regimes and legal systems throughout the world. This paper considers the broader legal issues associated with civilian UAS operations and their integration into unsegregated civilian airspace. The Australian UAS regulatory experience is examined with some unique constitutional limitations identified in relation to the application of the so-called ‘commingling theory’. It is contended that such limitations may render void existing UAS regulation in certain situations – many of which are related to the operation of small UAS and may have significant privacy implications. In particular this paper finds that the regulations purporting to control the operation of systems that are not capable of commingling with aircraft operating within <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace</b> are ultra vires and hence of no legal effect. In concluding this paper strongly asserts that if the commercial benefits attendant to UAS operations is to be fully realised then their risks to society must be controlled through domestic legislation that is harmonised and consistent with internationally agreed guidelines...|$|E
40|$|The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 {{requires}} the Federal Aviation Administration to integrate unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, {{into the national}} airspace system by September 2015. Yet perhaps because of their chilling accuracy in targeted killings abroad, perhaps because of an increasing consciousness of diminishing privacy more generally, and perhaps simply because of a fear of the unknown, divergent UAV-restrictive legislation has been proposed in Congress and enacted {{in a number of}} states. Given UAV utility and cost-effectiveness over a vast range of tasks, however, widespread commercial use ultimately seems certain. Consequently, it is imperative to understand the constitutional restraints on public flight and constitutional protections afforded to private flight. Unfortunately, although there are a few Fourth Amendment precedents in manned aviation, they are mired not only in 1980 s technology but also in the 1980 s third party doctrine, and therefore do not reflect more recent Fourth Amendment developments and doctrinal fissures. There is also considerable uncertainty over First Amendment protection of information-gathering—for example, is there a right to record? Further, there is no judicial or scholarly analysis of how UAV flight fits within contemporary First Amendment forum doctrine, a framework that provides a useful starting point for analyzing speech restrictions in government-controlled airspace, but that comes with some uncertainties of its own. It is into this thicket that we dive, and fortunately some clarity emerges. Although the Fourth Amendment third party doctrine hopelessly misunderstands privacy and therefore under-protects our security and liberty interests, the Supreme Court’s manned flyover cases can be mined for a sensible public disclosure doctrine that seems agnostic as to the various Fourth Amendment conceptions: we do not typically require only law enforcement to shield its eyes. Of course, both constitutions and legislation can place special restrictions upon law enforcement, and sometimes doing so makes good sense. But as a general Fourth Amendment matter, the officer may do and see as the citizen would. Hence to understand Fourth Amendment regulation, we must understand how the First Amendment limits government restraint on speech-relevant private UAV flight. Here we analyze the developing right to record and apply contemporary forum doctrine to this novel means of speech and information-gathering. If <b>navigable</b> <b>airspace</b> is treated as a limited public forum, as we propose with some qualification, then the Federal Aviation Administration will have significant—though not unlimited—regulatory leeway to evenhandedly burden speech-related UAV activities where doing so would reasonably promote safe unmanned and manned flight operations. The Agency, however, would likely need further congressional action before it can restrict UAV flight based on privacy rather than safety concerns. As the legality and norms of private flight correspondingly take shape, they will inform Fourth Amendment restrictions on government use...|$|E
