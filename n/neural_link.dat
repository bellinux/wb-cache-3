40|$|White {{adipose tissue}} (WAT) lipolysis is {{initiated}} via direct {{sympathetic nervous system}} (SNS) innervation and activation. SNS control to WAT is vital to maintaining homeostasis in response to metabolic challenges such as food deprivation and cold exposure. Using transneuronal viral tract tracers, we have identified sensory nerves from WAT that project to brainstem and forebrain areas critical to metabolic function. In addition, these sensory circuits from fat communicate with SNS outflow neurons that project back to fat—forming neural feedback loops throughout the CNS—providing neuroanatomical evidence for sensory WAT-SNS crosstalk. It is unclear, however, what role these WAT-specific sensory nerves serve to inform the CNS of acute and dynamic metabolic challenges to which it can then respond. Here we tested mechanisms of activation of WAT sensory nerves and present a working model to deepen our understanding of why these neural circuits act as conduits for acute metabolic feedback signals from WAT. Neurochemical, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological evidence supports the presence of: 1) WAT lipolytic sensors from a neural population known {{to be capable of}} controlling SNS outflow; and 2) functional <b>neural</b> <b>links</b> among fat depots mediated via the peripheral and central nervous systems...|$|R

40|$|Gonadal steroidogenesis can be {{influenced}} by direct <b>neural</b> <b>links</b> between {{the central nervous system}} and the gonads. It is known that androgen receptor (AR) is expressed {{in many areas of the}} rat brain involved in neuroendocrine control of reproduction, such as the cerebral cortex. It has been recently shown that the occipital cortex exerts an inhibitory effect on testicular stereoidogenesis by a pituitary-independent neural mechanism. Moreover, the complete transection of the corpus callosum leads to an increase in testosterone (T) secretion of hemigonadectomized rats. The present study was undertaken to analyze the possible corticocortical influences regulating male reproductive activities. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: 1) intact animals as control; 2) rats undergoing sham callosotomy; 3) posterior callosotomy; 4) gonadectomy and posterior callosotomy. Western blot analysis showed no remarkable variations in cortical AR expression in any of the groups except in group I where a significant decrease in AR levels was found. Similarly, both immunocytochemical study and cell count estimation showed a lower AR immunoreactivity in occipital cortex of callosotomized rats than in other groups. In addition, there was no difference in serum T and LH concentration between sham-callosotomized and callosotomized rats. In conclusion, our results show that posterior callosotomy led to a reduction in AR in the right occipital cortex suggesting a putative inhibiting effect of the contralateral cortical area...|$|R

40|$|What {{mechanisms}} {{underlie the}} flexible formation, adaptation, synchronization, and dissolution of large-scale neural assemblies from the 1010 densely interconnected, continuously active neurons {{of the human}} brain? Nonlinear dynamics provides a unifying perspective on self-organization. It shows that the emergence of patterns in open, nonequilibrium systems is governed by their stability in response to small disturbances and predicts macroscopic transitions between patterns of differing stability. Here, we directly demonstrate that such transitions can be elicited in the human brain by interference at the neural level. As a probe, we used a classic motor coordination paradigm exhibiting well described movement states of differing stability. Functional neuroimaging identified premotor (PMA) and supplementary motor (SMA) cortices as having <b>neural</b> activity <b>linked</b> {{to the degree of}} behavioral instability. These regions then were transiently disturbed with graded transcranial magnetic stimulation, which caused sustained and macroscopic behavioral transitions from the less stable out-of-phase to the stable in-phase movement, whereas the stable pattern could not be affected. Moreover, the strength of the disturbance needed (a measure of <b>neural</b> stability) was <b>linked</b> to the degree of behavioral stability, demonstrating the applicability of nonlinear system theory as a powerful predictor of the dynamical repertoire of the human brain...|$|R

40|$|Although {{previous}} evidence {{suggested that}} ALDH 2 {{is a candidate}} gene for schizophrenia, the association and underlying mechanisms have never been investigated. Therefore, we investigated ALDH 2 as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia and explored the effect of its polymorphisms on brain functions. In the discovery stage, we detected a positive association between a dominant-negative mutant, Glu 504 Lys, and schizophrenia (P= 8. 01 E- 5, OR = 1. 34, 95 % CI = 1. 16 - 1. 55). This association was confirmed in the validation stage (P= 3. 48 E- 6, OR = 1. 28, 95 % CI = 1. 15 - 1. 42). The combined P reached a genome-wide significance (Pcombined= 1. 32 E- 9, OR = 1. 30, 95 % CI = 1. 20 - 1. 42). To investigate the <b>neural</b> mechanism <b>linking</b> Glu 504 Lys to schizophrenia, we calculated the functional connectivity (FC) and applied an imaging genetics strategy using resting-state fMRI data. The imaging analysis revealed a significant interaction of diagnostic group by genotype for FC between the left hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.

Our results supported a role for ALDH 2 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Moreover, variation at Glu 504 Lys disrupts hippocampal-prefrontal FC, which might be the <b>neural</b> mechanism <b>linking</b> it to the disease...|$|R
