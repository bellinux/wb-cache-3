5|$|Ni(IV) {{is present}} in the mixed oxide , while Ni(III) {{is present in}} nickel(III) oxide, which is used as the cathode in many {{rechargeable}} batteries, including nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron, nickel hydrogen, and <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride,</b> and used by certain manufacturers in Li-ion batteries. Ni(IV) remains a rare oxidation state of nickel and very few compounds are known to date.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride</b> and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{or their}} {{compounds}} {{can be found}} in electronic components, electrodes, and wiring and solar panels where they may be used as either conductors, semiconductors, or insulators. Molybdenum powder is used in circuit board inks. Ruthenium(IV) oxide coated titanium anodes are used for the industrial production of chlorine. Home electrical systems, for the most part, are wired with copper wire for its good conducting properties. Silver and gold are used in electrical and electronic devices, particularly in contact switches, {{as a result of their}} high electrical conductivity and capacity to resist or minimise the formation of impurities on their surfaces. The semiconductors cadmium telluride and gallium arsenide are used to make solar panels. Hafnium oxide, an insulator, is used as a voltage controller in microchips; tantalum oxide, another insulator, is used in capacitors in mobile phones. Heavy metals have been used in batteries for over 200 years, at least since Volta invented his copper and silver voltaic pile in 1800. Promethium, lanthanum, and mercury are further examples found in, respectively, atomic, <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride,</b> and button cell batteries.|$|E
25|$|Some battery formats and {{chemistries}} (<b>nickel–metal</b> <b>hydride</b> batteries) {{suitable for}} use in PHEVs are tightly patented and were not licensed for use by PHEV manufacturers, thereby slowed the development of electric cars and PHEVs before the 2008 Oil Crisis.|$|E
25|$|The first {{consumer}} grade <b>nickel–metal</b> <b>hydride</b> batteries (NiMH) {{for smaller}} applications {{appeared on the}} market in 1989 as a variation of the 1970s nickel–hydrogen battery. NIMH batteries tend to have longer lifespans than NiCd batteries (and their lifespans continue to increase as manufacturers experiment with new alloys) and, since cadmium is toxic, NiMH batteries are less damaging to the environment.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at the University of Washington introduced power over Wi-Fi, which trickle-charges batteries and powered battery-free cameras and temperature sensors using transmissions from Wi-Fi routers. Wi-Fi signals were shown to power battery-free temperature and camera sensors at ranges of up to 20 feet. It was also shown that Wi-Fi {{can be used to}} wirelessly trickle-charge <b>nickel–metal</b> <b>hydride</b> and lithium-ion coin-cell batteries at distances of up to 28 feet.|$|E
25|$|Aurora 4 {{improved}} on {{the successes}} of the Aurora class of cars. The <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride</b> battery pack was the first new battery technology used by the Minnesota team, and the solar array {{was the first to}} use two different sizes of photovoltaic solar cells. The team overcame a collision with its lead vehicle and many days of rain for a 4th-place finish in Sunrayce '99. It was the second 4-wheeled car that the UMNSVP built after Aurora I.|$|E
25|$|Several plug-in {{electric}} vehicle fire incidents {{have taken place}} since the introduction of mass-production plug-in {{electric vehicle}}s in 2010. Most {{of them have been}} thermal runaway incidents related to the lithium-ion batteries and have involved the Zotye M300 EV, Chevrolet Volt, Fisker Karma, Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrid, Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, Mitsubishi i-MiEV and Outlander P-HEV. Most hybrid electric vehicles available in the market today use <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride</b> batteries which do not pose the same risk of thermal runaway as lithium-ion batteries.|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote uses two AA {{batteries}} {{as a power}} source, {{which can}} power a Wii Remote for 60 hours using only the accelerometer functionality and 25 hours using both accelerometer and pointer functionality. In May 2013, Nintendo announced a rechargeable battery and dock accessory, and various third-party manufacturers market charging solutions for the controller (see Wii Remote Chargers). According to an interview with Nintendo industrial designer Lance Barr, limitations of the Wii Remote's expansion port make it unlikely {{that it will be}} used for internal battery charging. Although Nintendo discourages other rechargeable battery types such as lithium ion (Li-ion) and nickel-cadmium (NiCd), the company's support website indicates that <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride</b> (NiMH) rechargeable batteries may be used. A 3300µF capacitor provides a temporary source of power during quick movements of the Wii Remote when connection to the batteries may be temporarily interrupted. If the Wii Remote is not used for more than 5 minutes, such as when the player is using a GameCube controller or watching Netflix, it will shut off, and can be re-activated by pressing any button.|$|E
25|$|In the Autumn of 2006 on {{the trade}} fairs in Hannover the world premier {{occurred}} of the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid with hybrid power. The model was made with the cooperation with Allison Transmission and Cummins, which already had been engaged in previous hybrid bus models in North America. The {{main part of the}} model is the Cummins ISLe4 engine with 8.9litre displacement which generates 248kW (340 HP) of power. The second main part of this model is the EP50 system of Allison Transmission with the Allison Ev50 engine. The concept is created by the use of one diesel engine and two electric engines with each having 75kW of power output, which links with the Ev DRIVE module. The system also uses the produced energy when braking, which is accumulated in a <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride</b> batteries located on the roof {{in the front of the}} vehicle. The prototype appeared in mid-2006 and went into production in 2007. The location of the electric and diesel engines is in the front part of the bus between the two doors.|$|E
500|$|One {{material}} {{used for}} anodic material of <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride</b> batteries is [...] Due to high cost {{to extract the}} other lanthanides, a mischmetal with more than 50% of lanthanum is used instead of pure lanthanum. [...] The compound is an intermetallic component of the [...] type.|$|E
500|$|As most hybrid cars use <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride</b> batteries, massive {{quantities}} of lanthanum {{are required for}} the production of hybrid automobiles.

The long-wheelbase LS 600h L is equipped with Lexus Hybrid Drive, featuring a 5.0-liter 2UR-FSE V8 engine mated to a high-output electric motor with <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride</b> battery packs. This system uses a continuously variable transmission and generates an output of [...] Fuel economy is slightly higher overall than the lower-powered non-hybrid LS, and the hybrids achieve a U.S. Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (SULEV) rating. Features specific to the LS hybrids include the first production low beam LED headlights, a leather-trimmed dash, and blue-tinted hybrid badging. In April 2007, Lexus announced that the base price for the LS 600h L would be over US$104,000, surpassing the V12-equipped Toyota Century as the most expensive Japanese luxury car ever produced. A standard-wheelbase version destined for Asia and Europe, the LS 600h (UVF45), was launched in Japan in May 2007. The first 100 LS 600h L sedans sold in the U.S. were offered as [...] "Launch Edition" [...] models via the Neiman Marcus catalog for InCircle members.|$|E

2500|$|The 1.8-liter four-cylinder {{gasoline}} engine (previously 1.5 liters) generates , {{and with the}} added power of the electric motor, total horsepower is [...] (previously 110hp). The larger engine displacement allows for increased torque, reducing engine speeds (RPM), which increases fuel economy at highway speeds. With an electric water pump, the Prius engine is the first production engine that requires no accessory belts, which also further improves fuel economy. The electric motors and other components of the hybrid powertrain are also smaller and more efficient. Toyota estimates the new inverter, motor and transaxle are 20 percent lighter. It has a 1.3 kWh <b>nickel-metal</b> <b>hydride</b> (NiMH) battery.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nickel–metal</b> <b>hydride</b> and {{lithium-ion}} batteries can be recycled; Toyota, for example, has a recycling program in place under which dealers are paid a US$200 credit for each battery returned. However, plug-in hybrids typically use larger battery packs than comparable conventional hybrids, and thus require more resources. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG) {{has suggested that}} utilities could purchase used batteries for backup and load leveling purposes. They state that while these used batteries may be no longer usable in vehicles, their residual capacity still has significant value. More recently, General Motors (GM) has said it has been [...] "approached by utilities interested in using recycled Volt batteries as a power storage system, a secondary market that could bring down {{the cost of the}} Volt and other plug-in vehicles for consumers." ...|$|E
