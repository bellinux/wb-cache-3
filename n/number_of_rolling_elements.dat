40|$|The Milner {{continuously}} variable transmission (MCVT) is a traction drive transmission based on rolling contacts analogous {{to those found in}} angular contact roller bearings. The MCVT is applicable to very high power density applications or those with demanding packaging constraints, due primarily to the existence of multiple traction contacts on each of the rolling elements. This paper details the application of a design of experiments approach to optimising the design of the MCVT. An Analytical model including the contact mechanics and Elasto-hydrodynamics of the traction contacts has been developed and interrogated using design of experiments. Furthermore, the results of the technique have been applied to develop a design tool based on multi dimensional response surface models of pertinent transmission performance criteria. The use of the design tool is then demonstrated to derive future geometry iterations of the MCVT based on the tradeoffs between efficiency, ratio range and transmission life requirements. Inputs to the design tool include geometry parameters, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>elements,</b> design torque and speed ratings and required traction coefficient. Outputs from the design tool include assessment of ratio range, spin effects, traction efficiency and material stress levels...|$|E
40|$|Flight control {{surfaces}} have the crucial task {{of allowing the}} pilot to control the aircraft. Currently, these are generally controlled by hydraulic actuators. As a part of More Electric Aircraft (MAE) trend, some redundant hydraulic actuators are being partially replaced by Electromechanical Actuators (EMA). In order to ensure the ultimate safety of EMA, reliable vibration-based diagnosis capabilities are potentially needed to minimize the catastrophic risk of EMA failure initiated by critical sub-components such as rolling-element bearing. In this paper a new technique to estimate the fault severity of a defective bearing is presented. The technique is based on analyzing the jerk energy gradient of the synchronously averaged fault impact. The averaged signal is extracted by using time synchronous averaging (TSA) triggered by the fault race frequency (FRF) for the detection task and triggered by shaft speed for the quantifying task. FRF is defined, in this work, as the bearing fault frequency of interest divided by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>elements,</b> which eventually denotes the cage frequency {{in the case of}} an outer race fault and the difference between the shaft speed and the cage frequency {{in the case of an}} inner race fault. Detailed monitoring of the TSA-based energy is developed for the EMA bearings noting in particular that this can be utilized in other low-speed applications. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated and discussed on several seeded faults...|$|E

40|$|The <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing is a core {{component}} of many {{systems such as}} aircraft, train, steamboat, and machine tool, and their failure can lead to reduced capability, downtime, and even catastrophic breakdowns. Due to misoperation, manufacturing deficiencies, {{or the lack of}} monitoring and maintenance, it is often found to be the most unreliable component within these systems. Therefore, effective and efficient fault diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings has an important role in ensuring the continued safe and reliable operation of their host systems. This study presents a trace ratio criterion-based kernel discriminant analysis (TR-KDA) for fault diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings. The binary immune genetic algorithm (BIGA) is employed to solve the trace ratio problem in TR-KDA. The numerical results obtained using extensive simulation indicate that the proposed TR-KDA using BIGA (called TR-KDA-BIGA) can effectively and efficiently classify different classes <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing data, while also providing the capability of real-time visualization that is very useful for the practitioners to monitor the health status <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings. Empirical comparisons show that the proposed TR-KDA-BIGA performs better than existing methods in classifying different classes <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing data.

40|$|A {{needle roller}} bearing is a bearing which uses small {{cylindrical}} rollers. Bearings are used to reduce friction of any rotating surface. Needle bearings have a large surface {{in contact with the}} bearing outer surfaces as compared to ball bearings. There is less added clearance(Diameter of the shaft and the diameter of the bearing are different) so they are much compact. The structure consists of a needle cage which contains the needle rollersthemselves and an outer race (The housing itself). Radial bearings are cylindrical and they use rollers parallel to the axis of the shaft. Radial pattern of needle are being used by thrust needles. Complement bearings have solid inner as well as outer rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers. The bearings have the largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> and also have extremely high radial load carrying capacity and are suitable for compact designs. Needle roller bearings have relatively small diameter cylindrical rolling elements whose length is much larger than their diameter. As compared to other types of rolling bearings, {{needle roller bearing}}s possess a small cross-sectional height and significant load-bearing capacity and rigidity relative to their volume. Also, because the inertial force acting on them is limited, needle bearings are an ideal choice for applications with oscillating motion. These bearings also work well in compact and lightweight machine designs and they serve as a ready replacement for sliding bearings. Needle bearings features are great rigidity, smaller cross-section, higher loadcarrying capacity, and has lower inertia forces that facilitate to size and weight reductions in machinery. Needle bearings are designed to stand in oscillation, performwell under any conditions, and interchange with the sliding of bearings...|$|E
40|$|The {{bearing chamber}} of an {{aeroengine}} houses roller bearings and other structural parts. The spatial limitation, high operational speeds of the HP shaft and the {{proximity to the}} combustion chamber can make the operating conditions of the bearing chamber challenging. A roller bearing consists of an inner race, an outer race and a cage constraining a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>elements.</b> In the aeroengine application, oil is introduced into the bearing chamber via the inner race regions of the bearing into the rolling elements interstices. This provides lubrication for the roller bearings. The source of heat in the bearing chamber is mainly from rolling contact friction and the high temperature of combustion. Cooling results from the oil transport within the bearing chamber and thus an efficient transport of oil is critical to maintaining {{the integrity of the}} entire structure. The bearing chamber contains the oil which is eventually scavenged and recycled for recirculation. Experiments have been conducted over the years on bearing chamber flows but often simplified to create the best emulation of the real aeroengine. The complexity of the bearing chamber structure is also challenging for experimental measurements of the oil characteristic in the roller bearing elements and the bearing chamber compartment. Previous experiments have shown that the oil continuum breaks up in the bearing chamber compartment but it is not quantitatively clear how and what parameters affect these. Previous simulation attempt of bearing chamber, also, have been limited by the boundary conditions for the oil. This work presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) transient simulation of flow in the bearing sector in an attempt create boundary conditions for such models.

40|$|For the {{quantitative}} fault diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings, a nonlinear vibration model for fault severity assessment <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings is established in this study. The outer race defect size parameter is {{introduced into the}} dynamic model, and vibration response signals <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings under different fault sizes are simulated. The signals are analyzed quantitatively to observe the relationship between vibration responses and fault sizes. The impact points when the ball rolls onto {{and away from the}} defect are identified from the vibration response signals. Next, the impact characteristic that reflects the fault severity in <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings is obtained from the time interval between two impact points. When the width of the bearing fault is small, the signals are presented as clear single impact. The signals gradually become double impacts with increasing size of defects. The vibration signals <b>of</b> a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings test rig are measured for different outer race fault sizes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an elasto-dynamic {{model of a}} {{defective}} sphere bearing is presented. This two-dimensional model can simulate local faults on the bearing races and <b>rolling</b> <b>elements,</b> and {{it is based on}} the non-linear Hertzian contact deformation <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements.</b> In the model the outer race is supposed to be fixed, and the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> are supposed to roll without slipping.
