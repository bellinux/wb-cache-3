5|$|Throughout the Troubles, UK {{broadcasters}} {{were regularly}} required to stop or postpone the broadcast of documentaries and other programmes relating to Ireland. One {{of the most}} prominent instances of this was the 1985 Real Lives documentary for the BBC, At the Edge of the Union. The programme featured extensive footage of Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness and the Democratic Unionist Party's Gregory Campbell discussing the Troubles, and following direct intervention by the government it was temporarily blocked from being aired. The incident led to a one-day strike by members of the <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Journalists,</b> who walked out in protest that the BBC's independence was being undermined.|$|E

25|$|In September 2007, Executive Chairman of ITV plc Michael Grade {{announced}} that {{as part of}} ITV's five-year business strategy, Tyne Tees' newsroom would merge with Border Television. Politicians have expressed concern, however, that the merger would affect the quality of news for southern Scotland, in particular, would fail if it lost its customised bulletins. The changes would mean that aside from the merged Border-Tyne Tees regional news and political programmes, the station could broadcast only 25minutes of dedicated North East news every weekday. In October 2008, the <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Journalists</b> threatened industrial action if ITV tried to force any of the changes without discussion. Between December 2008 and February 2009, around 50 staff at the station were made redundant or accepted voluntary redundancy, including presenters, journalists and production staff. The new merged ITV Tyne Tees & Border service launched on 25 February 2009.|$|E

Upon his death, senior figures from Yorkshire County Cricket Club paid tribute to his influence, and his dignity and zealousness were praised by the Leeds branch of the <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Journalists.</b> Hutton, who had just broken into the Yorkshire team aged 18, wrote that he [...] "had just got {{into the habit of}} looking for that kindly, alert, grey-bearded face of Mr Pullin's either among the players before the day's play or in a Press-tent".

500|$|The 1981 Act {{allowed the}} Home Secretary to {{introduce}} measures {{in the event of}} a public interest issue. A parliamentary debate was not required, though Hurd acquiesced to one, and the issue was discussed in the House of Commons on 2 November 1988. The opposition Labour Party introduced an amendment condemning the government's decision as [...] "incompatible with a free society", but it was rejected, despite some Conservative MPs voting with Labour. The legislation was condemned by the National Council for Civil Liberties. The <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Journalists</b> planned a one-day strike in protest at the ban for 10 November, but the action was called off after its members failed to reach consensus. A group of broadcast journalists subsequently launched a legal challenge to overturn the ban, but in May 1989 the High Court decided the Home Secretary had acted lawfully. A later hearing at the Appeal Court upheld that decision in December 1989.|$|E
500|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Journalists</b> (NUJ) has criticised FITs {{for their}} {{surveillance}} and sometimes violent harassment of working journalists. Marc Vallee, who was hospitalised by police after documenting a protest, {{has said that}} the teams limit freedom of the press and called on the Home Office to confirm that the police had no right to restrict the work of photojournalists. Bob Broadhurst, {{who is in charge of}} public order policing at the Metropolitan Police, said in a statement to the NUJ in 2008 that journalists, [...] "on the production of a valid form of accreditation will be able to continue with their work". The NUJ are to make a formal complaint to the Information Commissioner due to the Metropolitan Police failing to provide details on the surveillance of journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. Bob Broadhurst told photographers at an NUJ conference that he had no faith in the National Press Card (a form of press pass) despite journalists needing to prove that they are bona-fide newsgatherers to an independent authority before they are issued.|$|E
500|$|Having served {{just over}} three years as Commander-in-Chief, Walker was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of the British Army—on 17 April 2000, taking over from General Sir Roger Wheeler. He remained CGS for three years, after which {{he was promoted to}} Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces—on 2 May 2003, succeeding Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (later Lord Boyce). As CDS, Walker criticised some of the media coverage of British deployments in Iraq. In particular, he claimed that attacks on the Black Watch were [...] "enhanced" [...] due to news reports on their location. He {{went on to say that}} [...] ", there could well have been a response by those who wished us ill to go and meet us with something like a bomb". His comments were rejected by a spokesman for the <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Journalists,</b> who retaliated [...] "When generals turn around and start blaming reporters for their own mistakes, it is a sign they aren't doing their own jobs properly". Also in 2004, Walker, along with General Sir Mike Jackson, then Chief of the General Staff, attracted controversy over reforms of the armed forces, which included the amalgamation of several army regiments to form larger regiments, leading to the loss of historic names.|$|E

500|$|Pressure {{to reverse}} the {{restrictions}} grew after the statutory instruments of Section 31 of the Irish government's Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 lapsed in January 1994. These had prohibited radio and television interviews with representatives of paramilitary groups and Sinn Féin. From that point, anyone in Northern Ireland {{with access to the}} Republic of Ireland's state broadcaster, RTÉ, could hear the voices of anyone still banned from the airwaves by the UK regulations. Responding to the Dublin government's decision, Gerry Adams said, [...] "Over 20 years of political censorship has served to stunt any hopes of a resolution of the conflict. It has denied the right of information. Good riddance." [...] The regulations particularly came under the spotlight during a visit Adams made to the United States in 1994, where he gave a speech that was widely broadcast around the world, but had to be dubbed in the UK because of the ban. In May 1994 the <b>National</b> <b>Union</b> <b>of</b> <b>Journalists</b> launched a legal challenge with the European Commission of Human Rights, seeking to take the British government to court for breach of freedom of expression under the European Convention of Human Rights, but the case was rejected. A similar challenge brought against the Irish government in 1991 over its broadcast ban had also been thrown out.|$|E

2500|$|The Russian police {{initially}} {{reported that}} the woman in Lawlor's car {{may have been a}} sixteen-year-old prostitute. The report was the lead in a number of Sunday newspapers.
