40|$|In {{this review}} we {{summarize}} recent {{studies that have}} been performed in our laboratory. We has focused our researches {{on the issue of the}} “liver”, i. e., development, stem/progenitor cells, regeneration, and in vitro reconstruction of hepatic tissues. Our researches were mainly divided into 4 themes; (1) liver development, especially, biliary duct formation, (2) stem/progenitor cells related in normal and pathophysiological conditions of liver diseases, (3) cell transplantation for the treatment of liver diseases, and (4) in vitro reconstruction of hepatic tissues. To elucidate the unresolved issues of each theme, we have been investigating by using embryological, molecular biological, and pathological methods. In the near future, we hope that our approaches will lead to the development of <b>new</b> <b>effective</b> <b>medicines</b> and treatments for intractable liver diseases and of an artificial liver device in which the reconstructed hepatic tissues are incorporated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is an {{important}} topic to find and identify molecular drug targets for modern drug research. Naturally, to find new or potential drug-GPCRs couples is very useful for determining the <b>new</b> <b>effective</b> <b>medicine</b> target, because GPCRs {{are among the most}} frequent targets of therapeutic drugs and proven evolutionary pharmacology value. To realize this, this paper incorporates chemical functional groups of drugs and grey model GM(1, 1) based on digital coding of amino acids to formulate the drug-GPCRs couples for statistical prediction. The overall success rate using the fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm by the jackknife test is about 81 %. This novel approach will further stimulate the development of scanning target via a computational approach...|$|R

40|$|We {{tried to}} find out the {{cytotoxic}} and anticancer property of methanolic extract of N. sativa seeds against prostate cancer cells (PC 3). A concentration range of extract (100 - 0. 01 μg mL - 1) in culture medium (DMEM) was tested. Inhibition of colony formation was studied and microscopic observations of stained colonies were performed. Colony inhibition at highest concentration (100 μg mL - 1) was 87. 097 % and at lowest concentration (0. 01 μg mL - 1) it was 54. 105. IC 50 was < 0. 01 μg mL - 1. Microscopic observation confirmed karyolysis, karyorrhexin and picnosis in treated cells as well as presence of characteristic morphological changes associated with apoptotic cells like blebs, blisters and echinoid spikes etc. on cell membrane. These findings advocate that methanolic extract of N. sativa seeds is a potent clonoigenic inhibitor of PC 3 cell and cell deaths might have taken place through apoptosis.

Under these circumstances definitely {{one of the major}} issues which is far complex yet of core importance is the generation of the funds and resources to handle the predicted health care needs of the societies. The situation in developed nations are different from developing nations because better health facilities in these countries itself create demands for more funds allocations and enhanced strategies. For example increased life expectancy rates means more aged populations requiring increased demand for health services. Modern and better technologies and <b>newer</b> <b>effective</b> <b>medicines</b> themselves require more finance allocation because of their increased cost. Persons on continuous drug treatment are also increasing to keep disease under control. (Prevalence increased). This is true for many chronic disease like AIDS, cancers, cystic fibrosis etc. All these examples generate augmented financial pressures which are the direct result of better health care facilities. Currently many Western countries practice distinctly different health care system where diversity in the method of funds generation is obvious. Out of these Single-payer health care, Universal Health Care System and compulsory insurance systems are of special note which are dominantly observed in most of the Western countries including USA, Canada, Australia and European countries.

40|$|Abstract. Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a chronic}} disabling autoimmune disease with characteristics of chronic, progres-sive inflammatory joint synovial damage, which mainly encroaches upon the synovium of the joint. The use of tradi-tional medicine to treat RA slows {{the development of}} RA to a certain extent; however, it often has numerous side-effects. Therefore, the focus of RA research is the identification of a <b>new,</b> safe and <b>effective</b> <b>medicine.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to use an ultra performance liquid chromatography and photo diode array (UPLC-PDA) method to detect the paeoni-florin component in a Radix Paeoniae Alba decoction and in rat plasma following the oral administration of Radix Paeoniae Alba decoction. In addition, the effects of paeoniflorin on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats were investigated. The results indicate that a UPLC-PDA method for determining the presence of paeoniflorin in the Radix Paeoniae Alba decoction was successfully established. The method was fast, simple, sensitive, precise and valid. Paeoniflorin was shown to be a bioactive component of the Radix Paeoniae Alba decoction that was absorbed into rat plasma. Paeoniflorin significantly improved the disease resistant ability of RA rats and reduced the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL‑ 1 β and TNF-α, thereby inhibiting inflammation and bone erosion in the rats with CIA. The observations are likely to lay the foundation for further study of the mechanism of paeoniflorin in the treat-ment of RA...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the current}} {{recession}} began in December 2007, New Deal legislation and its effectiveness {{have been at}} the center of a lively debate in Washington. This paper emphasizes some key facts about two kinds of policy that were important during the Great Depression and have since become the focus of criticism by new New Deal critics: (1) regulatory and labor relations legislation, and (2) government spending and taxation. We argue that initiatives in these policy areas probably did not slow economic growth or worsen the unemployment problem from 1933 to 1939, as claimed by a number of economists in academic papers, in the popular press, and elsewhere. To substantiate our case, we cite some important economic benefits of New Deal–era laws in the two controversial policy areas noted above. In fact, we suggest that the <b>New</b> Deal provided <b>effective</b> <b>medicine</b> for the Depression, though fiscal policy was not sufficiently countercyclical to conquer mass unemployment and prevent the recession of 1937 – 38; 1933 's National Industrial Recovery Act was badly flawed and poorly administered, and the help provided by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 came too late to have a big effect on the recovery.

40|$|Background: Resistance {{of malaria}} parasites to {{existing}} drugs complicates treatment, but an antimalarial vaccine that could protect against this disease {{is not yet}} available. It is therefore necessary to find <b>new</b> <b>effective</b> and affordable <b>medicines.</b> Medicinal plants could be a potential source of antimalarial agents. Some medicinal plants from Burkina Faso were evaluated for their antiplasmodial and cytotoxic properties in vitro. Methods: Crude dichloromethane, methanol, water-methanol, aqueous and alkaloids extracts were prepared for 12 parts of 10 plants. Chloroquine-resistant malaria strain K 1 was used for the  in vitro sensibility assay. The  Plasmodium lactacte dehydrogenase technique {{was used to determine}} the 50 % inhibitory concentration of parasites activity (IC 50). The cytotoxic effects were determined with HepG 2 cells, using the tetrazolium-based colorimetric technique, and the selectivity index (SI) was calculated. Results: Sixty crude extracts were prepared. Seven extracts from  Terminalia avicenoides showed IC 50   1. The other plants have mostly moderate or no antimalarial effects. Some extracts from  Cordia myxa,  Ficus capraefolia and  Opilia celtidifolia showed cytotoxicity, with an SI ranging between 0. 4 and 0. 9. Conclusion: Our study showed a good antiplasmodial  in vitro activity of  Terminalia avicenoides, Combretum collinum and  Ficus capraefolia. These three plants may contain antiplasmodial molecules that could be isolated by bio-guided phytochemical studies.   </span...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. <b>Effective</b> <b>Medicine</b> Control is {{the essence}} of {{pharmaceutical}} service delivery and of financial management in Platinum Health Pharmacies. Platinum Health Pharmacies implement medicine control measures to enhance and optimise service delivery. As Platinum Health Pharmacies deliver a pharmaceutical service as business associates of Anglo Platinum, it serves the same workforce. The requirement of the pharmaceutical service delivery for Anglo Platinum is timely, appropriate and available medicine. Therefore, Platinum Health Pharmacies need to adhere to set criteria, those of ?Good Pharmacy Practice in South Africa? as applied to the control, procurement and prescribing of medication. The ordering and receiving of necessary medication forms {{a significant part of the}} criteria, as this is the source of medication to pharmacies. The subsequent management of medication as inventory and control over recall, storage, excess and disposal of expired medication serves the same purpose. Effective dispensing and distribution methods are therefore mandated to ensure timeously availability of correct medication. Finally, the success of <b>effective</b> <b>medicine</b> control is defined by the accuracy of the stock take ascertaining the results of managerial methods of medication. Platinum Health Pharmacies recorded an overall adherence level of 85 percent to the abovementioned criteria. This is a good indication of a strong, reliable and experienced pharmaceutical workforce that delivers an outstanding pharmaceutical service and is capable of maintaining <b>effective</b> <b>medicine</b> control. Although few shortcomings were identified, it is nevertheless recommended that Platinum Health Pharmacies plan the improvement of their risk management plans, and identify quality improvement projects in areas of medicine procurement. The implementation of key performance indicators, relevant to stock control, is also recommended. These, put into effect will assure optimisation of <b>effective</b> <b>medicine</b> control for Platinum Health Pharmacies, maintaining the benefits of cost containment and cost effective pharmaceutical service delivery.

40|$|Our {{thesis is}} a simple one: {{although}} a drug can fail in an individual patient for many reasons, appropriately sized and conducted drug-development programs often fail because of insensitive, uninformative end points, and/or poor a priori regimen decisions. The difficulty in successfully developing antimicrobial agents at present is often exacerbated by company decision-makers who are either uninformed or disregard the difference between empirical-based (ie, akin to playing pin-the-tail on the donkey) and quantitative model-based de-velopment plans. Frequently, {{the focus is on}} Gantt charts (project event schedules) and the on-time submission of a New Drug Application to a regulatory body, such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Such misplaced focus has led and will continue to lead to a number of problems, including program failure or, even worse, regulatory approval of an inappropriate dosing regimen with associated negative safety and efficacy sequelae. We believe that the goal of drug development is not a New Drug Application submitted on time but, rather, an approved, differentiated, safe, and <b>effective</b> <b>new</b> <b>medicine.</b> Here, we focus on the pharmacokinetic-phar-macodynamic data needed to guide dosing regimen decisions for patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.

This work {{is devoted}} a {{phytochemical}} study of biologically active substances in herb of Labrador Tea (Lédum palústre L.), {{as well as}} investigation {{of the possibility of}} complex use of raw materials in order to create on its basis new herbal medicines. Methods. The object of the study served as the herb Labrador Tea. Separation of isolated substances was performed by adsorption and partition chromatography on various adsorbents. The structure of the isolated compounds was determined based on physicochemical methods: paper (PC) and the thin layer (TLC) chromatography, UV, IR and NMR spectroscopy in comparison with the original valid standards of flavonoids. Acid hydrolys was used for the determination of the flavonoid aglycone composition. The content of total flavonoids was determined by differential spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 412 nm from the reaction with aluminum chloride based on the hyperoside-standard (Ukrainian scientific Pharmacopoeial center for quality of medicines (Pharmacopoeial center), Kharkоv). Results. During this study we found more than 40 of phenolic compounds and identified 31 compounds. The phytochemical analysis showed the presence of flavonols (11 compounds), catechins (5). Hydroxycinnamic acids represented by caffeic, ferulic, chlorogenic acids. Besides that, it were found phenolic glycoside arbutin, coumarins - coumarin, umbelliferon, scopoletin, esculetin and esculin, tannins – metyl gallate, pyrogallol. Conclusions. The following biologically active substances were defined for the first time: flavonoids – 5 -methyl-kaempferol, avicularin, polistahozid, quercitrin; coumarins – esculetin, esculin; as well as hydroxycinnamic acids – ferulic, chlorogenic, neochlorogenic of Labrador Tea.

40|$|Target drugs acting via the HIF/VEGF pathway show a {{steady-state}} clinical {{effect in}} treating patients with metastatic {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC). However, to continue therapy in patients with developing resistance in the prolonged use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors remained unsolved, which brought about a search for alternative pathogenetic pathways and <b>new</b> <b>effective</b> appropriate <b>medicines.</b> One of its solutions was the mTOR pathway and everolimus acting via it. Motzer et al. conducted the RECORD- 1 phase III international multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of the efficiency of everolimus. The study enrolled 410 patients with metastatic RCC that progressed during target therapy with sunitinib and/or sorafenib. The study was interrupted before the appointed time, as recommended by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee since the established effectiveness threshold values and conformity criteria for a positive study result were achieved. According to an independent centralized assessment, everolimus reduced the risk for disease progression by 70 % (p < 0. 0001). The median progression-free survival was longer in the everolimus group than that in the placebo group, which was 4. 9 and 1. 9 months, respectively (p < 0. 0001). Final double-blind analysis showed a partial response in 5 (2 %) patients and disease stabilization in 185 (67 %) patients in the everolimus group; there were no patients by the former indicator and 45 (32 %) patients by the latter in the placebo group. The final findings showed {{no statistically significant difference}} in overall survival rates between the groups: the median overall survival was 14. 78 and 14. 39 months in the everolimus and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0. 177). This might be due to a cross impact because 79 (81 %) of the 98 patients from the placebo group were switched over to open-labeled everolimus taking after disease progression. Everolimus demonstrated a good tolerability and safety. Grade III-IV toxicity was recorded in 5 % of patients. In the everolimus-taking patients, the most common adverse reactions of all severity degrees were stomatitis (36 %), eruption (28 %), fatigue (23 %), asthenia (22 %), and diarrhea (21 %). The hematological reactions included anemia (25 %), hypercholesterolemia (18 %), and hyperglycemia (8 %). Everolimus is now the first and only registered drug to treat metastatic RCC if therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is ineffective. </span...|$|R
