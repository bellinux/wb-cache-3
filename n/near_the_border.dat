5|$|From 1963 to 1966, RAN {{warships}} {{took part}} in the Indonesian Confrontation. During this period, Australian minesweepers and frigates patrolled Malaysia's coastline to counter Indonesian infiltration parties travelling in small craft. These ships also bombarded Indonesian positions in East Kalimantan <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> with Malaysia on several occasions. The RAN's experiences during this conflict led it to perceive a need for light destroyers and patrol boats tailored to Confrontation-type tasks.|$|E

5|$|Late on October29, Mitch {{weakened}} to {{tropical storm}} status. It moved slowly across Honduras, {{turning to the}} west. The large circulation dropped heavy rainfall throughout Central America, particularly in Honduras and Nicaragua, causing widespread flooding. While over land, Mitch initially maintained an area of deep convection, which allowed it to maintain tropical storm force winds. On October31, the circulation became poorly defined while moving over increasingly mountainous terrain; however, the strongest convection persisted over the adjacent Pacific Ocean, and the NHC noted the potential for Mitch to become a Pacific tropical cyclone. Later that day, Mitch weakened into a tropical depression <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of Guatemala and Honduras. An approaching trough weakened the ridge in the western Gulf of Mexico, allowing Mitch to make the long-intended turn to the northwest. Convection gradually diminished, and the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November1 <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of Mexico and Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|After {{continuing}} through the southeast United States, the storm became extratropical <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of North Carolina and Virginia midday on September18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September19 {{while it was}} near Philadelphia. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, moving through New England and {{along the coast of}} Maine before turning more to the east. Late on September19, the storm moved across Nova Scotia, passing southeast of Newfoundland the next day. It was last observed late on September20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hazel was {{the deadliest}} and costliest {{hurricane}} of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm {{killed at least}} 400people in Haiti before striking the United States <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> between North and South Carolina, as a Category 4 hurricane. After causing 95fatalities in the US, Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, raising the death toll by 81people, mostly in Toronto. As {{a result of the}} high death toll and the damage caused by Hazel, its name was retired from use for North Atlantic hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|In Ocos, Guatemala <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> winds {{from the}} storm {{destroyed}} the roofs {{of about a dozen}} palm huts, forcing over 100 residents to evacuate. The winds also downed hundreds of trees near the coastline. Heavy rainfall {{from the storm}} led to river flooding; the island of Ocos was separated from the mainland after the bridge was washed away. Heavy rains along the periphery of the storm triggered significant flooding in El Salvador which killed at least four people.|$|E
