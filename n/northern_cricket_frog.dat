40|$|Male {{frogs and}} toads call in dense choruses to attract females. Determining the vocal {{interactions}} and spatial distribution of the callers is important for understanding acoustic communication in such assemblies. It has so far proved difficult to simultaneously locate and recover the vocalizations of individual callers. Here a microphone-array technique is developed for blindly locating callers using arrival-time delays at the microphones, estimating their steering-vectors, and recovering the calls with a frequency-domain adaptive beamformer. The technique exploits the time-frequency sparseness of the signal space to recover sources even when there are more sources than sensors. The method is tested with data collected from a natural chorus of Gulf Coast toads (Bufo valliceps) and <b>Northern</b> <b>cricket</b> <b>frogs</b> (Acris crepitans). A spatial map of locations accurate to within a few centimeters is constructed, and the individual call waveforms are recovered for nine individual animals within a 9 × 9 m 2. These methods work well in low reverberation {{when there are no}} reflectors other than the ground. They will require modifications to incorporate multi-path propagation, particularly for the estimation of time-delays...|$|R

40|$|A {{major cause}} of {{amphibian}} declines worldwide is habitat destruction or alteration. Public green spaces, such as golf courses and parks, could serve as safe havens to curb the effects of habitat loss if managed in ways to bolster local amphibian communities. We reared larval Blanchard’s <b>cricket</b> <b>frogs</b> (Acris blanchardi) and green frogs (Rana clamitans) in golf course ponds with and without 1 m terrestrial buffer zones, and released marked <b>cricket</b> <b>frog</b> metamorphs at the golf course ponds they were reared in.

50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>cricket</b> <b>frog</b> {{is one of}} North America's two {{smallest}} vertebrates, {{ranging from}} 19 - 38 mm long.

It is very similar to the southern cricket frog, Acris gryllus, found in the US Southeastern Coastal Plain, but with some overlap along the fall line. The southern cricket frog has longer legs, with less webbing on the hind feet, and a more pointed snout; northern cricket frogs have been observed with snouts indistinguishable from those of the southern species.
