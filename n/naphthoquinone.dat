It is also prepared by the Friedel-Crafts reaction of benzene and phthalic anhydride in presence of AlCl3. The resulting o-benzoylbenzoic acid then undergoes cyclization, forming anthraquinone. This reaction is useful for producing substituted anthraquinones. The Diels-Alder reaction of <b>naphthoquinone</b> and butadiene followed by oxidative dehydrogenation will also produce 9,10-anthraquinone. Lastly, BASF has developed a process that proceeds via the acid-catalyzed dimerization of styrene to give a 1,3-diphenylbutene, which then can be transformed to the anthaquinone. It also arises via the Rickert-Alder reaction, a retro-Diels-Alder reaction.|$|E

Latent fingermarks deposited on paper substrates were treated with solutions of selected <b>naphthoquinones</b> in ethyl acetate/HFE- 7100, with subsequent heating. The selected compounds were 1, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid, 1, 2 -naphthoquinone- 4 -sulfonate, 2 -methoxy- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone and 2 -methyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone.

40|$|The {{isolation}} and antimycobacterial activity of several <b>naphthoquinones</b> from Euclea natalensis were previously reported and initiated this study into the occurrence, chemistry and biological activity of {{this class of}} compounds. The structure activity relationship of the isolated <b>naphthoquinones,</b> and commercially available derivatives were also studied. Several plant species were investigated to establish a possible link between their traditional use for chest related symptoms (including tuberculosis infection) and the occurrence of 7 -methyljuglone in these plants. The plants were extracted and tested qualitatively {{with the use of}} three analytical tools for the presence of 7 -methyljuglone or related <b>naphthoquinones.</b> Due to its commercial unavailability, the chemical synthesis of two of these <b>naphthoquinones,</b> 7 -methyljuglone and diospyrin, was attempted with varying degrees of success. The Friedel-Crafts acylation method was used to synthesise 7 -methyljuglone from m-cresol and maleic anhydride as starting material. The optimisation of the synthesis was also investigated. Through a two-step pathway of epoxidation and steam distillation, diospyrin was successfully synthesised albeit in small quantities. During the attempts to synthesise diospyrin, two other related compounds were also synthesised. These compounds, neodiospyrin and mamegakinone, are structural isomers of diospyrin. The stability of some of the <b>naphthoquinones</b> was tested in various carriers in an attempt to explain the influence this will have on the obtained antituberculosis and toxicity data. The BACTEC vial solution, which is widely used to determine potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was analysed with HPLC to determine the stability of these compounds in it. In addition the stability in organic solvents especially DMSO, was also tested as this is the solvent of choice for hydrophobic compounds in almost all bioassays. The antituberculosis activity and/or toxicity of 7 -methyljuglone was investigated with three bioassays, to broaden our knowledge on the mechanism of action of <b>naphthoquinones.</b> Vero cells were employed to determine the inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of most of the <b>naphthoquinones.</b> Mice experiments were carried out to determine the toxicity of 7 -methyljuglone and diospyrin in vivo. In addition the lead compound, 7 -methyljuglone, was tested on Musca domestica (house fly) to establish its toxicity on this organism. In order to find the pharmacophore of this class of compounds, a preliminary structure-activity relationship was conducted. During this study the active site in the compounds which confers potency and toxicity was partly established. The mode of action of some of the <b>naphthoquinones</b> was investigated and it was established that the compounds might interfere with the mycobacterial electron transport chain.

40|$|<b>Naphthoquinones</b> are {{compounds}} {{present in}} several families of higher plants.

In folk medicine, especially among Indian populations, plants containing <b>naphthoquinones</b> have been employed for the treatment of various diseases. The biological redox cycle of quinones can be initiated by one electron reduction leading to the formation of semiquinones, unstable intermediates that react rapidly with molecular oxygen, generating free radicals. Alternatively, the reduction by two electrons, mediated by DT-diphorase, leads to the formation of hydroquinone.

In order to elucidate if this NO decrease resulted from the interference of diosquinone with cellular defence mechanisms against LPS or to its conversion into peroxynitrite, by reaction with superoxide radical formed by <b>naphthoquinones</b> redox cycling, 3 -nitrotyrosine and superoxide determination was also performed. None of these parameters showed significant changes relative to control. Furthermore, diosquinone caused a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines: tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6).
