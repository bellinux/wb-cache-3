John Wherry, Jr., former Dean of the University of Orlando School of Law, wrote that [...] "lindly following Schmerber as authorization for all non-consensual blood seizure for forensic purposes is, {{in this day and}} age, an outrage." [...] Writing for the Notre Dame Law Review, Blake A. Bailey, Elaine M. Martin, and Jeffrey M. Thompson observed that although the Court limited the holding in Schmerber to the facts of the case, prior to Winston v. Lee, many lower courts relied upon the ruling to order criminal defendants to undergo surgery to remove bullets that may have been evidence of a crime. Other scholars have expressed concern that the Court's decision to exclude physical evidence from protections against self-incrimination may one day lead to the use of mind reading devices when prosecuting criminal suspects. For example, the Harvard Law Review suggested that the Court's decision may be used to justify monitoring brain waves. Additionally, {{in an article in the}} journal Developments in Mental Health Law, Benjamin Holley suggested that [...] "neurotechnological lie detection" [...] could be used in criminal prosecutions, as long as a suspect's words are not [...] "linked with the physical manifestations sought to be introduced at trial." [...] Likewise, in an article in the Journal of Legal Medicine, John G. New suggested that <b>non-testimonial</b> <b>evidence</b> gathered from electroencephalography or magnetic resonance imaging may be admissible to demonstrate a suspect's thoughts.|$|E

Except {{for a limited}} set of rules on privileges, interrogation, and the rape-shield rule (MRE 412), the military rules of evidence do not apply at this investigative hearing. This does not mean, however, that the investigating officer ignores evidentiary issues. The investigating officer will comment on all evidentiary issues that are critical to a caseâ€™s disposition. All testimony is taken under oath or affirmation, except that an accused may make an unsworn statement.|$|E
