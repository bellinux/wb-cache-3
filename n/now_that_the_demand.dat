40|$|For {{the design}} of large and fast {{applications}} that can demand a lot of computational power, new design path’s need to be explored. In the early days that only one processor could do all the desired computation, the designers optimized their designs mainly on throughput. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> for more computational power has increased for instance for signal processing applications, like speech and video encoders, one tries to design their application for multiprocessor environments. In such an environment, the many different tasks of an application can be split up over the available computational power that every processor possesses. The design of such a multiprocessor application needs more research., there {{in the past the}} main stream of applications where designed as single processor systems. This complex task of designing a multiprocessor application should be as automated as possible, to make the way of designing as easy as possible. In this field some work has already been done. In [1] Sander Stuijk presents five measures that should give an indication whether the designed application is an optimal implementation with respect to concurrency of the application. He also proposes a strategy to optimize these concurrency measures. A case study using a JPEG decoder was used to validate whether the strategy and the contained measures where in fact optimal for this application. In another case study, presented in [6...|$|E

Therefore, equation by equation estimation can be considered more robust than system estimation.|$|R

40|$|Although {{previously}} disputed, it is <b>now</b> clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> from avian incubation put parents under considerable energetic stress, {{sometimes to}} an extent where the costs of incubation constrain clutch size evolution. However, the behavioural mechanisms involved in manifesting such costs remain largely unknown. We manipulated <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of incubation by enlarging and reducing clutch size during 2 years in a pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, population in southern Sweden, and measured the resulting effects on incubation temperature and incubation behaviour. In addition, we assessed possible effects on later reproductive stages by restoring clutch size prior to hatching and subsequently monitoring female nest provisioning and nestling growth rate. The length of both attentive and inattentive bouts, {{as well as the}} total time spent incubating, was longer for females incubating enlarged clutches. These females also maintained eggs at lower temperatures, but only at the beginning of incubation. Thus, increased incubation demands were met by investing more time in incubation, but females were still not able to maintain incubation temperature at the same level as control females. Furthermore, females paid costs of increased incubation demands in terms of a longer incubation period in both years, and reduced nestling production in one, but did not appear to transfer any additional costs to their nestlings. We conclude that costs of incubation are context dependent, and suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> from incubation may be important in brood size determination in this species, at least in deteriorating ambient conditions.

40|$|Biomass {{has played}} a {{dominant}} role in the energy need of the continued world growing population. Its conversion from biomass to biogas in its production, {{have been a very}} promising means of producing an energy carrier from renewable resources and of achieving environmental benefits in multiples. As the population continue to grow coupled with the devastating effects of climate, efforts are being made by all and sundry at all level such as; scientists, researchers and policy makers in finding a lasting solution to the current predicament of climate change. As it is known fact <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> present <b>demand</b> for oil for biofuel production greatly exceeds the supply, this as a result has led to alternative sources of biomass being required. In achieving this, various biomasses have been considered for energy production, such as microalgae, yeast, grass and other renewable biomass substrates. Apart from the contribution biomass have made to sustainable development, it will also provide energy security for the growing population which currently stands at 7 billion. The resources availability and easily conversion process into the secondary energy carriers without much capital intensive makes this study a high profile research. Through this, it also aid in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by offsetting fossil fuel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when produced and used in a sustainable way Biomass as a renewable energy source is being discussed therein. Though there are large variations in biogas yields and composition of the gas among the raw materials considered. This is due to the variation in their compositions, digestion technologies and their digestion conditions that are applicable. Energy diversity through (RES) is herein therefore considered using biomass as a case study with particular emphasis on biogas/biofuel production...|$|R

In this process, <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> for several types of commodities are initially given at some specified vertices and then <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> spread interactively on a contact graph. To allocate supplies in such a dynamic setting, we use a modified version of PageRank vectors, called Kronecker PageRank, to identify vertices for shipping supplies. We analyze both <b>the</b> situation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> distribution evolves mostly in clusters around the initial vertices and <b>the</b> case <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> spread to <b>the</b> whole network.

40|$|Myanmar’s {{controversial}} census has inflamed {{ethnic tensions}} {{at a critical}} moment in the peace process, argues this report. Overview Myanmar’s first census in over 30 years, an ambitious project conducted in April 2014 with technical advice from the UN and significant funding from bilateral donors, {{has proved to be}} highly controversial and deeply divisive. A process that was largely blind to the political and conflict risks has inflamed ethnic and religious tensions in this diverse country. The release of the inevitably controversial results in the coming months will have to be handled with great sensitivity if further dangers are to be minimised. The census will provide information vital for Myanmar’s government, development partners and investors in planning their activities. But it has also created political tensions and sparked conflict at a crucial moment in the country’s transition and peace process. Some controversies are inevitable in any census. However, <b>the</b> way <b>that</b> <b>the</b> process has been designed and prepared, insufficiently sensitive to the country’s evolving realities and <b>the</b> major risks <b>that</b> they present, has greatly exacerbated its negative impact. Such problems were not inevitable, nor were they unforeseen. They largely stem from the way data on ethnicity, religion and citizenship status are being collected and classified, and the lack of consultation with key constituencies {{in the design of the}} process. The serious risks involved were anticipated and clearly laid out in the political risk assessment <b>that</b> <b>the</b> UN Population Fund (UNFPA) – the lead technical agency involved – commissioned at the beginning of the process, and they were subsequently repeated and amplified by many other stakeholders and observers, including Crisis Group. However, UNFPA rejected such concerns, consistently presented a panglossian perspective on the census and failed to acknowledge specific political or conflict risks. Key census donors failed to recommend fundamental revisions to the process, even when a census pilot had to be cancelled in Rakhine State due to fears of violence and when key ethnic armed groups called for the enumeration to be postponed. Only at the last minute, when a Rakhine census boycott morphed into violent attacks on international aid agencies that sparked a humanitarian crisis, did most push for such changes. The impact of these problems has been far-reaching, exacerbating inter-ethnic and inter-religious tensions. The census has been interrupted in parts of Rakhine State, following a last-minute government decision to prevent the Rohingya population from self-identifying its ethnicity – a move intended to placate Rakhine radicals, who were committed to a boycott and could have unleashed deadly violence. Amid a massive and intimidatory security operation in Rohingya communities, those households who insisted on identifying as such – the great majority in many areas – were left out of the census entirely. In Kachin State, no census has been allowed to take place in areas controlled by the Kachin Independence Organisation armed group, due in part to concerns about how ethnicity data are being collected. The Myanmar military has been used to secure contested areas in Kachin and northern Shan States in order to allow access to census enumerators. In the process, serious clashes have broken out between the two sides, and hundreds of civilians have had to flee. This has put further strain on the peace process at a critical time. Without doubt, the government has been found wanting in its approach to addressing <b>the</b> communal tensions <b>that</b> have proved so threatening to Myanmar’s Muslim community and particularly its Rohingya population. These problems pre-date talk of a census. The authorities, through their public statements, the behaviour of law enforcement personnel and in the laws enacted have to do a lot more to demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state’s concern is for the welfare of all. Equally, a census that was more sensitive to political realities, or one conducted at a less volatile time, could have limited or avoided some of the problems now being stoked. Further risks exist in the timing and manner in which census data are released. These will not be easy to mitigate at this point, and UNFPA and the donors will have much less influence <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most technically <b>demanding</b> and costly aspects of the process have been completed...|$|R
