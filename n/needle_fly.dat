60|$|But, no: down sat the shadow, {{and began}} to sew, making her <b>needle</b> <b>fly</b> like a real little seamstress.|$|E
60|$|On {{that day}} the landlady {{received}} her week's notice to quit, and Louisa's <b>needle</b> <b>flew</b> fast through the stitches of the parlor-maid's dress.|$|R
60|$|If {{the kind}} young persons who sent the fanciful gift {{could have seen}} how it was received, their doubts would soon have been set at rest; for Jessie laughed and cried as she told the story, counted the {{precious}} coins, and filled the pretty shoe with water that the buds might keep fresh for Laura. Then, while the <b>needles</b> <b>flew</b> and the gay garments were fitted, the happy voices talked and the sisters rejoiced together over this unexpected pleasure as only loving girls could do.|$|R
60|$|They talked {{over the}} new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then out came the four little work baskets, and the <b>needles</b> <b>flew</b> as the girls made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but tonight no one grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of {{dividing}} the long seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, {{and in that way}} got on capitally, especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them.|$|R
60|$|Among her companions was one, and one only, who {{attracted}} her. The {{others were}} well-meaning girls, but {{full of the}} frivolous purposes and pleasures which their tastes prompted and their dull life fostered. Dress, gossip, and wages were the three topics which absorbed them. Christie soon tired of the innumerable changes rung upon these themes, and took refuge in her own thoughts, soon learning to enjoy them undisturbed by the clack of many tongues about her. Her evenings at home were devoted to books, for she had the true New England woman's desire for education, and read or studied {{for the love of}} it. Thus she had much to think of as her <b>needle</b> <b>flew,</b> and was rapidly becoming a sort of sewing-machine when life was brightened for her by the finding of a friend.|$|R
60|$|James of the Needle {{was a man}} of {{his word}} when whisky was no party to the contract; and upon this {{occasion}} Callum Beg, who still thought himself in Waverley's debt, since he had declined accepting compensation at the expense of mine host of the Candlestick's person, took the opportunity of discharging the obligation, by mounting guard over the hereditary tailor of Sliochd nan Ivor; and, as he expressed himself, 'targed him tightly' till the finishing of the job. To rid himself of this restraint, Shemus's <b>needle</b> <b>flew</b> through the tartan like lightning; and as the artist kept chanting some dreadful skirmish of Fin Macoul, he accomplished at least three stitches to the death of every hero. The dress was, therefore, soon ready, for the short coat fitted the wearer, {{and the rest of the}} apparel required little adjustment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{you must}} suppose," [...] {{continued}} Robin, [...] "that a needle, like the mariner's compass needle, hangs beside my bit of iron, close to it, {{and that a}} wire, or conductor of electricity, connects the iron with my electric battery in Ireland. Well, that makes a magnet of it, and the suspended needle, being attracted, sticks to it. Then I disconnect the wire from my battery by touching a handle, the bit of iron ceases to be a magnet, and the needle was free. Again I connect the battery, and the <b>needle</b> <b>flies</b> to the remagnetised bit of iron. Thus, as fast as I choose, I can make the needle wag, and by a simple arrangement {{we can make it}} wag right or left, so many beats right or left, or alternately, representing letters. By varying the beats we vary the letters, and thus spell out our messages. Now, do you understand it?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Needles</b> {{and fingers}} <b>flew,</b> {{and two days}} before Christmas, Daisy {{set out for the}} enchanted city, feeling very rich with the pretty new dress in her trunk, and five dollars for pocket money. It seemed a large sum to the country girl, and she planned to spend it all in gifts for mother and Janey, whose tired faces rather haunted her after she had caught the last glimpse of them.|$|R
40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} of algorithms for onboard computation of trajectories for time-optimal intercept of {{a moving target}} by an F- 8 aircraft is described. The algorithms, use singular perturbation techniques, generate commands in the cockpit. By centering the horizontal and vertical <b>needles,</b> the pilot <b>flies</b> an approximation to a time-optimal intercept trajectory. Example simulations are shown and statistical data on the pilot's performance when presented with different display and computation modes are described...|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, Madame de la Rocheaimard {{was easy}} and {{tranquil}} {{the whole of}} the last morning. Although nearly exhausted by her toil and the want of food, for Adrienne had eaten her last morsel, half a roll, at breakfast, she continued to toil; but the work was nearly done, and the dear girl's <b>needle</b> fairly <b>flew.</b> Of a sudden she dropped me in her lap and burst into a flood of tears. Her sobs were hysterical, and I felt afraid she would faint. A glass of water, however, restored her, and then this outpouring of an exhausted nature was suppressed. I was completed! At that instant, if not the richest, I was probably the neatest and most tasteful handkerchief in Paris. At this critical moment, Desiree, the commissionaire, entered the room.|$|R
40|$|Neutrophils are {{the first}} cells {{recruited}} to the dermal site of Leishmania infection following injection by <b>needle</b> or sand <b>fly</b> bite. The role of neutrophils in either promoting or suppressing host immunity remains controversial. We discuss the events driving neutrophil recruitment, their interaction with the parasite and apoptotic fate, {{and the nature of}} their encounters with other innate cells. We suggest that the influence of the neutrophil response on infection outcome critically depends on the timing of their recruitment and the tissue environment in which it occurs...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} a real time piloted simulation of algorithms designed for on-board computation of time-optimal intercept trajectories for an F- 8 aircraft. The algorithms, which were derived using singular perturbation theory, generate commands that are displayed {{to the pilot}} on flight director needles on the 8 -ball. By flying the airplane so as to zero the horizontal and vertical <b>needles,</b> the pilot <b>flies</b> an approximation to a time-optimal intercept trajectory. The various display and computation modes that are available will be described and results will be presented illustrating {{the performance of the}} algorithms with a pilot in the loop...|$|R
25|$|The {{eye of a}} hook, {{although}} some hooks are technically eyeless, is {{the point where the}} hook is connected to the line. Hook eye design is usually optimized for either strength, weight and/or presentation. There are different types of eyes to the hooks. Typical eye types include the ring or ball eye, a brazed eye-the eye is fully closed, a tapered eye to reduce weight, a looped eye—traditional on Atlantic Salmon <b>flies,</b> <b>needle</b> eyes, and spade end—no eye at all, but a flattened area to allow secure snelling of the leader to the hook. Hook eyes can also be positioned one of three ways on the shank—up turned, down turned or straight.|$|R
50|$|Superman flies back to Lois and Jimmy Olsen {{is there}} with the device on his arm. It {{actually}} has a message from Lex Luthor. Wraith was secretly planning on his people invading and taking over the world. The voice in the crystal was actually the armada on its way. Lex has a plan to stop them but it would mean the death of Superman. Inside Jimmy's device is a solar reactor that could charge the entire city of Metropolis. Since Superman absorbs solar radiation he could absorb that power but he would become a bomb. Batman and Wonder Woman call Superman informing him that something in orbit is approaching. Jimmy's device opens up and revels {{that there is a}} needle inside. Superman takes the <b>needle</b> and <b>flies</b> into outer space as all the electronics in the world begin to shut down. While in space, Superman first tries to destroy the ships but is overwhelmed. Before he can inject himself, Wraith takes the needle and injects himself. He pushes Superman away as he explodes taking out the entire armada. In the end, Superman captured Lex and Jimmy had the device cut off by Argus.|$|R
500|$|Eega was parodied {{twice in}} Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao comedy film Sudigadu (2012); {{when a young}} girl asks her father to tell her a bedtime story in the opening credits, and in {{a scene in which}} the protagonist threatens to kill a female crime boss with weapons {{designed}} by Rajamouli, including the <b>fly's</b> <b>needle.</b> In December 2012, Eega and Sudeep topped Radhika Rajamani's Rediff.com [...] "Top Five Telugu Films Of 2012" [...] and [...] "Best Telugu Actors of 2012" [...] lists; according to her, Sudeep left an [...] "indelible" [...] mark on the film and gave an [...] "exceptionally good account" [...] of himself as the antagonist. Shobha Warrier of Reddif placed Sudeep on her list of [...] "Top Tamil Actors of 2012", writing that his performance was [...] "so superlative and far superior to any other actor's in Tamil" [...] that it [...] "has to be termed as the best performance of the year". Radhika Rajamani ranked Rajamouli first on her [...] "Top Telugu Directors of 2012" [...] list, which was published in January 2013.|$|R
50|$|Plugged tooth coils are {{frequently}} {{used in a}} star-shaped stator design where a final ring or yoke is mounted after the assembly of the coils. Inside slotted stator laminations can also be fitted with plugged tooth coils. But in that case, fill factor losses can be registered due to the plug-in direction from the inside to the outside. Conical windings are only possible and beneficial, if the plug-in direction is from the outside to the inside. As {{for the type of}} insulation, it is possible - as with the classical single teeth - to work with paper insulations or insulating end plates. If insert molding is applied with a star-shaped package, it is not referred to as plugged tooth coils anymore because of the necessary direct winding with a <b>needle</b> winding system, <b>flyer</b> winding technique or linear winding technique.Plugged tooth coils eventually require at least two contact points per coil, just as the single teeth. Toothed chains of a phase connected in series are rarely produced since, compared with the already difficult assembly of phase-wise wound T-segments, they will be followed by further assembly movements (pushing onto the stator pack) and the changing length ratios of the connecting wires between the coil sections of a phase. Therefore, two cut-and-clamp contacts per coil {{are frequently}} used for plugged tooth coils which finally reach into a control card or a lead frame via pin-like forms of the contacts.|$|R
5000|$|For an old Man that Travelled up {{and down}} the Country, and had some {{acquaintance}} at that house, calling in and asking the Man of the house how he did and his Wife; He told him that himself was well, but his Wife {{had been a long time}} in a languishing condition, and that she was haunted with a thing in the shape of a Bird that would flurr sic near to her face, and that she could not enjoy her natural rest well. The Old Man bid him and his Wife be of good courage. It was but a dead Spright, he said, and he would put him in a course to rid his Wife of this languishment and trouble, He therefore advised him to take a Bottle, and put his Wives Urine into it, together with Pins and Needles and Nails, and Cork them up and set the Bottle to the Fire well corkt, which when it had felt a while the heat of the Fire began to move and joggle a little, but he for sureness took the Fire shovel, and held it hard upon the Cork, And as he thought, he felt something one while on this side, another while on that, shove the Fire shovel off, which he still quickly put on Again, but at last at one shoving the Cork bounced out, and the Urine, Pins, Nails and <b>Needles</b> all <b>flew</b> up, and gave a report like a Pistol, and his Wife continued in the same trouble and languishment still.Not long after, the Old Man came to the house again, and inquired of the Man of the house how his Wife did. Who answered, as ill as ever, if not worse. He askt him if he had followed his direction. Yes, says he, and told him the event as is above said. Ha, quoth he, it seems it was too nimble for you. But now I will put you in a way that will make the business sure. Take your Wive’s Urine as before, and Cork, it in a Bottle with Nails, Pins and Needles, and bury it in the Earth; and that will do the feat. The Man did accordingly. And his Wife began to mend sensibly and in a competent time was finely well recovered; But there came a Woman from a Town some miles off to their house, with a lamentable Out-cry, that they had killed her Husband. They askt her what she meant and thought her distracted, telling her they knew neither her nor her Husband. Yes, saith she, you have killed my Husband, he told me so on his Death-bed. But at last they understood by her, that her Husband was a Wizard, and had bewitched this Mans Wife and that this Counter-practice prescribed by the Old Man, which saved the Mans Wife from languishment, was the death of that Wizard that had bewitched her.|$|R
