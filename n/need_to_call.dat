25|$|The VMM is also {{responsible}} for creating MS-DOS environments for system processes and Windows applications that still need to run in MS-DOS mode. It is the replacement for Win386 in Windows 3.x, and the file vmm32.vxd is a compressed archive containing most of the core VxD, including VMM.vxd itself and ifsmgr.vxd (which facilitates file system access without the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the real mode file system code of the DOS kernel).|$|E

25|$|Iridium {{controls}} the virtual country codes +8816 and +8817, {{part of the}} 881 range designated by the ITU for the Global Mobile Satellite System. Each subscriber is given an 8-digit number prefixed by one of these country codes. However many regional telephone service operators have no interconnect agreement with Iridium or other satellite networks and users on these networks <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> reverse charge to a U.S.-based number.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the mass}} media {{generally}} declared the March successful because of its high turnout, organizers were not confident that it would create change. Randolph and Rustin abandoned their belief in the effectiveness of marching on Washington. King maintained faith that action in Washington could work, but determined that future marchers would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> greater attention to economic injustice. In 1967–1968, he organized a Poor People's Campaign to occupy the National Mall with a shantytown.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{replied that}} he would consent to the test since he was confident of Marie's guilt, but he felt there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on Orfila to do it. The president of the court {{ruled in favor of}} the prosecutor's suggestion. Therefore, in lieu of Orfila, two well-known apothecaries from Tulle, M. Dubois and his son, and a chemist from Limoges named Dupuytren, were assigned to conduct the tests. While they were performed, the trial proceeded at a snail's pace. When they finally entered the courtroom, everyone waited to see what they would say. The elder Dubois testified that despite using the Marsh test carefully, they failed to find any arsenic. Almost immediately, the courtroom was in an uproar as Marie felt vindicated.|$|E
50|$|JNAerator is a {{computer}} programming tool for the Java programming language which automatically generates the Java Native Access (JNA) or BridJ code <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> C and Objective-C libraries from Java code.|$|R
50|$|A {{compiler}} (or other tool) {{can solve}} this problem by generating a thunk that automates the additional steps <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the target routine, whether that is transforming arguments, copying them to another location, or switching the CPU mode. A successful thunk minimizes the extra work the caller must do compared <b>to</b> a normal <b>call.</b>|$|R
50|$|GlueGen is a Java tool which {{automatically}} {{generates the}} Java and Java Native Interface (JNI) code <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> C libraries from Java code. It reads in ANSI C header files and GlueGen configuration files, and emits C code. As JNI can be complex, Gluegen simplifies {{the process of}} binding Java to C native libraries.|$|R
25|$|The {{school had}} its named changed 72 years later. In 1879, during the {{governorship}} of Sir Anthony Musgrave, a provision {{was made by}} law for the Jamaica Free School to come {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Jamaica School Commission. The institution was now to be known under a new name, Jamaica High School. All classes at the time were free so there was no longer a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the school Jamaica Free School, but the purpose of the school remained the same until 1903. This law also authorized the removal of the school from Walton Pen in St. Ann in 1883, and classes were conducted at Barbican Great House until mid-1885. The school then had a new headmaster, Reverend (later Archdeacon) William Simms.|$|E
25|$|Between London and Didcot {{there are}} four tracks, two for each direction. The main lines are mostly used by the faster trains and are {{on the south side}} of the route. The relief lines on the north side are used for slower {{services}} and those that <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> at all stations as only London Paddington, Slough, Maidenhead, Twyford, Reading and Didcot Parkway stations have platforms on the main lines (although a few others have main line platforms that can be used in an emergency). Between Didcot and Royal Wootton Bassett there are a series of passing loops lines to allow fast trains to overtake slower ones. This section is also signalled for bi-directional running on each line but this facility is usually only used during engineering working or when there is significant disruption to traffic in one direction.|$|E
25|$|Inventory credit {{refers to}} the use of stock, or inventory, as {{collateral}} to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in developing countries where land title may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks {{of a wide range of}} products held in a bonded warehouse is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy. Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries. A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.|$|E
5000|$|No referees are employed, so almost {{invariably}} a [...] "call your own foul" [...] rule is in effect, and {{a player who}} believes he has been fouled, simply <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> out [...] "Foul!", and play will be stopped, with the ball awarded to the fouled player's team (free throws are not awarded in streetball).|$|R

500|$|Goldstein was {{struggling}} with his former addiction during the filming of Gone Too Far. He held a crack-pipe during one episode. BJ Hickman, an intervention expert who appeared in two episodes, noticed Goldstein [...] "had a moment" [...] holding the crack pipe, and later felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> his sponsor. Goldstein later said of the experience: [...] "I realized my palms were sweaty and I was like, wait a minute, this is not smart {{for me to be}} holding this." [...] In another episode, a police officer shows Goldstein confiscated drugs, including a bag of crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, Goldstein leaves the building, informing the camera crew that he felt so tempted to consume the drugs that it was not safe for him to remain there.|$|E
500|$|Strong took {{a principled}} {{stand against the}} War of 1812, {{generally}} refusing to assist federal government efforts to prosecute the war. [...] Strong {{was part of a}} chorus of Massachusetts (and more broadly New England) Federalists who complained that in [...] "Mr. Madison's War" [...] the federal government was trampling state and individual rights. [...] He adhered to the view that state militia could not be required to serve under regular army command. When the first such requests were made by U. S. Army General Henry Dearborn, Strong, with the backing of not just the Governor's Council but also the Supreme Judicial Court, refused, arguing that there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> out the militia because invasion was not imminent. [...] Because of his stance against regular army command, the state was denied a shipment of arms that was instead diverted to frontier areas and the war theater. [...] Strong also took no particular actions to prevent widespread smuggling along the state's frontiers with the neighboring British provinces.|$|E
2500|$|Richardson was {{the author}} of two books. [...] The Creative Balance: Government, Politics, and the Individual in America's Third Century was {{published}} by Holt, Rinehart and Winston in 1976. [...] Reflections of a Radical Moderate was published by Westview Press in 1996. Reflections expresses his outlook:I am a moderate – a radical moderate. I believe profoundly in the ultimate value of human dignity and equality. I therefore believe as well in such essential contributions to these ends as fairness, tolerance, and mutual respect. In seeking to be fair, tolerant, and respectful I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> upon all the empathy, understanding, rationality, skepticism, balance, and objectivity I can muster.|$|E

Therefore, task timeout parameters <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be configured adequately which need a priori knowledge about application execution time. Later, many parallel programming based aligners like pBWA [38] which uses MPI to parallelize BWA, were designed.

2500|$|During early construction, two {{acres of}} land in the {{southern}} section of the Battery Park landfill was used by artist Agnes Denes to plant wheat in an exhibition titled Wheatfield - A Confrontation. The project was a visual contradiction: a golden field of wheat set among the steel skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan. It was created during a six-month period in the spring, summer, and fall of 1982 when Denes, {{with the support of the}} Public Art Fund, planted the field of wheat on rubble-strewn land near Wall Street and the World Trade Center site. Denes stated that her [...] "decision to plant a wheatfield in Manhattan, instead of designing just another public sculpture, grew out of a long-standing concern and <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> attention to our misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Blagojevich's arrest, Richard Durbin, the United States Senator for Illinois who {{had served}} {{alongside}} Obama, issued a statement regarding the prospective gubernatorial appointment to replace Barack Obama in the Senate: [...] "No appointment by this governor, under these circumstances, could produce a credible replacement". Durbin urged the Illinois General Assembly to quickly set a special election to replace Obama. Durbin noted that Illinois has a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a 2009 House of Representatives special election to replace then-Representative and White House Chief of Staff-designate Rahm Emanuel in Illinois's 5th congressional district. Both Illinois Senate President Emil Jones and Michael Madigan, Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, stated that they would call a session of their respective chambers to consider legislation to establish a special election to fill the Obama Senate seat vacancy. Bills were introduced in both houses that would have revoked the Governor's statutory authority to appoint a senator, and would have required a special election instead. Neither house debated the bills, nor were they enacted.|$|E
2500|$|Maddux {{has been}} {{credited}} {{by many of}} his teammates with a superior ability to outthink his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez {{tells the story of}} Maddux intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros's Jeff Bagwell, in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again, which Maddux would then refuse to throw. On another occasion while sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, [...] "Watch this, we might <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> an ambulance for the first base coach." [...] The batter, Los Angeles' José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers' first base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who'd been pitched inside by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly. On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between innings, he told Grissom, [...] "Gary Sheffield is coming up next inning. I am going to throw him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to the warning track." [...] The at-bat went as Maddux had predicted.|$|E
