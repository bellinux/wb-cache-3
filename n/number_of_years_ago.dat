40|$|N-body {{simulations}} of collisionless collapse have offered important {{clues to the}} construction of realistic stellar dynamical models of elliptical galaxies. Such simulations confirm and quantify the qualitative expectation that rapid collapse of a self-gravitating collisionless system, initially cool and significantly far from equilibrium, leads to incomplete relaxation, that is to a quasi-equilibrium configuration characterized by isotropic, quasi-Maxwellian distribution of stellar orbits in the inner regions and by radially biased anisotropic pressure in the outer parts. In earlier studies, as illustrated in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> papers several <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> (see Bertin et al. 1993 and references therein), the attention was largely focused on the successful comparison between the models (constructed under the qualitative clues offered by the N-body simulations mentioned above) and the observations. In this paper we revisit the problem of incomplete violent relaxation, by making a direct comparison between the detailed properties of a family of distribution functions and those of the products of collisionless collapse found in N-body simulations.

40|$|The “fetuses at risk ” {{concept of}} gestational-age-specific {{mortality}} proposed by Yudkin et al. (Lancet 1987; 1 : 1192 – 4) and extended by various researchers is becoming popular in perinatal and pediatric epidemiology. However, the definitions using this concept {{have led to}} a puzzling phenomenon in which mortality rates appear to increase monotonically with advancing gestational age. While proponents of this concept have highlighted the rationale for using as the denominator the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fetuses at risk rather than that of fetuses delivered at a particular gestational week, many have not discussed how the numerator is derived. This article reviews various definitions of gestational-age-specific mortality rates. It points out that the definitions based on the concept of Yudkin et al. are indicators of short-term risk only. Furthermore, the seemingly monotonic positive association between mortality rates and gestational age is a misinterpretation. All of the definitions are valid when used and interpreted correctly. The choice of which definition to adopt depends on the specific issues one attempts to address.

In fact, we returned to a fairly normal type of winter with some cold weather and accumulating snow cover. This caused birds to leave in fall in normal fashion, and, in general, to arrive in spring at normal times. Waterfowl and blackbirds generally departed in early Jan and returned {{at the end of}} February, just like old times, and there were some half-hardy birds in evidence: Yellow-bellied Sapsucker, Hermit Thrush, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Fox Sparrow, and Brown-headed Cowbird. A surprise was the absence of scoters. There was a minor influx of Common Redpolls and Purple Finches, but other winter finches were in low numbers. Clearly declining in recent years, especially when compared to CBC <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> around 20 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> is the House Sparrow. <b>Numbers</b> <b>of</b> Harris 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow also were low, as were chickadees, the latter strikingly so in the Platte Valley.
