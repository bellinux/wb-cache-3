25|$|An {{important}} purification {{element to}} the ancient Maya was the sweat bath, or 'temezcal. Similar to a modern-day sauna, sweat baths were constructed of stone walls and ceilings, with a small opening {{in the top of}} the ceiling. Water poured onto the hot rocks in the room created steam, offering a setting in which to sweat out impurities. Sweat baths were used for a range of conditions and situations. <b>New</b> <b>mothers</b> who had recently conceived a child would seek revitalization in them, while individuals who were sick could find healing power in sweating.|$|E
25|$|Her {{interest}} in obstetrics began after working with <b>new</b> <b>mothers</b> in hospital. At the time, standard childbirth procedures involved giving mothers {{large amounts of}} medication, and keeping them in hospital for 10 days after they gave birth.

After talking about her experiences at the hospital {{with one of her}} part-time private patients, she learned of Grantly Dick-Read's book Natural Childbirth. She was unable to meet Read or other like-minded individuals because of the outbreak of World War II, so she taught herself as much as she could about obstetrics.|$|E
25|$|Mothers will {{communicate}} with their offspring though vocalization, and it has even been shown that a mother can discriminate between the calls of its offspring and the offspring of other females. They exhibit more maternal approach behaviors when hearing the calls of their own offspring, and more experienced mothers show more approach behavior as opposed to <b>new</b> <b>mothers.</b> However, this behavior isn't the same in males, who instead take {{a different approach to}} hearing the calls of their offspring. They will harass the mothers until they go {{to take care of the}} young, but won't go to attend to the young themselves.|$|E

25|$|Between 1846 and 1874, an {{estimated}} 8,000 gray whales {{were killed by}} American and European whalemen, with over half having {{been killed in the}} Magdalena Bay complex (Estero Santo Domingo, Magdalena Bay itself, and Almejas Bay) and by shore whalemen in California and Baja California. This, for the most part, {{does not take into account}} the large number of calves injured or left to starve after their mothers had been killed in the breeding lagoons. Since whalemen primarily targeted these <b>new</b> <b>mothers,</b> several thousand deaths should probably be added to the total. Shore whaling in California and Baja California continued after this period, until the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{maternal}} death figure for Madagascar {{is lower than}} average in Sub-Saharan Africa, at a total of 498 deaths per 100,000 live births. This death rate remained stable between 2000 and 2009. This figure has been influenced by numerous factors. Although 86 percent receive pre-natal checkups, 49 {{percent of them are}} not told if there are complications. Approximately 46 percent of <b>new</b> <b>mothers</b> receive fewer than four post-natal care sessions. Most women give birth outside of health centres, and the number of those who had assistance in giving birth is decreasing; according to Sharp and Kruse, 35 percent of Malagasy women who give birth outside of health centres do not receive medical care. Abortions due to unwanted pregnancies are also a major contributor.|$|E

25|$|A similar great {{migration}} of herrings occurs each {{year during the}} summer plankton bloom {{along the coast of}} British Columbia and Alaska. The migration is featured in the final episode of the 2009 BBC wildlife documentary Nature's Great Events. In winter, the coastal fjords and inlets are relatively lifeless, and the resident Steller sea lions must dive deeper and further from the coast to catch the widely-dispersed herring. Humpback whales overwinter in the warm Pacific waters off Hawaii, where <b>new</b> <b>mothers</b> suckle their calves. They begin their 3,000 mile journey north in early spring, when the sea lions also give birth to their young. Spring storms disturb nutrients in the water which, together with the strengthening power of the sun, act as the catalysts for the plankton bloom. Huge shoals of herring arrive to spawn, turning the shallows milky white. The herring sift plankton from the water. In their wake come larger predators, including Pacific white-sided dolphins and killer whales. Common murres dive under the herring shoals and pick off the fish from below, pinning them to the surface. Their defence is to form a bait ball, but gulls gathering on the surface attack them from above. The finale to the programme features unique underwater footage of humpbacks engulfing whole bait balls, and reveals their co-operative hunting behaviour called bubble-netting.|$|E

A snack eaten by <b>new</b> <b>mothers</b> called Sunthawada or Dinkawada is the prasad or the religious food on Rama Navami.

[...] Ro-mangazafy (...) is a rich and flavorful broth made with beef, tomato and garlic that often accompanies a dry laoka. By contrast, Romatsatso (...) is a light and relatively flavorless broth made with onion, tomato and anamamy greens served with meat or fatty poultry. Ron-akoho (...) , a broth made with chicken and ginger, is a home remedy for the common cold, while rompatsa (...) —a broth made with tiny dried shrimp and beef, to which sweet potato leaves and potato are often added—is traditionally eaten by <b>new</b> <b>mothers</b> to support lactation. The national dish is the broth called romazava, which in its simplest form is made of beef with anamalao, anantsonga or anamamy, although ingredients such as tomato, onion and ginger are commonly added to create more complex and flavorful versions. Romazava is distinguished by its inclusion of anamalao flowers, which produce a mild analgesic effect when the broth is consumed.|$|E
