50|$|Lucy Wills, MA (Cantab), LRCP, MB BS (Lond) (10 May 1888 - 26 April 1964) was {{a leading}} English haematologist. She {{conducted}} seminal work in India in the late 1920s and early 1930s on macrocytic anaemia of pregnancy. Her observations led to her discovery of a <b>nutritional</b> <b>factor</b> in yeast which both prevents and cures this disorder. Macrocytic anaemia is characterised by enlarged red blood cells and is life-threatening. Poor pregnant women in the tropics with inadequate diets are particularly susceptible. The <b>nutritional</b> <b>factor</b> identified by Lucy Wills (the ‘Wills Factor’) was subsequently shown to be folate, the naturally occurring form of folic acid.|$|E
50|$|This anaemia {{was then}} known as ‘pernicious anaemia of pregnancy’. However, Lucy Wills was able to {{demonstrate}} that the anaemia she observed differed from true pernicious anaemia, as the patients did not have achlorhydria, an inability to produce gastric acid. Furthermore, while patients responded to crude liver extracts, they did not respond to the ‘pure’ liver extracts (vitamin B12) which had been shown to treat true pernicious anaemia. She postulated that there must have been another <b>nutritional</b> <b>factor</b> responsible for this macrocytic anaemia other than vitamin B12 deficiency. For some years this <b>nutritional</b> <b>factor</b> was known as the ‘Wills Factor’, and it was later shown, in the 1940s, to be folate, of which the synthetic form is folic acid.|$|E

She returned to the Chelsea building, however, to prepare agglutinating sera for diagnosis of typhoid and related diseases in troops. Subsequently, however, she commenced studies on rectifying nutritional deficiencies in the wartime diets of both the native population and overseas forces. Initially this involved surveys of the ability of various foodstuffs to counter scurvy and beriberi. In 1919, together with Dr. Elsie Dalyell, she led a team, including Margaret Hume and Hannah Henderson Smith, from the Lister Institute and the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) to study the relation of nutrition to childhood bone disease in post-war Vienna. They discovered the <b>nutritional</b> <b>factor</b> causing rickets, and proved that fat-soluble vitamins present in cod liver oil, or exposure to ultra violet light, could cure and prevent rickets in children.|$|E
50|$|Indigenous Australians are a {{minority}} group {{that are also}} at risk of developing poor nutritional habits.The remoteness of rural indigenous populations and their reduced exposure to nutritional regulations {{has resulted in a}} 2013 study revealing that 30% of Indigenous Australians between the ages of 15-18 are considered obese and 8% of indigenous children between 2-14 are considered under weight or malnourished. 2012-13 indigenous {{children between the ages of}} 2-14 were further surveyed and of this sample, 85% did not consume the recommended amounts of fruit or vegetables defined by the NHMRC. Poor dietary standards also extend to urban Indigenous Australians, as their diets are proven to include significant amounts of convenience foods, for reasons of lifestyle and affordability. The lack of health awareness is proven by the 97% of urban indigenous Australians who are unlikely to consume the recommended vegetable quota. Exercise for many Indigenous Australians is a redeeming <b>nutritional</b> <b>factor.</b> A 2013 national study revealed that Indigenous children dedicate on average 6.6 hours to daily physical activity. This daily physical activity output is higher than the average Caucasian child.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{and its relationship}} to <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> in female Vietnamese immigrants to Korea. METHODS: A total of 390 female immigrants from Vietnam and 206 Korean male spouses participated in the study. Blood samples from 321 female immigrants and 201 Korean male spouses were analyzed for H. pylori antibodies. Data on age, sex, alcohol consumption, smoking status, dietary <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> and gastrointestinal symptoms were collected using questionnaires. The daily intakes of the following nutrients were estimated: energy, protein, niacin, lipid, fiber, calcium, iron, sodium, potassium, zinc, folate, cholesterol, and vitamins A, B 1, B 2, B 6, C and E. RESULTS: The prevalence of H. pylori positivity was lower in the immigrants than in age-matched Korean females (55. 7 % vs 71. 4 %, respectively; P < 0. 0001) and the domestic population of Vietnam. The prevalence of H. pylori positivity among married couples was 31. 7 % for both spouses. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of smoking, amount of alcohol consumed, or <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> between the H. pylori-positive and negative groups.

Seventy-five Kimber K- 137 hens were divided into two groups. A corn-soy diet containing 3. 0 percent calcium (Ca) was fed to group 1, which was composed of 15 birds. Group 2 (60 birds) was fed the same diet except that limestone was removed and replaced with sand resulting in a level of 0. 05 percent calcium. Yolk calcium determinations and examinations for abnormal yolks were made at regular inter-vals throughout the 24 -day experiment. Severe yolk mottling and decreased yolk calcium were observed in eggs from hens fed the calcium-deficient diet within 12 days. The mottling appeared as reddish-brown splotches.

We assumed that there might be some unveiled sources for vitamin B 12 in the Korean traditional foods. Screening of vitamin B 12 contents has revealed that some traditional soybean-fermented foods, such as Doenjang and Chunggukjang, and seaweeds contain considerable amounts of vitamin B 12.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors,</b> serum lipids, and lipoproteins in late age-related macular degeneration (late AMD). Methods. Intake of red meat, fruit, fish, vegetables, and alcohol, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI) were ascertained questionnaire-based in 1147 late AMD cases and 1773 controls from the European Genetic Database. Serum levels of lipids and lipoproteins were determined. The relationship between <b>nutritional</b> <b>factors</b> and late AMD was assessed using logistic regression. Based on multivariate analysis, area-under-the-curve (AUC) was calculated by receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC). Results. In a multivariate analysis, besides age and smoking, obesity (odds ratio (OR) : 1. 44, P = 0. 014) and red meat intake (daily: OR: 2. 34, P = 8. 22 x 10 (- 6); 2 - 6 x/week: OR: 1. 67, P = 7. 98 x 10 (- 5)) were identified as risk factors for developing late AMD.
