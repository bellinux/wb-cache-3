25|$|Two memoirs by Fuchs (Crelle, 1866, 1868), {{inspired}} a novel approach, subsequently elaborated by Thomé and Frobenius.

Clebsch (1873) attacked the theory along lines parallel to those followed in his theory of Abelian integrals. As the latter can be classified according to {{the properties of the}} fundamental curve that remains unchanged under a rational transformation, so Clebsch proposed to classify the transcendent functions defined by the differential equations according to the invariant properties of the corresponding surfaces f = 0 under rational one-to-one transformations.|$|E

The proposed approach is very general and can be applied to both linear and <b>non-linear</b> <b>systems</b> of which the response can be determined by deterministic methods.
