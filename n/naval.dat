5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1914 credits were voted {{for the creation of}} a <b>naval</b> aerodrome in Eleusina, Attica. Meanwhile, despite limited funds Aristeidis Moraitinis managed to establish the first <b>naval</b> aviation school and corps. In spring 1915 the establishment of an independent <b>Naval</b> Aviation Department within the Ministry of <b>Naval</b> Affairs and the incorporation of the Greek <b>naval</b> air fleet into the Greek Navy ensured the foundation of the <b>Naval</b> Air Service (NAY).|$|E
5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the <b>Naval</b> Ordnance Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first <b>naval</b> aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been <b>naval</b> ordnance officers. Under his guidance, the <b>Naval</b> Ordnance Laboratory developed the Mark 52 <b>naval</b> mine, an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The <b>Naval</b> Ordnance Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E
5|$|The Coast and Maritime Traffic Command {{comprised}} three <b>naval</b> commands for the northern, {{central and}} southern sections of the Adriatic coast, headquartered at Crikvenica (later Sušak), Makarska (later Split) and Dubrovnik respectively. These commands were further divided into <b>naval</b> districts; North Adriatic <b>Naval</b> Command was divided into the Kraljevica and Senj <b>Naval</b> Districts, Central Adriatic <b>Naval</b> Command comprised the Omiš, Supertar, Makarska, Metković and Hvar <b>Naval</b> Districts, and South Adriatic <b>Naval</b> Command consisted of the Trpanj, Orebić and Dubrovnik <b>Naval</b> Districts. The <b>naval</b> districts consisted mainly of <b>naval</b> and weather stations, and were only responsible for coast guard and customs duties.|$|E
5|$|The United States <b>naval</b> gunfire support {{debate is}} an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and {{independent}} groups like the United States <b>Naval</b> Gunfire Support Association over what role <b>naval</b> gunfire support and <b>naval</b> surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can best be provided. At {{the heart of the}} issue is the role that <b>naval</b> gunfire support—the use of <b>naval</b> artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range—should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} her sea trials, Ise {{was attached}} to the Imperial Japanese <b>Naval</b> Academy at Etajima and ferried troops and munitions to the <b>naval</b> base at Truk in October. In November the ship began working up, joined by the newly completed Hyūga the following month, and both rejoined the 2nd Battleship Division. On 1 May 1944, the sisters were transferred to Rear Admiral Matsuda Chiaki's reformed Fourth Carrier Division of the 3rd Fleet. The division's 634th <b>Naval</b> Air Group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late June.|$|E
5|$|After {{nearly eight}} years of Coast Guard service, McDougal was {{decommissioned}} at Philadelphia on 26 May 1933 {{and returned to the}} custody of the U.S. Navy on 30 June. On 1 November 1933, she dropped the name McDougal to free it for a new destroyer of the same name, becoming known only as DD-54. The ship was struck from the <b>Naval</b> Vessel Register on 5 July 1934, and, on 22 August, was sold for scrapping in accordance with the London <b>Naval</b> Treaty for the limitation of <b>naval</b> armaments.|$|E
5|$|After the {{battleship}} was freed, a <b>naval</b> {{court of inquiry}} found Captain William D. Brown {{and a handful of}} other <b>naval</b> officers guilty of negligence. Brown was moved down 250 places on the promotion list, effectively ending his <b>naval</b> career.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the battle all Ottoman <b>naval</b> forces in the region were annihilated, thus {{ensuring}} the approaches to the Suez Canal were open to the Italians. Besides the <b>naval</b> losses, the city of Beirut itself suffered significant damage from the Italian warships.|$|E
5|$|As well as supervising Bradbury's thesis, Loeb, who {{had served}} as a <b>naval</b> reservist during World War I, {{encouraged}} Bradbury to apply for a commission as a <b>naval</b> reservist. Bradbury's commission as an ensign was signed by Lieutenant Commander Chester W. Nimitz, who {{was the head of the}} <b>Naval</b> Reserve Officer Training Corps at Berkeley at the time.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the conflict, all <b>naval</b> forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common <b>naval</b> tactics during the period were ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced <b>naval</b> powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Hyakutake's troops were attacking the Lunga perimeter, Japanese {{warships}} under the overall direction of Isoroku Yamamoto moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese <b>naval</b> forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) <b>naval</b> forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to Hyakutake's ground offensive. Allied <b>naval</b> carrier forces in the area, now under the command of William Halsey, Jr. who had replaced Ghormley, also hoped to meet the Japanese <b>naval</b> forces in battle.|$|E
5|$|Cernan was {{commissioned}} a U.S. Navy Ensign through the <b>Naval</b> Reserve Officers Training Corps at Purdue, and after graduation attended flight training. In 1958, Cernan became a <b>Naval</b> Aviator, flying FJ-4 Fury and A-4 Skyhawk jets in Attack Squadrons 126 and 113. Upon completion of his assignment in Miramar, California, {{he finished his}} education in 1963 at the U.S. <b>Naval</b> Postgraduate School with a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering.|$|E
5|$|Coker {{served as}} a U.S. <b>Naval</b> flight officer for twenty-three years. He joined the Navy Reserve on October 31, 1963 at Lakehurst, New Jersey on November 13, 1963, serving until his {{retirement}} on September 30, 1986. He entered the <b>Naval</b> Aviation Officer Program and was commissioned and received his <b>Naval</b> Flight Officer Wings on August 15, 1964. Following graduation, he attended Basic <b>Naval</b> Aviation Observer (BNAO) School at NAS Pensacola, Florida, followed by advanced jet navigation training at NAS Glynco, Georgia. He served as <b>Naval</b> Aviation Observer (NAO), and completed additional training as an A-6 Intruder bombardier-navigator.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Shikishima {{was based}} at Sasebo during 1914–15 and was then {{assigned}} to the Second and Fifth Squadrons, in that order, {{for the rest of}} the war. After the Washington <b>Naval</b> Treaty was signed, she was reclassified as a first-class coast defence ship on 1 September 1921, and was used to train submarine crews until the ship was reclassified as a transport on 1 April 1923. Shikishima continued to be used as a training hulk for the Sasebo <b>Naval</b> Barracks until she was scrapped in January 1948 at the Sasebo <b>Naval</b> Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of <b>naval</b> {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to <b>naval</b> aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of <b>Naval</b> Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, {{changes in}} the {{training}} of <b>naval</b> officers in both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a <b>naval</b> college. Midshipman began to mean an officer cadet at a <b>naval</b> college. Trainees now spent around four years in a college and two years at sea prior to promotion to commissioned officer rank. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, time at sea declined to {{less than a year}} as the entry age was increased from 12 to 18.|$|E
5|$|During the operation, Missouri also {{assisted}} {{coalition forces}} engaged in clearing Iraqi <b>naval</b> mines in the Persian Gulf. By {{the time the}} war ended, Missouri had destroyed at least 15 <b>naval</b> mines.|$|E
5|$|English <b>naval</b> {{power was}} vital to Edward I's {{successful}} campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland {{and his allies}} in the Islands to transport and supply his armies. Part {{of the reason for}} Robert I's success was his ability to call on <b>naval</b> forces from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major <b>naval</b> power in the North Sea. The development of <b>naval</b> power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314. Scottish <b>naval</b> forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318.|$|E
5|$|Established during World War I at {{historic}} Mulberry Island, {{the large}} base at Fort Eustis {{in modern times}} hosts the U.S. Army's Transportation Corps and other important activities. In adjacent localities, other U.S. military facilities include Fort Monroe, Langley Air Force Base, <b>Naval</b> Weapons Station Yorktown, and Camp Peary. Across the harbor in South Hampton Roads, the world's largest <b>naval</b> base, the <b>Naval</b> Station Norfolk and other installations are also located.|$|E

5|$|Following World War I, the United States {{agreed to}} the Washington <b>Naval</b> Treaty, which was aimed at {{preventing}} a <b>naval</b> arms race by limiting {{the size of the}} signatories' fleets. As a result, many old and obsolete ships were scrapped, including the Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Navy fell apart, without sufficient personnel to man many of its ships or the money to maintain them—indeed, many of them were sold to foreign nations. This left the United States as the world's undisputed <b>naval</b> superpower. U.S. <b>naval</b> forces did undergo a decline in absolute terms but relative {{to the rest of the}} world, however, United States dwarfs other nations' <b>naval</b> power as evinced by its 11 aircraft supercarriers and their supporting battle groups. During the 1990s, the United States <b>naval</b> strategy was based on the overall military strategy of the United States which emphasized the ability of the United States to engage in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|From 1909, Albert {{attended}} the Royal <b>Naval</b> College, Osborne, as a <b>naval</b> cadet. In 1911, he came {{bottom of the}} class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the Royal <b>Naval</b> College, Dartmouth. When his grandfather, Edward VII, died in 1910, Albert's father became King George V. Edward became Prince of Wales, with Albert second in line to the throne.|$|E

5|$|Hayward did {{his initial}} <b>naval</b> {{training}} at the <b>Naval</b> Station Newport at Newport, Rhode Island. He was encouraged by the Chaplain, Father John J. Brady, to try for admission to United States <b>Naval</b> Academy at Annapolis. Brady arranged for Hayward {{to be sent to}} the <b>Naval</b> Academy Preparatory School in Norfolk, Virginia, to study for the entrance exams. During World War I, some one-hundred presidential appointments to Annapolis had been set aside for enlisted sailors, but few had applied, and fewer still had passed the entrance exams. Of the 119 sailors who sat the exams in 1926, only 19 passed, one of whom was Hayward. He entered Annapolis in August 1926, and was commissioned as an ensign on graduation in June 1930, ranking 51st in his class of 406.|$|E
5|$|IIIBritish admiral Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope led <b>naval</b> {{forces in}} several {{critical}} Mediterranean <b>naval</b> battles as Commander-in-Chief.

5|$|In 1930, the <b>Naval</b> Academy {{received}} accreditation as {{an approved}} technological institution. In 1933, {{a new law}} enabled the <b>Naval,</b> Military, and Coast Guard Academies to award bachelor of science degrees, and the class of 1933 {{was the first to}} receive this degree and have it written in the diploma. In 1937, the superintendent of the <b>Naval</b> Academy was granted the authority to award bachelor of science degrees to all living graduates.|$|E
5|$|In April 1972, Ramage became Commander <b>Naval</b> Air Reserve, {{based at}} <b>Naval</b> Air Station Glenview in Illinois, {{for which he}} {{received}} a fourth Legion of Merit.

He retired from active duty in January 1976.|$|E
5|$|In January 1905, Yamashita {{got a job}} {{teaching}} judo at the U.S. <b>Naval</b> Academy. There {{were about}} 25 students in his class, including a future admiral, Robert L. Ghormley. The position ended {{at the end of}} the school term, and Yamashita was not rehired for the following year. When President Roosevelt heard of this, he spoke to the Secretary of the Navy, who in turn told the Superintendent of the <b>Naval</b> Academy to rehire Yamashita. Consequently, Yamashita's judo was taught at the <b>Naval</b> Academy throughout the first six months of 1906.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby islands and end the {{stalemate}} that had existed since September 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army planned a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal for 20–25 October 1942. In support of this offensive, and {{with the hope of}} engaging Allied <b>naval</b> forces, Japanese carriers and other large warships moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese <b>naval</b> forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) <b>naval</b> forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to the ground offensive. Allied <b>naval</b> forces also hoped to meet the Japanese <b>naval</b> forces in battle, with the same objectives of breaking the stalemate and decisively defeating their adversary.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of war or}} {{national}} emergency, the <b>Naval</b> Staff was to become directly subordinate to the Supreme Command. The <b>Naval</b> Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and <b>Naval</b> Coastal Command. All other <b>naval</b> establishments would remain {{under the control of}} the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, the <b>naval</b> detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and the <b>Naval</b> Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to requisition about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels.|$|E

The memorial {{is made from}} metal recovered from the ship.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to increasing pressure from Navy leaders, Long created a permanent advisory staff after the war. The board, created in March 1900, {{was designed to}} unify {{the work of the}} Office of <b>Naval</b> Intelligence, the <b>Naval</b> War College, and the fleet leadership for the production of war plans and the proper preparation, planning, and deployment of <b>naval</b> resources in pursuit of objectives defined in those plans. After the war, Long pushed forward plans to establish a <b>naval</b> base in the Philippines, however, the funding for plans was held up in Congress, which repeatedly sought review of potential base locations in the islands. The matter was also caught up in branch rivalry with the War Department, which objected to the Navy's establishment of a permanent base there that was not under its authority. Construction of the Subic Bay <b>Naval</b> Base did not begin until after Long left office.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} from early spring 1945 to late summer 1945, Feller's <b>naval</b> duties were again at Great Lakes <b>Naval</b> station, where he {{replaced}} Mickey Cochrane as manager of the baseball program, {{as well as an}} active pitcher for the team.|$|E
