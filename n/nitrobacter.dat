This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as <b>Nitrobacter</b> oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E

In 1891, English chemist Robert Warington proposed a two-stage mechanism for nitrification, mediated by two distinct genera of bacteria. The first stage proposed was the conversion of ammonia to nitrite, and the second the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. Winogradsky named the bacteria responsible for the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate <b>Nitrobacter</b> in his subsequent study on microbial nitrification in 1892.

The evolutionary motivation for a decoupled, two-step nitrification reaction is an area of ongoing research.
