This led to strikes at the camps at Casula and Liverpool. Rioting soldiers clashed with police at Circular Quay and at Central Station striking soldiers were shot and one killed by soldiers sent to return them to Liverpool. As a result, new liquor laws were introduced, including six o'clock closing.|$|E

5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> <b>post.</b> However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E
5|$|The British High Commissioner's role became {{that of an}} {{ambassador}} following Singapore's independence from Britain and merger with Malaysia in 1963. Apart from that {{the executive branch of}} the Singapore Government remained largely unchanged, although now it governed a state within a larger federation. However, with effect from 9 August 1965, Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia and became a fully independent republic. On separation from Malaysia, the Singapore Government retained its executive authority, and the executive authority of the Parliament of Malaysia ceased to extend to Singapore and vested in the Singapore Government. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Supreme Head of State of Malaysia, also ceased to be the Supreme Head of Singapore and relinquished his sovereignty, jurisdiction, power and authority, executive or otherwise in respect of Singapore, which revested in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore. The Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 then vested the executive authority of Singapore in the <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> <b>post</b> of President, and made it exercisable by him or by the Cabinet or by any Minister authorized by the Cabinet.|$|E

40|$|Primary care {{professionals}} work in settings which {{have traditionally been}} very hierarchical, and medical practitioners have occupied the dominant places in that hierarchy, possessing structural power through their affiliation with the social institution of medicine, and their control of funding. Counselling in primary care {{has been described as}} a fast evolving profession and Counselling Psychologists are filling many of these <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> <b>posts,</b> cautionary notes concerning the impact of the NHS reforms of recent years on the discipline have been raised. This study was designed to raise awareness of some key factors impacting on the process of communication in multidisciplinary working in primary care relevant to counselling psychologists, and to explore multidisciplinary working in health care from a psychological discourse analysis perspective. Three different workshops were run comprised of multidisciplinary groups brought together for the purpose of the study. Each team were trained in the Community Oriented Primary Care (COPQ model and then audio- and videotaped constructing a COPC programme to address depression in older people. Analysis of the group transcripts was carried out exploring power relations, competing agendas and ideological patterns. Conclusions are that 1. COPC may have had limited application due to difficulties implementing the nonhierarchical multidisciplinary working aspect of the model. 2. Counselling Psychology has much to contribute to multidisciplinary working and could foster true innovation in primary care through broadening the clinical perspective. 3. Counselling Psychologists need to be aware of the power of medical discourse in the environments in which they work, and the resistance of primary care to change which can emerge through the promotion of the medical agenda and the language used in multidisciplinaryworking in medical settings...|$|R
5000|$|In early 1952, a new Council of Ministers was inaugurated, {{the first}} in the country to be {{dominated}} by Nigerians. The ministers chose Nigerianisation as a key policy to pursue. In March 1952, the council appointed a commission jointly led by Simeon Adebo and Sydney Phillipson to review the process of the recruiting more Nigerians into the civil service. In the commission's report released a year later, it noted that between 1948 and 1953, the number of Africans in senior positions increased from 245 to 685 but also the number of expatriates increased from 2,296 to 2,984. In conclusion, the commission gave far reaching recommendations. The report's title was [...] "The Nigerianisation of the Civil Service", {{this was the first time}} the expression, Nigeriansation of the civil service was publicly used in the country. Among the recommendations of the commission include: advertisement of vacancies to Nigerians abroad, promotion based on merit but excluding non-Nigerians on secondment, that non-Nigerians should not be recommended to fill <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> <b>posts</b> or posts in new departments, that contract terms should be the first option in recruiting non-Nigerians. However, just like the previous commission new political developments impacted the full implementation of the proposals. In 1954, the Lyttleton Constitution displaced the Macpherson Constitution of 1951. The new constitution changed the civil service from a unified structure into a regionalized one. As a result, the two Southern regional governments, led by Awolowo’s Action Group and Azikiwe’s NCNC aggressively promoted the training and recruitment of Nigerians into the regional civil service. [...] Many Africans in the Federal service were heavily sought after by the regional governments. This led to progressive Nigerianisation within the regional governments of the South but a depletion of Africans in the Federal service.|$|R
