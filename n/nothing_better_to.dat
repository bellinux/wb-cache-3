5|$|The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy {{adventure}} novel written by Norton Juster with illustrations by Jules Feiffer, published in 1961 by Random House (USA). It {{tells the story}} of a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth one afternoon and, having <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> do, drives through it in his toy car, transporting him to the Kingdom of Wisdom, once prosperous but now troubled. There, he acquires two faithful companions and goes on a quest to restore to the kingdom its exiled princesses—named Rhyme and Reason—from the Castle in the Air. In the process, he learns valuable lessons, finding a love of learning. The text is full of puns and wordplay, such as when Milo unintentionally jumps to Conclusions, an island in Wisdom, thus exploring the literal meanings of idioms.|$|E
25|$|Rizal was a {{contemporary}} of Gandhi, Tagore and Sun Yat Sen who also advocated liberty through peaceful means {{rather than by}} violent revolution. Coinciding {{with the appearance of}} those other leaders, Rizal from an early age had been enunciating in poems, tracts and plays, ideas all his own of modern nationhood as a practical possibility in Asia. In the Noli he stated that if European civilization had <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> offer, colonialism in Asia was doomed.|$|E
25|$|In polyphasic sleep, an {{organism}} sleeps {{several times in}} a 24-hour cycle. Monophasic sleep occurs all at once. Under experimental conditions, humans tend to alternate more frequently between sleep and wakefulness (i.e., exhibit more polyphasic sleep) if they have <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> do. Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards bimodal sleep, with two sleep periods concentrated {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the dark time. Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the industrial revolution.|$|E

Children work {{because they have}} <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or {{the quality of education}} is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.|$|E

500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{has been}} criticized for lacking {{innovative}} gameplay. The New York Times writer Ashley Dunn characterized the game's E3 demonstration as [...] "brain-dead" [...] in its gameplay and suggested that even young children would rather fly a dragon on the Sony PlayStation. Game Revolution issued Pilotwings 64 a particularly harsh review score, declaring the game to be nothing more than a graphical showcase for those with <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> do. The sound effects present in the game were impressive to several reviewers, but the soundtrack has been negatively compared to lounge music and porn groove, although the 'Birdman' track was highly rated.|$|E

Michael Hubbard of MusicOMH complimented the song as [...] "brilliantly catchy, deceptively simple and wonderfully melancholy," [...] while Sarah Hajibagheri from The Times dismissed it for being a [...] "painful Latino warble [...] a would-be Eurovision reject."

[...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed.

2500|$|Zefirelli's {{handling}} of the duel scene has been particularly praised, and his device later adopted by Baz Luhrmann. Taking his cue from Benvolio's speech ending [...] "For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring" [...] Zefirelli depicts the dry, oppressive heat of the little town where (in Anthony West's words) [...] "men seek {{to kill each other}} to relieve their exasperation at having <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> do". The duel is presented as bravado getting out-of-control: the youths baiting one another, half-teasingly. Critic Robert Hatch described Tybalt and Mercutio as like [...] "a couple of neighborhood warlords, vaunting their courage with grandstand high jinks, trying for a victory by humiliation, and giving no strong impression of a taste to kill." [...] The scene increases sympathy for Michael York's Tybalt (often played as a bloodthirsty bully on the stage) by making him shocked and guilty at the lethal wound he has inflicted.|$|E

2500|$|Howard and Bush {{continued}} {{to develop the}} film {{with the assistance of}} the Disney Story Trust, the studio's top creative personnel who meet regularly to review and discuss all projects in development. [...] The most delightful part of the spy film turned out to be its first act, set in a city created by and for animals. [...] To focus on the all-animal city, Howard eventually dropped the 1960s setting, along with the espionage and international aspects, which caused the film to evolve into a contemporary police procedural in which Nick Wilde was the lead role and Judy Hopps was essentially his sidekick. For a while, [...] "the filmmakers were very committed" [...] to that version of the story, but then in November 2014, the filmmakers realized the film's plot would be more engaging if they reversed the roles to instead focus on Hopps as opposed to Wilde. The change in perspective caused several characters to be dropped, including two characters known as [...] "The Gerbil Jerks" [...] who were described as [...] "trust-fund gerbils that had <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> do than harass Nick." ...|$|E

It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day.

2500|$|The game's story {{picks up}} {{shortly after the}} end of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, with the hero of the series, Sam [...] "Serious" [...] Stone, {{continuing}} his goal to defeat his nemesis, Mental. The game begins with Serious Sam being summoned before the Sirian Great Council, where the Council provides him with guidance on how to accomplish his goal to defeat Mental. The Council reveals to Sam that he must collect all five pieces of an ancient Sirian medallion, each held by various groups on five different planets, and states that once Sam has the entire medallion, Mental will be vulnerable. All the planets (except Kleer) are populated by friendly, bobble-headed humanoids, {{but the problem is that}} all the planets are under Mental's control. The Council then instructs Sam to visit all five planets in order to recreate the medallion, only then will Sam become [...] "The One". Confused at the moment and with <b>nothing</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> do, Sam accepts the mission. With the medallion finally complete, Sam is now ready to begin the final assault against the greatest enemy of humanity...Mental, who is located on Sirius, once the planet of the great Sirians that visited Earth many times, now the domain of Mental himself. But in order to gain access to Sirius, Sam is asked to storm Kronor, a moon orbiting Sirius that has a massive cannon which could be used to remove Sirius' protection shield, which was a last line of defense for the Sirians against Mental. And so, Sam's mission continues. In the endgame, Sam enters Mental Institution after disabling it and into Mental's throne room. Sam finally encounters Mental in person while the lights are off. Mental tries to reveal to Sam that he is his father, but Sam interrupts by shooting him, thus silencing Mental forever. After that, the Sirian Great Council, even the inhabitants from the planets, celebrate their long-awaited victory against Mental. When the lights come back on however, it is revealed that Mental wasn't there at all and it was instead just a speaker attached to Mental's throne, implying that he actually tricked Sam in order to escape in his starship into deep space (in the Xbox version, the game doesn't show this scene). The credits roll after that, where a dialog of three unknown people is played discussing how this ending might just be another one of Croteam's bad jokes and how big Mental's boss fight could be.|$|E
