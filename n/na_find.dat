AC NA {{plays a key role in}} sensing the toxic chemical like carcinogens and as an electrochemical sensor [34]. Bimetallic AC nano crystals, as a new class of materials, have great potential in optoelectronic devices for the non-linear optical properties due to their excitation of surface plasmon [35]. For the quantum confinement effect, AC <b>NA</b> <b>finds</b> use in the field of catalysis [36, 37, 38].

40|$|Network {{alignment}} (<b>NA)</b> aims to <b>find</b> a node mapping between molecular {{networks of}} different species that identifies topologically or functionally similar network regions. Analogous to genomic sequence alignment, NA {{can be used}} to transfer biological knowledge from well- to poorly-studied species between aligned network regions. Pairwise <b>NA</b> (PNA) <b>finds</b> similar regions between two networks while multiple NA (MNA) can align more than two networks. We focus on MNA. Existing MNA methods aim to maximize total similarity over all aligned nodes (node conservation). Then, they evaluate alignment quality by measuring the amount of conserved edges, but only after the alignment is constructed. Directly optimizing edge conservation during alignment construction in addition to node conservation may result in superior alignments. Thus, we present a novel MNA approach called multiMAGNA++ that can achieve this. Indeed, multiMAGNA++ generally outperforms or is on par with the existing MNA methods, while often completing faster than the existing methods. That is, multiMAGNA++ scales well to larger network data and can be parallelized effectively. During method evaluation, we also introduce new MNA quality measures to allow for more complete alignment characterization as well as more fair MNA method comparison compared to using only the existing alignment quality measures...|$|R

40|$|Precise {{dissection}} {{of cells}} with ultrashort laser pulses requires {{a clear understanding}} of how the onset and extent of ablation (i. e., the removal of material) depends on pulse energy. We carried out a systematic study of the energy dependence of the plasma-mediated ablation of fluorescently-labeled subcellular structures in the cytoskeleton and nuclei of fixed endothelial cells using femtosecond, near-infrared laser pulses focused through a high-numerical aperture objective lens (1. 4 <b>NA).</b> We <b>find</b> that the energy threshold for photobleaching lies between 0. 9 and 1. 7 nJ. By comparing the changes in fluorescence with the actual material loss determined by electron microscopy, we find that the threshold for true material ablation is about 20 % higher than the photobleaching threshold. This information makes it possible to use the fluorescence to determine the onset of true material ablation without resorting to electron microscopy. We confirm the precision of this technique by severing a single microtubule without disrupting the neighboring microtubules, less than 1 micrometer away. c 2005 Optical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|V-T {{theory is}} {{constructed}} in the many-body Hamiltonian formulation, and differs at the foundation from current liquid dynamics theories. In V-T theory the liquid atomic motion consists of two contributions, normal mode vibrations in a single representative potential energy valley, and transits, which carry the system across boundaries between valleys. The mean square displacement time correlation function (the MSD) is a direct measure of the atomic motion, and {{our goal is to}} determine if the V-T formalism can produce a physically sensible account of this motion. We employ molecular dynamics (MD) data for a system representing liquid <b>Na,</b> and <b>find</b> the motion evolves in three successive time intervals: On the first "vibrational" interval, the vibrational motion alone gives a highly accurate account of the MD data; on the second "crossover" interval, the vibrational MSD saturates to a constant while the transit motion builds up from zero; on the third "random walk" interval, the transit motion produces a purely diffusive random walk of the vibrational equilibrium positions. This motional evolution agrees with, and adds refinement to, the MSD atomic motion as described by current liquid dynamics theories. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We present Na, Mg and Al abundances {{in a set}} of 98 {{stars with}} known giant planets, and in a {{comparison}} sample of 41 ``single'' stars. The results show that the [X/H] abundances (with X = Na, Mg and Al) are, on average, higher in stars with giant planets, a result similar to the one found for iron. However, we did not find any strong difference in the [X/Fe] ratios, for a fixed [Fe/H], between the two samples of stars in the region where the samples overlap. Finally, the data was used to study the Galactic chemical evolution trends for Na, Mg and Al, and to discuss the possible influence of planets on this evolution. The results, in general similar to the ones obtained by other authors, show that the [X/Fe] ratios all decrease as a function of metallicity up to solar values. While for Mg and Al this trend then becomes relatively constant, for <b>Na</b> we <b>find</b> indications of an upturn up to [Fe/H] values close to 0. 25 dex.

LNA aims to identify highly conserved common subnetworks, which are typically small, while GNA aims to identify large common subnetworks, which are typically suboptimally conserved. We recently showed that LNA and GNA yield complementary results: LNA has high functional but low topological alignment quality, while GNA has high topological but low functional alignment quality. Thus, we propose IGLOO, a new approach that integrates GNA and LNA in hope to reconcile the two. We evaluate IGLOO against state-of-the-art LNA (NetworkBLAST, NetAligner, AlignNemo, and AlignMCL) and GNA (GHOST, NETAL, GEDEVO, MAGNA++, WAVE, and L-GRAAL) methods.

For structures smaller than a few nanometers quantum effects are expected to be important, limiting the validity of widely used semi-classical response models.

As an example we calculate the plasmon modes of 0. 5 - 4 nm thick <b>Na</b> films and <b>find</b> that they can be classified as (conventional) surface modes, sub-surface modes, and a discrete set of bulk modes resembling standing waves across the film.
