Our contributions are to implement an epidemic messaging scheme on mesh networks of OLPC XO laptops, to extend the Ushahidi web application to efficiently exchange messages with nodes in mesh networks, and to allow the Ushahidi server to distribute cures, <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> message <b>delivery,</b> for each received message.

50|$|An advance ship notice or advance {{shipping}} notice (ASN) is a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> pending <b>deliveries,</b> {{similar to a}} packing list. It is usually sent in an electronic format and is a common EDI document. In the EDI X12 system, it {{is known as the}} EDI 856 document and the EDIFACT equivalent is the DESADV (Dispatch Advice) message. The ASN can be used to list the contents of a shipment of goods as well as additional information relating to the shipment, such as order information, product description, physical characteristics, type of packaging, markings, carrier information, and configuration of goods within the transportation equipment. The ASN enables the sender to describe the contents and configuration of a shipment in various levels of detail and provides an ordered flexibility to convey information.|$|R
40|$|Interruptions are {{a central}} {{characteristic}} {{of work in}} critical environments such as hospitals, airlines, and security agencies. Often, interruptions occur as <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> some event or circumstance that requires attention. Notifications may be delivered actively as disruptions requiring immediate attention, or passively as unobtrusive background messages. This research hypothesizes that the way notifications are delivered {{can have an impact}} on how work unfolds over time, which in turn can affect performance. Based on theories of interruption and observations in an actual operating room, a computer-based role-playing game simulating the scheduling of surgeries in an operating room unit was developed. An experiment was conducted using the game {{to examine the effects of}} different types <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>delivery</b> on work trajectories and performance. Results indicate that the way notifications are delivered can indeed influence work trajectories and, consequently, performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Event Notification {{service system}} is a data {{dissemination}} technology which asynchronously notifies consumers whose interests match with the events published by producers. Fault-tolerance is important for a large-scale event notification service system as link or node failures usually occur in a wide-area network. In this paper, we first describe architecture <b>of</b> event <b>notification</b> service system for large scale network to minimize the size of routing entities and to reduce latency <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>delivery</b> to consumers. We then present a replication algorithm based on primary-back replication so that event notification service system is resilient to failures of event servers and links between them and maintains dissemination of events. The replication technique used in proposed architecture can minimize {{the portion of the}} system affected by these failures. 1...|$|R
40|$|Event {{notification}} services enable {{loose coupling}} {{and they are}} therefore becoming {{an essential part of}} distributed systems' design. However, the development of event services follows the early stages of programming language evolution, disregarding the need for efficient mechanisms to structure event-based applications. In this paper, the well-known notion of scopes is introduced to event-based systems. We show that limiting the visibility of events is a simple yet powerful mechanism that allows to identify application structure and offers a module construct for the loosely coupled components in event-based systems. We are able to customize the semantics <b>of</b> scoped event <b>notification</b> services by binding meta-objects to the application structure that reify important aspects <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>delivery,</b> like interface mappings and transmission policies. The scoping concept facilitates design and implementation by offering encapsulation and adaption of syntax and semantics of eventbased systems...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
40|$|In mobile environments {{transmitting}} information {{relevant to}} an event along with <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the event has been proven {{to be an effective}} means of providing revenue enhancing services. For example, a relevant advertisement can be displayed just before event notification, for instance, a product promotion by Beckham can be shown just before the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> a goal scored by him. Challenges in achieving real time search and <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> information relevant to events as they occur include: (a) Predicting the next event so that the appropriate information can be kept ready; (b) Finding information relevant to the context and content of the event; (c) Searching and bringing the potentially needed information closer to the user location; and (d) Disseminating and displaying relevant information just before the actual event is notified to the user. In this paper we propose a real time information delivery system based on an event’s context and content. The key features of our system are: (i) Representing domains with event based scenarios using statecharts; (ii) Using a novel combination of history information and state transitions to predict events; and (iii) Real-time <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> information relevant {{to an event}} by prefetching and caching information based on the events predicted to occur in the near future. To illustrate our approach, we focus on the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> advertisements relevant to notified events as a specific case <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> information relevant to the events.

40|$|In many {{developed}} countries, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer {{cases is}} compulsory. Developing countries including India {{accounts for more}} than half of new cancer cases in the world, however <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer is not yet mandatory. The primary purpose <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> is to effect prevention and control and better utilization of resources. It is also a valuable source for incidence, prevalence, mortality and morbidity <b>of</b> the disease. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer will lead to improved awareness of common etiologic agents, better understanding of common preventable causes and better utilization of health resources with better monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of health programs such as cancer screening and cancer treatment programs, which ultimately might improve survival. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer can be done by the doctor or the hospital. Akin to the integrated disease surveillance project where more than 90 % of the districts report weekly data through E-mail/portal, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> cancer can be implemented if it is incorporated into the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke scheme.
