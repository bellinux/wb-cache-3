40|$|Background: Acute {{poisoning}} is {{a common}} medical emergency. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the pattern of drug utilization, poisoning agents, and outcome in patients with acute poisoning treated at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Vadodara, west of India. Methods: This prospective cross sectional drug utilization study was carried out on patients with diagnosis of acute poisoning admitted to emergency department of Sir Shree Sayajirao General Hospital during October, 2013 to March, 2014. Results:During 6 months, 340 acute poisoning cases were enrolled, out of which 216 cases (63. 5 %) were men. Mean age of the patients was 31. 9 ± 12. 7 years. Commonest mode of poisoning was intentional (suicidal), which was observed in 62. 1 % of cases. Pesticides were {{the most common cause of}} poisoning (40 %), followed by venomous animal exposures (25. 9 %). Fifty-six patients (16. 5 %) died. A significantly higher number of deaths was seen in intentional poisonings compared to accidental poisonings (24. 2 % vs. 3. 9 %; P < 0. 001). The most common symptomatic treatments given to the patients were antiemetics (97. 9 %), H 2 blockers (89. 1 %) and antimicrobials (75 %s). Atropine (47. 7 %), pralidoxime (42. 4 %) and anti-snake venom (15 %) were the most commonly prescribed specific antidotes. Median number of drugs per encounter was 8 [range: 1 to 23]. Over half of drugs were prescribed by generic and <b>nearly</b> <b>one-thirds</b> of drugs were prescribed by brand name. Conclusion: Use of antimicrobial medicines for poisoned patients was too high and irrational.  Due to high incidence of snakebites, hospital stockpiles should be regularly checked for availability of antivenom. Educational programs with emphasis on preventive measures for toxic exposures are necessary to create awareness among the general public...|$|R

5|$|Immediately upon reopening his business, Johnson started {{publishing}} theological and political works by Priestley and other Dissenters.

5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} analysing {{a detailed}} CT {{scan of the}} braincase of the London Archaeopteryx concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up <b>nearly</b> <b>one-third</b> of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that Archaeopteryx had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% {{of the way to}} modern birds from the condition of non-coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus or Allosaurus, which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear. Newer research shows that while the Archaeopteryx brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.|$|E
5|$|The rioting {{impacted}} Chicago's economy. Some of the South Side's {{industry was}} closed during the riot. Businesses in the Loop were also affected by {{closure of the}} street cars. Many workers stayed away from affected areas. At the Union Stock Yard, one of Chicago's largest employers, all 15,000 African-American workers were initially expected {{to return to work}} on Monday, August 4, 1919. But after arson near white employees' homes near the Stock Yards on August 3, the management banned African-American employees from the stockyards in fear of further rioting. Governor Lowden noted his opinion that the troubles were related to labor issues rather than race. <b>Nearly</b> <b>one-third</b> of the African-American employees were non-union, and were resented by union employees for that reason. African-American workers were kept out of the stockyards for ten days {{after the end of the}} riot because of continued unrest. On August 8, 1919, about 3,000 non-union African Americans showed up for work under protection of special police, deputy sheriffs, and militia. The white union employees threatened to strike unless such security forces were discontinued. Their main grievance against African Americans was that they were non-union and had been used by management as strikebreakers in earlier years. Many African Americans fled the city as a result of the riots and damage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nearly</b> <b>one-third</b> of the world's {{tropical}} cyclones form {{within the}} western Pacific. This makes this basin {{the most active}} on Earth. Pacific typhoons have formed year round, with peak months from August to October. The peak months correspond {{to that of the}} Atlantic hurricane seasons. Along with a high storm frequency, this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record. One of the most recent busy seasons was 2013. Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific Ocean, and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian Ocean. The area just northeast of the Philippines is the most active place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist. Across the Philippines themselves, activity reaches a minimum in February, before increasing steadily through June, and spiking from July through October, with September being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago. Activity falls off significantly in November, although Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest Philippine typhoon on record, was a November typhoon. The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central Luzon and eastern Visayas. A ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receive less than 10percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones. The genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency.|$|E

40|$|Black Sea {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{severely}} degraded and exploited large marine ecosystems in the world. For the last 50 years after the depletion of large predatory fish stocks, anchovy (with the partial contribution of sprat) has been acting as the main top predator species and experienced a major stock collapse at the end of 1990 s. After the collapse, eastern part of the southern Black Sea became the only region sustaining relatively high anchovy catch (400, 000 tons) whereas the total catch within the rest of the sea was reduced to <b>nearly</b> its <b>one-third.</b> The lack of recovery of different fish stocks under a slow ecosystem rehabilitation may be attributed, on the one hand, to inappropriate management measures and the lack of harmonized fishery policy among the riparian countries. On the other hand, impacts of multiple stressors (eutrophication, alien species invasions, natural climatic variations) on the food web may contribute to resilience of the system toward its recovery. The overfishing/recovery problem therefore cannot be isolated from rehabilitation efforts devoted to the long-term chronic degradation of the food web structure, and alternative fishery-related management measures must be adopted as a part of a comprehensive ecosystem-based management strategy. The present study provides a data-driven ecosystem assessment, underlines the key environmental issues and threats, and points to the critical importance of holistic approach to resolve the fishery-ecosystem interactions. It also stresses the transboundary nature of the problem...|$|R

Some history of stepped channels The discusser (CHANSON 1995, pp. 23 - 43) reviewed recently the history of stepped spillways and stepped spillway design since the Antiquity. He noted that, during the 19 -th century, stepped (or staircase) weirs and channels were quite common. Numerous dam engineers described indeed the construction of stepped spillways 1 : e. g., HUMBER (1876), SCHUYLER (1909), WEGMANN (1907, 1911, 1922). The discusser noted that, in Europe and in the USA, <b>nearly</b> one-quarter to <b>one-third</b> of the dams built during the 19 -th century included a stepped spillway!
