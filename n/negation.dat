40|$|Research on {{linguistic}} biases {{shows that}} stereotypic expectancies are implicitly reflected {{in language and}} are thereby subtly communicated to message recipients. We examined whether these findings extend {{to the use of}} <b>negations</b> (e. g., not smart instead of stupid). We hypothesized that people use more <b>negations</b> in descriptions of stereotype-inconsistent behavior than in descriptions of stereotype-consistent behavior. In 3 studies, participants either judged the applicability of experimentally controlled person descriptions or spontaneously produced person descriptions themselves. Results provided support for this hypothesis. Moreover, a 4 th study demonstrated that <b>negations</b> have communicative consequences. When a target person's behavior was described with <b>negations,</b> message recipients inferred that this behavior was an exception to the rule and that it was more likely caused by situational circumstances than by dispositional factors. These findings indicate that by using <b>negations</b> people implicitly communicate stereotypic expectancies and that <b>negations</b> play a subtle but powerful role in stereotype maintenance. © 2010 American Psychological Association...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{investigate}} {{the role of}} specific formulations in a doctor's bad news delivery. We focus {{on the effects of}} <b>negations</b> and message framing on patients’ immediate responses to the message and the doctor, and long-term consequences including quality of life and medical adherence intentions. MethodsTwo lab experiments with 2 (language use: <b>negations</b> vs. affirmations) × 2 (framing: positive vs. negative) between-subjects designs. After reading a transcription (experiment 1) or seeing a film clip (experiment 2), participants rated their evaluation of the message and the doctor, expected quality of life, and medical adherence intentions. ResultsPositively framed bad news with <b>negations</b> score more negative on these dependent variables than positively framed affirmations (both experiments). For negatively framed <b>negations,</b> these results are reversed (experiment 2). Furthermore, the evaluations of the message (experiment 1) and the doctor (both experiments) mediate the interaction of framing and language use on medical adherence intentions. ConclusionsSmall linguistic variations (i. e., <b>negations</b> vs. affirmations) in breaking bad news can {{have a significant impact on}} the health message, doctor evaluation and medical adherence intentions.

5|$|<b>Negation</b> is {{done with}} the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the <b>negation</b> to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E

50|$|In English, main verbs but not modal verbs always {{require the}} {{auxiliary}} verb do to form <b>negations</b> and questions, and do {{can be used}} with main verbs to form emphatic affirmative statements. Neither <b>negations</b> nor questions in early modern English used to require do.|$|R
40|$|A formal {{treatment}} of typed feature structures (TFSs) is developed to augncnt TFSs, so that negative descriptions of then can be treated. Negative descriptions of TFSs can make linguistic descriptions compact and thus easy to understand. Negative descriptions {{can be classified}} into three primitive negative descriptions: (1) <b>negations</b> of type symbols, (2) <b>negations</b> of feature existences, and (3) <b>negations</b> of feature-address value agreements. The forrealization proposed in this paper is based on A'/t-Kaci's complex terms. The first description is treated by extend- ing type symbol lattices to include complement type symbols. The second and third are treated by augmeuting term structures with strncturcs representing these <b>negations.</b> Algorithrm for augnentcd-TFS nnification have been developed using graph nnification, and programs using these algorithms have been writ- ten in C:ommon Lisp...|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} the {{implication}} graph, two literals {{belong to the same}} strongly connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal to the other and vice versa. Therefore, the two literals must have the same value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its <b>negation</b> both belong to the same strongly connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the same value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this is a necessary and sufficient condition: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs to the same strongly connected component as its <b>negation.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem, the minimax path problem, asks for {{the path that}} {{minimizes}} the maximum weight of any of its edges. It has applications that include transportation planning. Any algorithm for the widest path problem can be transformed into an algorithm for the minimax path problem, or vice versa, by reversing the sense of all the weight comparisons performed by the algorithm, or equivalently by replacing every edge weight by its <b>negation.</b>|$|E
5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} {{for determining}} whether a 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, using only a logarithmic amount of writable memory, is easy to describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from v to its <b>negation</b> {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it is also possible in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{determining}} the sentiment expressed by a customer review. The semantic orientation of a review can be positive, negative, or neutral. Our method counts positive and negative terms, but also takes into account contextual valence shifters, such as <b>negations</b> and intensifiers. Tests are done taking both <b>negations</b> and intensifiers into account, and also using only <b>negations</b> without intensifiers. <b>Negations</b> are used to reverse the semantic polarity of a particular term, while intensifiers are used to change {{the degree to which}} a term is positive or negative. We use the General Inquirer in order to identify positive and negative terms, as well as <b>negations,</b> overstatements, and understatements. We also test the impact of adding extra positive and negative terms from other sources, including a dictionary of synonym differences and a very large web corpus. To compute the corpus-based values of the semantic orientation of individual terms we use their association scores with a small group of positive and negative terms. We show that including contextual valence shifters improves the accuracy of the classification...|$|R

5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, <b>negation,</b> and interrogative constructions.|$|E

5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through <b>negation</b> of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of <b>negation</b> of the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its <b>negation</b> and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E

5|$|English verbs are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and marked for {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb {{to be is}} still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects. Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in {{that they can be}} followed by the <b>negation,</b> and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax.

40|$|Abstract. Flow typing is {{becoming}} a popular mechanism for typing existing programs written in untyped languages (e. g. JavaScript, Racket, Groovy). Such systems require intersections for the true-branch of a type test, <b>negations</b> for the false-branch, and unions to capture {{the flow of information}} at meet points. Type systems involving unions, intersections and <b>negations</b> require a subtype operator which is non-trivial to implement. Frisch et al. demonstrated that this problem was decidable. However, their proof was not constructive and does not lend itself naturally to an implementation. In this paper, we present a sound and complete algorithm for subtype testing in the presence of unions, intersections and <b>negations.</b> ...|$|R
