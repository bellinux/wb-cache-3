We investigated the potential utility of available sequenced fish genomes to develop microsatellite (cf. simple sequence repeat, SSR) markers for functionally important genes in <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius), as well as cross-species transferability of SSR primers from three-spined (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks.</b> In addition, we examined the patterns and degree of SSR conservation between these species using their aligned sequences. Results: Cross-species amplification success was lower for SSR markers located in or around functionally important genes (27 out of 158) than for those randomly derived from genomic (35 out of 101) and cDNA (35 out of 87) libraries.

Here, we show that both three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius) use past cues provided by others to locate food but only <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> use prior public information to assess patch quality, regardless of whether demonstrators were conspecifics or heterospecifics. Moreover, nine-spined but not three-spined sticklebacks preferentially hid in vegetation during the demonstration, a position from which they could observe both patches simultaneously and collect public information. We conclude that species differences {{in the use of}} public information can be explained by variations in habitat choice and response to predation. Our findings expand current understanding of the scope of public-information use in animals by showing that fishes can use public-information in a foraging context and from heterospecifics. The study suggests that public-information use is an adaptation that allows animals vulnerable to predation to acquire valuable foraging information at low risk. ...|$|R

To investigate the potential utility of molecular markers in studying sex chromosome differentiation at early stages of their divergence, we examined the levels and patterns of genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes in nine-spined (Pungitius pungitius) and three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) using microsatellite markers. Results A set of novel microsatellite markers spanning {{the entire length of}} the sex chromosomes were developed for <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> using the sequenced genomes of other fish species. Sex-specific patterns of genetic variability and male-specific alleles were identified at most of these loci, indicating a high degree of differentiation between the X and Y chromosomes in <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks.</b> In three-spined sticklebacks, male-specific alleles were detected at some loci confined to two chromosomal regions. In addition, male-specific null alleles were identified at several other loci, implying the absence of Y chromosomal alleles at these loci. Overall, male-specific alleles and null alleles were found over a region spanning 81 % of the sex chromosomes in three-spined sticklebacks. Conclusions High levels but distinct patterns of sex chromosome differentiation were uncovered in the stickleback species that diverged 13 million years ago. Our results suggest that the Y chromosome is highly degenerate in three-spined sticklebacks, but not in <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks.</b> In general, the results demonstrate that microsatellites can be useful in identifying the degree and patterns of sex chromosome differentiation in species at initial stages of sex chromosome evolution. </p...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals in current {{evolutionary}} biology research is to identify genes behind adaptive phenotypic variations. The advances in genomic technologies {{have made it possible}} to identify genetic loci behind these variations, also concerning non-model species. This thesis investigates the genetics of the behaviour and other adaptive traits of the <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Pungitius pungitius) through the application of different genetic approaches. Fennoscandian <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> populations express large phenotypical differences especially in behaviour, life –history traits and morphology. However the underlying genetic bases for these phenotypical differences have not been studied in detail. The results of the project will lay the foundation for further genetics studies and provide valuable information for our understanding of the genetics of the adaptive divergence of the <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback.</b> A candidate gene approach was used to develop microsatellite markers situating close to candidate genes for behaviour in the <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback.</b> Altogether 13 markers were developed and these markers were used in the subsequent studies with the anonymous random markers and physiologically important gene markers which are already currently available for nine-spined sticklebacks. It was shown that heterozygosity correlated with behaviour in one of the marine <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> populations but with contrasting effects: correlations with behaviour were negative when using physiological gene markers and positive with random markers. No correlation was found between behavioural markers and behaviour. From the physiological gene markers, a strong correlation was found between osmoregulation-related gene markers and behaviour. These results indicate that both local (physiological) and general (random) effects are important in the shaping of behaviour and that heterozygosity– behaviour correlations are population dependent. In this thesis a second linkage map for nine-spined sticklebacks was constructed. Compared to the earlier <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> linkage map, genomic rearrangements were observed between autosomal (LG 7) and sex-determing (LG 12) linkage groups. This newly constructed map was used in QTL mapping studies in order to locate genomic regions associated with pelvic structures, behaviour and body size/growth. One major QTL was found for pelvic structures and Pitx 1 gene was related to these traits as was predicted from three-spined stickleback studies, but this was in contrast to earlier <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> study. The QTL studies also revealed that behaviour and body size/growth were genetically more complex by having more QTL than pelvic traits. However, in many cases, pelvic structure, body size/growth and behaviour were linked to similar map locations indicating possible pleiotropic effects of genes locating in these QTL regions. Many of the gene related markers resided in the QTL area. In the future, studying these possible candidate genes in depth might reveal the underlying mechanism behind the measured traits...|$|E
40|$|Social foragers can {{potentially}} use private information gained {{from personal experience}} and public information gained from observing the foraging success of others to determine the profitability of a foraging patch. We investigated how <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> use conflicting public and private information of variable reliability to make foraging decisions. In a first experiment, when private information was reliable, sticklebacks ignored public information and based their foraging decision on private information. However, when private information was less reliable, sticklebacks tended to use public rather than private information. A second experiment investigated how the time since experiencing private information affected sticklebacks' use of this information when it conflicted with recent public information. Fish based their foraging decisions on recently acquired private information, but reliance on private information diminished as the period since experiencing it increased. Fish used public information if 7 days had elapsed since updating their private information. Our findings suggest that <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> flexibly adjust their decision making to exploit the most reliable information available, be it public or private, and that animals will weight private and public information appropriately depending on circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical {{models on}} the {{adaptive}} advantages of social learning {{lead to the}} conclusion that copying cannot be indiscriminate and that individuals should adopt evolved behavioral strategies that dictate the circumstances under which they copy others and from whom they learn. Strategies that exhibit hill-climbing properties, that would allow a population of individuals to converge on the fitness-maximizing behavior over repeated learning events, are of particular significance due to their potentially critical role in cumulative cultural evolution. Here, we provide experimental evidence that <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius) use public information adaptively and in accordance with a hill-climbing social learning strategy. Sticklebacks switch patch preferences to exploit a more profitable food patch if the returns to demonstrator fish are greater than their own but are less likely to copy when low-profitability patches are demonstrated. These findings reinforce the argument that public-information use in <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> is an adaptive specialization. More generally, the observation of this sophisticated form of learning in a species of fish supports the view that the presence of enhanced social learning may be predicted better by specific sources of selection than by relatedness to humans.

Between April 2002 and March 2003, a small lowland creek was sampled monthly. Species identity of about 75 % of the worms per host was determined with a genetic nuclear marker (ITSI). Each stickleback species hosted a characteristic gill- and in-parasitic Gyrodactylus: G. arcuatus Bychowsky, 1933 and G. gasterostei Glaser, 1974 respectively infecting the three-spined stickleback, with G. rarus Wegener, 1910 and G. pungitii Malmberg, 1964 infecting the <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback.</b> Host size and seasonal dynamics were strong determinants of parasite abundance.

40|$|Background: Comparative {{genomics}} approaches help to {{shed light}} on evolutionary processes that shape differentiation between lineages. The <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Pungitius pungitius) is a closely related species of the ecological ‘supermodel’ three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). It is an emerging model system for evolutionary biology research but has garnered less attention and lacks extensive genomic resources. To expand on these resources and aid the study of sticklebacks in a phylogenetic framework, we characterized <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> transcriptomes from brain and liver using deep sequencing. Results: We obtained nearly eight thousand assembled transcripts, of which 3, 091 were assigned as putative oneto- one orthologs to genes found in the three-spined stickleback. These sequences were used for evaluating overall differentiation and substitution rates between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks, and to identify genes that are putatively evolving under positive selection. The synonymous substitution rate was estimated to be 7. 1 × 10 - 9 per site per year between the two species, and a total of 165 genes showed patterns of adaptive evolution in one or both species. A few <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> contigs lacked an obvious ortholog in three-spined sticklebacks but were found to match genes in other fish species, suggesting several gene losses within 13 million years since the divergence of the two stickleback species. We identified 47 SNPs in 25 different genes that differentiate pond and marine ecotypes. We also identified 468 microsatellites that could be further developed as genetic markers in nine-spined sticklebacks. Conclusion: With deep sequencing of <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> cDNA libraries, our study provides {{a significant increase in the}} number of gene sequences and microsatellite markers for this species, and identifies a number of genes showing patterns of adaptive evolution between nine- and three-spined sticklebacks.

We investigated the potential utility of a microsatellite marker located on sex chromosomes for molecular sexing of Fennoscandian <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius). In addition, we assessed the patterns of allelic differentiation between X and Y chromosomes across the populations to examine if the sex chromosomes had been highly differentiated prior to the postglacial recolonization of Fennoscandia. Findings A clear and consistent sex difference in allele size distribution was observed at the Stn 19 locus throughout the 15 populations investigated. Males were distinguishable by the presence of distinct male-specific alleles, which were lacking in all females. There was no indication of recombination between sex and the Stn 19 locus in the 647 individuals tested. The degree of genetic differentiation between the X and Y chromosomes was much higher than that of interpopulation differentiation in the respective chromosomes.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} water quality, habitat and species interactions on the occurrence and abundance of stream fishes in southern Sweden. I found that improvements in water quality between the 1960 s and 1990 s have led to recolonization of streams by brown trout (Salmo trutta L.), stone loach (Barbatula barbatula L.) and eel (Anguilla anguilla L.). The response was greatest for brown trout and was best explained by increased dissolved oxygen concentrations. The occurrence of other species, specially the <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Pungitius pungitius L.), ide (Leuciscus idus L.) and brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri L.) decreased between the 1960 s and 1990 s. The decrease was greatest for <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> and {{was related to the}} increase in sites with trout, indicating that <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> may be sensitive to predation or competition. In-depth studies of brown trout showed that physical habitat influenced trout densities, especially for 0 + trout, where high densities were associated with narrow streams and with cover. Field manipulations of cover indicated that submerged macrophytes supported high 0 + trout densities in small and medium-sized streams, where other types of instream cover were scarce, and therefore may be especially important in canalized streams. Interspecific and intraspecific interactions also affected trout densities as well as trout behaviour and growth. In a field survey, trout density was inversely related to the abundance of piscivores. Moreover, experiments in artificial stream channels showed that the presence of piscivores could cause habitat shifts and decrease food intake by brown trout. Other experiments in these stream channels showed that intraspecific size-class competition in trout reduced food intake by smaller individuals. Intraspecific competition also seems to explain variation in length of 0 + trout in the field as body length was inversely correlated with trout density, indicating that density may affect trout growth...|$|E

40|$|Isolated {{populations of}} fish living in ponds are often phenotypically and genetically diverged from their source populations. However, {{to what degree}} this {{divergence}} reflects maternal, genetic or environmental effects is often unclear, as is the possible adaptive nature of this differentiation due to the strong impact of random genetic drift on populations residing in isolated habitats. The aim of my thesis {{was to investigate the}} relative influence of genetic, environmental and maternal effects on phenotypic differentiation using Fennoscandian populations of <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks,</b> Pungitius pungitius, as a model system. I used controlled crosses of fish from an ancestral Baltic Sea and a derived Pyöreälampi pond population - known to differ both genetically in neutral marker genes (Fst = 0. 46) and phenotypically in numerous traits (viz. morphology, anatomy, behaviour and life history) - to explore the relative importance of additive genetic, non-additive genetic, environmental and maternal effects as determinants of population differentiation in morphology, life history, and behaviour. I found evidence for strong genetic contributions to divergence in all studied traits (viz. body size, growth, age at maturity, feeding behaviour), but these genetic effects were not always additive. Rather, strong non-additive (dominance) contributions were observed in some traits, such as age at maturation. Furthermore, evidence for age-dependent dominance was found in the case of feeding behaviour. These results indicate that much of the phenotypic differentiation among marine and pond populations of <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> is due to genetic, rather than to environmental or maternal effects. Nevertheless, results from feeding manipulation experiments revealed a great deal of phenotypic plasticity in growth rates and patterns, and in particular, clear evidence for recovery growth. Specifically, full recovery - and even over compensation - was observed in response to unrestricted feeding following a period of resource limitation. The results of these experiments also indicate that there are genetically based population differences in recovery growth potential, and that maternal effects play into explaining patterns of recovery growth in response to feeding treatments. Furthermore, the impact of feeding treatments experienced by mothers was found to carry-over to influence the phenotypes of their offspring. Taken together, the results presented in this thesis demonstrate that the observed phenotypic differences among marine and pond populations of <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> are likely to be based on genetic differentiation, although the mode of gene action underlying this differentiation is not always additive. Although environmental and maternal effects were shown to be important modulators of phenotypic variation in this system, their role in explaining population differentiation appears to be secondary. Further studies utilizing an F 2 -backcross-design - as well as replicate populations - might shed more light on the questions that remain open. Nevertheless, these results reinforce the conjecture that Fennoscandian pond populations of <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> might, or should be viewed as a significant evolutionary and conservation unit that require special attention in regional and national management and conservation plans.

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{evolutionary}} {{studies on}} the size of brains and different parts of the brain have relied on interspecific comparisons, and have uncovered correlations between brain architecture and various ecological, behavioural and life-history traits. Yet, similar intraspecific studies are rare, {{despite the fact that they}} could better determine how selection and phenotypic plasticity influence brain architecture. We investigated the variation in brain size and structure in wild-caught <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius) from eight populations, representing marine, lake, and pond habitats, and compared them to data from a previous common garden study from a smaller number of populations. Results Brain size scaled hypo-allometrically with body size, irrespective of population origin, with a common slope of 0. 5. Both absolute and relative brain size, as well as relative telencephalon, optic tectum and cerebellum size, differed significantly among the populations. Further, absolute and relative brain sizes were larger in pond than in marine populations, while the telencephalon tended to be larger in marine than in pond populations. These findings are partly incongruent with previous common garden results. A direct comparison between wild and common garden fish from the same populations revealed a habitat-specific effect: pond fish had relatively smaller brains in a controlled environment than in the wild, while marine fish were similar. All brain parts were smaller in the laboratory than in the wild, irrespective of population origin. Conclusion Our results indicate that variation among populations is large, both in terms of brain size and in the size of separate brain parts in wild <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks.</b> However, the incongruence between the wild and common garden patterns suggests that much of the population variation found in the wild may be attributable to environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity. Given that the brain is among the most plastic organs in general, the results emphasize the view that common garden data are required to draw firm evolutionary conclusions from patterns of brain size variability in the wild. </p...|$|R

It has been proposed that this preference evolved because the choice of males with red coloration confers direct and indirect benefits to females {{in accordance with the}} Fisher-Zahavi model of sexual selection. We present indirect evidence that the preference is an effect of a receiver bias in the perceptual or cognitive system of G. aculeatus for the colour red, which may have arisen in the context of foraging. In laboratory trials, male and female three-spined and <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius) responded most strongly to red objects outside a mating context. This result demonstrates a correlation between a sexually selected trait and an intrinsic attraction to red objects, and supports the sensory-exploitation model for the evolution of red nuptial coloration in three-spined sticklebacks...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius) are {{a species}} of fish which are widely {{distributed}} throughout a range of different habitats. Their expression of different morphological traits and/or body shapes among populations makes them an excellent model to understand mechanisms of phenotypic variation. Currently, there are no recent studies about the morphology of northern German populations {{as well as how}} environmental conditions drive natural selection on phenotypic variation in these populations. In this study divergences in morphological traits and body shape between populations of northern German <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> were investigated. Populations inhabiting an environment with a low predation pressure of piscivorous fish showed a larger body size and a decreased spine-armory in comparison to fish inhabiting an environment with a high predation pressure of piscivorous fish. Moreover, fish from populations exposed to similar environmental conditions showed a higher similarity to each other concerning their morphology than fish, that are located near each other geographically. These results demonstrate that differences in predation pressure, likely caused by sympatric piscivorous fish species, strongly influence morphological and body shape variation between different populations. In addition, the environment seems to have a higher effect on phenotypic variation than geographical distances between populations. Nonetheless, more work is needed to get a better impression about the interaction of environmental conditions affecting phenotypic variation in <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks.</b> A comparison of more populations, inhabiting similar environments with a balanced sex ratio of specimens could be helpful to analyze sexual divergence. Additionally, a precise analysis of differences in food availability and water chemistry could help elucidate the influences of these factors on phenotypic variation.

40|$|Variation in age {{and size}} of mature <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius) within and among 16 Fennoscandian populations were {{assessed}} using skeletochronology. The average age of individuals in a given population varied from 1. 7 to 4. 7 years. Fish from pond populations were on average older than those from lake and marine populations, and females tended to be older than males. Reproduction in marine and lake populations commenced typically at an age of two years, whereas that in ponds at an age of three years. The maximum life span of the fish varied from 3 to 7 years. Mean body size within and among populations increased with increasing age, but the habitat and population differences in body size persisted even after accounting for variation in population age (and sex) structure. Hence, the population differences in mean body size are not explainable by age differences alone. As such, much of the pronounced intraspecific variation in population age structure {{can be attributed to}} delayed maturation and extended longevity of the pond fish. The results are contrasted and discussed in the context of similar data from the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) occupying the same geographic area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Identification {{of genes}} {{involved}} in adaptation and speciation by targeting specific genes of interest {{has become a}} plausible strategy also for non-model organisms. We investigated the potential utility of available sequenced fish genomes to develop microsatellite (cf. simple sequence repeat, SSR) markers for functionally important genes in nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius), as well as cross-species transferability of SSR primers from three-spined (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to nine-spined sticklebacks. In addition, we examined the patterns and degree of SSR conservation between these species using their aligned sequences. Results Cross-species amplification success was lower for SSR markers located in or around functionally important genes (27 out of 158) than for those randomly derived from genomic (35 out of 101) and cDNA (35 out of 87) libraries. Polymorphism was observed at a large proportion (65 %) of the cross-amplified loci independently of SSR type. To develop SSR markers for functionally important genes in nine-spined sticklebacks, SSR locations were surveyed in or around 67 target genes based on the three-spined stickleback genome and these regions were sequenced with primers designed from conserved sequences in sequenced fish genomes. Out of the 81 SSRs identified in the sequenced regions (44, 084 bp), 57 exhibited the same motifs at the same locations as in the three-spined stickleback. Di- and trinucleotide SSRs appeared to be highly conserved whereas mononucleotide SSRs were less so. Species-specific primers were designed to amplify 58 SSRs using the sequences of nine-spined sticklebacks. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that {{a large proportion of}} SSRs are conserved in the species that have diverged more than 10 million years ago. Therefore, the three-spined stickleback genome can be used to predict SSR locations in the <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> genome. While cross-species utility of SSR primers is limited due to low amplification success, SSR markers can be developed for target genes and genomic regions using our approach, which should be also applicable to other non-model organisms. The SSR markers developed in this study should be useful for identification of genes responsible for phenotypic variation and adaptive divergence of <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> populations, as well as for constructing comparative gene maps of nine-spined and three-spined sticklebacks. </p...|$|E
40|$|Body size is an ecologically {{important}} trait {{shown to}} be genetically variable both within and among different animal populations as revealed by quantitative genetic studies. However, few studies have looked into underlying genetic architecture of body size variability in the wild using genetic mapping methods. With the aid of quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses based on 226 microsatellite markers, we mapped body size and growth rate traits in the <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Pungitius pungitius) using an F 2 -intercross (n = 283 offspring) between size-divergent populations. In total, 17 QTL locations were detected. The proportion of phenotypic variation explained by individual body size-related QTL ranged from 3 % to 12 % and those related to growth parameters and increments from 3 % to 10 %. Several of the detected QTL affected either early or late growth. These results provide a solid starting point for more in depth investigations of structure and function of genomic regions involved in determination of body size in this popular model of ecological and evolutionary research...|$|E
40|$|Whether or not baiting {{influences}} stickleback catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) remains {{a matter of}} debate among stickleback researchers: While the opinions about the impact of baiting on CPUE differ, supporting quantitative data are scarce. The effect of baiting and trap type on <b>nine-spined</b> <b>stickleback</b> (Pungitius pungitius) CPUE was studied in a field experiment conducted over four consec-utive days in a small pond in northeastern Finland. The results show that baited traps yielded better (mean CPUE = 1. 24 fish/trap/d) catches than unbaited traps (mean CPUE = 0. 66); however, there were also differences in CPUE {{depending on the type of}} collapsible trap that was used. The trap type effect on CPUE seemed to differ among age classes – the finer meshed trap caught more young-of-the-year fish than the coarse-meshed one, whereas the opposite was true for the older and larger individuals. The results agree with those of an ear-lier more restricted study conducted in the same locality: Together, these results provide strong evidence for the positive impact of baiting on nine-spined stick-leback CPUE...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of environmental complexity on brain {{development has been}} demonstrated {{in a number of}} taxa, but the potential {{influence of}} social environment on neural architecture remains largely unexplored. We investigated experimentally the influence of social environment on the development of different brain parts in geographically and genetically isolated and ecologically divergent populations of <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius). Fish from two marine and two pond populations were reared in the laboratory from eggs to adulthood either individually or in groups. Group-reared pond fish developed relatively smaller brains than those reared individually, but no such difference was found in marine fish. Group-reared fish from both pond and marine populations developed larger tecta optica and smaller bulbi olfactorii than individually reared fish. The fact that the social environment effect on brain size differed between marine and pond origin fish is in agreement with the previous research, showing that pond fish pay a high developmental cost from grouping while marine fish do not. Our results demonstrate that social environment has strong effects {{on the development of the}} stickleback brain, and on the brain's sensory neural centres in particular. The potential adaptive significance of the observed brain-size plasticity is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Social {{animals can}} observe others' {{behavior}} {{and in the}} process acquire information of varying quality about a given resource. Theoretical models predict that blind copying of others' behavior is more likely when individuals are only able to observe the decisions (here "social cues") of others rather than the cues (here "public information") on which such decisions are based. We investigated information use by <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius) in a two-patch foraging context. Social cues were provided by the number of demonstrator fish present at each patch (two versus six), which either conflicted with the demonstrators' observed feeding rate at each patch (public information) or was the only information available. Consistent with predictions, observers preferred the patch previously associated with six demonstrators when social cues were the only available source of information but preferred the patch previously associated with two demonstrators ("rich" patch) when also provided with public information. On the bases of these experiments, we argue that it is because these fish preferentially base decisions on public information rather than social cues that they can potentially avoid engaging in erroneous informational cascades. Thus, the availability of public information can help social animals make adaptive decisions.

40|$|Understanding the {{selective}} forces promoting adaptive population divergence {{is a central}} issue in evolutionary biology. The role of environmental salinity in driving adaptation and evolution in aquatic organisms is still poorly understood. We investigated the relative impacts of habitat type (cf. saltwater vs. freshwater) and geographic area in shaping adaptive population divergence, as well as genes responsible for adaptation to different salinities in <b>nine-spined</b> <b>sticklebacks</b> (Pungitius pungitius). To this end, we employed a hitchhiking mapping approach with 111 microsatellite loci and one insertion/deletion locus including 63 loci situated within or close to genes with important physiological functions such as osmoregulation, growth, and thermal response. Using three pairs of marine and freshwater populations from different geographic areas, we identified several loci showing consistent evidence of being under directional selection in different outlier tests. Analyses of molecular variance at the loci under selection indicated that geographic area rather than habitat type has been acting as a central force in shaping adaptive population divergence. Nevertheless, both outlier tests and a spatial analysis method indicated that two loci (growth hormone receptor 2 and DEAD box polypeptide 56) are involved in adaptation to different habitats, implying that environmental salinity has been affecting them as a selective force. These loci are promising candidates for further investigations focusing on the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to marine and freshwater environments...|$|R
