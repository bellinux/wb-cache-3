On a mountain he finds {{the only place in}} his entire journey where moths are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark <b>nights.</b> <b>He</b> attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.|$|E

5|$|Midway {{through the}} regular season, the team {{announced}} that to avoid injury and preserve Hašek for the playoffs, {{he would not}} play on consecutive <b>nights.</b> <b>He</b> played his first consecutive nights of the season on April 21 and 22 against the Calgary Flames in games 5 and 6 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals. Hašek won both games, clinching the series for Detroit. In the next round against the San Jose Sharks, the Red Wings {{were on the road}} and down two games to one, but Hašek held the Sharks to three goals in the next three games. His 28-save shutout in game six was his 13th in postseason play and sent the Red Wings to the Western Conference finals against the Anaheim Ducks. However, Hašek and the Red Wings lost in six games to the Ducks, who eventually defeated the Ottawa Senators for the Stanley Cup.|$|E

500|$|From the beginning, Crane {{wished to}} show {{how it felt to}} be in a war by writing [...] "a {{psychological}} portrayal of fear." [...] Conceiving his story {{from the point of view}} of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war and then quickly becomes disillusioned by war's reality, Crane borrowed the private's surname, [...] "Fleming", from his sister-in-law's maiden name. [...] He later said that the first paragraphs came to him with [...] "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." [...] Working mostly <b>nights,</b> <b>he</b> wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. [...] Because he could not afford a typewriter, he wrote carefully in ink on legal-sized paper, seldom crossing through or interlining a word. [...] If he did change something, he would rewrite the whole page.|$|E
500|$|An unusually morose James Bond is {{assigned}} sniper duty to help British agent 272 escape from East Berlin. Bond's {{duty is to}} safeguard his crossing into West Berlin by eliminating a top KGB assassin codenamed [...] "Trigger" [...] who has been dispatched to kill him. Bond takes up {{a position on the}} western edge of the border, in a hotel overlooking the no man's land of broken, brightly lit ground that 272 will have to cross. On each of three <b>nights,</b> <b>he</b> sees a female orchestra arrive for rehearsal and leave, taking particular notice of a beautiful blonde cellist. Once 272 starts to cross the border, Bond sees Trigger get in position to kill him and realizes that it is the cellist. He adjusts his aim at the last moment and shoots her rifle instead of killing her, allowing 272 to reach safety.|$|E
500|$|After Oliver {{provided}} a summary account of Davidson's life in London, Barbara Harris gave evidence. [...] Cullen likens her evidence to [...] "a whip of scorpions" [...] that Davidson took {{full in the}} face. [...] Davidson had first met Harris in September 1930, when she was 16. He had used a favoured ploy—affecting to confuse her with a well-known film actress—to persuade her to take a meal with him. He then began regular visits to her lodgings, gave her small sums of money and promised to find her work. From time to time he shared rooms with her: [...] "At first he kept to the chair", Harris wrote, [...] "but {{after the first few}} <b>nights</b> <b>he</b> did not". In her evidence to the court she said she had not had intercourse with Davidson, though he had attempted this on several occasions; when she had repulsed his advances, she claimed that he had [...] "relieved himself".|$|E

500|$|Not all viewers {{were taken}} with Dalton. Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail was entirely dismissive. [...] "The new Bond {{has been widely}} {{described}} in feature stories as {{a throwback to the}} Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), and that may be true, if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit. Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity – Dirtless Harry. You get the feeling that on his off <b>nights,</b> <b>he</b> might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting – he'd try to memorize the jokes – before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved".|$|E
500|$|At the time, Crane was {{intermittently}} {{employed as}} a free-lance writer, contributing articles to various New York City newspapers. He began writing what would become The Red Badge of Courage in June 1893, while living with his older brother Edmund in Lake View, New Jersey. Crane conceived the story {{from the point of}} view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war, only to become disillusioned by war's reality. He took the private's surname, [...] "Fleming," [...] from his sister-in-law's maiden name. He would later relate that the first paragraphs came to him with [...] "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." [...] Working mostly <b>nights,</b> <b>he</b> wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning.

He later moved to New York City, where he completed the novel in April 1894.|$|E
500|$|In 1637 {{fully-fledged}} opera came to Venice {{with the}} opening of the Teatro San Cassiano. Sponsored by the wealthy Tron family, this theatre was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. The theatre's inaugural performance, on 6 March 1637, was L'Andromeda by Francesco Manelli and Benedetto Ferrari. This work was received with great enthusiasm, as was the same pair's La Maga fulminata the following year. In rapid succession three more opera houses opened in the city, as the ruling families of the Republic sought to express their wealth and status by investing in the new musical fashion. At first, Monteverdi remained aloof from these activities, perhaps on account of his age (he was over 70), or perhaps through the dignity of his office as maestro di capella at St. Mark's. Nevertheless, an unidentified contemporary, commenting on Monteverdi's silence, opined that the maestro might yet produce an opera for Venice: [...] "God willing, one of these <b>nights</b> <b>he</b> too will step onto the stage." [...] This remark proved prescient; Monteverdi's first public contribution to Venetian opera came in the 1639–40 carnival season, a revival of his L'Arianna at the Teatro San Moisè.|$|E

500|$|In August 1943 Constantine {{played in}} a charity cricket match at Lord's and had booked rooms for himself, his wife and {{daughter}} at the Imperial Hotel, London for four <b>nights.</b> <b>He</b> had been specifically told that his colour would not be an issue at the hotel. When he arrived on 30 July, he was told that they could only stay for one night because their presence might offend other guests. When Arnold Watson, a colleague of Constantine at the Ministry of Labour, arrived and attempted to intervene, he was told by the manager: [...] "We {{are not going to have}} these niggers in our hotel," [...] and that his presence might offend American guests. Watson argued, to no avail, that not only was Constantine a British subject, he worked for the government. Eventually Watson persuaded Constantine to leave and stay at another hotel which, owned by the same company as the Imperial, proved to be welcoming. [...] The Imperial Hotel incident affected Constantine deeply, both because of the involvement of his family and also because he was due to play cricket for [...] a team representing the British Empire and Commonwealth.|$|E
500|$|His {{next film}} roles, in 1998, were Kissing a Fool, Six Days, Seven Nights, and Apt Pupil. In Kissing a Fool, a romantic comedy, Schwimmer played Max, a dapper, smart-mouthed ladies' man. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Fans of the sitcom Friends may be {{surprised}} by David Schwimmer in Kissing a Fool. [...] Take it from someone who has never seen Friends and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does just fine. As a TV sports reporter in Kissing a Fool, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man". The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. In Six Days, Seven <b>Nights,</b> <b>he</b> played the boyfriend of Anne Heche's character. In Apt Pupil, adapted from a novella {{of the same name}} by Stephen King, he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor. [...] "I was scared of the part", Schwimmer said, [...] "but I {{wanted to be part of}} the movie". At the time, he noted it was a [...] "little frustrating" [...] that people would typecast him due to his role on Friends. He subsequently appeared opposite Woody Allen and Sharon Stone in Alfonso Arau's straight-to-cable comedy Picking Up the Pieces (2000).|$|E
500|$|Macdonald {{comments}} {{that at the}} start of the 20th century Massenet was in the enviable position of having his works included in every season of the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, and in opera houses around the world. From 1900 to his death he led a life of steady work and, generally, success. According to his memoirs, he declined a second offer of the directorship of the Conservatoire in 1905. Apart from composition, his main concern was his home life in the rue de Vaugirard, Paris, and at his country house in Égreville. He was uninterested in Parisian society, and so shunned the limelight that in later life he preferred not to attend his own first <b>nights.</b> <b>He</b> described himself as [...] "a fireside man, a bourgeois artist". The main biographical detail of note of his latter years was his second amitié amoureuse with one of his leading ladies, Lucy Arbell, who created roles in his last operas. Milnes describes Arbell as [...] "gold-digging": her blatant exploitation of the composer's honourable affections caused his wife considerable distress and even strained Massenet's devotion (or infatuation as Milnes characterises it). After the composer's death Arbell pursued his widow and publishers through the law courts, seeking to secure herself a monopoly of the leading roles in several of his late operas.|$|E
