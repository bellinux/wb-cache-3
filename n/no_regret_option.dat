40|$|AIM The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the potential for mitigation of predominantly pluvial flooding in CBDs through retrofitting of such systems. The research used two case study areas to explore the challenges and opportunities for retrofit of SUDS in different cities with varying climate zones, urban design and governmental regimes. The research sought to: a) Evaluate the potential to physically retrofit existing buildings and adjacent paved areas b) Explore the potential for run of reduction and therefore mitigation of associated flood damage c) Examine {{the costs and benefits of}} retrofitting SUDS and identify social and environmental benefits of sustainable drainage for commercial property and the business district. In order to provide information and guidance for surveyors in the emerging area of retrofit of SUDS and provide material to build capacity of surveyors to contribute to improved drainage and flood mitigation for commercial property. METHODOLOGY The research commenced with a systematic literature review to identify the available information on the use and retrofit of SUDS to reduce flood risk. International databases of both academic and industry sources were accessed thereby creating a global picture of examples, together with available tools and guidance likely to be of benefit to the surveying community. Using information drawn from the literature, criteria were developed to determine the technical requirements that determine suitability of roofs and paving areas for retrofit including the position, orientation and location of the building, the roof pitch, weight limitations and ground conditions. Two detailed building databases were then developed for Melbourne, Australia and Newcastle, UK. The databases were compiled drawing on a wide range of sources, including existing commercial and publicly available databases, Google maps and visual inspections. The final building databases contained 526 commercial buildings in Melbourne and 507 commercial buildings in Newcastle. The technical criteria were used to identify those buildings which had the potential to be retrofitted and to estimate the potential for retrofit of permeable paving. A simple estimation method was applied to the data derived from the property databases and available land use data to assess the potential run-off reduction under three scenarios. For the Melbourne dataset a further run-off analysis was carried out on the behalf of the research by the University of Newcastle using a state of the art rainfall inundation model. RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS The most appropriate and well understood SUDS for retrofit in city centre locations are green roofs, permeable paving and rain gardens. Combination of these features into a ‘management train’ or ‘treatment train’ (a linked series of drainage techniques) can increase the attenuation potential of individual features. The evidence base for estimating the direct benefits of SUDS retrofit is rapidly developing. Both academic studies and city-wide assessments have been undertaken. For green roofs, benefits accrue to individual property owners in terms of reduced energy bills owing to the insulating properties of such roofs. The broader stakeholder community also derives benefits from green SUDS installation, such as roofs and rain gardens, some of which are less easily monetised. They include: biodiversity/wildlife habitat; improvements in water and air quality; and attenuation of the urban heat island effect. Green roofs also have a carbon sequestration function. The range of benefits of permeable paving are more limited and relate to stormwater management and water quality. However permeable paving may have a lifecycle cost advantage over other paving systems thereby representing a <b>no</b> <b>regret</b> <b>option</b> for renewal of urban paving. The consideration of the full range of benefits and their applicability from the perspective of actors engaged in the installation of measures is a recent development in the literature and has not yet been explored for commercial property owners and investors. The database analysis of buildings within two city centres revealed that the proportion with potential for retrofit of green roofs is fairly low (under conservative assumptions). Estimation of other surfaces potentially suitable for permeable retrofit in busy business districts also reveals that a large proportion of urban hard surface may be unsuitable for standard permeable paving systems. Estimation of the run off reduction potential for these two cases study areas can be seen to be realistically around 10 - 20...|$|E
50|$|These are, by definition, {{emission}} reduction options that have net negative costs (Markandya et al.., 2001:474-475). The presumption of <b>no</b> <b>regret</b> <b>options</b> affects {{emission reduction}} cost estimates (p. 455).|$|R
50|$|By convention, {{estimates}} of emission reduction costs {{do not include}} the benefits of avoided climate change damages. It can be argued that the existence of <b>no</b> <b>regret</b> <b>options</b> implies that there are market and non-market failures, e.g., lack of information, and that these failures can be corrected without incurring costs larger than the benefits gained. In most cases, studies of the <b>no</b> <b>regret</b> concept have not included all the external and implementation costs of a given policy.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the climate}} change literature, 'no regrets' options are {{responses}} to climate change that deliver net economic benefits, and hence represent a low-risk, attractive strategy for governments, firms or households. These measures are {{sometimes referred to as}} 'win-win' actions, since they deliver multiple benefits simultaneously, namely economic growth as well as climate change objectives. Yet this term is used differently in different contexts, notably in the literatures on adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. In the mitigation literature, <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> <b>options</b> deliver net economic benefits as well as mitigation gains. Their defining characteristic is that their economic benefits outweigh the costs of implementation plus any costs to society, {{even in the absence of}} mitigation payments. In cases where mitigation gains achieved are compensated by the carbon market or public sector incentive schemes, these options would be still more advantageous. In the adaptation literature, <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> <b>options</b> are those that generate net social or economic benefits irrespective of whether or not climate change occurs, as well as across a range of possible climate futures. They build resilience to future climate shocks while also delivering near-term benefits...|$|R
40|$|The risk {{of global}} warming {{is a problem that}} is {{inherently}} international in its character. A solution may require international cooperation on a wide scale, but binding treaties are difficult to negotiate. Moreover, free rider incentives reduce the chances of successful implementation of these accords. Therefore, governments committed to reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases should look for areas where unilateral action may be justified. One such proposed area is the domain of energy efficiency, where improvements would lead to reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. In effect, some economists claim that in imperfect economies, possibilities for costless or profitable improvements in energy efficiency may exist. Policies aimed at realizing this potential have been named <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> options; if there is a potential, then realizing it will be desirable even if global warming, or its related costs, should turn out to be negligible. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine whether such opportunities occur or if they are just fanciful economic debates. In my study of the topic, I found that very little empirical research has been done to establish whether private companies can simultaneously implement energy conservation measures and save money by doing so. During a summer internship with the Center for International Climate and Energy Research-Oslo (CICERO), I generated data on energy efficiency investments by twenty-six Norwegian companies. These data are presented in section IV. My analyses point to a clear majority of profitable investments, thereby supporting the feasibility of <b>no</b> <b>regrets</b> <b>options.</b> It is not obvious why apparently profitable investments are not undertaken. One possibility could be that investments in energy efficiency are extremely risky; that the profitability of the projects is very sensitive to changes in the input variables. I have tested this hypotheses by a sensitivity analyses, but I did not find a clear evidence supporting this theory. Another possible explanation of the "paradox" of under-investment in energy efficiency, is that there may be barriers in the economy, preventing companies from realizing the potential for savings. Section I of the paper gives a brief introduction to the problem {{of global warming}}, and in section II, possible strategies for curbing greenhouse gas emissions are examined. Section IIII describes the potential for improved energy efficiency in the Norwegian economy, and section IV examines the profitability of twenty-six Norwegian companies' investments in energy efficiency measures. Section V describes some of the barriers that may prevent realization of the potential for improved energy efficiency. The paper concludes with a brief comment on possible implications for public policy of the analyses...|$|R
