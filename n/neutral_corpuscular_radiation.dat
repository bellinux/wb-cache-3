40|$|Main {{components}} of <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation</b> contributing to energy deposition (ED in eV/cu cm/s) {{in the atmosphere}} (10 to 100 km) are cosmic ray nuclei (CR - galactic and solar) and high energy electrons (HEE), mainly of magnetospheric origin. Galactic CR depending on solar cycle phase and latitude are dominant source of ED by <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation</b> below 50 to 60 km. Below 20 km secondaries must be assumed. More accurate treatment need assuming of individual HE solar flare particles, cut off rigidities in geomagnetic field and their changes during magnetospheric disturbances. Electrons E sub e greater than 30 keV of magnetospheric origin penetrating to atmosphere contribute to production rate below 100 km especially on night side. High temporal variability, local time dependence and complicated energy spectra lead to complicated structure of electron ED rate. Electrons of MeV energy found at geostationary orbit, pronouncing relation to solar and geomagnetic activity, cause maximum ED at 40 to 60 km.

The increase in global temperature during the past 100 years is in relatively good coincidence with the increase in geomagnetic (corpuscular) activity. It is concluded that it could have been the increase in temperature on the Northern Hemisphere, due to the processes occurring in the auroral oval under enhanced <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation</b> which led to an increased atmospheric concentration of CO 2 in the past.

40|$|Orbital {{evolution}} of spherical interplanetary dust {{particles in the}} Edgeworth-Kuiper belt zone is treated for semimajor axes 30 - 50 AU. Besides solar gravity, also solar electromagnetic and <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation,</b> and, fast interstellar gas flow are important forces influencing motion of the particles. The solar electromagnetic radiation {{is represented by the}} Poynting-Robertson effect and the solar <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation</b> corresponds to the solar wind. Time-variability of the non-radial solar wind can significantly increase dust lifetime in the zone. The average time for the particle stay in the zone is more than 30 -times greater than the conventional case of constant (time independent) radial solar wind offers, for the particles of tens micrometers in size. This holds for the most realistic material properties of the particles: Q̅'_pr = 1, where Q̅'_pr is the dimensionless efficiency factor for electromagnetic radiation pressure. If Q̅'_pr = 1 / 2, then the average time of the particle stay in the zone is only 4 -times the conventional value. The approach used in the paper illustrates the relevance of the solar wind action in comparison with the Poynting-Robertson effect.

40|$|The {{evidence}} for {{interactions between the}} ionosphere and troposphere is reviewed {{as a first step}} in establishing the role of electrical coupling between two regions. Upward processes appear to include the transfer of energy through gravity waves, or through the transmittance of VLF radio waves induced by lightning. In each case, the excitation of the upper atmosphere by tropospheric sources can stimulate feedback processes returning to the troposphere. Downward coupling involves changes in the global and local electrical structure of the atmosphere, and is often induced by solar activity. These effects are more direct and may possibly bypass the stratosphere. The responses in the atmospheric circuit to local changes are nearly instantaneous, and therefore are looked on with promise for possible influences on weather systems.

This shows {{certain aspects of the}} F 2 behaviour. Some of the results of this chapter have been reported in a paper by Gledhill and Williams. The two most important mechanisms thought to be responsible for the Antarctic f₀F 2 behaviour are incoming <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation</b> and horizontal <b>neutral</b> winds. These two mechanisms together with two others (the temperature theory of Torr and Torr and the semi-annual variation of neutral atmospheric density) are discussed in detail in part 2 (Chapters 2 to 4) with a view to discovering which aspects of the f₀F 2 behaviour over Antarctica can be explained by each theory. An attempt is made in Part 3 (Chapters 5 and 6) to explain the observed behaviour by solving the continuity equation of the ionosphere for high-latitude stations. Finally, besides the critical frequency, another parameter of importance in explaining the behaviour in the F 2 region is the height at which the F 2 maximum occurs. This quantity cannot be read directly from an ionogram and it is not an easy quantity to determine.

The solar wind effect {{is more important than the}} action {{of the solar}} electromagnetic radiation, as for the secular orbital evolution. The effect of the solar <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation</b> is more important than the Poynting-Robertson effect even when mass of the dust particle is considered to be constant, non-radial component of the solar wind velocity is neglected and the time dependence of the solar wind properties is ignored. The presented equation of motion of a body under the action of the solar <b>radiation,</b> electromagnetic and <b>corpuscular,</b> respects reality in a much better way than the conventionally used equation. The acceleration of the body is proportional to the superposition of the radial velocity component multiplied by the numerical coefficient [2 + (η_ 1 + η_ 2) / Q '_pr] and the transversal velocity component multiplied by the numerical coefficient (1 + η_ 2 / Q '_pr), where Q '_pr is the dimensionless efficiency factor of the radiation pressure.

40|$|Solar {{noble gases}} in an {{ilmenite}} separate from breccia 79035 (antiquity greater than 1 Ga) {{were analyzed by}} closed system stepped etching (CSSE). All five gases show the familiar two-component structure: first solar-wind (SW) gases are released, followed by gases from solar energetic particles (SEP). Element patterns in 79035 {{are similar to those}} of 71501 ilmenite. SW-He-Ne were partly lost, but SEP-He-Ne-Ar are retained (nearly) unfractionated. Constant Ar/Kr/Xe ratios indicate that ilmenites contain an unfractionated sample of the heavy SW-SEP noble gases. Ar/Kr/Xe ratios in the solar <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation</b> are, however, different from 'solar system' values, whereby the Kr/Xe difference in 79035 is about twice as large as in 71501. We propose that Xe is less fractionated than Kr and Ar, though its first ionization potential (FIP) is higher than the 'cutoff' at approximately 11. 5 eV, above which all elements in SEP are usually assumed to be depleted by a roughly constant factor. SW-Ne may be isotopically slightly heavier in the ancient SW trapped by 79035, as proposed earlier. In this work we extend our previous CSSE studies of solar noble gases including Kr and Xe to a lunar sample irradiated at least 1 Ga ago (breccia 79035, ilmenite separate, 42 - 64 microns). This sample was particularly gently etched in the first steps. Surprisingly, the first three steps, each releasing less than or equal to 0. 5 % of the total 36 -Ar, showed an SEP-like trapped component plus relatively large concentrations of cosmogenic gases. Steps 4 ff contain much less cosmogenic and more solar gas with a SW-like isotope pattern.

In this paper, we revisit the problem by looking closely at the longitudinal behavior of the Sq foci tracks with the question in mind whether the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) influences the Sq current system. The Sq current system is flowing at a 110 -km altitude in the thin ionospheric E-layer and has a double vortex structure, with an anticlockwise (clockwise) whorl in the northern (southern) hemisphere. It is driven by atmospheric tides in the ambient magnetic field of the Earth. These tides are in their turn produced by solar heating of the atmosphere on the sunlit side of the Earth. The interested reader is referred to (Campbell 1989; Olsen 1997; Richmond 1995) for details on the physics behind this current system. The Sq current system is stationary in the Earth-Sun line due to its solar origin with the Earth rotating underneath it. Because of this rotation, one can expect a modulation of Sq by the Earth’s main magnetic field, with its most striking mid-latitude feature being the SAA. The SAA describes a low intensity magnetic field area, which spans from east of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean to South America. The SAA is of great interest to the scientific community as well as to the public because high-intensity solar <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation</b> can penetrate the Earth’s orbit in the SAA region due to the weak main magnetic field. Such penetration can affect or harm the electronic systems of man-made devices such as satellites (Heirtzler 2002).|$|R
