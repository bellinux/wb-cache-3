5|$|In December 2006, GMG Radio {{acquired}} the Saga Radio Group, which owned {{stations in the}} West Midlands, East Midlands and Scotland, and a licence to begin broadcasting to the North East, and expanded the Smooth Network. Along with the Smooth FM stations in London and Manchester, all Saga stations were relaunched under the Smooth Radio brand on 26 March 2007. Saga 105.7 FM in the West Midlands became 105.7 Smooth Radio, Saga 106.6 FM in the East Midlands became 106.6 Smooth Radio and Glasgow based Saga 105.2 FM became 105.2 Smooth Radio. A service for the north-east of England, 97.5 Smooth Radio, was launched in January 2008. To begin with, most programming for these stations was produced locally and some shows were <b>networked</b> from London. However, Smooth gradually increased its <b>networked</b> programming until most content was originated in London or Manchester.|$|E
