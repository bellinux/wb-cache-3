5|$|A {{persistent}} {{shortage of}} coinage {{in all of}} the colonies prompted Massachusetts to establish a mint on May 27, 1652, and begin production of coins from its silver reserves. This act solved a practical problem, but the colony had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> do so from the crown. Although this did not become an issue while Endecott was governor, it eventually became a source of controversy with the crown, and the mint had apparently ceased operations around 1682.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, at age twenty-six, Harrison {{defeated}} Arthur St. Clair Jr., {{the son of}} {{the territorial}} governor, by one vote to become the Northwest Territory's first congressional delegate, and served in the Sixth United States Congress from March 4, 1799, to May 14, 1800. As the Northwest Territory's delegate to Congress, he had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> vote on legislative bills, but he was permitted to serve on a committee, submit legislation, and engage in debate.|$|E
5|$|Between 9:00am and 11:00am, about 100,000people {{gathered}} on the Adam Mickiewicz Square {{in front of the}} Imperial Castle in Poznań, surrounded by buildings occupied by the city and Party authorities and police headquarters. The demonstrators demanded lower food prices, wage increases and the revocation of some recent changes in the law that had eroded workers' conditions. They further requested a visit from Polish Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz, as the local government declared that they had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> solve the problems. Some police officers also joined the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Brooks was {{assigned}} three prominent Minstrel attorneys, {{and after a}} year of sitting on the docket, at about 11 AM on April 15, 1874, Baxter's demurrer to Brook's complaint was suddenly called up. Neither of Baxter's lawyers were present in the court room, and the demurrer had been submitted without their knowledge. Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the new governor of Arkansas, despite having <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|E
5|$|Claiming the General Assembly's {{decision}} was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising {{the authority of}} the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor's mansion. The suits were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court, which claimed it had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution, an outcome that favored Beckham. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|In 1059 {{the same}} papal bull that {{restricted}} suffrage to the cardinals also recognised {{the authority of}} the Holy Roman Emperor (at the time Henry IV), but only as a concession made by the pope, declaring that the Holy Roman Emperor had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> intervene in elections except where permitted to do so by papal agreements. Pope Gregory VII (in office 1073-1085) was the last Pope to submit to the interference of the Holy Roman Emperors. The breach between him and the Holy Roman Empire caused by the Investiture Controversy led to the abolition of the Emperor's role. In 1122 the Holy Roman Empire acceded to the Concordat of Worms, accepting the papal decision.|$|E

5|$|In October 1867, {{an agent}} for Swift & Co. {{negotiated}} a deal with Peru to purchase Catawba and her sister for a million dollars apiece. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that the company could repurchase the pair if it refunded the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the appraised value would be accepted. The ship was appraised at $375,000 and sold for that amount, possibly after a rigged bid, on 11 April 1868.|$|E
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> provide for expatriation.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} and {{powers of the}} Indiana General Assembly are established in the state constitution. The General Assembly has sole legislative power within the state government. Each house can initiate legislation, with the exception that the Senate is not permitted to initiate legislation that will affect revenue. Bills are debated and passed separately in each house, but must be passed by both houses before they can submitted to the governor. Each law passed by the General Assembly must be applied uniformly to the entire state; the General Assembly has <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> create legislation that targets only a particular community.|$|E

5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass a budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E
5|$|The GAO {{released}} its investigation report on 12 November 1997. The investigation {{determined that the}} USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. The GAO report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to report their contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS {{as required by the}} ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated that Martin had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The GAO report added that the failure of Wickson and May to report their contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.|$|E
5|$|In May 1796, Kentucky's gubernatorial electors convened {{to choose}} Shelby's successor. Their votes were split among four candidates; frontiersman Benjamin Logan {{received}} 21 votes, Baptist minister James Garrard received 17, Thomas Todd received 14, and Breckinridge's cousin, Senator John Brown, received 1. The Kentucky Constitution {{did not specify}} whether a plurality or a majority was required for election, but the electors held a runoff vote. Most of Todd's supporters voted for Garrard, and he won the election. Breckinridge claimed he had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> intervene but declared that, as a private citizen, he believed Logan should be governor. The state senate was authorized to settle disputed elections, but they, too, refused to intervene. Breckinridge resigned as attorney general on November 30, 1797; {{the extension of the}} attorney general's duties to include representing the state in federal district court as well as the Kentucky Court of Appeals, and reluctance to serve under Garrard after publicly declaring he had no right to his office {{may have contributed to the}} decision. A month later, he declared his candidacy to fill a vacancy in the Fayette County delegation to the Kentucky House of Representatives. Of the 1,323 votes cast, he garnered 594 (45%), the most of any of the six candidates in the race.|$|E

5|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22, 1810; it was debated whether the viceroy should {{continue}} in office, and if not, who should replace him. The first opinion was from Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, who held that Cisneros should continue and that, if all of Spain was conquered by France, peninsulars were meant to rule in the Americas. Castelli made a counter-argument, based on {{the doctrine of the}} retroversion of the sovereignty of the people that he had already employed in the defense of Paroissien. He insisted that {{in the absence of a}} legitimate authority, sovereignty should be returned to the people; they should govern themselves. The idea of dismissing the viceroy ultimately prevailed, but as Buenos Aires had <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> decide unilaterally the new form of government, they would elect a provisional government. A congress of deputies called from all other cities would take the final decision. However, there were disputes over who should exercise the provisional government: some argued that the Cabildo should do so, and others that it should be a Junta. Castelli bowed to Saavedra's proposal to form a Junta, but with the proviso that the procurator of the Cabildo, Julián de Leiva, had a decisive vote in the appointment. By adding this proviso, Castelli sought to add the former supporters of Martín de Álzaga, such as Mariano Moreno, Domingo Matheu, and Leiva himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} An-2s {{had observed}} the attack {{from a distance}} and managed to escape without damage. Four Hmongs, two men and two women, {{had been killed by}} the communist attack. Nevertheless, the TSQ-81 radar and its associated equipment was undamaged. Shortly afterwards, what remained of one of the An-2 biplanes was put on display in front of the That Luang Monument, Vientiane’s most important Buddhist shrine, as proof of North Vietnamese military activities in the kingdom. Despite the attack, the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane and the USAF refused to alter their strategy for defending Lima Site 85. Lieutenant-Colonel Clarence F. Blanton, commander of USAF personnel at the facility, was given <b>no</b> <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> supervise his own perimeter or to order a retreat if they again came under attack. Throughout January and February, intelligence collected by the Hmongs confirmed that a major assault on Lima Site 85 was being prepared, but Sullivan and the U.S. military took no steps to strengthen the defenses. In late February, a Combat Controller, Technical Sergeant James Gary, arrived to augment the defenses by directing air strikes. He was replaced in this duty by Sergeant Roger D. Huffman on about 4 March.|$|E
