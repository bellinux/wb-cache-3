People with milk allergies may {{still need to}} avoid butter, which contains enough of the allergy-causing proteins to cause reactions. Whole milk, butter and cream {{have high levels of}} saturated fat. Butter is a good source of Vitamin A.|$|E

25|$|A's {{labor costs}} {{were higher than}} those of most competitors. Because A stopped growing, a rising {{percentage}} of its workers were making higher wages due to their seniority. This was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> most of A's competitors because they were rapidly expanding and had relatively fewer workers with high seniority. To offset higher labor costs, A tried to operate stores with fewer employees, resulting in long lines at checkouts and empty shelves.|$|E

They thrive and spread most rapidly with temperatures above 30°C (90°F), so some areas with only occasional days that are hot rarely {{have a problem with}} wax moths, unless the colony is already weak due to stress from other factors.|$|E

25|$|Many {{teachers}} and school districts oppose the idea of homeschooling. However, {{research has shown that}} homeschooled children often excel in many areas of academic endeavor. According to a study done on the homeschool movement, homeschoolers often achieve academic success and admission into elite universities. There is also evidence that most are remarkably well socialized. According to the National Home Education Research Institute president, Brian Ray, socialization is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> homeschooling children, many of whom are involved in community sports, volunteer activities, book groups, or homeschool co-ops.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{are typically}} made by cell culture that involves fusing myeloma cells with mouse spleen cells immunized with the desired antigen. Rabbit B-cells {{can be used}} to form a rabbit hybridoma. Polyethylene glycol is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes, but the success rate is low, so a selective medium in which only fused cells can grow is used. This is possible because myeloma cells have lost the ability to synthesize hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), an enzyme necessary for the salvage synthesis of nucleic acids. The absence of HGPRT is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> these cells unless the de novo purine synthesis pathway is also disrupted. Exposing cells to aminopterin (a folic acid analogue, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, DHFR), makes them unable to use the de novo pathway and become fully auxotrophic for nucleic acids, thus requiring supplementation to survive.|$|E
25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple {{way to do this is}} to put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement along the length of the tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> a purely experimental machine, and there are ways to reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Legislative Council elections, {{the biggest}} problem facing the WAYL and the Mambii Party {{was the lack of}} {{suffrage}} for many of their supporters. Property and literacy requirements for voting were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> the elite, but they were for Thompson's supporters. To combat this deficiency, the league employed some legal and illegal practices to make sure his supporters would be able to cast their vote. In one practice, the supporters who lacked suffrage were given fraudulent town council receipts, which stated their eligibility to vote. They were also given campaign badges for the opposing candidate to avoid possible discrimination at the polls, as election officials were against the Mambii party and the WAYL. The government and social elite were outraged after Thompson was declared the winner of the election. F. V. Nanka-Bruce, a representative in the Legislative Council, filed a petition against the election return and won his appeal a year later.|$|E

The deleted scenes included on the DVD were originally featured on the official Parks and Recreation website after the episode aired. In one of them, Tom talks about changing his name {{because he thought it}} sounded too foreign for politics, although he admits this was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> U.S. President Barack Obama.

The Jaffa to Jerusalem railway, with connections northwards to Damascus and Istanbul, had a line branching southwards to El Tineh which branched again to Gaza and Beersheba. These lines could still be used to transport supplies and reinforcements quickly and efficiently to the Ottoman Army's front line. Indeed, a general strengthening of resistance along the Wadi Sukereir line was concentrated around Qastina, towards which the 2nd Light Horse Brigade advanced, capturing a refugee column between Suafir and Qastina.|$|E
