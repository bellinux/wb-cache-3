5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the {{deregulation of the}} market in 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have free competition, since <b>no</b> <b>new</b> airlines could establish themselves and <b>no</b> <b>new</b> international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E
