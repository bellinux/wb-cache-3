Six trends related to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bovine dairy <b>holdings</b> and their bovine population were analysed in the study.

50|$|Sybil married first Pain fitzJohn, a {{marriage}} that took place around 1115. Through Sybil, Pain acquired a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> around Ludlow Castle, as well as control of the castle itself. Ludlow was an important strategic stronghold which controlled part of the Welsh Borders. Sybil also brought her husband lands in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire. Both King Henry I and King Stephen recognized Pain's right to his wife's lands. Sybil had inherited lands that originally had been held by her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy, the son of Roger de Lacy. Roger de Lacy had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties in Normandy. Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy, and pressed his claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow notes that there was uncertainty hanging over the inheritance, and accounted for one reason why Sybil's husband worked to secure more lands around Ludlow. Sybil {{was not the only}} recipient of Hugh de Lacy's lands; some went to Josce de Dinan and some to Miles of Gloucester.|$|E

The projected pattern of structural change shows a continuing decline in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> involved in each enterprise sector and an increasing concentration on larger holdings.
