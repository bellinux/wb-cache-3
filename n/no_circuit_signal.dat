40|$|As a main {{interference}} {{to track}} <b>circuit</b> <b>signal,</b> the interference of the traction current(ITC) will directly influence the transmission quality of track <b>circuit</b> <b>signal</b> and even lead to signal distortion which would endanger the traffic safety. The ITC has a complicated formation mechanism {{and it is}} affected by factors of train compositions, load and running speed, so it is hardly possible to establish accurate mathematical analytic model of ITC. This paper has analyzed the probability distribution characteristics of the ITC extracted from real train operating data collected by the cab signal system. A method using Kolmogorov– Smirnov (K-S) test and least square approximation has been proposed to establish the probability distribution model of the ITC. Feasibility and applicability have been confirmed by examples. The probability distribution model of the ITC has a significant importance for analyzing track <b>circuit</b> <b>signals</b> especially for interference signal simulation...|$|R

5000|$|In {{electronic}} <b>circuits,</b> <b>signal</b> velocity is {{one member}} {{of a group of}} five closely related parameters. In these <b>circuits,</b> <b>signals</b> are usually treated as operating in [...] TEM (Transverse ElectroMagnetic) mode. That is, the fields are perpendicular to the direction of transmission and perpendicular to each other. Given this presumption, the quantities: signal velocity, the product of dielectric constant and magnetic permeability, characteristic impedance, inductance of a structure, and capacitance of that structure, are all related such that if you know any two, you can calculate the rest. In a uniform medium if the permeability is constant, then variation of the signal velocity will be dependent only on variation of the dielectric constant.|$|R
