The analyses were based on four reference categories: 1) types of research; 2) formal standardization; 3) the type of methodological models; 4) the writers’ level of training. The goal is to identify the level of professionalization in specialized studies in journalism, highlighting the types of research and manuals, theoretical influences, and prevailing methodological methods. The main results highlight the predominance of doctoral writers and empirical research. We also <b>noticed</b> a lack <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> to formal standardization...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the self-reported degree <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> to treatment {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF), investigating associations with characteristics {{of the disease and}} with the degree <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> perceived by health professionals. Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional study involving patients with CF monitored at a Program for Adults with CF. The degree <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> was evaluated using a questionnaire. Patients were divided into two groups: greater degree <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> and moderate/poor degree <b>of</b> <b>adherence.</b> Clinical data, Shwachman-Kulczycki clinical score, Brasfield radiographic score and spirometry data were obtained for all patients. Results: Out of 38 patients studied, 31 (81. 6 %) were classified as presenting a greater degree <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> and 7 (18. 4 %) as presenting a moderate/poor degree <b>of</b> <b>adherence.</b> The self-reported patient adherence score correlated with the clinical score (r = − 0. 36, p = 0. 028).

40|$|Aims In {{order to}} measure the {{effectiveness}} of interventions claiming to improve adherence in diabetes, valid measurement <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> is necessary. Any measurement must first {{be based on a}} definition. This study aimed to identify and categorize definitions and measurements <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> in living with diabetes, from a review of the literature. Methods Publications were identified from the MEDLINE database. Adherence, compliance and concordance were used as terms in the search algorithm, along with diabetes, diabetes mellitus and treatment. Two hundred and ninety-three papers were identified. Abstracts of these papers were read by two researchers independently. Two hundred and thirty-nine papers did not contain definitions or measures <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> and were discarded. Of the remaining 54 papers, 26 included definitions and 46 described measurements <b>of</b> <b>adherence.</b> Results Definitions and measurements fell into five categories: coincidence of behaviour with professional advice, relationship as {{part of the process of}} care, outcome and process targets, taking the medication as prescribed and others. No single definition <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> emerged. Many authors did not provide definitions <b>of</b> <b>adherence.</b> Glycated haemoglobin was the most common measurement <b>of</b> <b>adherence,</b> although this can raise problems. Conclusion Research which claims to show an intervention has, or has not, improved adherence must be interpreted cautiously. Interventions which appear to fail may actually succeed in aspects <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> which were not defined or measured in the study. Clinicians and researchers could use clear definitions and measurements, such as the ones presented in this review. ...|$|R
40|$|Through {{a review}} <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> {{literature}} and thirty qualitative interviews, a theoretical view <b>of</b> the <b>adherence</b> {{process has been}} created which enables {{an understanding of the}} process from initial awareness of need through to post-consumption assessment. This view is proposed to answer the research question, what is adherence from a process perspective? It builds on Service-Dominant Logic to theorise the act <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> for the first time. In this it views adherence as a complex relationship of interacting service (eco) systems. This takes the theoretical understanding <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> beyond existing theories and models and into the act of consumption itself, thus providing theoretical visibility of the end-to-end process <b>of</b> <b>adherence.</b> The literature review and qualitative research identified six factors <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> and three rules governing the adherence process. Perhaps surprisingly, interviews found little difference in causes of non-adherence between developed and developing worlds. A quantitative survey operationalised these adherence factors and rules through the development of a quantitative process <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> derived from the qualitative process. However, due to survey limitations this research provided no additional insights. A new viewpoint on adherence is advanced. This considers adherence as a single act and therefore as an individual opportunity to be adherent. This permits a greater focus on the enablers and inhibitors <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> at a point in time rather than it being averaged over many acts in different situations. It also includes a discussion of managerial implications, proposals for future research, and thoughts on research limitations...|$|R

One measurement <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> was obtained via pill counts remaining compared to a novel definition for adherence using serum 25 -hydroxy-vitamin D (25 -OH-D) levels (absolute change in 25 (OH) D over the study period and the subject&# 39;s steady-state variation in their 25 (OH) D levels). A multivariate logistic regression model examined whether mean percent adherence by pill count {{was significantly associated with}} the adherence measure by serum metabolite levels. Results.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAdherence {{rates for}} chronic {{pediatric}} conditions are approximately 50 %. The primary {{objective of the}} study was to assess rates <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> using four different measurement methods for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). MethodsParticipants included 37  children with CF between 6 and 13  years of age and their primary caregivers. Adherence measures included parent and child self-reports, diary data, pharmacy refill history, and electronic monitors. ResultsResults suggested that rates <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> varied by treatment component and across measurement methods. However, when examining more objective measures, rates <b>of</b> overall <b>adherence</b> were below 50 % for children with CF, indicating generally poor adherence to the treatment regimen. For example, rates <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> to enzyme medications, using electronic and diary measures, ranged from 27 % to 46 %. ConclusionsThe multi-method measurement approach provided unique information regarding rates <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> for each disease condition by type of treatment component.

40|$|Background: Despite {{the boom}} in new technologically based {{interventions}} for people with psychosis, recent studies suggest medium to low rates <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> to these types of interventions. The benefits will be limited if {{only a minority of}} service users adhere and engage; if specific predictors <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> can be identified then technologies can be adapted to increase the service user benefits. Objective: The study aimed to present a systematic review <b>of</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>adherence,</b> dropout, and approaches to analyzing adherence to newly developed mobile and Web-based interventions for people with psychosis. Specific predictors <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> were also explored. Methods: Using keywords (Internet or online or Web-based or website or mobile) AND (bipolar disorder or manic depression or manic depressive illness or manic-depressive psychosis or psychosis or schizophr* or psychotic), the following databases were searched: OVID including MedLine, EMBASE and PsychInfo, Pubmed and Web of Science. The objectives and inclusion criteria for suitable studies were defined following PICOS (population: people with psychosis; intervention: mobile or Internet-based technology; comparison group: no comparison group specified; outcomes: measures of adherence; study design: randomized controlled trials (RCT), feasibility studies, and observational studies) criteria. In addition to measurement and analysis <b>of</b> <b>adherence,</b> two theoretically proposed predictors <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> were examined: (1) level of support from a clinician or researcher throughout the study, and (2) level of service user involvement in the app or intervention development. We provide a narrative synthesis of the findings and followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews. Results: Of the 20 studies that reported a measure <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> and a rate of dropout, 5 of these conducted statistical analyses to determine predictors of dropout, 6 analyzed the effects <b>of</b> specific <b>adherence</b> predictors (eg, symptom severity or type of technological interface) on the effects of the intervention, 4 administered poststudy feedback questionnaires to assess continued use of the intervention, and 2 studies evaluated the effects of different types <b>of</b> interventions on <b>adherence.</b> Overall, the percentage of participants adhering to interventions ranged from 28 - 100 % with a mean <b>of</b> 83 %. <b>Adherence</b> was greater in studies with higher levels of social support and service user involvement {{in the development of the}} intervention. Studies of shorter duration also had higher rates <b>of</b> <b>adherence.</b> Conclusions: Adherence to mobile and Web-based interventions was robust across most studies. Although 2 studies found specific predictors of nonadherence (male gender and younger age), most did not specifically analyze predictors. The duration of the study may be an important predictor <b>of</b> <b>adherence.</b> Future studies should consider reporting a universal measure <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> and aim to conduct complex analyses on predictors <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> such as level of social presence and service user involvementpublishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Several {{previous}} studies have shown relationships between adherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the viral load, the CD 4 cell count, or mortality. However, the impact <b>of</b> variability in <b>adherence</b> to ART on the immunovirological response {{does not seem to}} have been investigated yet. Methods: Monthly adherence data (November 1999 to April 2009) from 317 HIV- 1 infected patients enrolled in the Senegalese ART initiative were analyzed. Latent-class trajectory models were used to build typical trajectories for the average adherence and the standardized variance <b>of</b> <b>adherence.</b> The relationship between the standardized variance <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> and each <b>of</b> the change in CD 4 cell count, the change in viral load, and mortality were investigated using, respectively, a mixed linear regression, a mixed logistic regression, and a Cox model with time-dependent covariates. All the models were adjusted on the average adherence. Results: Three latent trajectories for the average adherence and three for the standardized variance <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> were identified. The increase in CD 4 cell count and the increase in the percentage of undetectable viral loads were negatively associated with the standardized variance <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> but positively associated with the average <b>adherence.</b> The risk <b>of</b> death decreased significantly with the increase in the average adherence but increased significantly with the increase of the standardized variance <b>of</b> <b>adherence.</b> Conclusions: The impacts of the level and the variability <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> on the immunovirological response and survival justify the inclusion of these aspects into the process <b>of</b> patient education: <b>adherence</b> should be both high and constant...|$|R

40|$|Functional bowel {{disorders}} such as irritable bowel syndrome {{are commonly}} experienced within the population, and have an adverse impact on emotions, physical well-being, social activity, and occupational output. Adherence to a restricted diet can reduce symptoms, which in turn leads to increased {{quality of life and}} well-being. The aim of this review was to assess the extent to which predictors <b>of</b> dietary <b>adherence</b> have been considered in studies relating to functional bowel disorders and following a restricted diet. This was done firstly by examining such studies which contained a measure or indicator <b>of</b> <b>adherence,</b> and then by examining predictors <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> within and between studies. A search of PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was performed during July 2014, with the search criteria including relevant terms such as gastrointestinal disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, diet, and <b>adherence.</b> <b>Of</b> an initial 7927 papers, 39 were suitable for inclusion.

40|$|Objective: To {{summarize}} rates <b>of</b> supplement <b>adherence</b> {{in youth}} with {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) and to identify predictors and outcomes <b>of</b> supplement <b>adherence.</b> Methods: 49 adolescents (ages 11 - 18) participated. Youth completed six monthly assessments <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> and supplement knowledge. Youth and parents completed questionnaires. Medical record reviews provided medical and laboratory data. Results: Mean supplement adherence rates ranged from 32 % to 44 %. Predictors <b>of</b> supplement <b>adherence</b> included higher knowledge (for multivitamin, iron, and calcium adherence) higher family involvement (for iron and calcium adherence), and greater inflammation (via a hematological index) for multivitamin adherence. Few relationships between supplement adherence and inflammation, growth, or nutritional outcomes were found. Conclusion: Supplement adherence is problematic in pediatric IBD, and predictors <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> tended to be psychosocial rather than biological variables. Future research with larger sample sizes and assessments <b>of</b> supplement <b>adherence</b> that do not rely solely on patient self-report are important next steps...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{implement}} a pain management algorithm {{in intensive care}} units (ICU) and to evaluate nurses’ level <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> with the algorithm. Background: Many ICU patients experience pain. Therefore, an evidence-based algorithm for pain management was developed. Methods: A pain management algorithm was implemented in three units over three weeks. Nurses’ level <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> with the algorithm and associations between level <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> and patient and unit characteristics over 22 weeks were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis. Results: Nurses’ level <b>of</b> <b>adherence</b> was 74. 6 %. Adherence rates were lower on the evening and night shifts compared to the day shift. Males were assessed significantly less frequently than females. Patients with “injury, poisoning, or certain other consequences of external causes” were assessed significantly less frequently than patients with “diseases of the respiratory system. ” Conclusions: ICU nurses can use a pain management algorithm consistently. Findings from {{this study suggest that}} a pain management algorithm is a useful tool to increase ICU nurses’ adherence with pain assessment...|$|R
