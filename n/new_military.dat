5|$|After {{the early}} 20th century, few fortifications {{were built in}} Malta. However, <b>new</b> <b>military</b> {{installations}} such as airfields began {{to be built in}} World War I, when the seaplane base of RAF Kalafrana and the airfield at Marsa were built. More airfields were built in the interwar period and the Second World War, including RAF Hal Far, RAF Ta Kali, RAF Luqa, RAF Safi, RAF Krendi and Ta' Lambert Airfield.|$|E
5|$|First rescue efforts {{came from}} {{surviving}} neighbours and co-workers who pulled and dug out victims from buildings. The initial informal response was soon joined by surviving policemen, firefighters and military personnel {{who began to}} arrive, as did anyone with a working vehicle; cars, trucks and delivery wagons of all kinds were enlisted to collect the wounded. A flood of victims soon began {{to arrive at the}} city's hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The <b>new</b> <b>military</b> hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1400 victims on 6 December.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said Japan {{wanted to}} shed the passiveness it has {{maintained}} {{since the end}} of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Abe said Japan wanted to play a key role and offered neighboring countries Japan's support. In recent years, they have been engaged in international peacekeeping operations including the UN peacekeeping. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society. <b>New</b> <b>military</b> guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.|$|E

5|$|In early 1861 after Texas {{voted to}} secede from the United States and join the Confederacy, Ross's brother Peter began {{recruiting}} men for a <b>new</b> <b>military</b> company. Shortly after Ross enlisted in his brother's company as a private, Governor Edward Clark requested he instead proceed immediately to the Indian Territory to negotiate treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes so they would not help the Union Army. One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley, Ross {{set out for the}} Indian Territory. Upon reaching the Washita Agency, he discovered the Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1060, Giáp Đồng natives under the {{frontier}} prefectural leader Thàn Thiệu Thái—an imperial in-law to the Lý court through marriage alliance—raided the Song frontier for cattle and militia recruits. He succeeded in taking the Song military leader Yang Baocai hostage, and in autumn of 1060 Song troops were sent into the frontier to rescue the general {{but he was not}} found. The Song court appointed Yu Jing (余靖; 1000–1064) as a <b>new</b> <b>military</b> commissioner of the Guangnan region and charged him with the task of quelling the unrest caused by Thàn Thiệu Thái. Yu Jing also sent an agent to Champa to enlist Cham aid against the Song's enemies in Guangnan.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania regained its {{independence}} on February 16, 1918 {{and the old}} fortress was placed under engineering staff supervision. Those materials {{that had not been}} taken by the Germans were used to resupply Lithuanian military needs, and for the construction of the armored train Gediminas, named after the 14th century Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas. In 1920, the Kaunas Fortress Board was formed and charged with the task of administering the fortress. Due to the development of <b>new</b> <b>military</b> technologies, its reconstruction was seen as a vast and inappropriate expense. The fortress' armament was dismantled and the trenches were filled with scrap iron.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1964, {{a series}} of {{in-depth}} discussions took place between the governments of France and Great Britain on prospective collaborative military aviation programs; these involved talks between Handel Davies, the co-chairman of an Anglo-French committee, and his French counterpart, Ingénieur-General Lecamus, negotiating the launch of two <b>new</b> <b>military</b> combat aircraft. According to these negotiations, the French would take the lead role in developing a new light ground-attack/trainer, while the British was to assume the leadership of a multirole fighter project. This multirole aircraft was to be equipped with a variable geometry wing and was intended to perform the strike, reconnaissance, and interceptor roles.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Nanking had not {{led to the}} {{surrender}} of the Nationalist Government as Matsui had predicted and the war with China continued. Undeterred, Matsui began planning out <b>new</b> <b>military</b> operations in places like Xuzhou and Zhejiang Province soon after he had returned to Shanghai. The other big task occupying his time in January and February 1938 was his plan {{to establish a new}} Chinese government in Central China. Matsui was bound and determined to press forward with his ambition to found a new regime to rival Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government, and though he did not finish the job before leaving office, the Reformed Government of the Republic of China would eventually come into being in March 1938. However, the leaders of Japan's Army General Staff showed scant interest in his plan to create a new government in China and they also repeatedly refused to approve any <b>new</b> <b>military</b> campaigns under his command. By the beginning of February Matsui was contemplating suicide to protest their lack of enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of distributed element filters was {{spurred on by}} the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World WarII. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these <b>new</b> <b>military</b> systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology {{can be found in}} several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes.|$|E

5|$|The {{reception}} of The Desert Fox in Britain was enthusiastic: the book went through eight editions in a year. Young's biography was another {{step in the}} development of the Rommel myth, with Rommel emerging as an active, if not a leading, plotter. Speidel contributed as well, starting, from the early 1950s, to bring up Rommel's and his own role in the plot, thus boosting Speidel's suitability for a future role in the <b>new</b> <b>military</b> force of the Federal Republic, the Bundeswehr, and then in NATO.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{dispute about}} whether this <b>new</b> <b>military</b> {{structure}} was put into place under the Emperor Diocletian or Constantine since both reorganised the Roman Army in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries to some degree. Both Diocletian and even his predecessor of thirty years Gallienus may already have controlled mobile strategic reserves to assist the empire's border forces; either Diocletian or Constantine expanded this nascent force into permanent field armies.|$|E
5|$|With his {{finances}} {{securing the}} maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official courier system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the praefectus vehiculorum. Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country. In the year 6 Augustus established the aerarium militare, donating 170 million sesterces to the <b>new</b> <b>military</b> treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.|$|E
