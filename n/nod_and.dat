25|$|A {{night vision}} device (NVD), {{also known as}} night optical/observation device (<b>NOD)</b> <b>and</b> night vision goggles (NVG), is an {{optoelectronic}} device that allows images to be produced in levels of light approaching total darkness. The image may be a conversion to visible light of both visible light and near-infrared, while by convention detection of thermal infrared is denoted thermal imaging. The image produced is typically monochrome, e.g. shades of green. NVDs are most often used by the military and law enforcement agencies, but are available to civilian users. The term usually refers to a complete unit, including an image intensifier tube, a protective and generally water-resistant housing, and some type of mounting system. Many NVDs also include optical components such as a sacrificial lens, or telescopic lenses or mirrors. An NVD may have an IR illuminator, making it an active as opposed to passive night vision device.|$|E
25|$|On September 10, 2012 during Raw at the Bell Centre in Montreal, {{not long}} after {{defeating}} CM Punk and Dolph Ziggler in a tag-team match with Randy Orton, Lawler legitimately collapsed at the announcers table while Kane and Daniel Bryan competed against The Prime Time Players. Fellow commentator Michael Cole continued to call that match alone, {{as well as the}} next match, before WWE (through Cole) announced the medical situation with Lawler. The remaining matches on the show went ahead as scheduled but without commentary, and updates on Jerry's condition were provided by Cole. At the end of the broadcast, it was announced that he had received CPR, but was breathing independently and reacting to stimulation. It was later confirmed on WWE.com that Lawler had suffered a heart attack. On September 11, 2012, he underwent an angioplasty to improve blood flow to his heart. On September 12, 2012, Lawler was reported to be slowly being eased off sedation, his ventilator removed. He was able to blink, <b>nod,</b> <b>and</b> squeeze with his hands, and that same day, the results of several CT scans showed no signs of brain damage. By September 17, Lawler had returned to his home in Memphis. During Lawler's hospital stay, it was determined that his heart attack was not caused by a blocked artery, but was instead an unexplained cardiac arrest. Lawler was soon medically cleared to continue wrestling.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe cytosolic sensors <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> Toll-like receptors (TLRs) {{activate}} defense signaling pathways {{in response}} to microbial stimuli. However, the role of <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> their interplay with TLRs during systemic bacterial infection remains poorly understood. Here, we report that macrophages or mice made insensitive to TLRs by previous exposure to microbial ligands remained responsive to <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 stimulation. Furthermore, <b>Nod</b> 1 - <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 -mediated signaling and gene expression are enhanced in TLR-tolerant macrophages. Further analyses revealed that innate immune responses induced by bacterial infection relied on <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> their adaptor RICK in macrophages pretreated with TLR ligands but not in naive macrophages. In addition, bacterial clearance upon systemic infection with L.  monocytogenes was critically dependent on <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 when mice were previously stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or E. coli. Thus, <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 are important for microbial recognition and host defense after TLR stimulation...|$|R

40|$|<b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 (nucleotide-binding {{oligomerization}} domain-containing proteins 1 and 2) {{are related}} innate immune receptors responsible for initiating {{a response to}} bacterial infection. They belong to a class of receptors known as Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), which are germline encoded immune receptors that mediate various innate immune responses. These receptors recognize conserved microbial motifs known as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). The PRR-PAMP paradigm forms the bedrock of how innate immunity is understood today. As two of the first intracellular PRRs discovered, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 came to define an entire subclass of PRRs, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs). PRRs relay their signals through protein:protein interaction motifs that typically adopt a characteristic Death Domain (DD) fold. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signal through their respective CAspase Recruitment Domains (CARDs), which {{are part of a}} DD subfamily. The CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 interact with multiple downstream effectors and are thus situated at a key point for regulation <b>and</b> coordination of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signaling. To better understand this regulation, I structurally and functionally characterized interactions made by the CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2. Receptor Interacting Protein kinase 2 (RIP 2) is an effector of both <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 that activates the NF-ΚB pathway to elicit an inflammatory response. I discovered a new binding interaction between the CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 <b>and</b> ubiquitin. Furthermore, I elucidated a role for this interaction by showing that ubiquitin binds <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 CARDs competitively with the CARD of RIP 2. Through biophysical and biochemical investigation, I identified mutants of NOD 1 CARD that did not bind ubiquitin and were thus insensitive to its competitive effect on RIP 2 binding. Utilizing this mutant in functional studies defined ubiquitin as a negative regulator of NOD 1 signaling. Characterizing NOD 1 allowed rational design of mutations that uncovered a similar role for ubiquitin in the NOD 2 pathway. This introduces the potential for broader application of these findings in other DD-mediated pathways. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 also bind the autophagy protein ATG 16 L. I investigated the molecular mechanisms of this interaction <b>and</b> found that <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 bind ATG 16 L through their CARDs. I also found that the domain on ATG 16 L responsible for binding <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 is the C-terminal WD 40 Β-propeller. Furthermore, the CARD:Β-propeller interaction is sufficient to mediate interaction between NOD 1 or <b>NOD</b> 2 <b>and</b> ATG 16 L. The finding that the ATG 16 L Β-propeller also binds ubiquitin leaves open the possibility that ubiquitin regulates pathway selection by <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2. Together, these studies advance our understanding of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signaling <b>and</b> lay the groundwork for further mechanistic investigations into coordination of inflammatory and autophagic signaling pathways by the immune system in general...|$|R
2500|$|Megan Lehmann, {{writing in}} The Hollywood Reporter, {{said that the}} film [...] "defies {{all but the most}} cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling", and it is [...] "much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a <b>nod</b> <b>and</b> a wink to {{accompany}} the requisite Aussie clichés", {{and the bottom line is}} [...] "In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must confess that I might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{mononuclear cell}} expression {{and function of}} the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing receptors, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2, in very preterm and full-term infants. Methods: <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 gene <b>and</b> protein expression in very preterm infants, term infants and healthy adult, cord and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (C/PBMC) were quantified using qPCR and flow cytometry. Cytokine responses of purified infant and adult monocytes to <b>NOD</b> 1 - <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 -specific agonists were assessed using a multiplex immunoassay (Bioplex). Results: <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 were expressed by a range of infant and adult mononuclear cell types, including T- and B cells, with highest expression in classical (CD 14 ++CD 16 -) and intermediate (CD 14 ++CD 16 +) monocytes. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 expression levels by monocytes from very preterm infant were similar to those in term infants or adults. Monocyte production of TNFα, IL- 6 and IL- 1 β induced by activation of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 was similar between very preterm infants, term infants and adults. Conclusion: Monocyte expression <b>and</b> function of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 in very preterm infants are intact and comparable/equivalent to term infants and adults. Functional deficiencies in monocyte NOD signalling pathways are unlikely to contribute to the increased susceptibility to bacterial sepsis in preterm infants...|$|R
