40|$|We {{provide a}} new {{approach}} for assessing the cost of marginal ecosystem changes {{and the effectiveness of}} agri-environmental schemes. The approach is based on a theoretical and empirical analysis of the bio-economic production interactions between marketed outputs and <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> at the micro level. To frame the economic nature of the problem, we employ a generalized joint production model in combination with cost minimization. The generalized joint production framework allows for the consideration of complementary, substitutive and competitive relationships between agricultural production and <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> generation and avoids double counting. From this theoretical model we distinguish three theoretical cases depending on the imposed minimum acceptable level of the <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem <b>services.</b> We employ farm level panel data for the UK to empirically investigate these cases. More specifically, to represent and evaluate the production structure, we estimate first- and second-order elasticities derived from a flexible transformation function. Results show that the majority of farms produce agricultural output and ecosystem services in a complementary relationship. Generation of multiple ecosystem services on the same farm showed either a substitutive or competitive relationship.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{empirical}} study of the contribution of the services sector to per capita economic growth for Pacific Island countries. Design/methodology/approach – Within the new growth theory framework, the empirical procedure consisted of the regression analysis of data using the panel data fixed effects procedure. Findings – The results confirm the positive and statistically significant correlation of services growth to per capita gross domestic product growth. Research limitations/implications – Limitations largely centre on the use of aggregate cross-country data. Variations may be found in what actually drives the services growth at the country level. Thus, a country-specific study would be more appropriate in order to get more robust results. Also, the data do not capture the effect of <b>non-market</b> <b>services.</b> Disaggregate services data that separate market data services with <b>non-market</b> <b>services</b> would provide a more accurate picture of the influence of <b>non-market</b> <b>services.</b> Practical implications – The practical implication is that that service sectors in the Pacific Island countries ought to be given greater support, for example, investment in physical and institutional infrastructure, market access, financial support, skill development and investment incentives. Social implications – Pacific Islands services sectors contribute to household welfare through paid employment and meet household demands of service sector output. Originality/value – This paper presents the first study among the Pacific Island countries that has examined the importance of services sector and its contribution to growth. The findings of this study are useful to Pacific policy makers in terms of improving the services sector through instituting appropriate growth enhancing policies.

The model predicts positive effects of a favorable agricultural productivity shock on wages and income, but the effect on hired labor is ambiguous; it depends on the strength of reallocation of labor from home to market production by labor surplus and deficit households. Taking rainfall variations as a measure of shock to agricultural productivity, and using subdistrict level panel data from Bangladesh, this paper finds significant positive effects of a favorable rainfall shock on agricultural wages, labor supply to market work, and per capita household expenditure. The share of hired labor in contrast declines substantially in response to a favorable productivity shock, which is consistent with a case where labor-deficit households respond more than the labor-surplus ones in reallocating labor from home production...|$|R

The very concept of amenity still remains unclear though it has been widely used both in the environmental field since the 70 ’s, and in the cultural one {{since the beginning of}} the twentieth century. In the latter stream of literature, it is used to discuss urban development based on culture and creative class theory. However, the concept is often reduced to the amount of cultural equipment available in a city. We define an amenity as a <b>non-market</b> <b>service</b> provided by the specific features pertaining to an area. In addition, the amenity is a non-excludable and non-rivalrous service within this area. The originality of this paper lies in the analysis of the conditions under which cultural amenities can be generated and strengthened at a city scale. The process of cultural amenity generation depends on three main features concerning cultural assets: their density, their anchorage in the city and the implementation of flagship assets. Cultural activities can be instrumental in shaping charm, image and ambiance of cities. The last three items are examples of amenities. The randomness, the complexity and the bottom-up aspect of the amenity generation phenomenon is also discussed. Side issues that are at stake such as city gentrification, strategies of access to amenities are also part of our reflection. ...|$|R

Currently, international trade offers trillions of dollars in incentives for countries to convert natural capital into marketable goods and services, and few payments to entice countries to conserve natural capital in order to sustain critical <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem <b>services.</b> We examine the biophysical characteristics of climate change and biodiversity to understand the obstacles to developing effective IPES schemes. We find that none of the existing schemes for providing GES are adequate, given the scale of the problem. A cap and auction scheme for CO 2 emissions among wealthy nations could fund IPES and simultaneously deter carbon emissions. To disburse funds, we should adapt Brazil's ICMS ecológico, and apportion available funds to targeted countries in proportion to how well they meet specific criteria designed to measure the provision of GES. Individual countries can then develop their own policies for increasing provision of these services, ensured of compensation if they do so. Indirect IPES should include funding for freely available technologies that protect or provide GES, such as the low carbon energy alternatives that will be essential for curbing climate change.

40|$|Chile has {{experienced}} a period of strong economic growth. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has {{doubled in the past}} 12 years, however, income inequality remains relatively the same as in the 1960 s. The economic growth is primarily attributed to the exports of natural resources, which accounts for 80 % of total exports. However, the GDP fails to account for the loss of natural capital and <b>non-marketed</b> <b>services.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} more clearly indicate the status of the Chilean economy in terms of welfare using the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) designed by Daly and Cobb (1989). The ISEW provides corrections to the GDP that includes income inequalities, household labor and damage to natural capital. This index has been applied in several case studies for developed countries. In general, the results show that ISEW runs parallel with GDP until the 1970 s when a decline in welfare occurs due to a loss in natural capital. This study is the first attempt to utilize the ISEW for the purpose of analyzing whether or not similar trends exist for Chile, a developing country. The ISEW for Chile grew at a much slower annual rate over the past 30 years, compared with GDP (− 0. 16 % vs. 2. 9 %). The Chilean ISEW parallels the GDP until the 1980 s; a decline in the ISEW then occurs, showing that Chile is not on a sustainable path and that there is a strong link between economic growth and the depletion of natural resources. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.
