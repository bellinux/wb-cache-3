5|$|Soon {{after the}} Big Bang, {{primordial}} protons and neutrons formed from the quark–gluon plasma {{of the early}} Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in {{a process known as}} Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis,</b> nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This <b>nucleosynthesis</b> formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis</b> shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> and supernova <b>nucleosynthesis.</b>|$|E

5|$|Electrons {{are thought}} {{to exist in the}} Universe since early stages of the Big Bang. Atomic nuclei forms in <b>nucleosynthesis</b> reactions. In about three minutes Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis</b> {{produced}} most of the helium, lithium, and deuterium in the Universe, and perhaps some of the beryllium and boron.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is rare}} on Earth, helium is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} element in the known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis</b> one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar <b>nucleosynthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meteoric nickel {{is found}} in {{combination}} with iron, {{a reflection of the}} origin of those elements as major end products of supernova <b>nucleosynthesis.</b> An iron–nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth's inner core.|$|E
5|$|A {{few minutes}} into the expansion, when the {{temperature}} was about a billion (one thousand million) kelvin and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis.</b> Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{is rare in}} the Universe {{and solar}} system due to trace {{formation}} in the Big Bang and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation <b>nucleosynthesis</b> and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{up to the}} {{vicinity}} of iron (in the periodic table) are largely made via stellar <b>nucleosynthesis.</b> In this process, lighter elements from hydrogen to silicon undergo successive fusion reactions inside stars, releasing light and heat and forming heavier elements with higher atomic numbers.|$|E
5|$|In massive stars, heavier {{elements}} {{can also}} be burned in a contracting core through the neon-burning process and oxygen-burning process. The final stage in the stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> process is the silicon-burning process that results {{in the production of}} the stable isotope iron-56, an endothermic process that consumes energy, and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} argon in the Earth's {{atmosphere}} is radiogenic argon-40, derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust. In the universe, argon-36 {{is by far the}} most common argon isotope, being the preferred argon isotope produced by stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> in supernovas.|$|E
5|$|Since the Big Bang, which {{produced}} no carbon or heavier elements, atomic nuclei have been combined in stars {{through the process}} of nuclear fusion to produce more of the element helium, and (via the triple alpha process) the sequence of elements from carbon up to iron; see stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> for details.|$|E
5|$|The Oddo–Harkins rule {{holds that}} {{elements}} with even atomic numbers {{are more common}} that those with odd atomic numbers, {{with the exception of}} hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton {{and are more likely to}} capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability. All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them (the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals) in the Solar System. The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar <b>nucleosynthesis.</b> Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis</b> and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons, and stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> could only pass this bottleneck by the triple-alpha process, fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon, and skipping over those three elements.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{inherited}} its {{chemical composition}} from {{the interstellar medium}} out of which it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis,</b> and the heavier elements were produced by stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> in generations of stars that completed their stellar evolution and returned their material to the interstellar medium before {{the formation of the}} Sun. The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System. However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition {{is believed to have been}} 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium in the Solar System {{was created}} through stellar <b>nucleosynthesis,</b> mostly by the s-process (≈72%), {{but also by}} the r-process (≈28%). The r-process {{consists}} of rapid neutron capture of lighter elements during supernova explosions. The s-process is a slow neutron capture of lighter elements inside pulsating red giant stars.|$|E
5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of <b>nucleosynthesis</b> to continue longer.|$|E
5|$|After the Planck epoch and {{inflation}} came the quark, hadron, and lepton epochs. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. The observed abundance {{of the elements}} {{can be explained by}} combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, {{in the early part of}} the matter-dominated era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei through nuclear reactions. This process, known as Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis,</b> led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis</b> ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, when the Universe had cooled enough so that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the photon epoch, lasted about 380 thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} elements, fluorine's {{abundance}} value of 400ppb (parts per billion) – 24th among {{elements in the}} universe – is exceptional: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common. This is because stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> processes bypass fluorine, and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high nuclear cross sections, allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively.|$|E
5|$|Boron is a {{chemical}} element with symbolB and atomic number5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae {{and not by}} stellar <b>nucleosynthesis,</b> it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, a star shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova <b>nucleosynthesis</b> when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{astronomer}} Paul W. Merrill in California {{detected the}} spectral signature of technetium (specifically wavelengths of 403.1nm, 423.8nm, 426.2nm, and 429.7nm) in light from S-type red giants. The stars were {{near the end}} of their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, indicating that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of <b>nucleosynthesis</b> in stars. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} {{they believe to be}} {{pristine}} clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the second}} lightest inert gas. Neon has three stable isotopes: 20Ne (90.48%), 21Ne (0.27%) and 22Ne (9.25%). 21Ne and 22Ne are partly {{primordial}} and partly nucleogenic (i.e. made by nuclear reactions of other nuclides with neutrons or other particles in the environment) and their variations in natural abundance are well understood. In contrast, 20Ne (the chief primordial isotope made in stellar <b>nucleosynthesis)</b> is not known to be nucleogenic or radiogenic. The causes of the variation of 20Ne in the Earth have thus been hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|Supernovae are {{the major}} source of {{elements}} heavier than nitrogen. These elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S, by silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium (see Supernova <b>nucleosynthesis)</b> during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni, and by rapid captures of neutrons during the supernova's collapse for elements heavier than iron. <b>Nucleosynthesis</b> during silicon burning yields nuclei roughly 1000-100,000 times more abundant than the r-process isotopes heavier than iron. Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed, candidate sites for the r-process, which is the rapid capture of neutrons that occurs at high temperature and high density of neutrons. Those reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms. The r-process produces about half of all the heavier isotopes of the elements beyond iron, including plutonium and uranium. The only other major competing process for producing elements heavier than iron is the s-process in large, old, red-giant AGB stars, which produces these elements slowly over longer epochs and which cannot produce elements heavier than lead.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the lower}} mass noble gases, the normal stellar <b>nucleo{{synthesis}}</b> process inside a star does not form xenon. Elements more massive than iron-56 consume energy through fusion, and {{the synthesis of}} xenon represents no energy gain for a star. Instead, xenon is formed during supernova explosions, in classical nova explosions, by the slow neutron capture process (s-process) in red giant stars that have exhausted their core hydrogen and entered the asymptotic giant branch, and from radioactive decay, for example by beta decay of extinct iodine-129 and spontaneous fission of thorium, uranium, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|The entire star is {{undergoing}} convection, whereby the energy generated {{at the core}} is being transported toward the surface by the convective motion of plasma, rather than by transmission through radiation. This circulation redistributes any accumulation of helium that is generated through stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> at the core throughout the star. This process will allow the star {{to remain on the}} main sequence as a hydrogen fusing star proportionately longer than a star such as the Sun where helium steadily accumulates at the core. In combination with a lower rate of hydrogen consumption due to its low mass, the convection will allow Wolf 359 to remain a main-sequence star for about eight trillion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of <b>nucleosynthesis),</b> the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated era. Light from this era could travel freely, and it can still {{be seen in the}} Universe as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar <b>nucleosynthesis.</b> The Universe also contains a mysterious energy called dark energy, the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In this era, the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{space is}} the {{physical}} space within a galaxy beyond {{the influence of}} each star on the plasma. The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% {{of the mass of}} the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar <b>nucleosynthesis.</b> These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.|$|E
5|$|The abundances of {{the noble}} {{gases in the}} {{universe}} decrease as their atomic numbers increase. Helium {{is the most common}} element in the universe after hydrogen, with a mass fraction of about 24%. Most of the helium in the universe was formed during Big Bang <b>nucleosynthesis,</b> but the amount of helium is steadily increasing due to the fusion of hydrogen in stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> (and, to a very slight degree, the alpha decay of heavy elements). Abundances on Earth follow different trends; for example, helium is only the third most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere. The reason {{is that there is no}} primordial helium in the atmosphere; due to the small mass of the atom, helium cannot be retained by the Earth's gravitational field. Helium on Earth comes from the alpha decay of heavy elements such as uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust, and tends to accumulate in natural gas deposits. The abundance of argon, on the other hand, is increased as a result of the beta decay of potassium-40, also found in the Earth's crust, to form argon-40, which is the most abundant isotope of argon on Earth despite being relatively rare in the Solar System. This process is the basis for the potassium-argon dating method.Ar/39Ar dating and errors|accessdate=2008-06-26|publisher=Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg|date=2007-01-16|last=Scherer|first=Alexandra |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014042248/http://geoberg.de/text/geology/07011601.php |archivedate=2007-10-14}} Xenon has an unexpectedly low abundance in the atmosphere, in what has been called the missing xenon problem; one theory is that the missing xenon may be trapped in minerals inside the Earth's crust. After the discovery of xenon dioxide, research showed that Xe can substitute for Si in quartz. Radon is formed in the lithosphere by the alpha decay of radium. It can seep into buildings through cracks in their foundation and accumulate in areas that are not well ventilated. Due to its high radioactivity, radon presents a significant health hazard; it is implicated in an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States alone.|$|E
5|$|The most {{abundant}} iron isotope 56Fe {{is of particular}} interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of <b>nucleosynthesis.</b> Since 56Ni (14 alpha particles) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires a great deal more energy. This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe. As such, iron is the {{most abundant}} element in the core of red giants, and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth. It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight. Iron is the sixth most abundant element in the Universe, and the most common refractory element.|$|E
5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between <b>nucleosynthesis</b> and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E
5|$|The great {{rarity of}} the proton-rich 136Ce and 138Ce is {{explained}} by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> for elements beyond iron, the s-process (slow neutron capture) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture). This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s-process, and the r-process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron-rich stable nuclides. Such nuclei are called p-nuclei, and their origin is not yet well understood: some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration. 140Ce is the most common isotope of cerium, as it can be produced in both the s- and r-processes, while 142Ce can only be produced in the r-process. Another reason for the abundance of 140Ce is that it is a magic nucleus, having a closed neutron shell (it has 82 neutrons), and hence it has a very low cross-section towards further neutron capture. Although its proton number of 58 is not magic, it is granted additional stability, as its eight additional protons past the magic number 50 enter and complete the 1g7/2 proton orbital. The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources, because 138Ce and 140Ce are the daughters of the long-lived primordial radionuclides 138La and 144Nd, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Baryogenesis is {{followed}} by primordial <b>nucleosynthesis,</b> when atomic nuclei began to form.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} <b>nucleosynthesis</b> of {{the heavier}} elements requires the extreme temperatures and pressures found within stars and supernovas. These processes began as {{hydrogen and helium}} from the Big Bang collapsed into the first stars at 500 million years. Star formation has occurred continuously in galaxies since that time. Among the elements found naturally on Earth (the so-called primordial elements), those heavier than boron were created by stellar <b>nucleosynthesis</b> and by supernova <b>nucleosynthesis.</b> They range in atomic numbers from Z=6 (carbon) to Z=94 (plutonium). Synthesis of these elements occurred either by nuclear fusion (including both rapid and slow multiple neutron capture) or {{to a lesser degree}} by nuclear fission followed by beta decay.|$|E
