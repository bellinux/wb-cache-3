For each pair of elements, {{there is a certain}} probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. <b>Noisy</b> binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. The <b>noisy</b> binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E
