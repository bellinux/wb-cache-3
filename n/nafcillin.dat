50|$|E. faecalis is {{resistant}} to many commonly used antimicrobial agents (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, cephalosporins, clindamycin, the semisynthetic penicillins <b>nafcillin</b> and oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Resistance to vancomycin in E. faecalis {{is becoming more}} common. Treatment options for vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis include nitrofurantoin (in the case of uncomplicated UTIs), linezolid, and daptomycin, although ampicillin is preferred if the bacteria are susceptible. Quinupristin/dalfopristin {{can be used to}} treat Enterococcus faecium but not E. faecalis.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainstay}} {{of treatment for}} SSSS is supportive care along with eradication of the primary infection. Conservative measures include rehydration, antipyretics (e.g., ibuprofen, aspirin, and paracetamol), management of thermal burns, and stabilization. Parenteral antibiotics to cover S. aureus should be administered. Most strains of S. aureus implicated in SSSS have penicillinases, and are therefore penicillin resistant. Therefore, treatment with <b>Nafcillin,</b> oxacillin, or vancomycin is typically indicated. Clindamycin is sometimes also used because of its inhibition of exotoxins.|$|E
50|$|Treatment for {{meningitis}} is antibiotics. The particular drugs {{used are}} based off the infecting bacteria, but {{a mix of}} ampicillin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime is used for early-onset meningitis before identification of infection. A regimen of antistaphylococcal antibiotic, such as <b>nafcillin</b> or vancomycin, plus cefotaxime or ceftazidime with or without an aminoglycoside is recommended for late-onset neonatal meningitis. The aim for these treatments is to sterilize the CSF of any meningitis-causing pathogens. A repeated LP 24-48 hours after initial treatment {{should be used to}} declare sterilization.|$|E
5000|$|Oxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam. It {{is similar}} to methicillin, and has {{replaced}} methicillin in clinical use. Other related compounds are <b>nafcillin,</b> cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin. Since it is resistant to penicillinase enzymes, such as that produced by Staphylococcus aureus, it is widely used clinically in the US to treat penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, with the introduction and widespread use of both oxacillin and methicillin, antibiotic-resistant strains called methicillin-resistant and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/ORSA) have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. MRSA/ORSA is treated using vancomycin.|$|E
5000|$|Treatment is {{dependent}} on which species or strain of Bartonella is found in a given patient. While Bartonella species are susceptible {{to a number of}} standard antibiotics in vitro [...] - [...] macrolides and tetracycline, for example [...] - [...] the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in immunocompetent individuals is uncertain. Immunocompromised patients should be treated with antibiotics because they are particularly susceptible to systemic disease and bacteremia. Drugs of particular effectiveness include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and rifampin; B. henselae is generally resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and <b>nafcillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In E. coli multi-drug {{resistance}} develops from {{a variety}} of mechanisms. Particularly concerning is the ability of efflux mechanisms to confer broad band resistivity. RND efflux pumps provide extrusion for a range of compounds. Five protein transporters in E. coli cells that belong to the HAE-RND subfamily have been classified, including the multi-drug efflux protein AcrB, the outer membrane protein TolC and the periplasmic adaptor protein AcrA. The TolC and AcrA proteins are also utilized in the tripartite complex in other identified RND efflux proteins. The AcrAB-TolC efflux system is responsible for the efflux of antimicrobial drugs like penicillin G, cloxacillin, <b>nafcillin,</b> macrolides, novobiocin, linezolid, and fusidic acid antibiotics. Other substrates include dyes, detergents, some organic solvents, and steroid hormones. The ways in which the lipophilic domains of the substrate and the RND pumps is not completely defined.|$|E
50|$|For {{antibiotic}} resistance, {{which represents}} a widespread problem nowadays, drugs designed {{to block the}} mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance are used. For example, bacterial resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins and cephalosporins) can be circumvented by using antibiotics such as <b>nafcillin</b> that are not susceptible to destruction by certain beta-lactamases (the group of enzymes responsible for breaking down beta-lactams). Beta-lactam bacterial resistance can also {{be dealt with by}} administering beta-lactam antibiotics with drugs that block beta-lactamases such as clavulanic acid so that the antibiotics can work without getting destroyed by the bacteria first. Recently, researchers have recognized the need for new drugs that inhibit bacterial efflux pumps, which cause resistance to multiple antibiotics such as beta-lactams, quinolones, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim by sending molecules of those antibiotics out of the bacterial cell. Sometimes a combination of different classes of antibiotics may be used synergistically; that is, they work together to effectively fight bacteria that may be resistant to one of the antibiotics alone.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{in vitro}} synergy studies, the {{addition}} of <b>nafcillin</b> to daptomycin was used to treat refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Daptomycin is a de facto cationic antimicrobial peptide in vivo, with antistaphylococcal mechanisms reminiscent of innate host defense peptides (HDPs). In this study, the effects of <b>nafcillin</b> on HDP activity against MRSA were examined in vitro and in vivo. Exposures to β-lactam antimicrobials in general, and <b>nafcillin</b> in particular, significantly increased killing of S. aureus by selected HDPs from keratinocytes, neutrophils, and platelets. This finding correlated with enhanced killing ofMRSA bywhole blood, neutrophils, and keratinocytes after growth in <b>nafcillin.</b> Finally, <b>nafcillin</b> pretreatment ex vivo reduced MRSA virulence in a murine subcutaneous infection model. Despite the lack of direct activity against MRSA, these studies show potent, consistent, and generalized nafcillin-mediated “sensitization ” to increased killing of MRSA by various components of the innate host response. The use of <b>nafcillin</b> as adjunctive therapy in MRSA bacteremia merits further study and {{should be considered in}} cases refractory to standard therapy.

40|$|<b>Nafcillin,</b> a pencillinase-resistant penicillin, is {{frequently}} used {{for treatment of}} staphylococcal infections in hemodialysis patients. Despite its widespread use, there is a paucity of available data regarding the pharmacokinetics of <b>nafcillin</b> in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, sodium <b>nafcillin,</b> 25 mg/kg, was given intravenously over a 5 - to 15 -min period to 12 hemodialysis patients. Eleven patients were studied during dialysis, and eight of these were studied again during the interdialysis period.

These data indicate that renal failure does not appreciably affect the serum half-life of <b>nafcillin,</b> and hemodialysis does not accelerate the rate of clearance of <b>nafcillin</b> from the blood.

There are no well-matched controlled studies comparing cefazolin with <b>nafcillin</b> for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia. A retrospective propensity-score-matched case-control study was performed from 2004 to 2009 in a tertiary care hospital where <b>nafcillin</b> was unavailable from August 2004 to August 2006. The cefazolin group (n = 49) included MSSA-bacteremic patients treated with cefazolin during the period of <b>nafcillin</b> unavailability, while the <b>nafcillin</b> group (n = 84) comprised those treated with <b>nafcillin.</b> Treatment failure was defined as a composite outcome of a change of antibiotics due to clinical failure, relapse, and mortality.

40|$|Semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant {{penicillins}} {{are recommended}} for therapy of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, but {{evaluation of the}} efficacy and safety of individual agents has received little attention.

40|$|Five {{patients}} seen {{during a}} two-month period who developed untoward systemic reactions following high dose intravenous administration of <b>nafcillin</b> are described. Recovery was complete upon discontinuation of the drug. The clustering {{of these cases}} and the high incidence (5 of 5) of side effects are highly unusual, and suggest that the frequency of <b>nafcillin</b> reactions might be higher than previously suspected. It is assumed that all penicillinase-resistant semi-synthetic penicillins are equally effective in treating infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus [1, 2]. Little is known, however, about the relative toxicities of these antibiotics. Of the major side effects, rash, urticaria, fever, allergic interstitial nephritis, hepatic toxicity, and hematologic toxicity {{in the form of}} reversible granulocytopenia have been commented upon in the literature [3 - 10]. <b>Nafcillin,</b> 6 -(2 -ethoxy-l-naphthalmido) penicillanic acid, has been preferred by some clinicians over methicillin and oxacillin, because its use may be associated with a lower incidence of side effects, particularly nephropathy [11]. Furthermore, in one study <b>nafcillin</b> offered better synergistic activity than other penicillinase-resistant penicillins with an aminoglycoside when tested against the enterococci [12]. This report describes an unusually high occurrence of untoward reactions due to <b>nafcillin</b> observed by us at Yale-New Haven Hospital. During the months of July and August of 1976, five patients, four of whom were seen and followed by the Infectious Disease Section, received high dose intravenous <b>nafcillin</b> for proven or presumed staphylococcal infections.
