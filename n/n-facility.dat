Emergence of such information technologies as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has enabled access to detailed demand information. This proliferation of demand data brings about serious computational challenges for traditional approaches {{which are based on}} discrete demand representation. Furthermore, traditional approaches model the problem in location variable space and decide on the allocation decisions optimally given the locations. This is equivalent to prioritizing location decisions. However, when allocation decisions are more decisive or choice of exact locations is a later stage decision, then we need to prioritize allocation decisions. Motivated by these trends and challenges, we herein adopt a modeling and solution approach in the allocation variable space. Our approach has two fundamental characteristics: Demand representation in the form of continuous density functions and allocation decisions in the form of service regions. Accordingly, our framework is based on continuous optimization models and solution methods. On a plane, service regions (allocation decisions) assume different shapes depending on the metric chosen. Hence, this thesis presents separate approaches for two-dimensional Euclidean-metric and Manhattan-metric based distance measures. Further, we can classify the solution approaches of this thesis as constructive and improvement-based procedures. We show that constructive solution approach, namely the shooting algorithm, is an efficient procedure for solving both the single dimensional <b>n-facility</b> and planar 2 -facility problems. While constructive solution approach is analogous for both metric cases, improvement approach differs due to the shapes of the service regions. In the Euclidean-metric case, a pair of service regions is separated by a straight line, however, in the Manhattan metric, separation takes place in the shape of three (at most) line segments. For planar 2 -facility Euclidean-metric problems, we show that shape preserving transformations (rotation and translation) of a line allows us to design improvement-based solution approaches. Furthermore, we extend this shape preserving transformation concept to <b>n-facility</b> case via vertex-iteration based improvement approach and design first-order and second-order solution methods. In the case of planar 2 -facility Manhattan-metric problems, we adopt translation as the shape-preserving transformation for each line segment and develop an improvement-based solution approach. For <b>n-facility</b> case, we provide a hybrid algorithm. Lastly, we provide results of a computational study and complexity results of our vertex-based algorithm...|$|E
