A ship may engage in the grain trade during the harvest season and later move on to carry other cargoes or work on a different route. Aboard a coastal carrier in the tramp trade, the crew will often not know the <b>next</b> <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> until the cargo is fully loaded.|$|E

They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E

25|$|In November 2005 the R Five re-entered service {{when she}} was {{chartered}} to Oceania Cruises and renamed Nautica. On 30 November 2008 the Nautica was sailing from Safaga, Egypt to Salah, Oman on the Maritime Safety Protection Area established in the Gulf of Aden due to persistent pirate attacks on the area, when at approximately 9:28 AM UTC+3 the ship encountered two Somalian pirate skiffs. Captain Jurica Brajcic ordered the ship to take evasive manoeuvres and to sail away at flank speed. The Nautica was able to outrun her attackers, although the ship was fired at eight times. None of the 684 passengers or 401 crew on board were injured in the attack. Following the attack the Nautica proceeded normally to her <b>next</b> scheduled <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call.</b>|$|R
50|$|The next {{significant}} find, at a {{place called}} Takua Pa, just above the Valley, is an 8th-century CE inscription in Tamil of the Pallava king Nandivarman II with his title 'Avani Naranan.' It refers to a merchants' guild, trading in gems that had left from Manigramam, a village near Poompuhar, to Bujang Valley. The idol and the inscriptions in Tamil are still there at Takua Pa in present-day Thailand. Takua Pa was the first <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> for the South Indian merchants. The Bujang Valley, a little south of Takua Pa, was the <b>next</b> important <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call.</b> Sri Vijaya's king, Sri Mara Vijayotunga Varman, sent an embassy from Kedah to Raja Raja Chola, requesting him permission to build a Buddha Vihara near Nagapattinam in the name of his father Sri Chulamani Varman. Raja Raja Chola permitted him to build a Buddha vihara and gifted wealth and a village called Anaimangalam, near Nagapattinam, in 1006 CE, for the vihara.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Benyovszky and Stepanov, along with other exiles and disaffected {{residents}} of Kamchatka, organised an escape. From the list of those [...] {{who participated in the}} escape (70 men, women and children), it is evident that the majority were not prisoners or exiles of any sort, but just ordinary working people of Kamchatka. At the start of May, an armed uprising by the group overcame the garrison of Bolsheretsk, during which the commander, Grigorii Nilov, was killed. The supply ship St Peter and St Paul, which had been over-wintering in Kamchatka, was seized and loaded with furs and provisions. On 23 May (Old Style: 12 May), the ship set sail {{from the mouth of the}} Bolsha River, and headed southwards.Benyovszky’s Memoirs state that the route taken by the ship, having rounded the southernmost point of Kamchatka, was generally north and eastwards, taking in Bering Island, the Bering Strait, Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. [...] However, in the time available (four weeks according to Benyovszky’s own account), this 6000-mile itinerary is barely credible for a leaky ship and inexperienced crew. Such a route is completely absent from three other separate accounts of the voyage (by Ippolit Stepanov, [...] Ivan Ryumin [...] and Gerasim Izmailov [...] ). Additionally, some of the events described by Benyovszky are so implausible that the entire voyage in this area must be considered a fiction. The ship landed at the island of Simushir in the Kuril Islands chain, and stayed there between 29 May and 9 June to bake bread and take stock of their supplies and cargo. During this time, the sailor Izmailov was judged to be organising a mutiny; he and two other Kamchatkans were left on the island when the ship finally sailed southwards. Izmailov subsequently carved out a career as an explorer and trader in the Aleutians and the Alaskan coast, providing information to Captain James Cook in the summer of 1778. Their <b>next</b> known <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> was at Sakinohama on the island of Shikoku in Japan, where they rested between 19 and 23 July, and in the following days at Oshima island in Awa Province. Here the voyagers managed to trade with villagers, despite this being expressly forbidden by the Japanese authorities. At the end of July, they landed on Amami-Oshima in the Ryükyü islands, where they also traded successfully. At the end of August they arrived on the island of Formosa (present-day Taiwan), probably at Black Rock Bay, where three of the voyagers were killed during a fight with native islanders. [...] Then they sailed to the Chinese mainland, at Dongshan Island. Following the coast down from there, they finally arrived at Macao on 22 September 1771. Shortly after their arrival in Macao, 15 of the voyagers died, most likely from the effects of malnutrition. Benyovszky took responsibility for selling the ship and all the furs they had loaded at Kamchatka, and then negotiated with the various European trading establishments for passage back to Europe. In late January 1772, two French ships took the survivors away from Macao. [...] Some of them (13) stopped on the island of Mauritius, others died en route (8), and the remainder (26) landed at the French <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Lorient in July.|$|R
25|$|In 1960, Gardner's {{official}} biography, entitled Gerald Gardner: Witch, was published. It {{was written}} by a friend of his, the Sufi mystic Idries Shah, but used {{the name of one}} of Gardner's High Priests, Jack L. Bracelin, because Shah was wary about being associated with Witchcraft. In May of that year, Gardner travelled to Buckingham Palace, where he enjoyed a garden party in recognition of his years of service to the Empire in the Far East. Soon after his trip, Gardner's wife Donna died, and Gardner himself once again began to suffer badly from asthma. The following year he, along with Shah and Lois Bourne, travelled to the island of Majorca to holiday with the poet Robert Graves, whose The White Goddess would play a significant part in the burgeoning Wiccan religion. In 1963, Gardner decided to go to Lebanon over the winter. Whilst returning home on the ship, The Scottish Prince on 12 February 1964, he suffered a fatal heart attack at the breakfast table. He was buried in Tunisia, the ship's <b>next</b> <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> and his funeral was attended only by the ship's captain. He was 79 years old.|$|E

40|$|The Cruise Itinerary Schedule Design (CISD) problem {{determines the}} optimal {{sequence}} {{of a given}} set <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> (a <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is an intermediate stop in a cruise itinerary) and the arrival and departure times at each <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> {{in order to maximize}} the monetary value of the utility at <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> minus the fuel cost. To solve this problem, in view of the practical observations that most cruise itineraries do not have many <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> we first enumerate all sequences <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> and then optimize the arrival and departure times at each <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> by developing a dynamic programming approach. To improve the computational efficiency, we propose effective bounds on the monetary value of each sequence <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> eliminating non-optimal sequences without invoking the dynamic programming algorithm. Extensive computational experiments are conducted and the results showthat, first, using the bounds on the profit of each sequence <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> considerably improves the computational efficiency; second, the total profit of the cruise itinerary is sensitive to the fuel price and hence an accurate estimation of the fuel price is highly desirable; third, the optimal sequence <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is not necessarily the sequencewith the shortest voyage distance, especially when the ports do not have a natural geographic sequence.
