5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, {{like those}} of other insects, are centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm.

40|$|Coastal {{areas have}} been {{historically}} characterized as being a source of wealth. Nowadays, beaches have become more relevant as a place for rest and leisure. This had led to a very high population pressure due to rapid urbanisation processes. The impacts associated with coastal tourism, demand the development of anthropic actions to protect the shoreline. This paper has studied the impacts of these actions on the Marineta Cassiana beach, in Denia, Spain. This particular Mediterranean beach has traditionally suffered a major shoreline regression, and the beach <b>nourishments</b> {{carried out in the}} 1980 s would not have achieved the reliability desired. This research has analysed the historic evolution of the beach and its environment for a period of 65 years (1950 â€“ 2015). A Geographic Information System (GIS) has been used to integrate and perform a spatial analysis of urban development, soil erosion, stream flow, swell, longshore transport, submerged vegetation species and shoreline evolution. The results show how the anthropic actions have affected the shoreline. After the excessive urban development of the catchments, there is no natural sediment supply to the beach. The change in the typology of the sediment, from pebbles to sand, during the beach <b>nourishments</b> has led to a crucial imbalance in the studied area. Moreover, the beach area gained has disappeared, affecting the Posidonia oceanica meadow, and incrementing the erosion rates. The findings obtained are relevant, not only in the management and maintenance of the beaches, but also, in the decision-making for future <b>nourishments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Beaches {{are one of}} {{the most}} dynamic environments on earth. They provide storm surge protection, flood control, {{recreational}} activities, habitat for a variety of plants and animals and also provide an important source of income for economies around the country through tourism. Impacts on beaches from natural and anthropogenic sources of erosion are becoming more prevalent as sea levels rise and urban coastal areas grow in population. As a result, engineered erosion control techniques were developed to mitigate for beach erosion and protect coastal development. Early forms of these techniques included the use of engineered hard structures such as seawalls, jetties and groins to armor the coast line but they often have unintended impacts or side effects. Beach <b>nourishments,</b> which are increasingly employed around the United States, are considered a more environmentally friendly method by some and are now the preferred method of choice for engineered coastal protection. There is much debate as to whether erosion control techniques, including beach <b>nourishments,</b> are an effective mitigation tool for beach erosion or if tactics such as human population retreat are a better solution. Due to the large number of people that live and recreate near beaches and the economies that rely on the tourism generated earnings, retreat is not a viable option. Coastal erosion techniques such as beach <b>nourishments</b> are needed to provide protection against coastal inundation and maintain economically important recreational beaches while balancing environmental concerns...|$|R
40|$|In September and October of {{the year}} 2009, three sandgroyne <b>nourishments</b> have been {{executed}} at the Delfland Coast {{near the village of}} Ter Heijde. The <b>nourishments</b> have been executed to restore the sediment buffer in {{the upper part of the}} coastal profile. A sandgroyne is a concentrated amount of sediment (200. 000 m 3) artificially nourished from the beach into the sea, appearing in the formation of peninsulas. It was anticipated that the three sandgroynes would be absorbed into the coastal system by the impact of waves and currents, nourishing the upper shoreface from the shoreline until a depth of about - 5 m NAP over a coastal stretch of about 2. 5 km. The construction and evolution of the sandgroynes have been monitored intensively. The following research objectives were proposed: 1) Assess the morphological evolution and practical aspects of the sandgroynes constructed at the Ter Heijde coast and 2) Use the site specific knowledge from the Ter Heijde pilot project to create a future perspective of sandgroyne <b>nourishments</b> as a common applied method to nourish the shoreface. This master thesis describes the process of the monitoring campaign, the results of a morhpological data analysis, the results of an initial model simulation set-up and a practical analysis. The sandgroynes have been absorbed in the coastal system, dominantly between the shoreline and the - 5 m depth contour. However the spatial scale of longshore sediment redistribution was larger than accounted for, driven by the intense wave climate. It is concluded that the sandgroynes can be an effective method for nourishing the shoreface, under flexible contract requirements that acknowledge the dynamics of the natural system.

5|$|In {{those species}} which {{reproduce}} sexually, haploid cells bud from the spores. Depending {{on the environmental}} conditions, either a myxamoeba or a myxoflagellate buds from the spore. Myxamoebae move like amoebae â€“ that is, crawling on the substrate â€“ and are produced in dry conditions. Myxoflagellates, which are peritrichous and can swim, develop in moist to wet environments. Myxoflagellates almost always have two flagella; one is generally shorter than the other and sometimes only vestigial. The flagella are used for locomotion and to help to move food particles closer. If the humidity changes, cells can switch between the two manifestations. Neither form has a cell wall. This developmental stage (and the next one) serves as a <b>nourishment</b> provider and {{is also known as}} the first trophic phase (<b>nourishment</b> phase). In this monocellular phase, the Myxogastria consume bacteria and fungus spores, and probably dissolved substances, and they reproduce through simple cell division. If the environmental conditions change adversely in this phase, for example extreme temperature, extreme dryness or food shortage, the Myxogastria may switch to very long-lived, thin-shelled quiescent states â€“ the so-called microcysts. For that to happen, the myxamoebae assume a round shape and secrete a thin cell wall. In this state they can easily survive one year or longer. If living conditions improve, they become active again.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY A {{possible}} {{approach for}} the development of simple predictive methods of shoreface profile evolution is described.

These scales correspond lo bar and berm formation, to the life-time of profile <b>nourishments,</b> as far as major human induced modifications are concerned, and to the time scales of weather pattern modifications and sea-level rise as far as natural effects are concerned...|$|R
40|$|Aim: In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the frequency and relationship of recurrent aphthous stomatitis(RAS) with family history, personal variables such as weight, heigt, antibiotic usage, teeth brush and nutritional habits in geriatric patients. Material and Method: The patients over 65 years old {{were included in the}} study. Before examination, the definition of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and a visual informatory form including photographs were presented to the subjects. The age, sex, height, weight of the subjects were noted on a chart. Then the history of recurrent oral aphthous ulcerations were asked and if present the frequency of the ulcers, the type of the ulcers, the localization of the ulcers, the subjective symptome of the ulcers, familial history for the ulcers, frequency of antibiotic usage, teeth brush habits and nutritional habits were examined by a questionnaire. Results: Eighty subjects completed the study. 31. 25 % of subjects declared recurrent oral ulcer history. Pain was the leading subjective symptome declared by 44 % of the subjects. 15 % of the subjects had a family history for recurrent oral ulcers. There was no correlation between frequency of antibiotic usage and history of RAS. Also, there was no correlation between teeth brush habits and history of RAS. The RAS group consumed tea and fizzdrinks more frequently whereas they consumed milk and milk products, walnut, bread and other grains more rarely. Discussion: Nutritional habits may have a role on ocurrence of reccurrent oral aphthous ulcerations. So we are of the opinion that the elimination of the risky <b>nourishments</b> and the addition of the protective <b>nourishments</b> may be the first step of the treatment period...|$|R
