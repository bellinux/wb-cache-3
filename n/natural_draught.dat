5|$|A {{research}} survey at Kodumanal has unearthed {{the remains}} of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, vitrified brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified mouths and a granite slab, {{which may have been}} the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position. Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site. In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects. At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing {{the remains of}} working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell. Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, {{in the form of a}} number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site. Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.|$|E

Pimpalner was small village where the lack of comforts and literacy. The <b>natural</b> calamities like <b>draught</b> which make the living standard of village very low. In such a condition the school has been inaugurated in 1969 by Mr. Bhaskarrao Raskar sir. He handed over the school administration to organisation which did not do so well with the school. Then Mr. Raskar sir established Prayatna Education society and undertook the school. Facing such a problems in 1983 he built 6 classrooms which is built by himself with some villagers. He tried hard for so many years to bring the school on this position. Today school has taken he phinix flight and got reach to the high position. School now achieving the peaks of success.

Tertiary armaments consisted of sixteen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss. The Hai Chi class was also armed with five above-water, [...] torpedo tubes. One tube located at the bow and four more tubes mounted broadside, just aft of the mast.
