40|$|Adipose-derived {{stem cells}} (ADSC), which exist near adipocytes in adipose tissue, {{have been used}} as a {{potential}} tool of regenerative medicine. Lipid chaperones, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP 4) and 5 (FABP 5), are abundantly expressed in adipocytes. FABP 4 has recently been shown to be secreted from adipocytes during lipolysis in a non-classical pathway and may act as an adipokine. Here, we investigated the role of exogenous FABP 4 and FABP 5 in transcriptional and metabolic regulation in ADSC. FABP 4 and FABP 5 were little expressed in ADSC. However, both FABP 4 and FABP 5 were significantly induced after adipocyte differentiation of ADSC and were secreted from the differentiated adipocytes. Analysis of microarray data, including gene ontology enrichment analysis and cascade analysis of the protein-protein interaction network using a transcription factor binding site search, demonstrated that treatment of ADSC with FABP 4 or FABP 5 affected several kinds of genes related to inflammatory and metabolic responses and the process of cell differentiation. Notably, myogenic factors, including myocyte enhancer factors, myogenic differentiation 1 and myogenin, were modulated by treatment of ADSC with FABP 4, indicating that exogenous FABP 4 treatment is partially associated with myogenesis in ADSC. Metabolome analysis showed that treatment of ADSC with FABP 4 and with FABP 5 similarly, but differently in extent, promoted hydrolysis and/or uptake of lipids, consequentially together with enhancement of β oxidation, inhibition of downstream of the glycolysis pathway, accumulation of amino acids, reduction of nucleic acid components and increase in the ratio of reduced and oxidized <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> <b>phosphates</b> (NADPH/NADP+), an indicator of reducing power, and the ratio of adenosine triphosphate and adenosine monophosphate (ATP/AMP), an indicator of the energy state, in ADSC. In conclusion, secreted FABP 4 and FABP 5 from adipocytes as adipokines differentially affect transcriptional and metabolic regulation in ADSC near adipocytes. The adiposity condition in the host of regenerative medicine may affect characteristics of ADSC by exposure of the balance of FABP 4 and FABP 5...|$|R
25|$|Glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G6PD) is {{an enzyme}} in the pentose phosphate pathway (see image, {{also known as}} the HMP shunt pathway). G6PD converts glucose-6-phosphate into 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone and is the rate-limiting enzyme of this metabolic pathway that supplies reducing energy to cells by maintaining the level of the reduced form of the co-enzyme <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> <b>phosphate</b> (NADPH). The NADPH in turn maintains the supply of reduced glutathione in the cells that is used to mop up free radicals that cause oxidative damage.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme {{ribonucleotide}} reductase (RNR) catalyzes the de novo {{synthesis of}} dNDPs. Catalysis of ribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (NDPs) involves a reduction at the 2’-carbon of ribose 5-phosphate to form the 2’-deoxy derivative-reduced 2’-deoxyribonucleoside 5’-diphosphates (dNDPs). This reduction is initiated with the generation of a free radical. Following a single reduction, RNR requires electrons donated from the dithiol groups of the protein thioredoxin. Regeneration of thioredoxin occurs when <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> <b>phosphate</b> (NADPH) provides two hydrogen atoms {{that are used to}} reduce the disulfide groups of thioredoxin.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis, {{the process by which}} light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars. Water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are used in photosynthesis, and sugar and oxygen (O2) is made, using light energy. Photosynthesis is divided into two stages—the light reactions, where water is split to produce oxygen, and the dark reactions, or Calvin cycle, which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. The two phases are linked by the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> <b>phosphate</b> (NADP+).|$|E
40|$|Enhancing the {{catalytic}} {{properties of}} the CO 2 -fixing enzyme Rubisco is a target for improving agricultural crop productivity. Here, we reveal extensive diversity in the kinetic response between 10 and 37 [*]°C by Rubisco from C 3 and C 4 species within the grass tribe Paniceae. The CO 2 fixation rate (kcatc) for Rubisco from the C 4 grasses with <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (NAD) <b>phosphate</b> malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) photosynthetic pathways was twofold greater than the kcatc of Rubisco from NAD-ME species across all temperatures. The declining response of CO 2 /O 2 specificity with increasing temperature was less pronounced for PCK and NADP-ME Rubisco, which would be advantageous in warmer climates relative to the NAD-ME grasses. Modelled variation in the temperature kinetics of Paniceae C 3 Rubisco and PCK Rubisco differentially stimulated C 3 photosynthesis relative to tobacco above and below 25 [*]°C under current and elevated CO 2. Amino acid substitutions in the large subunit that {{could account for the}} catalytic variation among Paniceae Rubisco are identified; however, incompatibilities with Paniceae Rubisco biogenesis in tobacco hindered their mutagenic testing by chloroplast transformation. Circumventing these bioengineering limitations is critical to tailoring the properties of crop Rubisco to suit future climates...|$|R
40|$|Acetate {{and other}} short chain n-fatty acids (C 1 -C 6) inhibit {{strongly}} the uptake of l-serine or other l-amino acids but inhibit only weakly that of α-methylglucoside or fructose, whether measured in whole cells of Bacillus subtilis or in membrane vesicles {{that have been}} energized with reduced <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (NADH), l-α-glycerol <b>phosphate,</b> or ascorbate plus phenazine methosulfate. The acetate inhibition is noncompetitive, as was shown for l-α-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by whole cells and for l-serine uptake by membrane vesicles. In membrane preparations, neither NADH oxidation nor the reduction of cytochromes by NADH are affected by fatty acids. All of these effects {{are similar to those}} of 2, 4 -dinitrophenol.

40|$|Many {{pathogenic}} microorganisms {{have been}} demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and in cerebral plaques in dementia. Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is {{a risk factor for}} atherosclerosis and dementia, is caused by dysregulation of methionine metabolism secondary to deficiency of the allosteric regulator, adenosyl methionine. Deficiency of adenosyl methionine results from increased polyamine biosynthesis by infected host cells, causing increased activity of ornithine decarboxylase, decreased nitric oxide and peroxynitrate formation and impaired immune reactions. The down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation that is observed in aging and dementia is attributed to deficiency of thioretinaco ozonide oxygen complexed with <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> and <b>phosphate,</b> which catalyzes oxidative phosphorylation. Adenosyl methionine biosynthesis is dependent upon thioretinaco ozonide and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the deficiency of adenosyl methionine and impaired immune function in aging are attributed to depletion of thioretinaco ozonide from mitochondrial membranes. Allyl sulfides and furanonaphthoquinones protect against oxidative stress and apoptosis by increasing the endogenous production of hydrogen sulfide and by inhibiting electron transfer to the active site of oxidative phosphorylation. Diallyl trisulfide and napabucasin inhibit the signaling by the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat 3), potentially enhancing immune function by effects on T helper lymphocytes and promotion of apoptosis. Homocysteine promotes endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis by the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress through activation of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, causing oxidative stress, calcium influx, apoptosis and endothelial dysfunction. The prevention of atherosclerosis and dementia may be accomplished by a proposed nutritional metabolic homocysteine-lowering protocol which enhances immunity and corrects the altered oxidative metabolism in atherosclerosis and dementia...|$|R

NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Glutathione reductase is a <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> <b>phosphate</b> (NADPH) and FAD-dependent enzyme, and {{the major}} {{flavoprotein}} in erythrocyte. The measurement of the activity coefficient of erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR) is the preferred method for assessing riboflavin status. It provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. In vitro enzyme activity in terms of activity coefficients (AC) is determined both with and without the addition of FAD to the medium. ACs represent a ratio of the enzyme’s activity with FAD to the enzyme’s activity without FAD. An AC of 1.2 to 1.4, riboflavin status is considered low when FAD is added to stimulate enzyme activity. An AC > 1.4 suggests riboflavin deficiency. On the other hand, if FAD is added and AC is < 1.2, then riboflavin status is considered acceptable. Tillotson and Bashor reported that {{a decrease in the}} intakes of riboflavin was associated with increase in EGR AC. In the UK study of Norwich elderly, initial EGR AC values {{for both males and females}} were significantly correlated with those measured 2 years later, suggesting that EGR AC may be a reliable measure of long-term biochemical riboflavin status of individuals. These findings are consistent with earlier studies.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increases in oxidant stress, i. e. {{excessive}} {{production of}} superoxide anion (O 2 (. -)), {{have been reported}} in different models of hypertension. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that increased O 2 (. -) production, more than diminished nitric oxide (NO) generation, plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction present in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). METHODS: The study was performed in 30 -week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and SHR. In addition, 16 -week-old SHR were treated with oral irbesartan (average dose 20 mg/kg per day) for 14 weeks (SHR-I). Aortic <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide/nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> <b>phosphate</b> (NADH/NADPH) oxidase activity was determined by use of chemiluminescence with lucigenin. Aortic constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) activity was determined by measuring the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline. Vascular responses to acetylcholine were determined by isometric tension studies. RESULTS: Whereas systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly increased in SHR compared with WKY, no differences were observed in SBP between SHR-I and WKY. In SHR compared with WKY, we found significantly greater NADH/NADPH-driven O 2 (. -) production, similar cNOS-mediated NO production and an impaired vasodilation in response to acetylcholine. Treated SHR had similar NADH/NADPH oxidase activity and significantly lower cNOS activity than the WKY group. Vasodilation in response to acetylcholine was improved in SHR-I. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a diminished availability of NO secondary to an enhanced NADH/NADPH oxidase-dependent O 2 (. -) production may {{play a critical role in}} endothelial dysfunction of adult SHR...|$|R
40|$|Background: Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{is linked}} to exaggerated production of superoxide anions. This {{study was conducted to}} examine the effects of oxidative stress on endothelial modulation of contractions in chronic two-kidney, one-clip (2 K 1 C) renal hypertensive rats. Methods: The 2 K 1 C hypertension was induced by clipping the left renal artery; age-matched rats receiving sham treatment served as controls. Thoracic aortae were isolated and mounted in tissue baths for measurement of isometric tension. Results: Norepinephrine-induced contraction was augmented by the removal of the endothelium, which was more pronounced in sham rats than in 2 K 1 C rats. Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide production, had a similar augmenting effect. Vitamin C inhibited the contraction in aortic rings with intact endothelium from 2 K 1 C rats but not from sham rats. The contraction was also suppressed by treatment with diphenyleneiodonium or apocynin, inhibitors of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide/nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> <b>phosphate</b> (NADH/NADPH) oxidase, in the aortae with intact endothelium from 2 K 1 C rats but not in those from sham rats. Superoxide anions generated by xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine enhanced the contraction in the aortae with intact endothelium from sham rats, but had no effect in 2 K 1 C rats. Enhanced contractile responses to norepinephrine by xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine in sham rats were reversed by vitamin C. Conclusion: These results suggest that the effect on endothelial modulation of endothelium-derived nitric oxide is impaired in 2 K 1 C hypertension. The impairment is, at least in part, related to increased production of superoxide anions by NADH/NADPH oxidase...|$|R
40|$|Tissue kallikrein attenuates salt-induced renal {{fibrosis}} by {{inhibition of}} oxidative stress. BackgroundHigh salt intake induces hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and progressive renal damage. Progressive renal injury is {{the consequence of}} a process of destructive fibrosis. Using gene transfer approach, we {{have shown that the}} tissue kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) {{plays an important role in}} protection against renal injury in several hypertensive ratmodels. In this study, we further investigated the effect and potential mechanisms mediated by kallikrein on salt-induced renal fibrosis. MethodsAdenovirus harboring the human tissue kallikrein gene was delivered intravenously into Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats on a high salt diet for 4 weeks. Two weeks after gene delivery, the effect of kallikrein on renal fibrosis was examined by biochemical and histologic analysis. ResultsKallikrein gene delivery resulted in reduced blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein and albumin levels in DSS rats on a high salt diet. Expression of recombinant human tissue kallikrein was detected in the sera and urine of rats injected with the kallikrein gene. Histologic investigation showed that kallikrein gene delivery significantly reduced glomerular and tubular fibrosis scores and collagen deposition, as well as renal cell proliferation, compared to rats on a high salt diet injected with control virus. Kallikrein gene transfer significantly increased nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in conjunction with reduced salt-induced <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> dinucleotide/nicotinamide <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> <b>phosphate</b> (NADH/NADPH) oxidase activity, superoxide production, transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) mRNA and protein levels, and TGF-β 1 immunostaining.

The multiple roles of glutamate in nitrogen balance make it a gateway between free ammonia and the amino groups of most amino acids. Its crystal structure is published. The GluDH activity in P.vivax, P.ovale and P. malariae has never been tested, but given the importance of GluDH as a branch point enzyme, every cell must have a high concentration of GluDH.

The enzyme was purified 92 -fold from extracts, and its molecular weight was determined to be 100, 000 by gel filtration. Initial velocity studies revealed marked positive cooperativity for OAA (Hill coefficient [nH] = 1. 8; S 0. 5 = 21 mM). The affinity of the enzyme for OAA was markedly increased upon addition of <b>nicotinamide</b> <b>adenine</b> <b>dinucleotide</b> (NAD), NAD <b>phosphate</b> (NADP), and some other pyridine nucleotides. S 0. 5 (OAA) decreased to 1 mM but nH and Vmax were unchanged. Saturation kinetics for the pyridine nucleotides were hyperbolic, and a half-maximal effect was obtained with 8 μM NAD and 30 μM NADP. The enzyme also catalyzed the exchange of 14 CO 2 into OAA but not the net carboxylation of pyruvate. Exchange activity, too, exhibited sigmoidal kinetics for OAA and was strongly stimulated by NAD at low substrate concentrations. The enzyme was inhibited by acetate competitively with respect to OAA. The KI for acetate (12 mM) was well within the physiological range of this compound inside the cell. The regulatory properties of the decarboxylase with respect to OAA cooperativity, NAD activation, and acetate inhibition were retained in situ within permeabilized cells. These properties seem to provide for a control mechanism which could insure the maintenance of OAA and the citrate cycle during growth of cells on glucose and, conversely, the required supply of pyruvate during growth on intermediates of the citrate cycle...|$|R

The study was performed in 16 -week-old and 30 -week-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY(16) and WKY(30), respectively) and in 16 -week-old and 30 -week-old SHR (SHR(16) and SHR(30), respectively). In addition, 16 -week-old SHR were treated with oral irbesartan (average dose 20 mg/kg per day) for 14 weeks (SHR(30) -I). Aortic NADH/NADPH oxidase activity was determined by use of chemiluminescence with lucigenin. The expression of p 22 phox messenger RNA was assessed by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Vascular responses to acetylcholine were determined by isometric tension studies. Aortic wall structure was studied, determining the media thickness and the cross-sectional area by morphometric analysis. Whereas systolic blood pressure was significantly increased in the 2 groups of hypertensive animals compared with their normotensive controls, no differences were observed in systolic blood pressure between SHR(30) and SHR(16). No other differences in the parameters measured were found between WKY(16) and SHR(16). In SHR(30) compared with WKY(30), we found significantly greater p 22 phox mRNA level, NADH/NADPH-driven *O(2) (-) production, media thickness, and cross-sectional area and an impaired vasodilation in response to acetylcholine. Treated SHR had similar NADH/NADPH oxidase activity and p 22 phox expression as the WKY(30) group. The vascular functional and morphological parameters were improved in SHR(30) -I. These findings suggest that an association exists between p 22 phox gene overexpression and NADH/NADPH overactivity in the aortas of adult SHR. Enhanced NADH/NADPH oxidase-dependent *O(2) (-) production may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and vascular hypertrophy in this genetic model of hypertension...|$|R
