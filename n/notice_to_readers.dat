50|$|Coecke van Aelst’s 1539 Flemish {{translation}} of Serlio {{provided to the}} Low Countries a relatively affordable {{translation of}} one of the first illustrated architectural treatises in Europe. The original Italian edition had appeared in Venice only two years earlier. Coecke van Aelst’s Flemish (Dutch) edition in turn served {{as the basis for the}} first English translation of Serlio. The translations of Serlio's works were in fact pirated editions since Serlio never authorised Coecke to translate and publish his works. In the Flemish translation of volume IV Serlio was only mentioned in the <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> the <b>reader</b> and in the colophon. The first translation in French by Coecke (also of Book IV) dated 1542 only mentioned Serlio in the colophon. In the first German translation dated 1543 Coecke mentioned Jacob Rechlinger from Augsburg as the translator but remained silent on Serlio's authorship. Serlio was clearly unhappy with these unauthorised translations and repeatedly threatened to sue Coecke who was, however, safe from prosecution as Coecke lived in a region under Spanish control while Serlio resided in France, an enemy of Spain.|$|R
6000|$|His {{correspondence}} with Swift appeared in 1741.

[...] In a prefatory <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> the <b>reader,</b> the letters are stated to have been [...] "copied from an impression sent from Dublin, and {{said to have been}} printed by the Dean's direction," [...] an impression, it is added, [...] "which was begun without our author's knowledge, and continued without his consent." [...] Pope held the same language in private to Allen and Warburton, and professed to be extremely annoyed at the step. His account has been almost uniformly accepted as true till the critic in the Athenæum showed that the publication of the {{correspondence with}} Swift was no exception to the previous proceedings of the poet, and that, {{as in the case of}} the Wycherley letters of 1729, and the miscellaneous collection of 1735, he himself had sent the manuscripts to the press, and charged the act upon others.|$|R
40|$|General <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> the <b>reader</b> In the {{academic}} programme for Hydraulic Engineering at the TU Delft {{we have in}} the 4 th year (i. e. {{in the first year of}} the Master Programme) the opportunity to do a project in a group of four to six students, called "Master Project". The work should be integral, starting with terms of reference, and ending with the real design. This can be a structure, but also it can be a harbour lay-out, a policy plan design, etc. The total time available for the project is in the order of two months and will provide 10 European Credits. It has to be practical and applied. It is certainly not a M. Sc. thesis assignment (the thesis work is individual, 6 months and more focussed on research or advanced design work on details). But it is also not an apprenticeship, internship or traineeship where the student has to work together with a group of experienced people. For this groupwork they have to solve the problem on their own (of course with guidance). This report is the result of such a Master Project. This report has been assessed by staff of TU Delft.

40|$|Descriptions {{of cosmic}} impacts and {{meteorite}} falls are found throughout Australian Aboriginal oral traditions. In some cases, these texts describe the impact event in detail, {{suggesting that the}} events were witnessed, sometimes citing the location. We explore whether cosmic impacts and meteorite falls may have been witnessed by Aboriginal Australians and incorporated into their oral traditions. We discuss the complications and bias in recording and analysing oral texts but suggest that these texts may be used both to locate new impact structures or meteorites and model observed impact events. We find that, while detailed Aboriginal descriptions of cosmic impacts and meteorite falls are abundant in the literature, there is currently no physical evidence connecting any of these accounts to impact events currently known <b>to</b> Western science. <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> Aboriginal <b>Readers</b> This paper gives the names of, or references to, Aboriginal people that have passed away throughout, and to information that may be considered sacred to some groups. It also contains information published in Nomads of the Australian Desert by Charles P. Mountford (1976). This book was banned from sale in the Northern Territory in 1976 as it contained sacred/secret knowledge of the Pitjantjatjara (see Brown 2004 : 33 - 35; Neate 1982).

40|$|At the University of Ilorin Medical Library, sixty-one {{randomly}} selected medical students with overdue books were surveyed using a questionnaire {{with a view}} to (1) finding out why they had not returned the library books in their possession, (2) determining their perceptions of eight given overdue measures, and (3) seeking suggestions on how else to reduce overdue books. Most of the overdue books were as a result of (1) the students not finishing with the books and (2) the students being forgetful. Providing for renewals was the most favored overdue measure, while the need for increased multiple copies and extended loan periods for students were also stressed. Thus, a <b>notice</b> urging <b>readers</b> <b>to</b> return or renew borrowed library books was mounted on the issue desk as a reminder <b>to</b> all <b>readers</b> borrowing books. The library is being automated, which will facilitate timely generation and sending of overdue notices. More copies of some titles were purchased, while a copy each of others was transferred to the reserve collection. The need for an extended loan period will require further investigation, while the judicious use of other overdue measures to complement providing for renewals is recommended...|$|R
