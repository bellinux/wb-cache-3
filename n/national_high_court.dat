40|$|Abstract__ Why do legal {{arrangements}} for the institutions of government (legislative, executive, judicial branches) in Western liberal democracies develop faster, or in a different way, in one jurisdiction in comparison to another? In this article, {{it is argued that}} constitutional theory can help us understand the development of these legal institutional arrangements, for example in light of of the changing role of <b>national</b> <b>highest</b> <b>courts</b> in the the globalised legal context. For this purpose, the concept of constitutional (in-) flexibility is introduced, which can explain how national constitutional frameworks enable or constrain the integration of normative changes in national legal systems. Four elements encompassed by this concept are identified: the detail of constitutional norms, the modalities for revising the national Constitution, the approach to legal argumentation taken by interpreters of the Constitution, and the influence attributed to international law within the national legal system. This analytical framework is applied to the illustrative case of judicial globalisation - concerning, inter alia, the judicial use of non-binding foreign law - to explain similarities and differences concerning the way in which changes affecting the functioning of <b>national</b> <b>highest</b> <b>courts</b> are integrated within different legal systems. This analysis, in turn, yields some insight into the further development of constitutional theory in the era of globalisation...|$|R

In this article, firstly, {{four types of}} variables (constitutional, institutional, organisational, and personal) which influence judicial practices are described, and it is shown how these variables shape the judicial decision-making of the <b>highest</b> <b>courts</b> in liberal-democratic legal systems. Secondly, the specific development {{of the use of}} foreign law in the Supreme Courts of the UK and the Netherlands is analysed in light of the identified variables.

I argue that a venue-shopping framework is best suited to account for the timing, form, and content of European cooperation in this area. The venues less amenable to restrictive migration control policy are <b>national</b> <b>high</b> <b>courts,</b> other ministries and migrant-aid organisations. Building upon pre-existing policy settings and developing new policy frames, law and order officials circumvented national constraints in largely intergovernmental and secretive forums with EU institutions playing a minor role. In this fashion, they avoided judicial scrutiny, eliminated other national adversaries and enlisted the help of transnational actors such as transit countries and carriers...|$|R

40|$|As {{courts in}} separation-of-powers systems {{are said to}} have the power of neither the purse nor the sword, their {{institutional}} legitimacy is essential for ensuring compliance with their decisions. While institutional legitimacy has been examined in-depth for <b>national</b> <b>high</b> <b>courts,</b> the legitimacy of sub-national courts has been overlooked. In this dissertation I develop a new measure of court-level institutional legitimacy for state <b>high</b> <b>courts.</b> I use multilevel regression and poststratification to create state-level measures from individual-level survey results. In this dissertation, I develop a theory of review and delegation by state <b>high</b> <b>courts.</b> I argue that these courts work toward two main goals: implementing their policy preferences and maintaining the legitimacy of their institution. I argue for a two-stage process that considers whether or not the court will decide on the constitutionality of a statute in the first stage and whether they will overturn the statute and delegate policy control back to the other branches of government in the second. Relying on the literatures on both institutional legitimacy and political delegation, I suggest that courts may delegate policy control back to the other branches of government by specifically stating this in their opinion. Finally, I examine the conditions under which a state <b>high</b> <b>court</b> will delegate to either the state legislature or the executive branch. Overall, I find that legitimacy is important when considering state <b>high</b> <b>court</b> decision-making; and it must be considered along with political context and institutional rules as one of the central motivations for state <b>high</b> <b>courts</b> in separation of powers theories...|$|R
40|$|Protocol 16 ECHR {{will provide}} for an {{extension}} of the advisory jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), enabling <b>highest</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> to request advisory opinions on questions of principle concerning the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) or its Protocols. This extension of the ECtHR’s advisory jurisdiction aims to achieve two goals: a reduction in the ECtHR’s excessive docket, and the enhancement of dialogue between the ECtHR and (<b>highest)</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts.</b> While the aims of this reform initiative are laudable, we argue that Protocol 16 is likely to fail to achieve its objectives. Our analysis suggests that rather than facilitating the Court’s adjudicatory function, extended advisory jurisdiction has the potential to impact on the Court’s constitutionalist function in a manner which can be better achieved through the Court’s contentious cases. The burden this procedure will place on the Court’s already overstretched resources would risk delays to contentious cases and potentially undermine judicial comity should requests for advisory opinions be declined. Furthermore, evidence of ‘constructive’ dialogue between <b>highest</b> <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> and the ECtHR is emerging in contentious cases without the need for an extended advisory opinions mechanism. Rather than achieving its objectives, Protocol 16 risks exacerbating the Court’s backlog and nullifying the positive effects of advisory opinions on dialogue...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{emergence}} of the Mexican Supreme Court and the Colombian Constitutional Court as powerful political actors. Mexico and Colombia undertook constitutional transformations designed to empower their respective <b>national</b> <b>high</b> <b>courts</b> in the 1990 s to facilitate a democratic transition. These constitutional transformations opened up political space for the Mexican Supreme Court and the Colombian Constitutional Court to begin to displace political actors in the tasks of constitutional construction and maintenance. These two courts play different roles, however, in their respective democratic orders. Mexico chose to empower its Supreme Court to police vertical and horizontal separation of powers whereas Colombia fashioned a Constitutional Court whose task is to deepen the social bases of democracy by constructing rights. This essay argues that the constitutional changes that occurred are a necessary but not sufficient explanation for the role these two courts play. The agenda courts undertake is shaped both by short-term political bargains and by long-term societal transformations. A s a result of both the bargains that led to the adoption of a new constitution and broader intellectual transformations regarding the role of courts in effectuating constitutional guarantees, the Colombian Constitutional Court has pursued a more ambitious agenda than the Mexican Supreme Court.

5000|$|In 1983, {{the matter}} {{went to the}} Courts in the State of Victoria and {{subsequently}} to the <b>national</b> <b>High</b> <b>Court.</b> Scientologists argued a $70 payroll tax should not be paid due to {{its status as a}} religious organisation. The Commissioner of Pay-Roll Tax in Victoria had ruled that Scientology was not a religion. This decision was upheld in the Supreme Court of Victoria (Judge: Crockett,J) and then on appeal in the Full Court. The judgement concluding Scientology was not a religion relied on the premise that Scientology was a philosophy rather than a religion and that the trappings of religion had only been acquired after its establishment in order to give the organisation the semblance of a religion. Some support of this position was found in Scientologist writings: Scientology's predecessor in Australia was the Hubbard Association of Scientologist International ("H.A.S.I."), This association had published, at some time not earlier than 1961, a magazine which unequivocally asserted [...] "H.A.S.I. is non-religious -it does not demand any belief or faith nor is it in conflict with faith.

40|$|Summary: In European {{societies}} {{of the early}} 21 st century, the judicialisation of politics and society seems to be ‘a partial aspect of societal evolution’. Politics has become deeply judicialised and the judiciary has become profoundly involved in issues {{which used to be}} the sole domain of ‘pure’ politics. Some talk of ‘the secular papacy’, ie the judiciary of the Modern West playing the role of the 12 th century papacy of the Medieval Western World. Others criticise the rise of ‘juristocracy’ and the decline of popular politics. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} the phenomenon of ‘New Constitutionalism’ started to influence the emerging constitutionalisation of the European Communities in the 1960 s and 1970 s. A specific regime of European ‘constitutional tolerance’ involves constitutional and methodological pluralism among the Union and its Members, including the plurality of views on what is, and whether there is any, Grundnorm of the legal system, or who is the final arbiter of European Constitutionalism. This sort of pluralism makes the domestic judicial acceptance of European doctrines a necessary condition of the proper application of EU law. Thus, it is fair to say that the principle of primacy of European law cannot be understood from the ECJ’s perspective only. Instead, the primacy of EU law is formed by both the ECJ and <b>national</b> <b>high</b> <b>courts...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article assesses {{shifting}} presumptions {{by three}} democracies [...] the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom – {{all of whom}} appear to have permanently adopted some alterations to their detention practices for certain terrorism-related cases since the attacks of September 11, 2001 (hereinafter “ 9 / 11 ”). A review of executive, legislative and judicial outcomes in these three countries often reveals an ongoing tension between the judiciary and the other branches of government, with the judiciary frequently citing to traditional constitutional principles to reassert the primacy of individual liberties and fair trial guarantees. In spite of such rulings, however, the advance towards some system of preventive detention and abridged judicial process for terrorism suspects continues, in various forms, {{in each of these}} countries. It appears that this ongoing tension between some <b>national</b> <b>high</b> <b>courts</b> and political branches of government may be based, in part, on the judicial role of safeguarding constitutional protections, while the other branches have increasingly become reliant upon a form of discourse that may be at odds with those principles, and much of which was developed in a time of perceived emergency. The premises on which detention practices have been altered may not have been fully assessed in the years after 9 / 11 by those in policy-making positions. This ongoing tension and continuing uncertainty as to the status of certain constitutional protections may have larger implications for the viability of long-standing constitutional norms, as well as for larger criminal-justice standards, and those implications must be further examined before any such changes do, indeed, become permanent...|$|R
