The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 250µg for pregnant and breastfeeding women. As many women will <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> this from dietary sources alone, the American Thyroid Association recommends a 150µg daily supplement by mouth.|$|E

5|$|After a {{subsequent}} tour, Iron Maiden {{started working on}} their next studio effort, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which featured more progressive rock elements than the band's previous records. Although it became their second release to top the UK charts, it was also Dickinson's first album with the band that did <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> platinum status in the US. Unlike Somewhere in Time, Dickinson was much more enthusiastic about this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits. After the following tour in 1988, the band {{decided to take a}} year off.|$|E

5|$|After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona {{signed the}} English top-scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, {{but the team}} could <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> success, as Schuster was {{excluded}} from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired {{at the beginning of}} the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory at the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{was named}} in the Spanish squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and he scored Spain's first goal of the tournament, his first {{international}} goal, against Ukraine on 14 June 2006.

5|$|Antara was {{established}} on 13December 1937 in Batavia (later Jakarta), the colonial {{capital of the}} Dutch East Indies. Prior to its establishment, Dominique Willem Berretty had founded Aneta, the Indies' first news agency. A number of Dutch and indigenous firms were also in existence but did <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> similar stature. As a Dutch agency, however, Aneta rarely included local news in its coverage. This led to dissatisfaction among independence activists Soemanang Soerjowinoto and Albert Manoempak Sipahoetar, who eventually decided to form a separate news agency.|$|E

5|$|Bucer {{believed}} that the Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire could be convinced to join the Reformation. Through a series of conferences organised by Charles V, he tried to unite Protestants and Catholics to create a German national church separate from Rome. He did <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> this, as political events led to the Schmalkaldic War and the retreat of Protestantism within the Empire. In 1548, Bucer was persuaded, under duress, to sign the Augsburg Interim, which imposed certain forms of Catholic worship. However, he continued to promote reforms until the city of Strasbourg accepted the Interim, and forced him to leave.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that Whetstone had reached Hispaniola, Du Casse had already departed. Benbow's force {{subsequently}} sighted the French on 19 August, sailing off Cape Santa Marta. The French had three transports and four warships carrying between 68 and 70 guns, while Benbow commanded seven ships carrying between 50 and 70 guns. The English forces were heavily scattered, and the light winds meant that they were slow to regroup. They did <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> a form of collective order until four in the afternoon, after which a partial engagement was fought, lasting about two hours, until nightfall caused the fleets to temporarily break off.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, {{opposition}} from the two mainline companies that the line was intended to connect, and World War I, led {{to the start of}} construction work being delayed until 1927. The line was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E

He was the third highest point-scorer in the tournament, behind Henrik and Milan Kraft of the Czech Republic. Again, Sweden failed to earn a medal, finishing in fifth place. At the Men's World Championships, Daniel and Henrik both recorded five points; they were the youngest players on the squad. Sweden did <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> a medal, however, losing to Finland in the tournament quarterfinal.|$|E
5|$|Operation Gisela did <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> its {{intended}} outcome. It did not deliver the mass casualties that Schmid hoped for {{and it did}} not disrupt British bombing operations. The very next night, a small-scale repeat-operation was attempted but had made no impact. The size of the German force was {{less than a quarter of}} what Schmid had originally hoped could be mustered. One source referred to Gisela as the swansong of the German night fighter force. During the course of the operation, the last German aircraft to be brought down over British soil crashed.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> the desired effect.|$|E

Somerset CCC was formed in 1875, but the club did <b>not</b> <b>achieve</b> first class status until 1891.

30|$|Having perfect Gaussian blur in {{the images}} and {{disregarding}} that the desired blur strength Θ is <b>not</b> <b>achieved</b> exactly, the method leads to theoretically perfect invariance.

In the discrete case, besides that Θ is <b>not</b> <b>achieved</b> exactly, an error is furthermore obtained due to the discrete image sampling.|$|R
