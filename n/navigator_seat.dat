40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the pas-senger head-tilt strategy on the severity of carsickness in lateral acceleration situations in automobiles. Background: It is well known that the driver is generally less susceptible to carsickness than are the passengers. However, it is also known that the driver tilts his or her head toward the curve center when negotiating a curve, whereas the passenger’s head moves in the opposite direction. Therefore, we hypothesized that the head-tilt strategy has the effect of reducing the severity of carsickness. Method: A passenger car was driven on a quasi-oval track with a pylon slalom while the participant sat in the <b>navigator</b> <b>seat.</b> The experiment was terminated when either the participant felt the initial symptoms of motion sickness or the car finished 20 laps. In the natural head-tilt condition, the participants were instructed to sit naturally, to relax, and not to oppose the lateral acceleration intentionally. In the active head-tilt condition, {{the participants were asked to}} tilt their heads against the centrifugal acceleration, thus imitating the driver’s head tilt. Results: The number of laps achieved in the active condition was significantly greater than that in the natural condition. In addition, the subjective ratings of motion sickness and symptoms in the active condition were significantly lower than those in the natural condition. Conclusion: We suggest that an active head tilt against centrifugal acceleration reduces the severity of motion sickness. Application: Potential applications of this study include development of a methodology to reduce carsickness...|$|E
50|$|The pilot {{attempted}} {{to regain control}} {{but was unable to}} and he and the co-pilot both ejected. The low level made it impossible for Squadron Leader Stroud (Howard's regular co-pilot who was in the aircraft's radar <b>navigator's</b> <b>seat),</b> Squadron Leader Eames, Squadron Leader Gamble, and Frederick Bassett to exit the aircraft and they were killed.|$|R
50|$|That summer, British {{pilots were}} being trained in {{instrument}} flying at Bryan Field. When {{they saw that}} the Americans were evacuating their AT-6 Texan trainers {{in the face of}} the storm, they began questioning the construction of the aircraft. Lead instructor Colonel Joe Duckworth took one of the trainers out and flew it straight into the eye of the storm. After he returned safely with navigator Lt. Ralph O'Hair, the base's weather officer, Lt. William Jones-Burdick, took over the <b>navigator's</b> <b>seat</b> and Duckworth flew into the storm a second time.|$|R
50|$|The Tu-128 had a broad, low/mid-mounted {{swept wing}} {{carrying}} the {{main landing gear}} in wing-mounted pods, and slab tailplanes. Two Lyulka AL-7F-2 turbojet engines were mounted in the fuselage. The two-man crew of pilot and <b>navigator</b> were <b>seated</b> in tandem.|$|R
500|$|The Petlyakov design bureau {{addressed}} {{these concerns}} in September {{and they were}} tested in the Pe-3bis prototype between September and October. The armament was upgraded with 250rounds provided {{for each of the}} UBK machine guns, a 20mm ShVAK cannon with 250rounds was mounted in the nose and a 12.7mm Berezin UBT machine gun with 180rounds in boxes replaced the 7.62mm ShKAS in the dorsal position. Frontal armor was installed and the <b>navigator's</b> <b>seat</b> armor was thickened with a total weight of [...] Automatic leading edge slats were fitted and the nitrogen fuel tank pressurization system was replaced by one that used inert gases from the engine exhaust.

2500|$|The [...] {{furnishings}} of the Contessa 32 cabin {{are typical}} of boats of her size and vintage. There is a V-shaped berth in the bow, followed by a small head (toilet) to port opposite a wet-locker and shower. The saloon (main cabin area) includes a folding table, with sofas that double as berths, the table lowering to convert the port berth to a double. At the aft end of the saloon next to the companionway, and to port, is a small U-shaped galley, consisting of a stove, sink (fed by an 18-gallon freshwater tank), and a counter. To starboard, there is a chart table, with a quarter berth extending aft of the <b>navigators</b> <b>seat.</b> An inboard marine diesel engine of 15 to 25 horsepower is mounted beneath the cockpit, fed by a 12-gallon fuel tank. Modern boats have a Beta Marine 20 or 25 horsepower engine with folding or feathering propellor, in conventional or hybrid configuration.|$|R
25|$|The 1943 Surprise Hurricane, which struck Houston during World War II, {{marked the}} first {{intentional}} meteorological flight into a hurricane. That summer, British pilots being trained as instrument instructor pilots at Bryan Army Airfield heard that the school was evacuating its AT-6 Texan trainers {{in the face of}} the oncoming hurricane, and began teasing their instructors about the airworthiness of the aircraft. Instrument flying school commander USAAF Lt. Col. Joseph B. Duckworth, a former airline pilot with Eastern Airlines who had developed instrument procedures for the carrier, bet his RAF students that he could safely fly into the storm and return. On 27 July 1943 he took out one of the trainers with 2nd Lt Ralph M. O'Hair navigating and flew it straight into the eye of the storm. After he returned safely, the base's only weather officer, 1st Lt William H. Jones-Burdick, took over the <b>navigator's</b> <b>seat</b> and Duckworth flew into the storm (now over land) a second time, this time recording their observations and measuring temperatures within the storm. The flights demonstrated that hurricane reconnaissance flights were feasible.|$|R
50|$|The cockpit {{housed the}} pilot and {{fighting}} controller's position underneath the canopy, and these two crew members were provided with all-round vision. The <b>navigator</b> was <b>seated</b> aft of the fighting controller and the position included an astrodome for use of a sextant. The bomb aimer's station was housed inside the aircraft's nose, beneath the forward turret and bomb aiming was conducted using optical sights housed in this compartment. For crew comfort on lengthy missions, a rest area was situated just {{to the rear of}} the main cabin.|$|R
5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor <b>navigator's</b> <b>seat</b> in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, a retired {{military}} pilot {{and president of}} the Moosehead Riders Snowmobile Club initiated the annual memorial snowmobile ride in honor of those aboard the B-52. The annual crash site ceremony is attended by representatives from the Maine Air National Guard, the American Legion, the Civil Air Patrol, Maine Warden Service and members of the snowmobile club. There is a color guard, the laying of a wreath, the reading of the names of those who died, a prayer by a military chaplain and the playing of Taps. One engine and the <b>navigator's</b> ejection <b>seat</b> can be viewed at the Clubhouse.|$|R
25|$|The two-man crew, {{pilot and}} <b>navigator,</b> were <b>seated</b> in tandem cockpits, each housed under {{separate}} clamshell canopies. A bombing/navigation radar is housed within an oblique-facing radome underneath the fuselage between the intakes and aft of the cockpit; {{much of the}} Mirage IV's onboard avionics systems, such as the radar communications, navigational instrumentation, and bombing equipment, were produced by Thomson-CSF. Other avionics elements were provided by Dassault itself and SFENA; {{one of the only}} major subsystems not of French origin onboard was the Marconi-built AD.2300 doppler radar. Free-falling munitions could also be aimed using a ventral blister-mounted periscope from the navigator's position.|$|R

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} principally from plywood over spruce longerons, while {{the upper and}} lower forward section were built up from spruce planking in order to achieve the necessary compound curves. As with the wing, the strength of the structure was dependent upon the skin. Fuel was carried in three tanks in the fuselage, two over the wing in front of the cockpit and the third, of only 20 gal capacity, behind it; this could be used to alter the aircraft's trim. The pilot and <b>navigator</b> were <b>seated</b> in tandem in a cockpit set aft of the wing; while dual flight controls were fitted, only one set of flight instruments were installed.|$|R
5000|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} the B-25G. This version relocated the manned dorsal turret to a more forward location on the fuselage just aft of the flight deck. It also featured two additional fixed [...]50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in the nose and in the H-5 onward, four in fuselage-mounted pods. the T13E1 light weight cannon replaced the heavy M4 cannon 75 mm (2.95 in). Single controls from factory with <b>navigator</b> in right <b>seat.</b> (Number made: 1000; two airworthy [...] ) ...|$|R
25|$|The Aldershot was a three-bay biplane, with a {{steel-framed}} fuselage {{structure with}} plywood and fabric covering, and wooden wings. The pilot and <b>navigator</b> were <b>seated</b> {{side by side}} in a cockpit behind the upper wing trailing edge, with additional accommodation for the navigator who was also the bomb-aimer, in a cabin inside the fuselage, which was provided with four circular windows on each side. A gunner sat in a separate cockpit behind the pilot, and was armed with a Lewis gun on a Scarff ring. Another Lewis gun could be fitted to a ventral mounting in the cabin, while there was provision for a fixed, forward-firing Vickers machine gun operated by the pilot, although this was rarely fitted. A bomb bay forward of the cabin could hold eight 250lb (114kg) bombs, with larger bombs being carried externally under the fuselage.|$|R
25|$|Construction of the {{prototype}} began in August 1949, using components from the canceled Tu-73S prototypes, and {{was completed in}} October. The manufacturer's tests were conducted between 13 October 1949 and 21 January 1950. Its State acceptance trials lasted from 23 January to 27 May 1950 and it was accepted for production, provided that {{the problems with the}} KDU-81 turret were resolved and that ejection seats were provided for the pilot and gunner, a hot air deicing was to be fitted and the gun mount in the nose revised. The first five preproduction aircraft did not incorporate these changes as they were built using Tu-73S components, after the factory in Irkutsk had prematurely begun production of that bomber. One of these was sent to Moscow where it was evaluated by Soviet Naval Aviation for use as a torpedo bomber. The sixth aircraft did incorporate all these changes as well as the <b>navigator's</b> ejection <b>seat</b> requested by Naval Aviation, and it was evaluated in May 1951. It was recommended for production as the Tu-14T and entered service in 1952 with Naval Aviation.|$|R
500|$|In December 1953, No.82 (Bomber) Wing, {{headquartered}} at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, took {{delivery of}} Australia's first jet bomber, the English Electric Canberra. Over {{the next five}} years, forty-eight Canberras built in Australia by the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) re-equipped {{all three of the}} wing's flying units, Nos.1, 2 and 6 Squadrons. During this period, operational training of new bomber aircrew was performed [...] "in-house" [...] by the wing, primarily by No.6 Squadron. Aside from its adverse effect on regular flying duties, the task was made technically challenging and potentially dangerous by virtue of the Canberra being designed for only one pilot, with a single control column. On 12January 1959, No.1 (Bomber) Operational Conversion Unit (No.1OCU) was formed at Amberley. Coming under the control of No.82 Wing, its purpose was to convert pilots and navigators to the Canberra, and train them for operations with Nos.1, 2 and 6 Squadrons. On establishment, the unit was commanded by Squadron Leader B.F.M. Rachinger, and equipped with Mk.20 bombers and T.4 trainers. The T.4 was a dual-control model with three seats; the pilot and instructor sat side by side {{at the front of the}} cockpit, and the <b>navigator</b> was <b>seated</b> behind them. Two of these models had been purchased from Britain. The unit was subsequently allocated Mk.21 trainers; GAF built seven of these dual-control models by converting five early Mk.20s and two British-built B.2 bombers. Student aircrew underwent bombing and navigation instruction, as well as simulated operations. The first training course graduated in April 1959.|$|R
