5|$|The {{cetacean}} family Monodontidae comprises two unusual whale species, the <b>narwhal,</b> {{in which}} the male has a long tusk, and the white beluga.|$|E
5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the <b>narwhal.</b> They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time castles were {{becoming}} tourist attractions for the first time. By the 1740s Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter, see curiosities such as the castle's <b>narwhal</b> horn, and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks. The first guidebook to Kenilworth Castle followed in 1777 with many later editions following in the coming decades. By the 1780s and 1790s visitors were beginning to progress as far as Chepstow, where an attractive female guide escorted tourists around the ruins {{as part of the}} popular Wye Tour. In Scotland Blair Castle became a popular attraction on account of its landscaped gardens, as did Stirling Castle with its romantic connections. Caernarfon in North Wales appealed to many visitors, especially artists. Irish castles proved less popular, partially because contemporary tourists regarded the country as being somewhat backward and the ruins therefore failed to provide the necessary romantic contrast with modern life.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-one <b>narwhals</b> tagged in 2003 and 2004 in Admiralty Inlet {{showed a}} {{different}} summer distributional pattern than previous narwhal-tracking studies from Somerset Island, Eclipse Sound and Melville Bay. The migration of the <b>narwhals</b> tracked from Admiralty Inlet moved out through Lancaster Sound 15 days earlier (P < 0. 0001) than the <b>narwhals</b> summering around Eclipse Sound, whereas the Admiralty Inlet <b>narwhals</b> reached {{the mouths of}} Eclipse Sound 18 days later (P < 0. 0001) than the Eclipse Sound summering population. The winter range of the Admiralty Inlet <b>narwhals</b> overlapped with the winter range of <b>narwhals</b> from Melville Bay and Eclipse Sound in central southern Baffin Bay and Northern Davis Strait, {{but not with the}} winter range of <b>narwhals</b> from Somerset Island that wintered further north. Distribution size of range, and population size {{did not appear to be}} related. An example of considerable year to year variation between area of summer and winter distribution in the 2 years was believed to be related to the sample size and number of pods of whales tagged, rather than to differences in sex or age classes...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Narwhals</b> feature several intercollegiate teams: {{basketball}} (2009), {{cross country}} (2010), cycling (2013), soccer (2013), tennis (2014), ultimate Frisbee (2014). The New School <b>Narwhals</b> are an independent school, unaffiliated with the NCAA, but regularly compete against NCAA Division III schools.|$|R
50|$|The {{occurrence}} of tusks in Odobenocetops is a convergence with <b>narwhals.</b> However, in <b>narwhals</b> the male tusk is {{implanted in the}} left maxilla, whereas in Odobenocetops it is implanted in the right premaxilla. The tusks in these two genera are therefore not homologous.|$|R
5|$|Stanton wanted EVE {{to be at}} {{the higher}} end of technology, and asked iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a <b>narwhal</b> because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E

25|$|Legends {{and names}} {{referring}} to a special type of unicorn or mysterious beast with one horn, {{as opposed to the}} delicate imaginary unicorns of Europe based on <b>narwhal</b> horns, are scattered across the former range of Elasmotherium from China to Eastern Europe.

25|$|Several {{species of}} marine mammals {{can be seen}} in the park’s area: ringed seals (Phoca hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) live there in large numbers, and from time to time a walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), common seal (harbour seal, Phoca vitulina), a beluga (Delphinapterus leucas), a <b>narwhal</b> (Monodon monoceros), or a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) may appear in Wager Bay.|$|E

50|$|The tusks are {{surrounded}} posteriorly, ventrally, and laterally by several small vestigial teeth which vary in morphology and histology. These teeth {{can sometimes be}} extruded from the bone, but mainly reside inside open tooth sockets in the <b>narwhal’s</b> snout alongside the tusks. The varied morphology and anatomy of small teeth indicate a path of evolutionary obsolescence, leaving the <b>narwhal's</b> mouth toothless.|$|R
40|$|Samples of 150 <b>narwhals</b> {{obtained}} in different years from two West Greenland areas, Avanersuaq and Uummannaq, were compared for concentrations of and regional differences in heavy metals and organochlorines and stable-carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Cadmium, Hg, and Se concentrations {{increased in the}} first 3 - 4 years of the animal's life, after which no dependence on age was observed. Females had significantly higher concentrations of Cd in all tissues and of Hg and Se in liver than males. No consistent difference in metal levels between <b>narwhals</b> from Avanersuaq and Uummarmaq was found. Year-to-year variation in metal levels at one location was larger than the geographical variation. Metal levels were {{within the range of}} previous published results for <b>narwhals</b> from Arctic Canada. Organochlorine (OC) concentrations in blubber of <b>narwhals</b> were dependent on age and sex. Females showed decreasing OC concentration in the first 8 - 10 years, while for males increases were detected in {{the first few years of}} life, after which the concentrations became stable. Few statistical differences in mean OC concentrations among individuals were observed. However, <b>narwhals</b> from Avanersuaq in 1993 had the lowest levels, indicating a temporal decrease of SigmaPCBs. SigmaPCBs, DDTs, HCHs and toxaphenes seem to be at similar levels in West Greenland and Arctic Canada, which can be explained by the close winter distributions of populations as well as large ranges in concentrations, time span, number of analyses and the size/age composition of the data. PCB and DDT concentrations in West Greenland <b>narwhals</b> were half those found in East Greenland and Svalbard. Stable-carbon isotope ratios in muscle of 150 <b>narwhals</b> showed a decreasing trend in the first year when they gradually reduced their dependency on mother's milk, after which they became relatively stable. delta(15) N values were significantly higher in samples from Uummarmaq in 1993 compared to samples from Avanersuaq in 1984 and 1985 indicating that the diet of the <b>narwhals</b> in Uummannaq was at a higher trophic level. However, only a few significant correlations were found between stable isotope ratios and metal and OC concentrations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|The beluga {{was first}} {{described}} in 1776 by Peter Simon Pallas. It {{is a member}} of the Monodontidae family, which is in turn part of the parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). The Irrawaddy dolphin was once placed in the same family; recent genetic evidence suggests these dolphins belong to the Delphinidae family. The <b>narwhal</b> is the only other species within the Monodontidae besides the beluga. A skull has been discovered with intermediate characteristics supporting the hypothesis that hybridization is possible between these two families.|$|E
25|$|Among {{numerous}} finds {{of prehistoric}} bones found at Unicorn Cave in Germany's Harz Mountains, some were selected and reconstructed {{by the mayor}} of Magdeburg, Otto Von Guericke, as a unicorn in 1663 (illustration, right). Guericke's so-called unicorn had only two legs, and was constructed from fossil bones of a woolly rhinoceros and a mammoth, with the horn of a <b>narwhal.</b> The skeleton was examined by Gottfried Leibniz, who had previously doubted {{the existence of the}} unicorn, but was convinced by it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Seven <b>narwhals</b> (Monodon monoceros) were {{instrumented}} with satellite transmitters in Tremblay Sound, northeast Canada in August 1999. The whales were tracked for 5 – 218 {{days with}} positions received until 17 March 2000. All whales {{stayed in the}} fjord system where they were tagged {{until the end of}} August. Three whales went northwest visiting adjacent fjords before moving south, together with the three other whales, along the east coast of Baffin Island. The <b>narwhals</b> ar-rived on the wintering ground in northern Davis Strait in late October. Speed and range of movements declined once the wintering ground was reached. Dive depths increased from summer to autumn, and reached at least 1, 500 m. Late summer and winter kernel home ranges were approximately 3, 400 km 2 and 12, 000 km 2, respec-tively. The relative abundance of whales on the winter-ing ground was 936 <b>narwhals.</b> Assuming that the home range defines the winter distribution of the stock, an estimated 5, 348 <b>narwhals</b> (corrected for perception and availability bias) were present in this area...|$|R

25|$|Early whaling captains {{and their}} crews were well-paid if the boats netted their prey. In 1907, for instance, George Leavitt and his vessel <b>Narwhal,</b> steam whaler, took some 15 bowhead whales. In such cases, the captain {{received}} one-twelfth of the take; the first mate one 22nd; the second mate one 30th; the third mate one 45th. Other sailors aboard received smaller percentages of the haul, {{down to the}} so-called 'green hands', who received one 200th. The engineers aboard ship received a straight salary of $120 a month.|$|E
25|$|In European folklore, {{the unicorn}} is often {{depicted}} as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long horn and cloven hooves (sometimes a goat's beard). In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could only be captured by a virgin. In the encyclopedias its horn {{was said to have}} the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the <b>narwhal</b> was sometimes sold as unicorn horn.|$|E
25|$|The sagas mention Icelanders {{traveling}} to Greenland to trade. Settlement chieftains and large farm owners controlled this trade. Chieftains would {{trade with the}} foreign ships and then disperse the goods by trading with the surrounding farmers. The Greenlanders' main commodity was the walrus tusk, which was used primarily in Europe {{as a substitute for}} elephant ivory for art décor, whose trade had been blocked by conflict with the Islamic world. Professor Gudmundsson suggests a very valuable <b>narwhal</b> tusk trade, through a smuggling route between western Iceland and the Orkney islands.|$|E
50|$|The {{pigmentation}} of <b>narwhals</b> is a mottled pattern, with blackish-brown markings over a white background. They are darkest when {{born and}} become whiter with age; white patches develop on the navel and genital slit at sexual maturity. Old males may be almost pure white. <b>Narwhals</b> {{do not have}} a dorsal fin, possibly an evolutionary adaptation to swimming easily under ice. Their neck vertebrae are jointed, like those of land mammals, instead of being fused together as in most whales. Both these characteristics are shared by the beluga whale. The tail flukes of female <b>narwhals</b> have front edges that are swept back, and those of males have front edges that are more concave and lack a sweep-back. This is thought to be an adaptation for reducing drag caused by the tusk.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Free-ranging <b>narwhals</b> (Monodon monoceros) were {{instrumented}} in Admiralty Inlet, Canada {{with both}} satellite tags to study migration and stock separation and short-term, high-resolution digital archival tags to explore diving and feeding behaviour. Three <b>narwhals</b> were {{equipped with an}} underwater camera pod (Crittercam), another individual was equipped with a digital archival tag (DTAG), and a fifth with both units during August 2003 and 2004. Results Crittercam footage indicated that of the combined 286 minutes of recordings, 12 % of the time was spent along the bottom. When the bottom was visible in the camera footage, the <b>narwhals</b> were oriented upside-down 80 % of the time (range: 61100 %). The DTAG data (14. 6 hours of recordings) revealed that during time spent below the surface, the two tagged <b>narwhals</b> were supine an average of 13 % (range: 9 – 18 %) of the time. Roughly 70 % of this time spent in a supine posture occurred during the descent. Conclusion Possible reasons for this upside-down swimming behaviour are discussed. No preference for a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction of roll was observed, discounting the possibility that rolling movements contribute to the asymmetric left-handed helical turns of the tusk. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ages {{of marine}} mammals have {{traditionally}} been estimated by counting dentinal growth layers in teeth. However, this method is difficult to use on <b>narwhals</b> (Monodon monoceros) because of their special tooth structures. Alternative methods are therefore needed. The aspartic acid racemization (AAR) technique {{has been used in}} age estimation studies of cetaceans, including <b>narwhals.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate a species-specific racemization rate for <b>narwhals</b> by regressing aspartic acid d/l ratios in eye lens nuclei against growth layer groups in tusks (n= 9). Two racemization rates were estimated: one by linear regression (r 2 = 0. 98) based on the assumption that age was known without error, and one based on a bootstrap study, taking into account the uncertainty in the age estimation (r 2 between 0. 88 and 0. 98). The two estimated 2 kAsp values were identical up to two significant figures. The 2 k Asp value from the bootstrap study was found to be 0. 00229 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 000089 SE, which corresponds to a racemization rate of 0. 00114 &#x 2212;yr&#x 00 B 1; 0. 000044 SE. The intercept of 0. 0580 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 00185 SE corresponds to twice the (d/l) 0 value, which is then 0. 0290 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 00093 SE. We propose that this species-specific racemization rate and (d/l) 0 value be used in future AAR age estimation studies of <b>narwhals,</b> but also recommend the collection of tusks and eyes of <b>narwhals</b> for further improving the (d/l) 0 and 2 kAsp estimates obtained in this study...|$|R

During this time, when the steam whaler <b>Narwhal</b> was {{wintering}} at Herschel Island in 190607 with Leavitt as her captain, the Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson first met Leavitt and his Native guide. Leavitt and the explorer {{went on to}} become fast friends, with Leavitt often offering advice on the area to Stefansson, as well as bringing him supplies from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. In 1908, Stefansson hired Leavitt's Native guide, who went on to aid the Arctic explorer on his subsequent expeditions.|$|E
