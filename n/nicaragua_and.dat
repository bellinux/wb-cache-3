5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, hawksbills {{are known to}} occur from the Baja Peninsula in Mexico south along the coast to {{southern}} Peru. Nonetheless, as recently as 2007, the species had been considered largely extirpated in the region. Important remnant nesting and foraging sites have since been discovered in Mexico, El Salvador, <b>Nicaragua,</b> <b>and</b> Ecuador, providing new opportunities for research and conservation. In contrast to their traditional roles {{in other parts of}} the world, where hawksbills primarily inhabit coral reefs and rocky substrate areas, in the eastern Pacific, hawksbills tend to forage and nest principally in mangrove estuaries, such as those present in the Bahia de Jiquilisco (El Salvador), Gulf of Fonseca (Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras), Estero Padre Ramos (<b>Nicaragua),</b> <b>and</b> the Gulf of Guayaquil (Ecuador). Multi-national initiatives, such as the , are currently pushing efforts to research and conserve the population, which remains poorly understood.|$|E

The regional elites supported {{the terms of the}} Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{very weak}} storm, forecasters were wary about Katrina, as Central America was devastated by Hurricane Mitch exactly one year earlier. There was {{considerable}} fear of additional flash flooding and mudslides across the mountainous region. Immediately after being declared a tropical depression, a tropical storm warning was issued for <b>Nicaragua,</b> <b>and</b> it was extended to the San Andrés islands of Colombia shortly afterward. Officials in Honduras evacuated 71 families from the district of Colón and another 17 families from other at-risk areas. Along the coastline of Honduras, a red alert was declared as torrential rains were anticipated to produce deadly mudslides in areas still recovering from Mitch nearly one year ago.|$|E

5|$|The {{meteorological}} {{history of}} Hurricane Gordon {{consisted of a}} thirteen-day {{period in which the}} storm's path was erratic, persistent, and highly unusual. The hurricane formed near Panama in the southwestern Caribbean on November 9, 1994.

Strengthening slightly into a tropical storm, Gordon wound its way north into the Greater Antilles. Despite warm waters, persistent wind shear prevented significant strengthening. Executing a slow turn to the north and then the northwest, Gordon made two more landfalls, on eastern Jamaica and eastern Cuba, while delivering tremendous rains to western Hispaniola.|$|E
