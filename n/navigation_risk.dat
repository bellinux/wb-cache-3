The proposed rover safety module is composed of two distinct components: safe attitude (pitch and roll) management and safe traction management. Fuzzy logic approaches to reasoning about safe attitude and traction management are presented, wherein inertial sensing of safety status and vision-based neural network perception of terrain quality are used to infer safe speeds of traversal.

40|$|Fast {{ships are}} taking a {{relevant}} role with a clear interest for military purposes. Fast sea transportation encounters several problems to be solved. This article refers to the difficulties originated by brisk vertical motions. The waves encountered by fast ships induce such vertical motions, and this has negative effects: <b>navigation</b> <b>risks,</b> sea sickness, structural damages, and load displacement. It is also interesting for military uses to stabilize the ship when an aircraft is landing or when precision firing is required. By means of submerged actuators, {{it is possible to}} alleviate vertical motions. In this research, a pair of transom flaps and a T-foil near the bow are used to counteract the waves. These actuators must move with the maximum efficiency, taking into account the dynamical characteristics of the ship. As a consequence, there is a problem of automatic control design. To carry out this design, it is important to obtain mathematical models of all the aspects involved in the problem: the ship, the waves, the actuators, and the effect on crew and comfort.

40|$|Ship {{navigation}} {{is determined}} by the ship’s position on a certain part of the fairway from the place of departure to the place of arrival. During the voyage, in a given period of time ship changes the course and the speed. Navigation itself can be viewed from the aspect when during the voyage all onboard systems are functioning properly and the person managing the ship practices good seamanship, and from the aspect when an extraordinary event occurs, which affects the possibility of maintaining the desired course and/or speed. This paper analyzes the movement of the ship in case of an extraordinary event with the assumption that the malfunction occurred in the steering system. Depending on the navigation area and the sea traffi c, such an event generates two basic maritime <b>navigation</b> <b>risks,</b> the risk of ship grounding and the risk of collision. This paper explores ship movement that, depending on the scenario, may result in ship grounding. For the purposes of conducting research on ship movement due to the assumed extraordinary event onboard, various scenarios were defi ned. To create a track model, an Euler spiral/clothoid was chosen. By modifying the parametric clothoid equation, a curve was obtained which very well approximated the curve of a turning ship. Furthermore, developed was the speed change model that can show the speed change at any point of the curve of a turning ship when the rudder defl ection was constant, and the engine was stopped. The designed models were tested in 60 scenarios in accordance to which the research on the navigation simulator was carried out. Ship track model can be used in the fi eld of research for simulation model development, the result of which will enable determining the extent of grounding damage, and after determining the extent of grounding consequences, it will enable the defi ning of acceptable risk as well...|$|R

40|$|A water {{traffic system}} is a huge, nonlinear, complex system, and its {{stability}} is affected by various factors. Water traffic accidents can {{be considered to be}} a kind of mutation of a water traffic system caused by the coupling of multiple navigational environment factors. In this study, the catastrophe theory, principal component analysis (PCA), and multivariate statistics are integrated to establish a situation recognition model for a navigational environment with the aim of performing a quantitative analysis of the situation of this environment via the extraction and classification of its key influencing factors; in this model, the natural environment and traffic environment are considered to be two control variables. The Three Gorges Reservoir area of the Yangtze River is considered as an example, and six critical factors, i. e., the visibility, wind, current velocity, route intersection, channel dimension, and traffic flow, are classified into two principal components: the natural environment and traffic environment.

40|$|This work employs in situ {{measurement}} {{data and}} constructive simulations to examine the underlying physical mechanisms that drive spacecraft plume interactions with the space environment in low‐Earth orbit. The study centers on observations of the enhanced flux of plasma generated during a maneuver of Space Shuttle Endeavour {{as part of the}} Sensor Test for Orion Relative <b>Navigation</b> <b>Risk</b> Mitigation experiment in May 2011. The Canary electrostatic analyzer (ESA) instrument mounted on the portside truss of the International Space Station indicated an elevated ion current during the shuttle maneuver. The apparent source of enhanced ion current is a result of interaction of the spacecraft thruster plume with the rarefied ambient ionosphere, which generates regions of relatively high density plasma through charge exchange between the neutral plume and ambient ions. To reconstruct this event, unsteady simulation data were generated using a combined direct simulation Monte Carlo/particle‐in‐cell methodology, which employed detailed charge exchange cross‐section data and a magnetic field model. The simulation provides local plasma characteristics at the ESA sensor location, and a sensor model is subsequently used to transform the local properties into a prediction of measured ion current. The predicted and observed total currents are presented as a function of time over a 30 s period of pulsed thruster firings. A strong correlation is observed in the temporal characteristics of the simulated and measured total current, and good agreement is also achieved in the total current predicted by the model. These results support conclusions that (1) the enhanced flux of plasma observed by the ESA instrument is associated with Space Shuttle thruster firings and (2) the simulation model captures the essential features of the plume interactions based on the observation data.

40|$|The rapid {{economic}} growth of Taiwan has been paralleled {{by an increase in}} marine. traffic in the port of Keelung. The increase has been evolutionary and, prior to this study, has lacked the benefit of supporting research necessary to ensure no loss in navigational efficiency. The study uses eclectic methodologies to: identify the nature of marine traffic at Keelung; assess the associated risks; and identify measures needed to reduce risk and increase navigational efficiency. For contextual purposes the study reviews current marine traffic operations at Keelung against the background of geographical constraint and environmental conditions. Radar survey and extensive sampling of professional opinion indicate that existent traffic control measures are both inadequate and open to contravention. Casualty analysis further identifies areas of concern where <b>navigation</b> <b>risk</b> has been shown to exist In particular the traffic separation scheme, introduced in 1990; has been found inadequate and lack of movement control reduces navigational efficiency. Use of visual simulators, at Taiwan Ocean University and University of Plymouth, provided a unique opportunity to compare present marine traffic operations against a modified model. The modified model incorporated limited vessel traffic service functions and channel markers, neither of which exist at present in the live situation. Most significantly the experiment has enabled evaluation of the difference between Taiwanese and foreign ship masters when handling ships in the port approaches. Analysis of ship's tracks, and subjects' perceptions, concludes that provision of channel markers and sequence control greatly simplifies the operation and reduces risk. The need to widen the traffic lanes by reducing the separation zone between inward and outward lanes is identified. The study shows that navigational safety and efficiency at Keelung can be improved through the introduction of small changes to operation and working practices, The study provides the basis for a programme of continuing work necessary to maintain or further improve standards once the recommendations of the study have been implemented.

These flows are influenced in support of a number of activities including, commercial <b>navigation,</b> flood <b>risk</b> mitigation, hydroelectric generation, municipal water supply, recreation, and water quality control. Within the realm of flood risk mitigation, the TVA routinely must model the effects of water release practices on the likelihood and magnitude of possible flooding in specific geographic areas. Projected flows are translated into pool elevations that must then be used to estimate expected flood damages. Within this process, the TVA has carefully documented the likely damages to residential and commercial properties, as well as their contents. However, damages to transportation infrastructures have traditionally been captured through the application of a scalar value that is, in fact, intended to reflect a number of ancillary flood damages. Experience, however, suggests that the proportion of total event damages attributable to transportation infrastructure destruction may vary significantly based on the characteristics of individual floods. Specifically, floods that involve significant flows damage both transportation infrastructures and other structures. However, in the absence of such flow...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to provide a {{systematic}} study of stakeholder partnership building of BP in Colombia and Hoechst in Germany {{in the context of}} social risk management. Each company built an NGO and a community partnership that became an integral part of firms' strategy. In examining and evaluating the two companies and the four stakeholder partnerships, the leading research question of how firms build stakeholder partnerships is answered. The present study seeks to identify the characteristics of stakeholder partnership building, as well as to isolate the similarities and differences of this process. Additionally, it is an attempt to define the features of the firms' social <b>risk</b> <b>navigation</b> as context of this research project. The thesis is divided into four parts. The first part introduces the research phenomenon, reviews conceptual foundations, and elaborates methodological issues. The case studies of BP and Hoechst are subdivided into internal processes of social integration and reintegration with regard to the two companies, and external processes of partnership building with regard to the four stakeholder partnerships that are chronologically presented in part two. Part three conceptualises stakeholder partnership building in terms of navigating social risk and partnership alchemy. Finally, part four comprises the research synopsis and reflection. Business and society, stakeholder theory, and strategic relationships are the theoretical areas that contributed to the framework for analysing partnership building. Two longitudinal in-depth case studies provide qualitative data for the processual analysis. The empirical data are categorised, aggregated and compared, in order to extract research findings. The contribution of this research is the extension of behavioural stakeholder theory. It develops is a stakeholder partnership building theory that comprises three parts. First, the 4 -Ps of stakeholder partnership building are identified. Second, variables are isolated that describe these elements of partnership alchemy. Finally, four patterns of stakeholder partnership building are identified. As a result, the research presents four propositions for partnership building. Based on the analysis of firms' <b>navigation</b> of social <b>risk,</b> a fifth proposition distinguishes between firm-specific and partnership-specific partnership building.

Drugs research has been traditionally based on the identification, weighting and interrelatedness of risk and protective factors within a "risk prevention paradigm". This paradigm has been criticised for its lack of inclusion of individual, group and wider structural aspects, and occurs within a greater awareness of greater social discourse and societal shifts. The research papers in this portfolio of work are thematically analysed and conceptualised within the theoretical framework of cognitive and structural social capital. The descriptive research and later, more conceptual papers investigating drug use among rural youth, Travellers and cocaine use, are thereby explored in terms of the potential ‘normalisation of rural youth drug use’ within contemporary risk discourse, the assimilatory threat of increasing drug use among the ‘Traveller community’., and the emergence of the ‘recreational cocaine user’ in Irish society. The social processes of individualisation, reciprocity and trust which constitute social capital are deemed to provide potent collective frameworks for the <b>navigation</b> of <b>risk</b> in day to day ‘localised’ settings. The ‘interrelated normative frameworks’ and ‘processes of risk neutralisation’ are underpinned within a wider social capital understanding of the meaning of drug activity in associational life based on ‘interpersonal and institutional trust’ and ‘mutual resource acquisition’. Contemporary drug policies must consider the contextual constraints of the ‘risk society’, which impact on inherent individual ‘power resources’, whereby individual agency and drug taking is better understood within situational agency of ‘localised’ social, gender, ethnic and cultural capital...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} the safety culture and hazard risk {{perception}} {{has been carried out}} involving 77 maritime pilots around Australia and New Zealand, representing more than the 20 % of the maritime pilots in each country, in proportional geographic distribution. In 82 % of the cases, interviews were carried out face-to-face, based on a questionnaire designed to be completed in less than 1 Â hour. Questions on 4 different aspects were asked, relating to each pilot's professional background, safety culture and perception of <b>risks,</b> <b>navigation</b> and pilotage hazards and their perception of the pilot's role. The responses indicated that there are issues with regulator identification, commercial pressures on pilots in some locations, incident reporting mechanisms and feedback, training opportunities and improved bridge resource management. In addition to reviewing comments made by pilots, the paper also presents recommendations for consideration in improving operational performance and safety of navigation in ports and regulated waterways. These recommendations can be used by regulators to improve their performance concerning pilotage matters and understand pilots' concerns.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a GPS-based navigation system {{designed for the}} University of New South Wales (UNSW) BLUEsat microsatellite. BLUEsat is a research-focussed low earth orbit microsatellite project designed and built entirely by students. Through {{the use of a}} modified, off-the-shelf GPS receiver, position, velocity and time data can be robustly provided in a highly dynamic environment. To allow a standard GPS receiver to function in space, many software and hardware modifications are necessary. Hardware and software interfaces have been carefully designed to allow integration within the BlueSat project. A Mitel GPS-chipset Software Development Kit (SDK) was available. The SDK consists of all source code that “drives ” a GPS receiver, permitting all operations of the GPS receiver to be examined and, if necessary, permitting new algorithms for signal acquisition, tracking and navigation solution to be developed and tested. A modified Canadian Marconi Corporation AllStar GPS boardset was used as the baseline receiver hardware. The AllStar is based on a twelve-channel GPS chipset, consisting primarily of the GP 2015 RF frontend and the GP 2021 correlator chip. A 40 MHz ARM 60 microprocessor provides overall control of the system. Three RS- 232 ports are available – two for general input/output and one for debugging. This hardware had to be interfaced to the main BlueSat computer. Techniques have been developed for processing the data and providing the system with <b>navigation</b> criteria. <b>Risk</b> mitigation is also examined. Limited testing has been performed, with the high velocity receiver able to robustly track GPS signals. The system’s firmware is currently being ported to a new generation hardware platform provided by the Australian company Signav Pty Ltd (SIGNAV, 2003). Further testing will be carried out when a multi-channel GPS constellation simulator becomes available. 1...|$|R
