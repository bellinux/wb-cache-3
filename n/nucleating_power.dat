40|$|International audienceNew {{synthetic}} talcs {{were incorporated}} into a polyolefin matrix to prepare synthetic talc polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites via melt mixing. Different routes of physicochemical modifications of short range (cation exchange or silane grafting) or long range (compatibilizer) order were carried out to achieve an optimized dispersion state. A statistical TEM image analysis methodology was developed to evaluate more quantitatively the dispersion state of the talc particles within the PP matrix. Natural talc was taken as a reference in order to compare its <b>nucleating</b> <b>power</b> and its dispersion capacity {{with that of the}} synthetic talcs in the same grade of PP. Even though natural talc acts as the most efficient nucleating agent, the organophilic surface treatment enhances significantly the nucleating effect of the synthetic talcs. By coupling the incorporation of a compatibilizer with a suitable organophilic surface treatment, the synthetic talcs can be also better dispersed than their natural counterpart, giving rise to the formation of a heat shield that delays the thermal degradation of the filled matrix...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{heterogeneous}} nucleation {{of solid}} silicon is studied when molten droplets solidify on various substrates. An experimental installation {{has been developed}} in order to record in real time the melting solidification process, measure the undercooling temperature {{and look at the}} solidification of the droplets. Three different categories of substrate materials are studied: oxides (silica, zyarock and sapphire), nitrides (silica+oxidized Si 3 N 4 coating, zyarock+oxidized Si 3 N 4 coating, sintered Si 3 N 4, PBN and HIP-BN) and carbon-containing (isostatic graphite, glassy carbon and SiC). Higher undercooling values are measured in the case of oxide substrates where the solidified droplet is found to be mainly composed of a single-crystal. In the case of nitride substrates, a dissolution/precipitation process takes place and beta-phase Si 3 N 4 precipitates are found to act as nucleation centers for the silicon solidification. The <b>nucleating</b> <b>power</b> of Si 3 N 4 is attributed to the good epitaxial fit with silicon. Oxidation of Si 3 N 4 powder at a higher temperature increases the undercooling of the droplet. When the silicon droplet is solidified on BN substrates, BN particles are detected {{on the surface of the}} droplet as well as a Si 3 N 4 layer at the substrate/Si interface which promotes nucleation. Carbon-containing substrates are found to favor the nucleation of silicon due to the creation of a SiC layer at the substrate/silicon interface and precipitation of SiC particles in the droplets. However, no explanation of the important nucleating effect of SiC has been found. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Amorphous {{conducting}} carbon films deposited over quartz substrates were analysed using X-ray diffraction and AFM technique. X-ray diffraction data reveal {{disorder and}} roughness {{in the plane}} of graph ne sheet as {{compared to that of}} graphite. This roughness increases with decrease in preparation temperature. The AFM data shows surface roughness of carbon films depending on preparation temperatures. The surface roughness increases with decrease in preparation temperature. Also some nucleating islands were seen on the samples prepared at 900 °C, which are not present on the films prepared at 700 °C. Detailed analysis of these islands reveals distorted graphitic lattice arrangement. So we believe these islands to be <b>nucleating</b> graphitic. <b>Power</b> spectrum density (PSD) analysis of the carbon surface indicates a transition from the nonliear growth mode to linear surface-diffusion dominated growth mode resulting in a relatively smoother surface as one moves from low preparation temperature to high preparation temperatur. The amorphous carbon films deposited over a rough quartz substrate reveal nucleating diamond like structures. The density of these nucleating diamond like structures was found to be independent of substrate temperature (700 – 900 °C) ...|$|R
