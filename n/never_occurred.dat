The conversion, however, <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> Ultimately, the ship was broken up between May 1944 and October 1946 in Bremerhaven. Her bell now resides in the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Danny {{had only}} minor effects on land. However, it {{triggered}} high surf and rip currents from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina. The cyclone's remnants contributed to widespread rainfall in the northeast United States. At one point, some weather forecasts predicted Danny to rapidly strengthen, and hit Nantucket as a Category 1 Hurricane, although this <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> Localized flooding was reported, particularly in Pennsylvania. It later caused heavy precipitation and power outages in Atlantic Canada.|$|E

5|$|During its operation, Virgin Atlantic Little Red's fleet {{consisted}} of four Airbus A320s wet leased from Aer Lingus under a three-year contract. The aircraft had 29 rows of seating with a 3–3 configuration, {{for a total}} of 174 seats. The fleet was painted with Virgin Atlantic livery with future plans to eventually repaint them with Little Red livery. However, due to the closure of operations, this rebrand of the planes <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> and they retained their original livery.|$|E
5|$|Hannover {{was struck}} from the navy list in 1936 and {{destined for the}} scrapyard. There were ideas to rebuild her as a target ship {{especially}} for aircraft, although this <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including a stop in Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E

5|$|The 1997 Castlevania Legends for the Game Boy was Alucard's third {{appearance}} in the series. Similar to his initial {{appearance in}} Dracula's Curse, he is a boss challenging {{the skills of the}} game's protagonist, Sonia Belmont. After she defeats him, he accepts her strength and decides to submerge his powers by sleeping, believing that she will defeat Dracula in his stead. Koji Igarashi later removed Castlevania Legends from the official canon of the series, meaning that the plot of the game <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> in the series' continuity.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin {{became a}} monk in about 1170, and then abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Forde. He {{was well known}} as a canonist, and often acted as a judge-delegate for the papacy, hearing cases that had reached the Roman Curia and been remanded to local experts for decision. In 1166, Baldwin was the {{addressee}} of a work by John of Salisbury, Expectiatione longa, {{which was one of}} the tracts written during the Becket controversy. It was probably at this time that Baldwin wrote De sacramento altaris. In 1175 he served with his old bishop, Bartholomew, as joint papal judge in a dispute between Malmesbury Abbey and Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury. In 1178 he was recommended to Pope Alexander as a possible candidate for a cardinalship, but this <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in the domain name would have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself defamatory had likely <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> before in the field of information technology law.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{indicate}} river otters were once populous throughout most major drainages {{in the continental}} United States and Canada prior to European settlement. North America’s largest otter populations were found in areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats, such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England. In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but practical, otter populations. The otter existed on {{all parts of the}} Pacific Coast, including the seashore and inland streams and lakes. However, large populations <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the xeric shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, the otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas.|$|E

5|$|Officially {{having no}} role in the {{provisional}} government, Castro exercised a great deal of influence, largely because of his popularity and control of the rebel army. Ensuring the government implemented policies to cut corruption and fight illiteracy, he did not initially force through any radical proposals. Attempting to rid Cuba's government of Batistanos, the Congress elected under Batista was abolished, and all those elected in the rigged elections of 1954 and 1958 were banned from politics. The government now ruling by decree, Castro pushed the president to issue a temporary ban on all political parties, but repeatedly stated that they would get around to organizing multiparty elections; this <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> He began meeting members of the Popular Socialist Party, believing they had the intellectual capacity to form a socialist government, but repeatedly denied being a communist himself.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1999 the 24th Infantry Division was reactivated, {{this time}} at Fort Riley, Kansas. From 1999 to 2006, the 24th Infantry Division {{consisted}} of a headquarters and three separate National Guard brigades; the 30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team at Clinton, North Carolina, the 218th Heavy Brigade Combat Team at Columbia, South Carolina, and the 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in Macon, Georgia. The division headquarters {{was responsible for the}} Guard brigades should they be called to active duty in wartime. This <b>never</b> <b>occurred,</b> as each brigade deployed individually. The division's final operations included preparing Fort Riley for the return of the 1st Infantry Division, which was stationed in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Route64 was {{designated}} originally as an alignment of Route31A, a spur off of State Highway Route31 (currently U.S. Route206) from Princeton eastward to Hightstown, where it met State Highway Route33. The state planned on turning the alignment into a full-fledged expressway for several decades, including constructing the alignment that Route 64 currently uses in 1939. The route was amended in 1941, and was renumbered from Route31A to Route64 in the 1953 renumbering. Route 64 was proposed {{to become part}} of the PrincetonHightstown Bypass (later designated New Jersey Route92), but completion <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> Currently, the route remains the bridge over the Northeast Corridor. However, it is not currently planned that Route64 will receive an extension of sorts from the proposed Penns Neck Bypass to U.S. Route1, a proposed realignment of County routes 526 and 571.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, Morgan was promoted to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division, which he led during the Battle of France. In May 1942 he became a lieutenant-general and given command of I Corps. Morgan's headquarters was designated Force 125, and given the task of dealing with a German thrust through Spain to Gibraltar that <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> In March 1943 he was appointed chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate), or COSSAC. As COSSAC he directed the planning for Operation Overlord. When General Dwight D.

After the island was secured, the unit was sent back to Guam where they underwent training for a possible invasion of the Japanese mainland. The invasion <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> since hostilities between Japan and the United States came to an end.

During the production, Nicol promised the actors a cut of the film's ultimate box office earnings, but due to an issue with the film's distributor, this <b>never</b> <b>occurred.</b> During filming, Webber discovered she was pregnant with a son, and so several scenes had to be re-written, like one where she was meant to fall down a staircase.|$|E
