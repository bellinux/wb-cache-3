40|$|The {{execution}} of distributed applications involving mo-bile terminals and fixed servers connected by wireless links raises {{the need for}} handling network disconnections, both involuntary during unexpected connection breakdowns, and voluntary when the user wants to save money and energy. In this paper, we investigate how standard CORBA mecha-nisms (Objects By Value and Portable Interceptors) {{can be used for}} enhancing legacy CORBA-based distributed appli-cations in order to support voluntary and involuntary dis-connections. We show that the first mechanism can be used for handling easily voluntary disconnections by copying on the terminal all the data necessary for running the appli-cation in a <b>disconnected</b> <b>mode.</b> The second mechanism al-lows also to handle involuntary disconnections; a switch between connected <b>mode</b> and <b>disconnected</b> <b>mode</b> can be performed transparently to the user. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{provide a}} {{positive}} user experience, an application generally needs {{to provide the}} user {{with a sense of}} {{the current state of the}} system. To support disconnected operation, data must be stored locally in caches. These rapidly become stale, leading to a reconciliation problem. Even when connected, getting agreement between distributed nodes on what constitutes current state is far from trivial. Most applications use some sort of database to hold current system state, and from this perspective the problem of agreeing on current state becomes a distributed database problem. Reconciliation involves substantial programming effort and use cases proliferate with the need to program for both connected and <b>disconnected</b> <b>modes</b> of operation. This paper introduces the concept of a FactBase ™ which is a secure and robust distributed collection of Facts. Facts are defined as immutable aggregates of data. This immutability is the key to avoiding reconciliation issues and use case proliferation.

40|$|Abstract. The complex {{software}} development scenarios for mobile/handheld devices operating in wireless environments require {{adaptation to the}} variations in the environment (such as fluctuating bandwidth). This translates to maintenance of service availability in preferably all circumstances. In this paper we propose that a mobile computing system (for hand-held, wireless devices) {{must be based on}} the combination of reflection, remote evaluation and code mobility mechanisms such that the communication framework 1 allows developers to design disconnectionaware applications which maintain service availability in case of varying circumstances by automatically redeploying essential components to appropriate locations. This not only allows the application to continue executing in varying conditions, but also in entirely <b>disconnected</b> <b>modes.</b> ...|$|R

In this paper we describe simple algorithms and {{techniques such as}} central server, forwarding pointers, broadcast, group communication, and hierarchical location directory, and use Nomadic Pict {{to develop and implement}} an example infrastructure. The infrastructure can tolerate site disconnection; a user can disconnect the computer from the network, work in a <b>disconnected</b> <b>mode</b> for extended periods, and later reconnect.

40|$|A {{mechanism}} for handling inconsistencies created when replicated objects are updated during disconnected operations on a mobile host is described. By exploiting the encapsulation property of objects, analysis of object behaviours is employed to derive "reconciliation procedures" so conflicting concurrent updates made on different copies of objects may be rendered mutually consistent.

However, in the absence of readily available high-quality communication, users are often forced to operate disconnected from the network.

In particular, there is a need for replication and synchronization services in order to guarantee availability of data and functionality, (including updates) in <b>disconnected</b> <b>mode.</b> To this end we propose a scalable and highly available data replication and management service. The proposed replication technique is compared with a baseline replication technique and shown to exhibit high availability, fault tolerance and minimal access times of the data and services, which are very important in an environment with low-quality communication links. <br /...|$|R

Introduction One goal of mobile computing is to provide users with a system that faithfully emulates the desktop environment. The mobile environment makes this goal a difficult one to reach because of limitations such as sporadic, low-bandwidth networks. Moreover, mobile computers tend to be resource poor, so that consumption of resources, such as disk space, demands careful control. The conventional paradigm for modern computing systems is distributed computing. An essential service in a distributed computing environment is the (distributed) fil [...] ...|$|R

In this paper, we formally define the file semantics of our mobile file system, which we called the NFS/M.

In order to enable the MNM mobile agents have been used.

If, for instance, mutual consistency is required, then collaboration should be synchronous. On the other hand, if remote users can work in <b>disconnected</b> <b>mode,</b> collaboration can be asynchronous with weaker con-straints on data freshness. In this paper, we focus on asyn-chronous replication which is typically required on the Web.

However, due to battery power limitation, {{a wireless}} mobile computer may often be forced to operate in a doze or even totally <b>disconnected</b> <b>mode.</b> As a result, the mobile computer may miss some cache invalidation reports. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient cache invalidation method for a wireless mobile computer. The new cache invalidation scheme is called grouping with cold update-set retention (GCORE). Upon waking up, a mobile computer checks its cache validity with the server. To reduce the bandwidth requirement for validity-checking, data objects are partitioned into groups. However, instead of simply invalidating a group {{if any of the}} objects in the group has been updated, GCORE retains the cold update set of objects in a group if possible.

40|$|This {{research}} paper deals with {{ideas of the}} design and performance optimization of medium/high-power induction motors during soft starting by eliminating the supply frequency torque pulsations, and by keeping the line curr rent constant at the preset value.

Line cur- rent during starting can be kept constant at any preset value by a simple strategy composed of successive sinusoidal and constant function segments of the triggering angle.
