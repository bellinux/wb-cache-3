30|$|Mattresses are {{classified}} by {{the type of}} support system: innerspring, solid foam, cotton batting, air, or water. Air and water mattresses account for less than 20 % of the U.S. market, solid foam (viscoelastic and latex) mattresses and innerspring mattresses account for nearly all of the remaining 80 % of the U.S. market (Mattress manufacturing in the US [2011]). Solid foam mattresses, also called all-foam mattress, do not have springs or other metallic arrangements. The use of viscoelastic or ‘memory’ foam and latex mattress is increasing in modern residential mattresses. An innerspring mattress is constructed from metal springs that may be separately housed in individual fabric sheaths or attached to a metal frame (Figure 4 a). Innerspring mattresses covered with varying combinations of layered viscoelastic and latex foam in combination with standard PUF are also available. For single-sided mattresses (also known as ‘no flip’ mattresses), the innerspring is covered by a comfort layer {{on one side and a}} low-cost <b>non-woven</b> <b>backing</b> material on the other. A comfort layer covers both sides for double-sided mattresses.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of pervaporation to the dehydration of aprotic solvents {{was investigated in}} this study. The performance of a commercial membrane, Celfa CMC-VP- 31, was evaluated for the dehydration of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dimethylformamide (DMF). The membrane was demonstrated to successfully dehydrate THF and calculations of water and THF permeance performed. When the membrane {{was applied to the}} dehydration of DMF, delamination of the top selective layer was observed and thus the membrane was deemed unsuitable for DMF dehydration. ' Polyaniline (PAni) was identified as a suitable candidate polymer for the formation of an aprotic solvent stable hydrophilic pervaporation membrane. PAni was synthesised in the lab and preparation conditions optimised and scaled-up to produce polymer with consistent batch to batch properties, in suitable quantities, to fabricateÃƒ?Ã‚?Ãƒ?Ã‚Â· membrane sheets with sufficient surface area for testing. Casting solutions comprising of 20 wt% PAni were stabilised using an amine, 4 -methyl piperidine, to prevent gelation and cross-linking prior to casting. Membranes were cast on a polyester <b>non-woven</b> <b>backing</b> and phase inverted in water to produce an asymmetric membrane structure. Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to examine the structure of the membranes formed. The effects of thermal treatment on the membrane film and polymer were investigated by a number of analytical techniques in order to devise a suitable procedure for membrane stabilisation. Thermally cross-linked PAni membranes were demonstrated to be water selective and stable in THF, DMF, ethyl acetate and ethanol. Permeance correlations with temperature were constructed to describe the performance of the membrane discs tested during solvent dehydration and compared to experimental data. Transport across the membrane was reported to be solubility dominated for all of the solvent systems tested. Finally, an examination of the reproducibility of membrane performance was made and further tests performed, to better understand variations observed in membrane pervaporation performance.

40|$|Solvent {{resistant}} nanofiltration (SRNF) is {{a separation}} technique with large applicability in the (petro-) chemical, pharmaceutical and food industry. Development of better performing membranes will boost {{the implementation of}} SRNF membranes in the coming years. The key factors that still need optimization to achieve this growth, are membrane stability in extreme pH conditions, thermal, mechanical and solvent stability and membrane cost. The majority of SRNF membranes are polymeric, since they are cheaper and easier to process than ceramic membranes. Most polymers applied to produce membranes are soluble in harsh solvents and sometimes in extreme pH conditions, a limitation {{that needs to be}} addressed. Another factor limiting the performance of SRNF membranes is the trade-off which is typically found between selectivity and permeability through the membrane. Membranes with very tight pores are known to combine a high selectivity with low flow rate. Optimization of the membrane preparation process can however improve this trade-off. One type of material is proposed in this research to produce SRNF membranes. Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) was chosen as hydrophobic, mechanically and thermally stable lab-synthesized polymer. Some modifications were added to the standard polymer, making it soluble in polar aprotic solvents and usable for the production of membranes via phase inversion. Some of the prepared PEEKs contained carboxylic acid groups in the polymer chain to allow crosslinking, thus producing a solvent-stable membrane. In a first part of this research, uncrosslinked membranes were prepared that are stable in mainly alcohols and alkanes. The lab-synthesized PEEKs were dissolved first in the polar aprotic solvents n-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and tetrahydrofuran (THF), after which they were spread onto a <b>non-woven</b> <b>backing</b> and immersed in water to ensure phase transition to the solid phase  the membrane. A number of phase inversion parameters were altered to investigate the potential of these materials for membrane preparation. First of all, polymer specific properties were investigated, namely molar mass and polydispersity. The influence of some synthesis parameters, such as composition of the polymer solution and evaporation time before immersion in the water bath, were subsequently investigated. The importance of post-treatment on membrane performance was also studied. In a second part of this research, a novel series of PEEKs were synthesized that could produce crosslinked membranes with good chemical stability in polar, aprotic solvents. For this, amines were used as crosslinkers, producing amide bonds between the polymer chains. The crosslinking occurred simultaneously with the phase inversion process, namely during immersion of the polymer films, by adding the amines to the water bath. These membranes can be implemented for separations in harsh solvents such as THF and NMP. In a final part of this research, SRNF membranes were developed to separate edible oils from solvents. By adapting the type of crosslinker, membranes were synthesized that are more hydrophilic than the abovementioned ones, making them more suitable for the purification of edible oils from solvents. This is indeed a very interesting industrial application in which the membranes developed in this research can be implemented. 1. 	Introduction and scope	 2 1. 1. 	General introduction	 2 1. 1. 1.
