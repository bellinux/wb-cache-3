2500|$|In {{a journal}} entry {{written in the}} 1970s, Oates sarcastically {{addressed}} her critics, writing, [...] "So many books! so many! Obviously JCO has a full career behind her, if one chooses {{to look at it}} that way; many more titles and she might as well... what?...give up all hopes for a 'reputation'? [...] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a 'serious' writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels [...] ". In The New York Review of Books in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates [...] "derives from reviewer's angst: How does one judge a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist?

2500|$|In 1977 Gradishar {{assisted}} the Broncos to Super Bowl XII, their very first. He earned Pro Bowl honors {{and was named}} first team All-Pro. Gradishar anchored a defense that led the AFC in fewest points allowed (148 in the 14-game season) and gave up the 6th fewest yards. Gradishar was also voted the AFC Defensive Player of the Year by the Columbus Touchdown Club. The 1977 Broncos season is documented in a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> Terry Frei, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age that features Gradishar, Lyle Alzado and others. The 1977 Broncos season began with a 7–0 shutout of the St. Louis Cardinals that {{had been one of}} the NFL's top offenses from 1974–1976 that featured offensive stars like Jim Hart, Terry Metcalf, Mel Gray, Dan Dierdorf and Conrad Dobler. In a 14–7 win against the Kansas City Chiefs the Broncos made a goal line stand as time expired to preserve a win. Denver Post staff writer Terry Frei's book, 77: Denver, the Broncos, and a Coming of Age, put it this way, [...] "Gradishar penetrated and stopped two running plays, as Gradishar did time and time again on the goal line in his career. It was the trademark of both Gradishar and the defense overall".|$|E
2500|$|Many of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered {{story line}} and its morals, perhaps expecting a {{significantly}} more conventional story {{from one of}} France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adult's literature classification. The New York Times wrote shortly before its release [...] "What makes a good children's book?......The Little Prince, which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [...] of conjectural value {{for boys and girls}} of 6, 8 and 10. [...] may very well be a book on the order of Gulliver's Travels, something that exists on two levels"; [...] "Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10 year olds?" [...] Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still [...] "capture the imagination of any child." [...] Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, Reynal & Hitchcock promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned [...] "it's the <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> Saint-Exupéry", adding to its dustcover [...] "There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mark Twain {{that year}} was working pretty {{steadily}} on 'The Yankee at [...] King Arthur's Court', a book {{which he had}} begun two years before. [...] He had published nothing since the Huck Finn story, and his company [...] was {{badly in need of}} a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> an author of distinction. Also [...] it was highly desirable to earn money for himself; wherefore he set [...] to work to finish the Yankee story. He had worked pretty steadily [...] that summer in his Elmira study, but on his return to Hartford found [...] a good deal of confusion in the house, so went over to Twichell's, [...] where carpenter work was in progress. He seems to have worked there [...] successfully, though what improvement of conditions he found in that [...] numerous, lively household, over those at home it would be difficult [...] to say.|$|E

6000|$|On 1 February 1823 Charles Wiley {{published}} in New York The Pioneers, a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> {{the author of}} The Spy; by noon he had sold 3,500 copies--a record-making sale by the bookselling standards of the time. On 26 June, almost five months later, Wiley quietly offered, as we know from a notice in The Patriot, a New York newspaper, [...] "Tales for Fifteen, or Imagination and Heart, an original work in one volume, by Jane Morgan, price 75c." [...] The actual author {{was the author of}} The Spy; and the two stories, [...] "Imagination" [...] and [...] "Heart," [...] were obviously imitations of Mrs. Amelia Opie's popular moral tales, published, as the paper cover noted, when The Spy was in its fourth edition, The Pioneers in its third, and The Pilot in press. The sale was so small that only four copies are known to be extant. Why, one may ask, did James Cooper, who was in 1823 a writer of national and international reputation, publish this volume of imitative stories for adolescent girls, even though his identity was carefully concealed? ...|$|E
60|$|There ought {{certainly}} {{to be some}} bound beyond which the cult of favorite authors should not be suffered to go. I should keep well within the limit of that early excess now, and should not liken the creation of Shakespeare {{to the creation of}} any heavenly body bigger, say, than one of the nameless asteroids that revolve between Mars and Jupiter. Even this I do not feel to be a true means of comparison, and I think {{that in the case of}} all great men we like to let our wonder mount and mount, till it leaves the truth behind, and honesty is pretty much cast out as ballast. A wise criticism will no more magnify Shakespeare because he is already great than it will magnify any less man. But we are loaded down with the responsibility of finding him all we have been told he is, and we must do this or suspect ourselves of a want of taste, a want of sensibility. At the same time, we may really be honester than those who have led us to expect this or that of him, and more truly his friends. I wish the time might come when we could read Shakespeare, and Dante, and Homer, as sincerely and as fairly as we read any <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>by</b> the least known of our contemporaries. The course of criticism is towards this, but when I began to read Shakespeare I should not have ventured to think that he was not at every moment great. I should no more have thought of questioning the poetry of any passage in him than of questioning the proofs of holy writ. All the same, I knew very well that much which I read was really poor stuff, and the persons and positions were often preposterous. It is a great pity that the ardent youth should not be permitted and even encouraged to say this to himself, instead of falling slavishly before a great author and accepting him at all points as infallible. Shakespeare is fine enough and great enough when all the possible detractions are made, and I have no fear of saying now that he would be finer and greater for the loss of half his work, though if I had heard any one say such a thing then I should have held him as little better than one of the wicked.|$|E
