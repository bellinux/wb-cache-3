5|$|On 8 May 2012, a 20-year-old man {{climbed over}} safety fences and {{accessed}} the underground ride area. He reportedly {{dropped into the}} hole from which the roller coaster track re-emerges from the underground tunnel, walked through the underground section and emerged on a ledge where the track enters the ground. Neither he nor any guests on the ride were harmed following the ride cars being held at the boarding station. He was arrested for a public order offence, and the ride returned to <b>normal</b> <b>operation</b> the following day.|$|E
5|$|BART {{was one of}} {{the first}} U.S. systems of any size to be {{substantially}} automated. Routing and dispatching of trains, and adjustments for schedule recovery are controlled by a combination of computer and human supervision at BART's Operations Control Center (OCC) and headquarters at the Kaiser Center in Downtown Oakland. Station-to-station train movement, including speed control and maintenance of separation between successive trains, is entirely automatic under <b>normal</b> <b>operation,</b> the operator's routine responsibilities being issuing announcements, closing the doors after stations stops, and monitoring the track ahead for hazards. In unusual circumstances the operator controls the train manually at reduced speed.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires. In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were in operating service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during <b>normal</b> <b>operation,</b> only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E

5|$|Tests {{scheduled}} for 11 and 14 November were to traverse {{each of the}} two tracks, in both directions of travel and at a test speed 10% above the speed limit when the line is in commercial service. On the afternoon of 14 November, the test train was scheduled to depart Meuse TGV Station at 14:18 and arrive at Strasbourg Station at 15:17. At 14:26, authorization was given to begin the test and the test train left Meuse TGV Station two minutes later. During this test, the test train traveled eastbound on Track2, the southern track on the east-west oriented LGV Est, in the direction opposite <b>normal</b> <b>operation</b> (Strasbourg towards Paris). The Meuse-Strasbourg run was the last series of tests on the line during the fourth phase of tests.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in <b>normal</b> <b>operation,</b> quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during <b>normal</b> <b>operation,</b> and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E

5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during <b>normal</b> <b>operation.</b> Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E
