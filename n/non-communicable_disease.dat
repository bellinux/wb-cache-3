The report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation, to which the WHO/FAO responded by including in the report this statement: [...] "The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial". It also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies. In 2014, WHO reduced recommended sugar levels by half and said that sugar should make up no more than 5% of a healthy diet.|$|E

The countries of the South-East Asia region are facing a double burden, with a heavy load of infectious diseases and an increasing burden due to <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> The increasing burden of <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases,</b> particularly in developing countries including India, threatens to overwhelm already stretched health services.

The latest report from the WHO about the status of non-communicable dis-eases in the world showed that about 28 million of the 58 million global deaths in 2012 are related to <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> It is worth noting from which 16 million deaths {{occurred}} among ages under 70 years.

40|$|There is {{mounting}} {{evidence of the}} rising incidence and prevalence of <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in developing countries. Governments are facing serious challenges in health care due to the rising trends in <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> {{as a result of}} demographic and epidemiological changes, as well as economic globalization. Cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, respiratory <b>disease,</b> obesity andother <b>non-communicable</b> conditions now account for 59 percent of the 56. 5 million global deaths annually, and almost half, or 46 percent, of the global burden of disease. It is estimated that by 2020, <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> will account for 60 % of the global burden of disease. The burden of <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in sub-Saharan Africa is already substantial, and patients with these conditions make significant demands on health resources.

40|$|Background: Dock {{workers are}} {{important}} for world economic growth. They develop work where {{they are exposed to}} risk factors for <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> <b>Non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> are characterized as disorders that affect the general population and in recent decades the number of deaths worldwide has been considered significant. The aims of this study have been to identify <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> that affect dock workers, according to records from the Medical Outpatient Clinic for Dock Workers. Methods: Quantitative and exploratory study. Data were collected from all medical care files of dock workers in the period 2000 to 2009. A predetermined form was used, focusing on clinical data and diagnoses of <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> Descriptive data analysis was performed. Results: Data were collected from 953 medical care records. The population was predominantly male (90. 47 %) and the predominant age of workers was below 50. The most common <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> were hypertension (8. 3 %); obesity (5. 6 %); diabetes mellitus (3 %); acute myocardial infarction (0. 5 %). Conclusion: The results showed hypertension, obesity and diabetes as the more prevalent <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> Occupational health nurses possess the theoretical and practical knowledge to organize a process of care that includes prevention and promotes health strategies appropriate for the labour reality of this group of workers...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{past decade}} has seen {{a decline in the}} disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) contributed by {{communicable}} diseases while lifestyle changes and rapid urbanization have led to an increase in DALYs contributed by <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> We studied the causes of death in a low socioeconomic area over 11 years to help identify changes in the pattern of disease. Methods. We did this study in Gokulpuri, a resettlement colony in East Delhi. All deaths occurring from 1994 to 2004 were analysed using a verbal autopsy questionnaire completed by trained health workers during their home visits in the area. Results. A total of 515 deaths occurred during the period; 340 in men (66 %) and 175 in women (34 %). The six commonest causes of death were tuberculosis (24. 8 %), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (11. 6 %), pneumonia (8. 7 %), accidents and poisoning (8. 6 %), coronary heart disease (8. 2 %) and cancer (4. 6 %). The age-specific mortality rate was highest among people> 45 years of age. The cause-specific mortality rate due to communicable diseases showed a decline while that due to <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> showed a rising trend in all age groups. Conclusion. Our study shows the coexistence of communicable and <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in a low socioeconomic area with a rising trend in <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> Surveillance for risk factors of <b>non-communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> should be done even in predominantly low socioeconomic areas.
