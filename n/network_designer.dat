40|$|International audienceThe {{efficient}} {{design of}} networks {{has been an}} important engineering task that involves challenging combinatorial optimization problems. Typically, a <b>network</b> <b>designer</b> has to select among several alternatives which links to establish so that the resulting network satisfies a given set of connectivity requirements and the cost of establishing the network links is as low as possible. The Minimum Spanning Tree problem, which is well-understood, is a nice example. In this paper, we consider the natural scenario in which the connectivity requirements are posed by selfish users who have agreed to share the cost of the network to be established according to a well-defined rule. The design proposed by the <b>network</b> <b>designer</b> should now be consistent not only with the connectivity requirements but also with the selfishness of the users. Essentially, the users are players in a so-called network design game and the <b>network</b> <b>designer</b> has to propose a design that is an equilibrium for this game. As it is usually the case when selfishness comes into play, such equilibria may be suboptimal. In this paper, we consider the following question: can the <b>network</b> <b>designer</b> enforce particular designs as equilibria or guarantee that efficient designs are consistent with users’ selfishness by appropriately subsidizing some of the network links? In an attempt to understand this question, we formulate corresponding optimization problems and present positive and negative results...|$|E

40|$|Anonymous {{wireless}} networking is studied when {{an adversary}} monitors the transmission timing {{of an unknown}} subset of the network nodes. For a desired quality-of-service (QoS), as measured by network throughput, the problem of maximizing anonymity is investigated from a game-theoretic perspective. Quantifying anonymity using conditional entropy of the routes given the adversary’s observation, the problem of optimizing anonymity is posed as a two player zero-sum game between the <b>network</b> <b>designer</b> and the adversary; {{the task of the}} adversary is to choose a subset of nodes to monitor so that anonymity of routes is minimum whereas the task of the <b>network</b> <b>designer</b> is to maximize anonymity by choosing a subset of nodes to evade flow detection by generating independent transmission schedules. In this two player game, it is shown that a unique saddle point equilibrium exists for a general category of finite networks. At the saddle point, the strategy of the <b>network</b> <b>designer</b> is to ensure that any subset of nodes monitored by the adversary reveals identical amount of information about the routes. For a specific class of parallel relay networks, the theory is applied to study the optimal performance tradeoffs and equilibrium strategies. In particular, when the nodes employ transmitter directed signaling, the tradeoff between throughput and anonymity is characterized analytically {{as a function of the}} network parameters and the fraction of nodes monitored. The results are applied to study the relationships between anonymity, fraction of monitored relays and the fraction of hidden relays in large networks...|$|E
