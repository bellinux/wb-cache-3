25|$|Abbott Laboratories in {{partnership}} with NeuroSearch have two drug candidates in clinical trials, ABT-894, a selective α4β2 nicotine receptor agonist, for ADHD and ABT-560, a neuronal <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> modulator, which was selected by Abbott in 2006 as a new development candidate for cognitive dysfunctions.|$|E
25|$|The {{quest of}} Changeux for the {{structure}} of the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> culminated with the publication of the structure, at atomic resolution, of a bacterial homolog in the open and resting conformations supporting the concept of a symmetrical concerted opening for channel gating, in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations.|$|E
25|$|While {{until the}} 1990s, Changeux's group studied the {{structure}} of the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> present in electric organs of electric eel and torpedo, the investigations of the physiological role of those receptors were mostly focussed on two model systems: the nicotinic receptors of the neuromuscular junction, the synapse linking the motorneuron to the skeletal muscle, and the nicotinic receptors of the brain, notably in relation with nicotine addiction.|$|E
50|$|In vertebrates, <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> are broadly {{classified}} into two subtypes {{based on their}} primary sites of expression: muscle-type <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> (N1) primarily for somatic motor neurons; and neuronal-type <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> (N2) primarily for autonomic nervous system.|$|R
25|$|Another area of {{research}} {{is the role of}} <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> in schizophrenia and smoking. Studies show increased numbers of exposed <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors,</b> which could explain the pathology of both smoking and schizophrenia. However, others argue that the increase in <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> is a result of persistent heavy smoking, rather than schizophrenia.|$|R
25|$|The 1990s saw the {{progressive}} shift of interest of Changeux from the neuromuscular junction to the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> {{expressed in the}} brain. Among the notable achievements of the group is the discovery that neuronal <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> are highly permeable to calcium - which explains {{the positive effect of}} <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> on the release of many neurotransmitters in the brain.|$|R
25|$|Normal {{end plate}} {{function}} can be blocked by two mechanisms. Nondepolarizing agents, such as tubocurarine, block the agonist, acetylcholine, from binding to nicotinic receptors and activating them, thereby preventing depolarization. Alternatively, depolarizing agents, such as succinylcholine, are <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> agonists which mimic Ach, block muscle contraction by depolarizing {{to such an}} extent that it desensitizes the receptor and it can no longer initiate an action potential and cause muscle contraction. Both of these classes of neuromuscular blocking drugs are structurally similar to acetylcholine, the endogenous ligand, in many cases containing two acetylcholine molecules linked end-to-end by a rigid carbon ring system, as in pancuronium (a nondepolarizing agent).|$|E
25|$|In healthy adults, longterm visual {{episodic memory}} can be {{enhanced}} specifically through administration of the Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor Donepezil, whereas verbal episodic memory can be improved in persons with the val/val genotype of the val158met polymorphism through administration of the CNS penetrant specific catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Tolcapone. Furthermore, episodic memory is enhanced through AZD3480, a selective agonist at the neuronal alpha4beta2 <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor,</b> which is developed by the company Targacept. Currently, {{there are several other}} products developed by several companies—including new catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitors with fewer side effects—that aim for improving episodic memory. A recent placebo controlled study found that DHEA, which is a functional cortisol antagonist, improves episodic memory in healthy young men (Alhaj et al. 2006).|$|E
25|$|Memantine {{acts as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} {{at different}} neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at potencies possibly similar to the NMDA and 5-HT3 receptors, but this is difficult to ascertain with accuracy because of the rapid desensitization of nAChR responses in these experiments. It can be noted that memantine is an antagonist at Alpha-7 nAChR, which may contribute to initial worsening of cognitive function during early memantine treatment. Alpha-7 nAChR upregulates quickly in response to antagonism, which could explain the cognitive-enhancing effects of chronic memantine treatment. It {{has been shown that}} the number of nicotinic receptors in the brain are reduced in Alzheimer's disease, {{even in the absence of}} a general decrease in the number of neurons, and <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> agonists are viewed as interesting targets for anti-Alzheimer drugs.|$|E

2500|$|Nicotine is {{frequently}} used for its performance-enhancing effects on cognition, alertness, and focus. A meta-analysis of 41double-blind, placebo-controlled studies concluded that nicotine or smoking had significant {{positive effects on}} aspects of fine motor abilities, alerting and orienting attention, and episodic and working memory. A 2015 review noted that stimulation of the α4β2 <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> is responsible for certain improvements in attentional performance; among the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> subtypes, nicotine has the highest binding affinity at the α4β2 receptor (ki=1), {{which is also the}} biological target that mediates nicotine's addictive properties.s as follows; α2β4=9900nM , α3β2=14nM , α3β4=187nM , α4β2=1nM [...] Due to the heterogeneity of nACh channels we have not tagged a primary drug target for nicotine, although the α4β2 is reported to be the predominant high affinity subtype in the brain which mediates nicotine addiction [...]}} Nicotine has potential beneficial effects, but it also has paradoxical effects, which may be due to its inverted U-shape or pharmacokinetic features.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1990s, Changeux {{concentrated}} most of {{his interest}} on the function of nicotinic receptors in the basal ganglia {{and in particular the}} mesencephalic dopaminergic system.

2500|$|Nicotine is {{a potent}} {{parasympathomimetic}} stimulant and an alkaloid found in the nightshade family of plants.

40|$|We {{isolated}} a mammalian homologue of the C. elegans gene unc- 50 that we {{have named}} UNCL. The 777 kb rat UNCL cDNA encodes a 259 amino acid protein that is expressed {{in a wide variety}} of tissues with highest mRNA levels in brain, kidney and testis. Hydropathy plot analysis and in vitro translation experiments with microsomal membranes indicate that UNCL is a transmembrane protein. Hemagglutinin tagged UNCL was stably transfected into SaOS- 2 osteosarcoma cells and exhibited a nuclear rim staining pattern which was retained following extraction with 1 % Triton X- 100, suggesting that UNCL localizes to the inner nuclear membrane. UNCL-HA was extractable in 350 mM NaCl, suggesting that UNCL is not associated with the nuclear matrix. Homopolymer RNA-binding assays performed on in vitro translated UNCL protein and 'structural modeling by homology' suggest that UNCL binds RNA via an amino-terminal RNA Recognition-like Motif. Since unc- 50 is required for expression of assembled muscle-type <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> in the nematode we investigated whether UNCL had a similar function for mammalian <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors.</b> When UNCL was co-expressed with neural <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> in Xenopus oocytes or COS cells it increased expression of functional cell surface receptors up to 1. 6 -fold.

2500|$|The {{group also}} {{discovered}} that the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> is regulated {{by a variety of}} [...] "allosteric modulators" [...] such as: 1. calcium ions (This was also discovered independently by the group of John Dani), which binding sites were later identified and localized in the extracellular domain, at the interface between subunits (Le Novère et al. 2002); 2. ivermecin [...] which behaves as a potent positive allosteric modulator binding to a site present in the transmembrane domain (where general anesthetics also bind); 3. phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain which regulate desensitization.|$|E
2500|$|In his PhD thesis, Changeux {{suggested}} that the recognition and transmission of signals by membrane, and in particular by synapses, could use the same mechanisms as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. More than forty years of research would follow, mainly focussed on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). In 1967, Changeux extended the MWC model to bi-dimensional lattice of receptors [...] (an idea that would also be developed three decades afterward by Dennis Bray). He then applied this idea to the post-synaptic membrane of electric organs (analog to striated muscle). His team demonstrated the existence of several interconvertible states for the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor,</b> resting, open and desensitized, displaying different affinities for the ligands, such as the endogenous agonist acetylcholine. The transitions between the states followed different kinetics, and those kinetics plus the differential affinities sufficed to explain {{the shape of the}} post-synaptic potential. A full mechanistic model of the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> from striated muscle (or electric organ) was to be provided much later, when Changeux collaborated with Stuart Edelstein, another specialist of allostery, who worked decades on hemoglobin. In addition to the allosteric modulation of the channel gating by the agonists, many other regulations of the ligand-gated ion channels activity have since been discovered. The modulators bind to a variety of allosteric sites, whether on the agonist binding sites, other binding sites at the subunit interfaces, on the cytoplasmic part of the protein or in the transmembrane domain.|$|E

2500|$|Muscle {{relaxation}} and paralysis can theoretically occur by interrupting function at several sites, including {{the central nervous}} system, myelinated somatic nerves, unmyelinated motor nerve terminals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the motor end plate, and the muscle membrane or contractile apparatus. Most neuromuscular blockers function by blocking transmission at the end plate of the neuromuscular junction. Normally, a nerve impulse arrives at the motor nerve terminal, initiating an influx of calcium ions, which causes the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then diffuses across the synaptic cleft. It may be hydrolysed by acetylcholine esterase (AchE) or bind to the nicotinic receptors located on the motor end plate. The binding of two acetylcholine molecules results in a conformational change in the receptor that opens the sodium-potassium channel of the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor.</b> This allows [...] and [...] ions to enter the cell and [...] ions to leave the cell, causing a depolarization of the end plate, resulting in muscle contraction. Following depolarization, the acetylcholine molecules are then removed from the end plate region and enzymatically hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase.|$|E

50|$|Since nicotinic receptors help {{transmit}} outgoing signals for {{the sympathetic}} and parasympathetic systems, <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonists such as hexamethonium {{interfere with the}} transmission of these signals.

50|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by the impairment of cholinergic function. One hypothesis is that this impairment contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by the disease. This hypothesis forms the basis for galantamine's use as a cholinergic enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's. Galantamine completely inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes acetylcholine. As a result of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, galantamine increases the availability of acetylcholine for synaptic transmission. Additionally, galantamine binds to the allosteric sites of <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors,</b> which causes a conformational change. This allosteric modulation increases the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptor's</b> response to acetylcholine. The activation of presynaptic <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> increases the release of acetylcholine, further increasing the availability of acetylcholine. Galantamine's competitive inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and allosteric nicotinic modulation serves as a dual mechanism of action.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{determine}} whether paraventricular neurons possess functional acetylcholine <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors.</b> Using infrared videomicroscopy and differential interference contrast optics, we performed whole-cell recordings in hypothalamic slices containing the paraventricular nucleus. Acetylcholine, locally applied by pressure microejection {{in the presence of the}} muscarinic antagonist atropine, evoked a rapidly rising inward current in paraventricular magnocellular endocrine neurons. This current persisted in the presence of blockers of synaptic transmission. It could be reversibly suppressed by nanomolar concentrations of methyllycaconitine, a selective antagonist of alpha 7 -containing <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors,</b> but was insensitive to micromolar concentrations of dihydro-beta-erythroidine, an antagonist acting preferentially on non-alpha 7 <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors.</b> In addition, the effect of acetylcholine could be mimicked by exo- 2 -(2 -pyridyl) - 7 -azabicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptane, a recently synthesized nicotinic agonist specific for alpha 7 receptors. Acetylcholine also desensitized paraventricular <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors.</b> Desensitization was pronounced and recovery from desensitization was rapid, consistent with the notion that paraventricular <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors</b> contain the alpha 7 subunit. Nicotinic currents could not be evoked in paraventricular parvocellular neurons, suggesting that these neurons are devoid of functional <b>nicotinic</b> <b>receptors.</b> The electrophysiological data were corroborated by light microscopic autoradiography, showing that [(125) I]alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites are present in all the magnocellular divisions of the paraventricular nucleus but are undetectable in other areas of this nucleus. Immunohistochemistry, performed using antibodies directed against vasopressin and oxytocin, indicated that responsiveness to nicotinic agonists was a property of vasopressin as well as of oxytocin magnocellular endocrine neurons, in both the paraventricular and the supraoptic nucleus.
