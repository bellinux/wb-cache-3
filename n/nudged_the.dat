5|$|The {{volume of}} space within which an object {{can be said}} to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, it {{happened}} to be near its aphelion, and found itself slightly within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity <b>nudged</b> <b>the</b> comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricitythat is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began brightly {{in front}} of a crowd of 65,483, {{creating}} the first chance of the match in the 17th minute. Paul Davis set up striker Kevin Campbell, who hooked the ball high over goal. Four minutes later, Alan Smith headed the ball into the goal net, meeting a cross from Paul Merson; it was ruled out by referee Terry Holbrook for offside. Tottenham improved shortly after, with Gary Mabbutt heading the ball directly at Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to create their first chance of the match. Their best opportunity to score was in the 36th minute. Vinny Samways set up Gary Lineker to break past the Arsenal defence. Having <b>nudged</b> <b>the</b> ball past Tony Adams, Lineker looked up, before making a cross for Nayim to head; the shot was acrobatically saved by Seaman's right foot.|$|E
5|$|As {{the green}} flag flew on lap 38, Chip Ganassi Racing held a one–two with Franchitti leading Dixon, {{with two of}} the Dreyer & Reinbold cars—Conway and Wilson—holding third and fourth places, with the only {{remaining}} KV car of E. J. Viso holding fifth, the Venezuelan disposing of Castroneves just after the restart. Realising that the gamble had backfired, the lead quintet pitted on laps 41 and 42, which cycled Hunter-Reay back through to the lead. Power made an error which allowed Matos and Briscoe to move ahead of him. Briscoe moved ahead of Matos on lap 45 and set off in chase of Hunter-Reay. Four laps later, the Australian was on the American's tail, and moved ahead after an outbraking move into the final hairpin. Hunter-Reay immediately regained the position into the first chicane on Lap 51, before Briscoe sealed the place with a similar final hairpin move {{at the end of the}} lap. Briscoe's luck would run out, however, when he overcooked it into turn five on lap 54, and <b>nudged</b> <b>the</b> barriers with his nose assembly, bringing out the fourth and final caution of the race. The time limit meant that only six laps remained at the restart, with Hunter-Reay leading Power, Matos, Meira and Wheldon. Meira soon passed his fellow Brazilian for third on Lap 57, and began to chase down the lead duo, who had changed positions after Power used the slipstream to overtake Hunter-Reay into the final corner. Power moved away from Hunter-Reay in the final laps, taking the chequered flag to cap his return from injury with a victory. Hunter-Reay took his best result for a year in second, with another injury returnee, Meira, finishing third. Matos was fourth, holding off seven other cars, as fourth to eleventh were covered by 3.49 seconds at the race's conclusion. Wheldon led those seven in fifth, ahead of the Ganassis, Conway, Castroneves, Kanaan and Wilson. Viso finished twelfth ahead of top rookie Beatriz, a recovering Briscoe, Danica Patrick and de Silvestro, the final two off the lead lap.|$|E

25|$|Softly, {{well before}} the winter dawn, the yellow monster lurched towards the grey façade. A lone rook stirred in the tall beeches nearby, troubled by the {{relentless}} purring of powerful motors. Down beyond the stream, what remains of his ornamental garden, a few regal bamboo blades, trembled in the night breeze. A mighty arm <b>nudged</b> <b>the</b> building. There was no crash, not even a rumble. Masonry fell with a rustle and hiss of dust down ivy-clad walls, to thud in moss. Within the hour, Frescati was no more.|$|E
25|$|In the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons, Ajax, {{along with}} Cruyff, became league champions. In 1982–83, Ajax won the Dutch Cup (KNVB-Beker). In 1982, he scored a famous goal against Helmond Sport. While playing for Ajax, Cruyff scored a penalty {{the same way}} Rik Coppens had done it 25 years earlier. He put the ball down as for a routine penalty kick, but instead of {{shooting}} at goal, Cruyff <b>nudged</b> <b>the</b> ball sideways to teammate Jesper Olsen, who in return passed it back to Cruyff to tap {{the ball into the}} empty net, as Otto Versfeld, the Helmond goalkeeper, looked on.|$|E
25|$|The Ipswich 400 saw the {{championship}} lead change hands, with Jamie Whincup moving ahead of Mark Winterbottom. Whincup won {{both of the}} Saturday races ahead of his teammate Craig Lowndes. Lowndes had started from pole in the first race but Whincup passed him {{towards the end of}} the race to take the win, with Scott McLaughlin finishing behind the pair. McLaughlin, from pole, and Michael Caruso led Whincup and Lowndes for most of the second race. Caruso attempted to pass McLaughlin, but he <b>nudged</b> <b>the</b> Volvo into a spin and received a drive-through penalty. Whincup then held off Lowndes to win the race, with Chaz Mostert finishing third. The Sunday race saw James Moffat take his first career pole position and the first for Nissan since the company returned to the series. James Courtney won the race after starting from second on the grid, with Lowndes in second and Mostert third. Scott Pye scored a career-best result with fourth. Moffat finished fifth after going off the track while attempting to pass Mostert on the final lap. Whincup finished sixth, which was enough to take {{the championship}} lead after a tyre puncture for Winterbottom dropped him to twenty-second place.|$|E
40|$|This project report aims {{to explore}} how <b>the</b> notion of <b>nudge</b> can be {{understood}} {{and whether or not}} manipulation is an element in <b>the</b> <b>nudge</b> approach. <b>The</b> latter is thus assessed in order to provide a theoretical framework leading to an analysis, which is anchored in two different examples of implemented <b>nudges.</b> <b>The</b> idea of dialogue is brought into play as it is argued that dialogue can prevent manipulation in <b>the</b> <b>nudge</b> approach. Finally, it is concluded on the basis of utilitarianism, that to nudge an individual towards a better choice is not morally problematic...|$|R
