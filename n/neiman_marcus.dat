5|$|Another Marcus {{contribution}} to the arts was his own work {{in the area of}} photography. Over the course of his adult life, Marcus took thousands of photographs, both of famous and anonymous subjects, which he turned over to granddaughter Allison V. Smith, a professional photographer, upon moving out of his Nonesuch Road home into a smaller residence in the late 1990s. Two years after his death, Smith began making digital scans of the photos and posting them to the sharing site Flickr; despite the fact that their authorship was not identified, within a year the photographs had drawn 10,000 views. For the 100th anniversary of <b>Neiman</b> <b>Marcus,</b> Smith and her mother, Jerrie Marcus Smith, decided to assemble a representative selection of the nearly 5,000 images into a book; titled Reflection of a Man, the 192-page book was published by Cairn Press in October, 2007, and accompanied by an exhibit at the Dallas Museum of Art.|$|E

During the early 20th century, Dallas transformed from an agricultural center to a center of banking, insurance, fashion retailing and other businesses. Founded here were <b>Neiman</b> <b>Marcus</b> and the now-defunct A. Harris and Sanger Brothers ready-to-wear stores.

25|$|In 1952, Stanley Marcus {{introduced}} a new tradition of having extravagant and unusual gifts in each year's Christmas catalog, The Christmas Book; the idea was sparked when journalist Edward R.

At one point, the <b>Neiman</b> <b>Marcus</b> Christmas catalog carried {{the distinction of being}} the item most stolen from recipients' mailboxes, prompting a Chicago postmaster to suggest the company switch to enclosing the catalogs in plain brown wrappers.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 2006, Coles Myer {{announced}} it would sell Myer to a consortium controlled by US private equity group Newbridge Capital, part of the Texas Pacific Group.
