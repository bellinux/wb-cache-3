40|$|This paper {{intends to}} explore {{the events of the}} {{conflict}} on 23 May 1997 from the aspect of the peaceful resolution. Where a peace-building effort is needed to maintain a peaceful situation. With the collective memory being represented in the present mass, {{it is part of the}} form of efforts in fostering post-conflict sustainable peace. Through the elements of society (<b>Non-Governmental</b> <b>Actor)</b> the memory of conflict is represented in the public sphere as a form of warning against forgetting over history. The role of a <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actor</b> in peacebuilding has a strategic role in resolving conflicts and building peace post-conflict. There are three things raised in this research that is: The incident of conflict "Jum'at Kelabu" in the city of Banjarmasin in 1997, a collective memory form of conflict that built elements of society after the conflict, and the views of elements of society to the collective memory that was represented in the present in the effort to build peacebuilding. This research is a qualitative research, using a sociology-historical approach. The method used in data collection is through observation, interview, and documentation as secondary data. From the results of data analysis, the following results are obtained: the conflict that occurred in Banjarmasin city has a long chronology, the cause of this conflict is an unclear campaign route, the party base that controls Banjarmasin, because the mass of one the OPP that interfere with the Friday prayer, and aggressiveness of campaign participants. The form of peacebuilding efforts of the elements of society is to take peaceful action down the street, discussion/dialogue, and watching a documentary film. Elements of society argue that bringing back the memory of the conflict has two impacts: negative and positive impacts on people’s lives thereafter. These efforts need to be built to create an awareness that the conflict is painful, unpleasant and disturbing so hopefully it will never happen again...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on lobbying in the European Union. After initial surveys of the landscape of <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actor</b> participation, theoretical investigations have concentrated on the modes of network governance and later on the phenomenon of Europeanization. Yet increasingly, studies have moved away from considering EU lobbying as a sui generis phenomenon. Normalizing the study of interest group participation in the EU and understanding the opportunities and constraints that characterize it, however, has led more and more scholars to adopt a comparative perspective. The most interesting parallels exist between Washington, D. C. and Brussels, but unfortunately, there have been very few attempts to explore {{the connection between the}} American literature on lobbying and EU studies. This article makes a first step towards such a comparison and points to concepts common in comparative political studies that could provide considerable insight into the study of EU lobbying...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{approaches}} {{the implementation of}} security and defence policies of the EU and its member states from a governance perspective, which focuses on the multitude of governmental / institutional and <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors</b> involved, and their relations. This {{is applied to the}} security sector reform (SSR) policies in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). SSR is a major field of activity within the civilian crisis management dimension of ESDP/CSDP (European/Common Security and Defence Policy), that also in the DRC became a focal point of the EU. Within this framework, two operations are deployed in support of the Congolese SSR. In addition, also the European Commission and particular member states, such as the UK, are intensively engaged in the Congolese SSR. Their programmes are implemented by <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors</b> and consultants, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM). As the implementation of these SSR policies in the Congo illustrates, coordination is often obstructed by the varying approaches and (financial) resources of theses institutional and <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors.</b> The author investigates the relations between these governmental/institutional and <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors</b> in the European SSR policies in the Congo, and analyses the impact of the presence of <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors</b> (consultants, companies and others) in the implementation of these policies. status: publishe...|$|R

Thisprocess is closely related to the evolution of EU governance; new political partners will have - and already have had - an impact on the decision making process at different levels of the EU. We start off with a review of the theoretical literature on the EU's normative impact on the work and role of political parties. This is followed by an analytical study of European party federations,EU enlargement and the interrelationship between the 'logic of appropriateness' and the 'logic of expected consequences'.

40|$|This paper {{begins the}} {{analysis}} of complex multi-actor, multi-round decision-making processes in Canadian public policy formation. After setting out {{the notion of a}} decision-making style and its constitutive elements, the paper identifies research into complex multi-actor, multi-round decisions as a serious lacuna in the literature on decision-making, despite the fact that this type of decision-making is extremely common in public policy-making circumstances. The paper attempts to advance research in this area through {{the analysis of}} five cases of complex decision-making in Canada over the period 1995 - 2005, dealing with: amendments to the Indian Act, the creation of Species-at-risk legislation, alterations to the Bank Act, the extension of Privacy legislation to the private sector and efforts to develop a Free Trade of the Americas agreement (FTAA). A database of actor interactions in these four areas is constructed from on-line newspaper and media index services which establishes that (a) multiple rounds are a common feature of Canadian policy-making; (b) actor behaviour and activity is correlated with these rounds; and (c) significant, but predictable, variations exist in government and <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actor</b> behavior i...|$|E
40|$|The chapter aims at {{examining}} {{the process of}} construction/deconstruction of the Lebanese-Syrian border {{from the point of}} view and through the practices of one group of actors whose contribution to the process can be considered strategic.

Choosing a <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actor</b> in order to analyse the international boundary separating Lebanon from Syria imposed itself. In most of the studies already available on the subject, the boundary has been examined in a classic international relations perspective privileging the state, and even more in a narrow governmental perspective, thus ignoring complex processes and dynamics. Also, analysing the distinction between Lebanon and Syria by means of the examination of businessmen's representations and strategies allows us to bridge the gap between international relations and political economy, and possibly to throw light on the domestic structures that make the specificity of each state with regard to the other...|$|E

Next, we compare the role of leadership in two examples of regional adaptation practices which were initiated by governmental actors with two examples which were initiated by <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors.</b> The case studies are located in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Our research question is twofold: to what extent can the five functions of leadership be identified in practices of climate change adaptation, and are there differences in the patterns of leadership between adaptation practices which are initiated by governmental and by <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors?</b> The study shows that although all leadership functions were fulfilled in all four cases, patterns of leadership were different and the fulfilment of leadership functions posed different challenges to <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors</b> and governmental actors. </p...|$|R

40|$|Music, the <b>Non-Governmental</b> <b>Actor</b> Changing Political Policy: Have We Failed the Power of Music? People {{learn that}} making music {{as well as}} {{listening}} to it frees them from the toil and tedium of a life dominated by the privileged and the powerful. Music means trouble {{for those who would}} own and control it as they perpetuate injustice and suffering. – Mat Callahan It is believed that the pen is mightier than the sword, but is the guitar playing vocalist, a beatnik, mightier than the M- 16 machinegun and an American political oligarchy? To find {{the answer to this question}} we must look at our American history and the awe inspiring role that music has taken to help change political direction. The source of American resistance seems to be historically rooted in music and transformed to something that has become known as ‘Music of Social Change. ’ In the last century or so, music has become the cry of a people under duress. Political melodies have become the vehicle through which the common folk can raise their agenda and voice opposition. This unifying force has become a symbol of American revolutions. Socially conscious music has come in waves of hope and become the face of political movements. A common function of this genre of music has been to remind people of the good that is found in humanity, and is used to display what can be accomplished when people work together. The utilization of music as a tool to address social woes within the American community has had an extensive history. Throughout the American experience, music has been politically synonymous with opposition. Starting with Congo Square, Louisiana, and moving into the cotton fields of North America, the music of African slaves became the very foundation of this American movement, and would be used to symbolically defy their masters. Melodies would be used to record the history of an enslaved people, and would evolve to fight oppression wherever cruelty was found. From the African slaves to the Immigrant Labor Movements, from the Civil Rights Movement to the Anti-War Movement, music has served as an instrument for cohesion, in the fight against oppression. Music, in its ability to unify people, has become a <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actor</b> that has the power to change the political process in the United States. The music of social change has shown that politicians may come and go, but music will always be the voice of the people...|$|E
40|$|Green spaces {{provide a}} variety of {{benefits}} that contribute to more healthy and attractive cities. This paper, building upon results of the EU FP 7 GREEN SURGE project, aims to identify, describe and categorize innovative participatory governance practices characterized by <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actor</b> involvement in the maintenance, decision-making or management of urban green spaces. A total of 20 cities in 14 EU-countries were studied and for each of these, information on participatory governance arrangements was acquired using a multi-method approach. This was a combination of: a) semi-structured interviews with green space planning city officials, b) desk studies, and c) analysis of planning documents with relevance to urban green space. We identified four broad trends influencing participatory governance policies and practices in the EU, and we categorized participatory governance practices relating to urban green spaces into seven clusters. To capture and compare between different cities and countries the {{different ways in which}} non-governmental actors are involved in urban green space governance, we introduced a participatory governance matrix. The matrix has two dimensions: “mode of governance” (ranging from government regulation to self-governance) and “means of participation” (ranging from more structural institutional influence to influence through hands-on activities). By considering participatory governance practices along with trends at a European level, practitioners are provided with an improved understanding of how to harness the potential of civil society in urban green space management, now and into the future...|$|E
40|$|Consider the {{following}} cases: (1) A man employed {{by a private}} college informs his employer (in response to an inquiry) that he is gay. The employer fires him. The former employee sues the college, claiming that the college 2 ̆ 7 s action violates the nation 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional requirement that everyone be treated equally. (2) A hearing- impaired person seeks medical care from a hospital, which indicates its willingness to provide the care {{on the condition that}} the patient provide, and pay for, a sign-language interpreter to assist in the delivery of the medical care. The patient sues the hospital, claiming that its refusal to provide service violates the constitutional norm of equality. (3) A group of farm workers organizes itself and approaches the workers 2 ̆ 7 employer, seeking to bargain collectively over wages, hours, and conditions of labor. The employer refuses to bargain. The union sues the employer, claiming that the refusal to bargain violates the workers 2 ̆ 7 constitutionally protected right of association. In each of these cases, the plaintiffs seek to invoke constitutional norms against a <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actor.</b> Constitutional systems address their ability to do so through the doctrines of state action or horizontal effect: The plaintiff loses if the defendant is not a 2 ̆ 2 state actor, 2 ̆ 2 or if the constitutional system does not give constitutional guarantees direct horizontal effect. Another way of describing the cases is this: In each the defendant has acted in a manner authorized by background rules of property and contract, rules which have not been modified by legislation applicable to the action the defendant took. The college relies on the employment-at-will doctrine; the hospital and the farm owner rely on the rule of contract law that no one is required to make a contract on terms other than those to which he or she agrees. The plaintiffs claim is therefore that the nation 2 ̆ 7 s constitution necessarily alters those background rules. The state action/horizontal effect doctrine identifies the circumstances under which such claims are legally valid. [CONT...|$|E

The Commission's documents on its policy of consultation and cooperation with external <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors</b> reveal that a reflective approach has emerged during the 1980 s, referring to a more elaborate concept of 'good governance'. The gradual extension is most noticeable in the change of terminology, from ‘consultation’ (1960 / 70 s) to 'partnership' (1980 / 90 s) and 'participation' (1990 s/ 2000).

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades in Thailand, <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors,</b> such as NGOs, intellectuals, and people's organizations, have found {{widening}} opportunities to participate in policy formation and in the implementation of local development. The government has facilitated the formation of civil society forums, in the expectation of influencing local-level governance. The last two national five-year development plans were formulated after taking into account the voices of people in the provinces. Even though they may seem petty, some state funds are now transmitted through non-governmental institutions for policy implementation at the grassroots level. These changes have their origin in a reformation of rural development administration in early 1980 s. This reformation in due course led to policies that have allowed the participation of <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors.</b> Meanwhile, rural people have proved their ability to engage in participatory development by forming various local organizations, while NGOs have grown to be proficient facilitators of local development.

Though governmental leaders have justified not funding HIV treatment programs {{because they believe that}} poverty needs to be dealt with first, social spending has been slashed as part of an adherence to a neo-liberal economic model. Though {{it would seem that the}} government would seem to have everything to gain by establishing a cooperative relationship with <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors</b> regarding the epidemic, the relationship between the government and <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors</b> has instead been described as nothing short of hostile. Though the government enthusiastically backed Virodene, a supposed treatment for AIDS that turned out to be no more than an industrial solvent, other ‘scientifically backed’ AIDS treatments have been treated with caution and skepticism – to the point where the government even refused to provide funding for programs to prevent mother to child transmission of the virus. And perhaps the most perplexing is that although widely respected for his intellect and cool demeanor, former President Mbeki chose to risk his political career on the AIDS issue by shunning away from the mainstream consensus on the biomedical causes of the epidemic and instead surrounded himself and sought advice from AIDS ‘dissidents’ This thesis will seek explanations for these apparent contradictions. Using Bourdieu’s (1986) typology of capitals, it will build on an argument put forward by Helen Schneider (2002) : from the South African government’s perspective, the contestation regarding HIV and AIDS policy and implementation is over symbolic capital, or the right to legitimately hold and exercise political power regarding the epidemic. Though this argument helps explain the conflictual relationship between the government and <b>non-governmental</b> <b>actors</b> regarding the AIDS crisis, in order to understand the perplexing contradictions within the governmental policy response, the political context of policy formation must first be taken into consideration...|$|R
