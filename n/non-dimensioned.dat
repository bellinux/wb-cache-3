40|$|Lateral {{buckling}} phenomenon {{is one of}} the most important factors to determine the maxsmumload carrying capacity of H-shaped beams. This paper presents the results of numerical analysisof the elastic lateral buckling load of H-shaped beams under various types of bending moments;unequal end moments, bending moments due to uniformly distributed load and combined mo-ments of these two. Generally, partial differential equations in equilibrium condition are impos-sible to solve analytically. In this paper, basic equations are replaced by finite difference equations. Lateral buckling load is obtained as the load at which the stiffness matrix of the beam becomessingular. As the results of analysis, it is observed that the acting location in vertical direction ofuniform load significantly affects upon the lateral buckling load. <b>Non-dimensioned</b> bucklingload is quasi-linear to the span length of beams. On the other hand, it is also confirmed thatthe lateral buckling load of the beams subjected to not only end moments but uniformly dis-tributed load, is given as a very complex function of dimension of cross-section, end moment ratio(α), magnitude of uniformly distributed load (β) and span length (L). Appropriate formulationfor design is urgently needed considering the combination of the above-mentioned factors...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhen {{studying}} patrimonial edifices or sites, documentary sources, may {{they originate}} from archives or from contemporary survey campaigns, provide partial evidences from which the researcher will infer possible scenarios on how an edifice or site may have evolved throughout the centuries. Documentation analysis and visualisation are therefore vital {{to the understanding of}} the architectural heritage. They are the only scientific basis from which virtual renderings can be proposed and justified. Still, the making of 3 D scenes in our field of experimentation is most often only in relation with communications goals. Virtual renderings, although presented as visualisations of an edifice, totally mask the semantics behind the scene, meaning the reasons behind the shapes and in definitive any kind of scientific analysis since they provide certainty where only probability should be considered. Such seducing results may be of great use, they may be considered as a visualisation of geometrical shapes, but in no way can they be considered as visualisation of architectural heritage data. We propose an approach of data visualisation in which 3 D scenes act as interpretative interfaces to the documentation, and in which the objects represented are given appearances that show what can be stated form the reading of each object's documentation. We have defined a methodology in which the documentation is analysed and attached to architectural concepts with respect to the notion of scale, and in which the concepts are given representations that are used both as visualisations of the documentation's analysis and as interfaces in the documentation's database. Our experimental set is the centre of the city of Kraków (Poland). We introduce in this paper several recent developments of our research : a combination of persistence mechanisms that includes XML parsing and RDBMS, links between objects and documentary sources, symbolical visualisation of undocumented / <b>non-dimensioned</b> objects. We also introduce a recent experimentation of this framework at structural scale on major edifices in Kraków's city centre...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: On {{the basis}} of Reddy’s higher order shear {{deformation}} plate theory and the von Kármán’s geometry nonlinear theory, governing equations for nonlinear thermal buckling and post-buckling of cross-ply laminated composite beam subjected to a temperature rise are derived, in which the stretching-bending coupling terms produced by the non-homogenous distribution of the material properties are included. By using the shooting method to solve the corresponding nonlinear boundary value problem, numerical solutions for thermal post-buckling of cross-ply shear deformation laminated composite beam with its both ends immovably simply supported under uniform temperature rise are obtained. As an example, equilibrium paths and configurations for laminated composite beam paved in term of 0 / 90 / 0 are presented and characteristic curves of the nonlinear deformation changing with the thermal load were plotted. The effects of the geometric and physical parameters on the deformation of the beam are also examined.

Recently localized arc filament plasma actuators (LAFPA) were developed to force an axisymmetric Mach 0. 9 jet. Previous experimentation was improved upon by adding four actuators to an eight actuator equally spaced setup. A new nozzle extension was designed to house these twelve actuators and an adaptor was developed to provide flush mounting of the electrodes of the actuators between the nozzle and extension. The twelve actuators were used to excite the flow over a large frequency range, which was expressed in terms of the <b>non-dimension</b> forcing Strouhal number (StDF).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-linear {{finite element model}} (FEM) used to predict the behaviour of slender concrete filled steel tubular (CFST) columns with elliptical hollow sections subjected to axial compression. The accuracy of the FEM was validated by comparing the numerical prediction against experimental observation of eighteen elliptical CFST columns which carefully chosen to represent typical sectional sizes and member slenderness. The adaptability to apply the current design rules provided in Eurocode 4 for circular and rectangular CFST columns to elliptical CFST columns were discussed. A parametric study is carried out with various section sizes, lengths and concrete strength in order to cover {{a wider range of}} member cross-sections and slenderness which is currently used in practices to examine the important structural behaviour and design parameters, such as column imperfection, <b>non-dimension</b> slenderness and buckling reduction factor, etc. It is concluded that the design rules given in Eurocode 4 for circular and rectangular CFST columns may be adopted to calculate the axial buckling load of elliptical CFST columns although using the imperfection of length/ 300 specified in the Eurocode 4 might be over-conservative for elliptical CFST columns with lower non-dimensional slenderness...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Cluster {{microforms}} are a type {{of small}} scale bed-form found in the surface layer of some gravel bed rivers. These bed-forms are comprised of discrete, organized groupings of particles that sit above the average elevation of the surrounding bed. As part of the structural organization of the bed, clusters are believed to impact the local dynamics of the fluvial system through the feedback process involving the flow field, entrainable sediment and stable bed morphology. Approach: In this study, flow and sediment characteristic measured at a laboratory flume and {{the presence or absence}} of clusters at each of these tests was recorded. A statistical analysis using logistic regression was performed to examine the correlation between the occurrence of clusters and various <b>non-dimension</b> combinations of measured variables. Results: It was found that the best parameters for predicting the clusters presence are gd 2 u /hU 2 avg and gd 2 u /U 2 avg. In two parameters analysis it was found that clustering was best predicted by gd 2 u /U 2 avg and Ï b /ÏU 2 avg.

40|$|Steady and {{unsteady}} force {{measurements and}} surface pressure measurements on cylinders in single and tandem configurations were performed for Reynolds numbers from sub- up to transcritical values. The smooth and rough cylinders, either with a square cross-section and rounded edges {{or with a}} circular cross-section, represent typical column shapes for large floating offshore structures. The measurements were conducted in the DNW High Pressure Wind Tunnel in Göttingen, a specialized high Reynolds number facility. The aerodynamic forces on the cylinder were measured using a both sided piezo-electric balance. For the tandem cases, only the forces on the downstream cylinder were measured due to restrictions of the test setup. In addition to the unsteady force measurements the time-mean surface pressures at two locations on the cylinders were obtained. As a supplement, a pressure rake {{was used to measure}} the time-mean pressure and thus velocity distribution {{in the wake of the}} (downstream) cylinder. Variations of the Reynolds number were possible over almost three orders of magnitude in the range from Re = 4 · 10 ^ 4 up to 12 · 10 ^ 6 by changing the free stream flow velocity and the total pressure. In case of the square cross-section cylinders the dependence of the aerodynamic forces and surface pressures on the Reynolds number were investigated for various angles of incidence � and for two <b>non-dimension</b> surface roughness values of O(10 ^− 6) and O(10 ^− 3).

40|$|Some {{mechanical}} systems with gaps {{such as in}} disc brakes and Cardan joints exhibit nonlinearity under certain load conditions, which is unpredictable and highly sensitive to initial conditions. Previous studies were mainly focused on either a single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) system or a flexible beam with uniform elastic foundation. The analysis of this thesis {{is a combination of}} these two where gaps are first introduced to a flexible beam model. A model of a beam resting on compliant foundation with gaps has been developed and analyzed. The assumed modes method is used to derive the equations of motion (EOM 2 ̆ 7 s) for the system. The responses of both rigid and flexible beam systems with linear piecewise contact vibration is considered. For the rigid beam system with only transverse DOF, the piecewise linear function method and <b>non-dimension</b> analysis are used to determine the solution. For the multi-DOF system, the EOM 2 ̆ 7 s are solved by numerical time integration. The pseudo-arc continuation and Floquet multipliers provide the completed frequency response along with relevant stability information. The primary resonance has been analyzed in different parameters. Several types of bifurcations are observed around the resonant frequency, some leading to chaotic motion within a small range of excitation frequencies. For the parametric analysis, the effect of gaps, excitation force, constraint load, damping and number of springs on the response are discussed, which are used to describe the types of nonlinear response (softening/hardening or both) shown on the resonant peaks. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{benefits}} of using <b>non-dimension</b> analysis to develop a control law for a flexible electro-mechanical system. The system that is analyzed consists of a DC motor connected to a load inertia {{through a set of}} gears. A state space system model is derived using LaGrange 2 ̆ 7 s equation and then non-dimensionalized using a linear transformation. The resulting system model reveals the system character more clearly through the resulting dimensionless parameters. The parameters highlight the interaction between system properties and motor constants and demonstrate {{the benefits of}} a concurrent mechatronics design process. Open-loop behavior is analyzed and an optimal value for these paramaters can be found by varying the gear ratio. Once the best possible gear ratio is determined, a PID control law is developed and the closed loop performance is analyzed. With the optimal gear ratio, the power required to control the system is minimized. Also, dynamic inversion is applied to control the system. Dynamic inversion requires a square 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 matrix in the state space model. A new method to apply dynamic inversion to a system with a non-square 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 matrix is demonstrated. To make the matrix invertible, a linear transform is applied to the state space model. A Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) design method is applied to find the transformation matrix values that will make the 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 matrix invertible.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{pertains}} {{to the development of}} a foundation model for predicting the behavior of geosynthetic reinforcement railway track system rested on soft clay subgrade. The ballast and sub-ballast layers have been idealized by Pasternak shear layer. The geosynthetic layer is represented by a stretched rough elastic membrane. Burger model has been used to characterize the soft clay subgrade. Numerical solutions have been obtained by adopting the finite difference scheme combined with <b>non-dimensioning</b> the governing equations of the proposed model. The results confirm that the present model is quite capable of predicting the time-dependent settlement response of geosynthetic reinforcement railway track system placed on soft clay subgrade. The surface settlement profile and mobilized tensile load of geosynthetics has been evaluated by considering variation in the wheel load, sleeper width, thickness of ballast and sub-ballast layers and shear modulus of ballast and sub-ballast layers. It has been observed that an increase in the sleeper width by 24 % results in the reduction in central settlement and mobilized tensile load by 6. 5 % and 20. 1 %, respectively. It was found that with a 50 % increase in the thickness of the ballast layer, the central settlement has decreased by 7. 3 % and the mobilized tension at the zone of maximum curvature has increased by 24. 6 %. However, with an increase in the thickness of the sub-ballast layer, a considerable reduction in both central settlement and the mobilization of tension on geosynthetic has been noticed. The pattern of variation of settlement and mobilized tension for an increase in the shear modulus of ballast and sub-ballast material was found to be almost similar...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new {{technique}} of modelling <b>non-dimensioning</b> severe weather for power system reliability calculations is developed. The model is suitable for both transmission and distribution networks {{and is based on}} geographically moving winds and ice storms. The modelled weather has severity levels that vary with time and change continuously as the weather passes a region. Different weather situations are represented with scenarios. For each scenario the weather parameters, such as size, strength, speed and direction can vary. A stochastic method for choosing parameters is also described. This method is based on probabilities for different weather situations for Swedish conditions. A stochastic vulnerability model for the components is required for each scenario to connect the risk of failure to the weather situation. The model developed here connects the direct wind impact with the impact from the ice storm which is given by an ice accretion model. It is assumed that the probability for an individual segment to break down due to the impact of a given weather depends on load functions for wind and ice together with the vulnerability model for components. It is possible to estimate the outage risk as well as the time difference between mean times to failure in different lines. Monte Carlo methods, where many scenarios are simulated, are used in the case studies. Studies of the system vulnerability is a future work of this project but in one small case study the probability for outage in a load point is estimated. To be able to estimate repair times after a severe weather the reliability calculations are extended with a restoration model which gives distributions of down times for the broken components. The situations after the ice storm that are studied are so severe that gathering of all or almost all possible restoration resources is required to restore the system. Restoration times for different components are not assumed to be independent; on the other hand they are assumed to be strongly correlated. The restoration process is dependent on staff situation, distance between location of spare parts and the breakdown, forecasts, availability of roads and distance to other breakdowns; this is included in the model. A method for simulation of non-Gaussian correlated random numbers is developed to include the correlations during the restoration process. The case studies show the impact of the different weather situations on the components and the following restoration times for the broken components. QC 2010110...|$|R
40|$|Dissolved air {{flotation}} (DAF) is a separation technique, often used after a primary gravity separator {{to enhance the}} quality of the wastewater, so it can be released to streams, rivers, and the sea in a manner not to violate the environment. DAF works by removing oil droplets from oil-in-water mixtures by air bubbles of an average diameter of 50 μm {{with a standard deviation of}} 5. 5 μm. The air bubbles used in these experiments were generated as a result of rapid pressure reduction of water saturated with air when it released from the bottom of the DAF tank. The main aim of the DAF experiments reported here was to measure the removal efficiency of oil droplet mostly in a diameter range between 15 and 80 μm that were created using a static mixer. The DAF tank located at the University of Surrey was a scale model of existing DAF unit used by Thames Water plc. The effects of seven operating parameters that are believed to affect the performance of DAF were investigated. The operating parameters consist of inlet oil concentration, air saturator pressure, temperature, the salinity of continuous phase, type of oil, flow rate of the mixture and coagulant dosage. Two independent analysis methods were used to estimate the removal efficiency of oil droplet. They are a droplet counting and an oil-in-water measuring methods. The droplet counting method used a Coulter Counter that provided numbers of oil droplet passed through the aperture based on the selected size range. The oil-in-water measuring method used an ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), which the removal efficiencies were estimated from the absorbance values that were measured at the optimum wavelength of 400 nm. The analyses done with these two methods found that the inlet oil concentration and flow rate of the mixture into DAF tank were inversely proportional to the oil droplet removal efficiency. The other parameters such as saturator pressure, temperature, water salinity and alum dosage were directly proportional to the oil droplet removal efficiency. Vegetable oil, which has larger spreading coefficient than lamp oil obtained a better oil droplet removal efficiency. Coulter Counter showed that a better removal efficiency for vegetable oil obtained at larger oil droplet ranges size, 50 μm and above. This was because the oil droplets were removed by gravity and enhanced by air bubbles. Contrary to lamp oil, which the worst removal efficiency was obtained at larger size ranges due to the coalescence of oil droplets. Results from these experiments were used to obtain a correlation that can predict removal efficiency. This was done by performing dimensional analysis. It was carried out using Buckingham Pi and scaling methods. It involved with the identification of two <b>non-dimension</b> and nine dimensional parameters. The dimensional analysis concluded that the removal efficiency is a function of eight other dimensionless groups, which are ratio of inlet oil and mixture flow rat...|$|R
