5|$|In July 2015, after <b>nearly</b> <b>ten</b> {{years of}} Eris being {{considered}} the ninth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun, close-up imagery from the New Horizons mission more accurately determined Pluto's volume {{to be slightly}} larger than Eris's, rather than slightly smaller as previously thought. Eris is now the tenth-largest object known to directly orbit the sun by volume, though not by mass.|$|E

5|$|Benfica {{started the}} {{domestic}} season by winning their fourth Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, beating Vitória de Setúbal one-nil. In the Primeira Liga, Benfica struggled initially, making their worst entry ever. Results improved following a European win against Lille, with Benfica climbing several places and defeating Porto in the Clássico. In late October, the team experienced {{a drop in}} form, going a month without a win. In December, Benfica's results improved in December, qualifying for the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time}} in eleven years and winning <b>nearly</b> <b>ten</b> matches in a row, allowing them to get within three points of the top of the league.|$|E

50|$|The game {{takes place}} in the eponymous world, {{populated}} by humans and objects called Seru, which can join with humans and grant fantastic powers.

This is also the last album to feature Dutkiewicz on drums, as he would switch to guitar before the touring process. The drumming position was filled by Tom Gomes.|$|E

5|$|The Indo-Pakistani {{conflict}} was {{sparked by the}} Bangladesh Liberation war, a conflict between the traditionally dominant West Pakistanis and the majority East Pakistanis. In 1970, East Pakistanis demanded autonomy for the state, but the Pakistani government failed to satisfy these demands and, in early 1971, a demand for secession took form in East Pakistan. In March, Pakistan Armed Forces launched a fierce campaign to curb the secessionists, including the soldiers and police from East Pakistan. Thousands of East Pakistanis died, and <b>nearly</b> <b>ten</b> million refugees fled to West Bengal, an adjacent Indian state. In April, India decided {{to assist in the}} formation of the new nation of Bangladesh.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed. The lights that can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed <b>nearly</b> <b>ten</b> miles away by grips.|$|E

Despite Kassian surpassing his goal total from his rookie season, the Sedins started the year with their lowest output in <b>nearly</b> <b>ten</b> years, combining for 14 {{points in the first}} 10 games. Coinciding with the line changes, Vancouver went on a six-game winning streak between the end of January and their February 12 game.

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1988, the West Indies had {{experienced}} <b>nearly</b> <b>ten</b> years as the best Test team in world cricket, including a streak of winning 10 of 11 Test series they played from 1980 to 1985–86 (the other was drawn). However, the West Indies side that had enjoyed this considerable recent success was beginning {{to show signs of}} ageing. The experienced batsmen Viv Richards (the captain), Gordon Greenidge, Jeff Dujon, and Desmond Haynes were all coming to the end of their careers, and bowlers Michael Holding and Joel Garner and batsman Larry Gomes had recently retired. As a result, the squad arrived with an unusually inexperienced group of pace bowlers. Supporting Malcolm Marshall, a veteran of 53 Tests, were relative newcomers Courtney Walsh (20 Tests), Patrick Patterson (11), Winston Benjamin (4), Curtly Ambrose (3) and Ian Bishop (0).|$|E
5|$|Continuing westward, Inez made {{landfall}} {{as a small}} hurricane on the Barahona Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. There, {{the storm}} flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800houses. Nationwide, there were about 100deaths and $12million in damage. After affecting the country, Inez struck southwestern Haiti, where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s. As many as 1,000people were killed, and 60,000people were left homeless. Damage totaled $20.35million in Haiti, prompting the United States government to send aid {{for the first time}} in <b>nearly</b> <b>ten</b> years due to previous mishandling of funds. Inez weakened quickly over Hispaniola, although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern Cuba on September30. In the country, 125,000people were forced to evacuate, and there were three deaths and $20million in damage.|$|E
