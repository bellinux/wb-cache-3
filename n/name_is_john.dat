5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would remember having given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E

2500|$|Identification is an {{assertion}} of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement [...] "Hello, my <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Doe" [...] {{they are making}} a claim of who they are. However, their claim {{may or may not}} be true. Before John Doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to verify that the person claiming to be John Doe really is John Doe.

2500|$|Some have wrongfully {{claimed that}} Jean Charest downplays his legal first name John by {{presenting}} himself in French as Jean {{so as to}} appeal more to francophone Quebecers. For example, in the 1997 federal election, Bloc Québécois MP Suzanne Tremblay attacked Charest by saying, [...] "First, let's recall who Jean Charest really is... his real <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John,</b> that's what's on his birth certificate, not Jean." [...] Charest responded that, his mother being an Irish-Quebecer, it was the Irish priest who baptized him that wrote John on the baptism certificate, {{but that he was}} always known as Jean in his family and with his peers as well. [...] He also went to French schools.|$|E

2500|$|Elliott and Goulding lent {{their voices}} {{to a variety}} of {{recurring}} characters and countless one-shots, creating a multi-layered world that parodied the real-life world of radio broadcasting. [...] Elliott and Goulding played [...] "Bob" [...] and [...] "Ray", the hosts of an ostensibly serious radio program. Their [...] "staff" [...] (all voiced by Elliott and Goulding) was a comic menagerie of reporters, book reviewers, actors and all other manner of radio personalities, all of whom interacted with [...] "Bob" [...] and [...] "Ray" [...] as well as with each other. [...] Almost all of these characters had picturesque names, as in one sketch where Bob introduced Ray as one Maitland W. Mottmorency, who then replied, [...] "My <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> W. Norvis. I have terrible handwriting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alexis and Aline arrive ("With {{heart and}} with voice"), and it soon {{becomes clear that}} his widower father Sir Marmaduke and her widowed mother Lady Sangazure are concealing long-held {{feelings}} for one another, which propriety however demands remain hidden ("Welcome joy, adieu to sadness"). The betrothal ceremony is carried out, and left alone together Alexis reveals to his fiancée his plans for practical implementation of his principle that love should unite all classes and ranks ("Love feeds on many kinds of food, I know"). He has invited a representative from a respectable London firm of sorcerers to Ploverleigh ("My <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Wellington Wells"). Aline has misgivings about hiring a real sorcerer. [...] Nevertheless, Alexis instructs Wells to prepare a batch of love potion, sufficient to affect the entire village, except {{that it must have}} no effect on married people.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Gilbert's story, An Elixir of Love, critics have traced several {{ideas in the}} opera to earlier sources. The concept of a love philtre was widespread in nineteenth century opera, and a philtre that causes people {{to fall in love}} with first person who they see is found in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. [...] The idea of depicting the sorcerer as a respectable tradesman is comparable to the respectable friar in E. L. Blanchard's 1863 burlesque, Harlequin and Friar Bacon, who is described as a [...] "Licensed Dealer in Black Art". [...] A drinking-chorus with tea instead of alcoholic drink appeared in Gilbert's The Merry Zingara (1868), a burlesque of The Bohemian Girl. [...] In [...] "My <b>name</b> <b>Is</b> <b>John</b> Wellington Wells", Gilbert reused rhymes from one of his Bab Ballads, The Student.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Johnny Fever (Howard Hesseman) is a burned-out veteran {{disc jockey}} from Los Angeles {{who came to}} WKRP after being fired from a major station there when he said [...] "booger" [...] on the air. After WKRP changes its format, one of Fever's first on-air words (after being told by Travis [...] "you can even say 'booger' if you want to") is [...] "booger." [...] Cynical and neurotic, and an {{occasional}} insomniac who consumes large amounts of coffee, Fever is usually in one sort of trouble or another. Though the character's real <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Caravella, Fever occasionally uses other air names, notably Johnny Cool, Johnny Duke, Johnny Style, Johnny Midnight, Johnny Sunshine, Professor Sunshine, Rip Tide and Heavy Early. This role is possibly Howard Hesseman's signature role as an actor (as {{he had been a}} disc jockey for a brief time).|$|E
2500|$|Tarzan {{is the son}} of a British {{lord and}} lady who were marooned on the Atlantic coast of Africa by mutineers. When Tarzan was an infant, his mother died, and his father was killed by Kerchak, leader of the ape tribe by whom Tarzan was adopted. Soon after his parents' death, Tarzan became a feral child, and his tribe of apes are known as the Mangani, Great Apes of a species unknown to science. Kala is his ape mother. Burroughs added stories {{occurring}} during Tarzan's adolescence in his sixth Tarzan book, Jungle Tales of Tarzan. Tarzan is his ape name (meaning [...] "White-Skin"); his English <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Clayton, Viscount Greystoke (according to Burroughs in Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle; Earl of Greystoke in later, less canonical sources, notably the 1984 movie Greystoke). In fact, Burroughs's narrator in Tarzan of the Apes describes both Clayton and Greystoke as fictitious names – implying that, within the fictional world that Tarzan inhabits, he may have a different real name.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the help}} of Joe Dever, Paul Barnett, whose pen <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Grant, wrote twelve novelizations of the Lone Wolf books known as the Legends of Lone Wolf, several of which were heavily edited before publication. They have {{received}} mixed reviews from fans. Barnett was {{the creator of the}} characters Alyss, Qinefer, and Thog. Random House stopped publishing the novelizations after the twelfth book because [...] "the books weren't selling," [...] though the truth of this statement is contested. Barnett entered discussions with an Italian publisher about reprinting the books unedited in Italian, this finally occurring with some editing of the original text. In July 2009, he announced on his blog that Dark Quest Books would republish an upgraded version of the series in English beginning in 2010. As of April 2015, two omnibuses, containing the first six novels of the series, have been published, with a third one being listed on the publisher's website.|$|E

Also, in the eighth-season episode [...] "Nurse Doctor", he gives his full name as Francis John Patrick Mulcahy. Yet, in all other episodes, his <b>name</b> <b>was</b> <b>John</b> Patrick Francis Mulcahy, and he just wanted others to call him by his confirmation name, Francis.|$|R

2500|$|Four {{numbers were}} encored {{during the opening}} night: Aline's aria [...] "Oh, happy young heart", [...] "My <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Wellington Wells", the Act II quintet [...] "I rejoice that it's decided" [...] and Sir Marmaduke's and Lady Sangazure's duet [...] "Welcome joy, adieu to sadness". [...] The Observer called this duet [...] "a {{masterpiece}} of construction. ... The Baronet sings {{to the accompaniment of}} a gavotte, and suddenly bursts forth into a rapid semi-quaver passage, expressive of his admiration of the lady. She follows his example, and while one sings a slow movement the other sings the presto movement alternatively". [...] The Era called the quintet [...] "the gem of the opera", because it is [...] "written with delightful fluency and grace, is admirably harmonised, and the melody is as fresh as May dew." [...] Punch argued that [...] "the quintette and the old-fashioned duet with minuet step are the two best numbers" [...] in the opera.|$|E
2500|$|The Sorcerer also {{contained}} several musical techniques {{that would become}} typical in the operas. [...] One {{of the most important}} ones is the comic baritone's lightly orchestrated, rapid-fire patter song, which would {{become one of the most}} distinguishing and popular features of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] Following Italian opera precedents, such as [...] "Largo al factotum" [...] from The Barber of Seville, these numbers juxtapose virtuosity in their speed of delivery (requiring clarity of elocution) with their often comic or satiric lyrics. [...] In [...] "My <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> Wellington Wells", the title character of The Sorcerer introduces himself as a tradesman of an ironic kind: [...] "a dealer in magic and spells". [...] Another typical Sullivanian musical technique is the contrapuntal combination of slow and rapid tunes in one song and a tenor aria set in 6/8 time. [...] Sullivan did this so frequently in the Savoy operas that comedian Anna Russell, in her comedy routine [...] "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera", exclaimed, [...] "the tenor...according to tradition, must sing an aria in 6/8 time". [...] Another repeated musical technique was the emphasis of a single syllable to distinguish otherwise identical lines. [...] For example, in the vicar's Act I song, the same melody is sung in each of the two stanzas using the following text: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{carry my}} visiting-card in my hand, sir," [...] the other replied, {{swinging}} his dressing-case around. [...] "My <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>John</b> P. Dunster." ...|$|E
