40|$|The {{mechanics}} of the actin cytoskeleton have {{a central role in}} the regulation of cells and tissues, but the details of how molecular sensors recognize deformations and forces are elusive. By performing cytoskeleton laser <b>nanosurgery</b> in cultured epithelial cells and fibroblasts, we show that the retraction of stress fibers (SFs) is restricted to the proximity of the cut and that new adhesions form at the retracting end. This suggests that SFs are attached to the substrate. A new computational model for SFs confirms this hypothesis and predicts the distribution and propagation of contractile forces along the SF. We then analyzed the dynamics of zyxin, a focal adhesion protein present in SFs. Fluorescent redistribution after laser <b>nanosurgery</b> and drug treatment shows a high correlation between the experimentally measured localization of zyxin and the computed localization of forces along SFs. Correlative electron microscopy reveals that zyxin is recruited very fast to intermediate substrate anchor points that are highly tensed upon SF release. A similar acute localization response is found if SFs are mechanically perturbed with the cantilever of an atomic force microscope. If actin bundles are cut by <b>nanosurgery</b> in living Drosophila egg chambers, we also find that zyxin redistribution dynamics correlate to force propagation and that zyxin relocates at tensed SF anchor points, demonstrating that these processes also occur in living organisms. In summary, our quantitative analysis shows that force and protein localization are closely correlated in stress fibers, suggesting a very direct force-sensing mechanism along actin bundles...|$|E

Nanoscale carbon-based structures, such as carbon nanotubes and nanopipes, are one such nanoscopic structure gaining increased attention for <b>nanosurgery</b> and nanomedicine applications because of their unique and superior properties. ^ The abilities and shortcomings of previous carbon-based nanoprobes motivated the development of an alternative <b>nanosurgery</b> tool, the carbon nanopipette. Carbon nanopipettes integrate carbon nanopipes into the tips of pulled glass capillaries without assembly, thereby making the process amendable to mass production. An electrically-conductive carbon film coats {{the entire length of the}} glass micropipette 2 ̆ 7 s inner lumen, facilitating electrical interfacing and fluid transport through the nanoscopic carbon tip. Since carbon nanopipettes incorporate glass micropipettes, standard cell physiology equipment can be used to maneuver the probe to deliver materials to cells and sense cellular processes. ^ Carbon nanopipettes are manufactured without assembly and in quantity. Their composite carbon structure enables them to bend without breaking. Yet, carbon nanopipettes are rigid enough to penetrate into the interior of cells without causing them harm. Carbon nanopipettes are capable of concurrent fluid injection and electrical recording. Highlighting these capabilities, carbon nanopipettes injected calcium-mobilizing second messengers to identify signaling pathways in breast cancer cells and electrically recorded the intracellular response of hippocampal neurons to stimuli.

40|$|Femtosecond (fs) {{laser-based}} intracellular <b>nanosurgery</b> {{has become}} an important tool in cell biology, albeit the mechanisms in the so-called low-density plasma regime are largely unknown. Previous calculations of free-electron densities for intracellular surgery used water as a model substance for biological media and neglected the presence of dye and biomolecules. In addition, it is still unclear on which time scales free-electron and free-radical induced chemical effects {{take place in a}} cellular environment. Here, we present our experimental study on the influence of laser parameters and staining on the intracellular ablation threshold in the low-density plasma regime. We found that the ablation effect of fs laser pulse trains resulted from the accumulation of single-shot multiphoton-induced photochemical effects finished within a few nanoseconds. At the threshold, the number of applied pulses was inversely proportional to a higher order of the irradiance, depending on the laser repetition rate and wavelength. Furthermore, fluorescence staining of subcellular structures before surgery significantly decreased the ablation threshold. Based on our findings, we propose that dye molecules are the major source for providing seed electrons for the ionization cascade. Consequently, future calculations of free-electron densities for intracellular <b>nanosurgery</b> have to take them into account, especially in the calculations of multiphoton ionization rates...|$|E

Dynein-mediated pulling forces position the spindle, but {{their role in}} anaphase {{is a matter of}} debate. Here, we demonstrate that dynein is responsible for rapid spindle elongation in the model fungus Ustilago maydis. We show that initial slow elongation is supported by kinesin- 5, which is located in the spindle mid-zone. When the spindle reaches ∼ 2 μm in length, the elongation rate increases four-fold. This coincides with the appearance of long and less-dynamic microtubules (MTs) at each pole that accumulate dynein at their tips. Laser-mediated <b>nanosurgery</b> revealed that these MTs exert pulling forces in control cells, but not in dynein mutants. In addition, dynein mutants undergo initial slow anaphase, but fail to establish less-dynamic MTs and do not perform rapid spindle elongation, suggesting that dynein drives anaphase B.

Here we investigate the biophysical basis of this phenomenon by using femtosecond laser <b>nanosurgery</b> to measure the viscoelastic recoil and cell-shape contributions of contractile stress fibers (SFs) located in specific compartments of living cells. Upon photodisruption and recoil, myosin light chain kinase-dependent SFs located along the cell periphery display much lower effective elasticities and higher plateau retraction distances than Rho-associated kinase-dependent SFs located in the cell center, with severing of peripheral fibers uniquely triggering a dramatic contraction of the entire cell within minutes of fiber irradiation. Image correlation spectroscopy reveals that when one population of SFs is pharmacologically dissipated, actin density flows toward the other population. Furthermore, dissipation of peripheral fibers reduces the elasticity and increases the plateau retraction distance of central fibers, and severing central fibers under these conditions triggers cellular contraction.

Working with epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney monolayers we show that cells within the fingers, {{as compared with the}} epithelium, are well oriented and polarized along the main finger direction, which suggests that these cells actively migrate. The cell orientation and polarity decrease continuously from the tip toward the epithelium over a penetration distance of typically two finger lengths. Furthermore, laser photoablation experiments at various locations along these fingers demonstrate that the cells in the fingers are submitted to a tensile stress whose value is larger close to the tip. From a dynamical point of view, cells entering a finger gradually polarize on timescales that depend upon their particular initial position. Selective laser <b>nanosurgery</b> of the leader lamellipodium shows not only that these structures need a leader to progress, but that this leader itself is the consequence of a prior self-organization of the cells forming the finger.

40|$|While {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that nonmuscle myosin II (NMMII) enables stress fibers (SFs) to generate traction forces against the extracellular matrix, {{little is known}} about how specific NMMII isoforms and functional domains contribute to SF mechanics. Here we combine biophotonic and genetic approaches to address these open questions. First, we suppress the NMMII isoforms MIIA and MIIB and apply femtosecond laser <b>nanosurgery</b> to ablate and investigate the viscoelastic retraction of individual SFs. SF retraction dynamics associated with MIIA and MIIB suppression qualitatively phenocopy our earlier measurements in the setting of Rho kinase (ROCK) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibition, respectively. Furthermore, fluorescence imaging and photobleaching recovery reveal that MIIA and MIIB are enriched in and more stably localize to ROCK- and MLCK-controlled central and peripheral SFs, respectively. Additional domain-mapping studies surprisingly reveal that deletion of the head domain speeds SF retraction, which we ascribe to reduced drag from actomyosin crosslinking and frictional losses. We propose a model in which ROCK/MIIA and MLCK/MIIB functionally regulate common pools of SFs, with MIIA crosslinking and motor functions jointly contributing to SF retraction dynamics and cellular traction forces...|$|E
