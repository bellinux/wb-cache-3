5|$|Over {{the next}} {{three and a half}} years, as the World Wide Web's core {{technologies}} of HTML, HTTP, and web browsers developed, a need to distinguish a string that provided an address for a resource from a string that merely named a resource emerged. Although not yet formally defined, the term Uniform Resource Locator came to represent the former, and the more contentious Uniform Resource <b>Name</b> <b>came</b> to represent the latter.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} band Society's Finest, {{in which he}} played guitar, vocalist Tim Lambesis formed As I Lay Dying in 2000. Starting out as a duet with drummer Jordan Mancino, they first met as a band in February 2001. They both were in the {{hardcore}} punk band Point of Recognition. The band's <b>name</b> <b>came</b> from the novel {{of the same name}} by William Faulkner that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel.|$|E

5|$|In early 1971, Rainbow played {{its first}} show, which {{consisted}} of two sets performed at Richmond Community College in Staten Island. After the show, the group discovered that there was already another band called Rainbow. They decided to drop the name, {{and came up with}} the name Wicked Lester, which Klein liked because it was unusual. While the decision to change the group's <b>name</b> <b>came</b> partly out of a desire to avoid any potential legal issues, it also reflected Klein and Eisen's desire to start playing more original compositions.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{analyses of}} the name must account for {{the origins of the}} different forms found in early sources Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the <b>name</b> <b>came</b> into these languages from British Celtic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as * or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into West Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, already before English had become widely spoken in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Pétrus {{was opened}} in March 1999 as {{a joint venture}} between chef Gordon Ramsay and his {{father-in-law}} Chris Hutcheson as Ramsay's second restaurant after Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea. It was opened at 33 St James's Street, London, on 22 March 1999 under head chef Marcus Wareing. The <b>name</b> <b>came</b> from the French wine Pétrus, which was Ramsay's and Wareing's favourite. Whilst located at St James's Street, it was nearby L'Oranger, which Wareing had run for A-Z Restaurants, which reopened shortly after Pétrus, but with Wareing's former sous chef as head chef.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> {{from the}} old Hafslo farm (Old Norse: Hafrsló), since Hafslo Church is located there. The first element of the <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> {{from the old}} male name Hafr or from the word for [...] "goat" [...] (also hafr). The second element of the <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> from the old word ló meaning [...] "meadow, {{probably}} due to the excellent farming areas nearby.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} <b>name</b> <b>came</b> {{from the}} 'Burne' or stream which ran through today's Old Town area of Eastbourne. All {{that can be}} seen of the Burne, or Bourne, is the small pond in Motcombe Gardens. The bubbling source is guarded by a statue of Neptune. Motcombe Gardens are overlooked by St. Mary's Church, a Norman church which allegedly lies on the site of a Saxon ‘moot’, or meeting place. This gives Motcombe its name.|$|E

5|$|To {{fill the}} {{anticipated}} {{lack of a}} fireboat, Phoenix was built in 1954 in Alameda by Hugh F. Munroe of Plant Shipyard, {{paid for by the}} State of California. Her <b>name</b> <b>came</b> from a contest publicized by the Port Authority; the winning suggestion was submitted {{by a member of the}} Phoenix Society, a group of San Francisco citizens interested in civil fire protection. Phoenix, the mythical firebird which rose anew from ashes, seemed appropriate because the city of San Francisco had risen seven times from great fires.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{fall-out}} between Ramsay and A-Z Restaurants over Wareing's contract at L'Oranger, {{which saw}} Ramsay quit Aubergine to open Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, Wareing followed suit by leaving L'Oranger, forcing the restaurant into temporary closure. A-Z Restaurants commenced legal proceedings against the pair, and reopened L’Oranger with Wareing's former sous chef, Kamel Benamar, {{as the new}} head chef. The legal case ended in Ramsay and Wareing paying an out-of-court settlement to the Restaurant group. Ramsay and Wareing worked together to open Pétrus in 1999, with Wareing becoming head chef and operating the restaurant on behalf of Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH), at 33 St James's Street, London. The <b>name</b> <b>came</b> from the French wine Pétrus, which was Ramsay's and Wareing's favourite. Wareing promptly regained the Michelin star he had previously held, with Pétrus being named as a one star restaurant seven months after opening.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{probably}} began {{fighting in}} June 1783, {{at the age}} of thirty-three, although Brailsford suggests it was 1781 or slightly earlier. Johnson had unintentionally slighted a carman (horse-drawn wagon driver) and fighter called Jack Jarvis, who then called for Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour. Johnson comprehensively battered the experienced Jarvis at Lock's Fields, and his <b>name</b> <b>came</b> to the attention of professional fighters. At that time Johnson had no intention of earning a living from the sport, but he became so goaded by a professional known as The Croydon Drover that a fight was arranged for March 1784, at Kennington Common. Johnson beat the Drover to a pulp in 27minutes and decided to become a professional.|$|E
5|$|The allied {{objective}} was to encircle Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. On 15 August 1867, under heavy fire, Brazilian warships forced the passage of Curupayty, an outer line of defense of Humaitá. Joaquim Inácio commanded from {{the bridge of the}} ironclad Brasil, which engaged in the operation. Joaquim Inácio was afterwards awarded the noble title of Barão de Inhaúma (Baron of Inhaúma) on 27 September. The <b>name</b> <b>came</b> from Inhaúma, a region (now a neighborhood) near the city of Rio de Janeiro. His wife had grown up there, and he himself owned a coffee farm in the area. Those landowners, including the Baron of Inhaúma, who produced coffee (the most valuable Brazilian export commodity) were the wealthiest and most influential people in Brazil's southeast. They were owners of slaves, and many of them formed the core of the Conservative Party (the ultraconservative wing called saquarema) and were connected to each other through family and political ties.|$|E
5000|$|The least seedsnipe was {{described}} in 1829 by Eschscholtz. The genus <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> from the Greek thin-, this- (θινος) “shore" [...] or [...] "sandbank” and -corus (κορυδος) “helmet”. The species <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> from Latin rumicis “sorrel” and vorā “eater”.|$|R
2500|$|The island's <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> from a plant {{found on}} the island and used to make brooms. Some people claim that the <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> from the word [...] "blue whale" [...] (Baleine in French) that {{appeared}} next to the island in early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Acantholiparis caecus {{is one of}} the two snailfishes {{within the}} genus Acantholiparis, along with A. opercularis, the spiny snailfish.

5|$|There are {{two words}} in the Marquesan {{language}} for dog: peto, used in the Northern Marquesas, and nuhe, used in the Southern Marquesas. The former {{might have been an}} English loanword from pet or a Spanish loanword from perro (dog), although pero was an alternative for dog (kurī) in the related Māori language. According to another theory supporting its foreign origin, the <b>name</b> <b>came</b> from a New Haven dog named Pato left on Nuku Hiva by the American sea captain Edmund Fanning from 1798 to 1803. The South Marquesan Nuhe is unique in the Polynesian languages, but may have some connection to wanuhe, the word for dog in the Papuan language of the Brumer Islands. French Catholic missionary René-Ildefonse Dordillon listed two other forms: mohoʻio and mohokio in his 1904 dictionary Grammaire et dictionnaire de la langue des iles Marquises.|$|E
5|$|Three of the {{founding}} members of Thirsty Merc – Matthew Baker, Karl Robertson, and Phil Stack – had played together in various bands in Dubbo, a regional New South Wales city. In 1996 Drown was formed with Baker on guitar, Robertson on drums, Peter Jamieson on vocals, and Stack on bass guitar. By 1998 Baker, Jamieson and Stack had split to form Twenty Two and then moved to Sydney. In 2002, Baker and Stack returned to Dubbo where Rai Thistlethwayte, from Sydney, as lead singer (later also on guitar and keyboards) and Stack worked as a live jazz duo and session musicians. They were joined by Baker and Robertson, and formed a pop rock band, initially called Thirsty; soon after they moved to Sydney and were renamed, Thirsty Merc. The band's <b>name</b> <b>came</b> from Thistlethwayte's old Mercedes Benz, which was a gas-guzzler.|$|E
5|$|US131 and its {{predecessors}} bears several memorial designations {{in addition to}} the Sidney Ouwinga Memorial Bypass near Cadillac. One of the oldest is the Mackinaw Trail, named after a former Indian trail that ran from Saginaw to Mackinaw City and Sault Ste. Marie. By 1915, the name was transferred to the roadway that was later numbered US131. The Mackinaw Trail Association was formed that year to promote an all-weather highway between Grand Rapids and Mackinaw City, using a logo incorporating a trout for the road. The name was to be officially applied to the highway in 1929, but the State Senate did not agree to the proposal. The official endorsement of the <b>name</b> <b>came</b> in 1959, after the opening of the Mackinac Bridge revitalized the idea.|$|E
50|$|Poomala's <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> {{from the}} Poovam tree (also called Ceylon oak or Gum-lac tree), which was {{plentiful}} {{here in the}} past. Residents here also claim that this <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> from 'poovan pazham' (A type of banana) which was grown in large amounts.|$|R

5000|$|Oxygen's <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> {{from the}} Greek words oxy genes, meaning [...] "acid-forming". Sulfur's <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> {{from either the}} Latin word sulfurium or the Sanskrit word sulvere; both of those terms are ancient words for sulfur. Selenium is named after the Greek goddess of the moon, Selene, to match the previously-discovered element tellurium, whose <b>name</b> <b>comes</b> from the Latin word telus, meaning earth. Polonium is named after Marie Curie's country of birth, Poland. Livermorium is named for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.|$|R
5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature {{on any of the}} murals, a search for the artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's <b>name</b> <b>came</b> to light in the RAF Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E
