5|$|In the {{mathematics}} of graph drawing, Turán's brick factory problem asks for the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> in {{a drawing of}} a complete bipartite graph. The problem is named after Pál Turán, who formulated it while being forced {{to work in a}} brick factory during World War II.|$|E
5|$|More generally, it {{has been}} proven that every {{complete}} bipartite graph requires a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> that is (for sufficiently large graphs) at least 83% of the number given by the Zarankiewicz bound. Closing the gap between this lower bound and the upper bound remains an open problem.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, pushing wagon loads of bricks from kilns to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each storage site, and the wagons were harder to push at the points where tracks crossed each other. Turán was inspired by this situation to ask how the factory might be redesigned to minimize the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> between these tracks.|$|E

25|$|By using SPQR {{trees to}} encode the {{possible}} embeddings of the planar {{part of an}} apex graph, {{it is possible to}} compute a drawing of the graph in the plane in which the only crossings involve the apex vertex, minimizing the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings,</b> in polynomial time. However, if arbitrary crossings are allowed, it becomes NP-hard to minimize the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings,</b> even in the special case of apex graphs formed by adding a single edge to a planar graph.|$|E
25|$|The {{conjecture}} is {{that there}} can be no better drawing, so that this formula gives the optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> for the complete graphs. An independent formulation of the same conjecture was made by Thomas L. Saaty in 1964.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{crossing}} numbers originated in Turán's brick factory problem, in which Pál Turán {{asked for a}} factory plan that minimized the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> between tracks connecting brick kilns to storage sites. Mathematically, this problem can be formalized as asking for the crossing number of a complete bipartite graph, The same problem arose independently in sociology at approximately the same time, {{in connection with the}} construction of sociograms. Turán's conjectured formula for the crossing numbers of complete bipartite graphs remains unproven, as does an analogous formula for the complete graphs.|$|E
50|$|In knot theory, the writhe is a {{property}} of an oriented link diagram. The writhe {{is the total}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> positive <b>crossings</b> minus the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> negative <b>crossings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Next, we {{construct}} the `normalised complex C(D) = D−n−{n+ − 2n−}, where n− denotes the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> left-handed <b>crossings</b> in the chosen diagram for D, and n+ the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> right-handed <b>crossings.</b>|$|R

25|$|It is also {{possible}} for a class of graphs that is not closed under minors to have bounded local treewidth. In particular {{this is true of}} the 1-planar graphs, graphs that can be drawn in the plane with one crossing per edge, and more generally for the graphs that can be drawn on a surface of bounded genus with a bounded <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> per edge. As with minor-closed graph families of bounded local treewidth, this property has pointed the way to efficient approximation algorithms for these graphs.|$|E
25|$|The {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused the Norway–Soviet Union border to become the Norway–Russia border. This resulted in a more liberal border crossing policy, which saw the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> increase to 80,000 by 1992. For Norwegian authorities this meant that police and customs authorities {{would have to be}} regularly stationed at the border. A large amount of the initial traffic was from Russians who sold crafts and souvenirs at markets and fairs throughout Finnmark. From 1992 Norwegian authorities introduced limitations on the activity, resulting in a reduction in trans-border traffic. However, by 1998 the traffic had nearly hit 100,000.|$|E
25|$|For graphs {{drawn in}} the plane without crossings, Fáry's theorem states that one gets the same class of planar graphs {{regardless}} of whether the edges of the graph are drawn as straight line segments or as arbitrary curves. But this equivalence does not hold true for other types of drawing. For instance, although the crossing number of a graph (the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> in a drawing with arbitrarily curved edges) may be determined in NP, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals to determine whether there exists a drawing achieving a given bound on the rectilinear crossing number (the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross in any drawing with edges drawn as straight line segments {{in the plane}}).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is {{to prove that the}} minimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> virtual <b>crossings</b> for some {{families}} of virtual knots grows quadratically with respect to the minimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> classical <b>crossings.</b> All previously known estimates for virtual crossing number were principally no more than linear in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> classical <b>crossings</b> (or, what is the same, in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> edges of a virtual knot diagram) and no virtual knot was found with virtual crossing number greater than the classical crossing number...|$|R
40|$|The {{symmetry}} {{of the joint}} distribution <b>of</b> the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> and nestings <b>of</b> two edges has been observed in many combinatorial structures, including permutations, matchings, set partitions, linked partitions, and certain families of graphs. These results have been unified in {{the larger context of}} enumeration of northeast and southeast chains of length 2 in 01 -fillings of moon polyominoes. In this paper we extend this symmetry to fillings of a more general family –layer polyominoes, which are intersection-free and row-convex, but not necessarily column-convex. Our main result is that the joint distribution <b>of</b> the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> and nestings over 01 -fillings is symmetric and invariant under an arbitrary permutation of rows...|$|R

25|$|For the {{purposes}} of defining the crossing number, a drawing of an undirected graph is a mapping from the vertices of the graph to disjoint points in the plane, and from {{the edges of the}} graph to curves connecting their two endpoints. No vertex should be mapped onto an edge that it is not an endpoint of, and whenever two edges have curves that intersect (other than at a shared endpoint) their intersections should form a finite set of proper crossings, where the two curves are transverse. A crossing is counted separately for each of these crossing points, for each pair of edges that cross. The crossing number of a graph is then the minimum, over all such drawings, of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> in a drawing.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} {{traditional}} notation, due to the 1927 paper of J. W. Alexander and G. Briggs and later extended by Dale Rolfsen in his knot table (see image above and List of prime knots). The notation simply organizes knots by their crossing number. One writes the crossing number with a subscript to denote its order amongst all knots with that crossing number. This order is arbitrary and so has no special significance (though in each <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> the twist knot comes after the torus knot). Links are written by the crossing number with a superscript to denote the number of components and a subscript to denote its order within the links with {{the same number of}} components and crossings. Thus the trefoil knot is notated 31 and the Hopf link is 2.|$|E
25|$|Level {{crossings}} in Thailand, and Malaysia {{are largely}} manually operated, where the barriers are lowered using a manual switch when trains approach. A significant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings</b> are without barriers. Railway electrification in Malaysia has gradually eliminated level crossings in Peninsular Malaysia, replacing those along nearly all upgraded lines with large overhead viaducts or deep underground tunnels, and simply cutting off non-essential crossings outright. Level crossings used to exist along the KTM railway line in Singapore, {{but these were}} removed after the closure of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, and the moving of the KTM railway station to Woodlands Train Checkpoint. But {{there are still some}} that are used on the line between Port Klang - Westport (Pulau Indah). However, it seems like only the level crossing near Port Klang Komuter Station has the barrier.|$|E

30|$|The {{difference}} between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> zero <b>crossings</b> and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> extrema is at most one.|$|R
25|$|Some authors {{add more}} {{constraints}} {{to the definition}} of a drawing, for instance that each pair of edges have at most one intersection point (a shared endpoint or crossing). For the crossing number as defined above, these constraints make no difference, because a crossing-minimal drawing cannot have edges with multiple intersection points. If two edges with a shared endpoint cross, the drawing can be changed locally at the crossing point, leaving the rest of the drawing unchanged, to produce a different drawing with one fewer crossing. And similarly, if two edges cross two or more times, the drawing can be changed locally at two crossing points to make a different drawing with two fewer crossings. However, these constraints are relevant for variant definitions of the crossing number that, for instance, count only the numbers of pairs of edges that cross rather than the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tait's {{motivation}} {{for studying the}} ménage problem came from {{trying to find a}} complete listing of mathematical knots with a given <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>crossings,</b> say n. In Dowker notation for knot diagrams, an early form of which was used by Tait, the 2n points where a knot crosses itself, in consecutive order along the knot, are labeled with the 2n numbers from 1 to 2n. In a reduced diagram, the two labels at a crossing cannot be consecutive, so the set of pairs of labels at each crossing, used in Dowker notation to represent the knot, can be interpreted as a perfect matching in a graph that has a vertex for every number in the range from 1 to 2n and an edge between every pair of numbers that has different parity and are non-consecutive modulo 2n. This graph is formed by removing a Hamiltonian cycle (connecting consecutive numbers) from a complete bipartite graph (connecting all pairs of numbers with different parity), and so it has a number of matchings equal to a ménage number. For alternating knots, this matching is enough to describe the knot diagram itself; for other knots, an additional positive or negative sign needs to be specified for each crossing pair to determine which of the two strands of the crossing lies above the other strand.|$|E
