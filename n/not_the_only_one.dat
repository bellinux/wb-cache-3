The Tsarnaev brothers drew inspiration from Feiz Mohammed's internet rants and decided to kill innocent onlookers at a marathon. Everyone is in danger.|$|E
5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one.</b> Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for {{his actions}} during game eight. Eagleson was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled. Eagleson woke up with bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was not sorry, but he regretted the {{incident}} and planned to not get involved in further series. He did get a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E

5|$|Tennyson is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{that uses}} the image; John Everett Millais's {{painting}} Mariana is based on Tennyson's version of Mariana, and lines 9 through 12 of Tennyson's poem {{were used for the}} catalogue description of the painting. Similarly, Millais's version served as the inspiration for Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, Mariana. Tennyson's Mariana and Gaskell's main character, Ruth, are sensitive to the sounds around them and are constantly looking out of their window in image that represents their imprisonment within their homes. The image of Mariana used by Tennyson and the later works are equally of a woman who is weary.|$|E
5|$|The first {{principal}} keeper was James Ewing {{who looked}} after the light {{for the next}} eleven years. Despite the exceptionally adverse conditions faced by the keepers, which resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, Ewing was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> who served the light {{for a decade or}} more. However, some found the lonely rock and its cramped quarters less to their taste. One had to be prevented from diving into the sea and attempting to swim ashore.|$|E
5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, {{in the form of}} a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E

40|$|June 8 - 10, 2003 There is {{something}} comforting {{about the whole}} field of behavioral economics because it shows us we are not alone. We are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> who pay $ 350 up front and $ 100 per month to join a health club so that we will exercise. We don’t view that payment as a sunk cost, but as an impetus to tread the mill. We are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> who got more pain than pleasure from {{the ups and downs}} of our 401 (k) plans. We are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> who will walk away from a coveted antique plate because the dealer won’t come down $ 5, only to pay an extra $ 50 for just the right pair of Ferragamo shoes. We are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> who ask <b>the</b> bartender to take the nuts off the bar or the waitress to take the bread off the table. In short, we are frequently irrational and inconsistent, and don’t always act to maximize our financial well being. And that is fine, because so is almost everyone else. I. The Behavioral Assumptions In short, I fully buy the premise behind Sunstein and Thaler’s paper on libertarian paternalism. People do have ill-formed preferences; they are subject to inertia and susceptible to suggestion; defaults often create endowment effects. And the example...|$|R
5|$|MOHH {{may have}} been the first hip-hop dance {{convention}}, but it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> that exists. Urban Dance Camp (UDC) is a six-week-long German-based dance convention held every year in Lörrach, a small town on the border of France and Switzerland. In a report on the event by a local paper, Bettina Kraft, the manager of UDC, estimated that 85% of the participants were from outside of Germany. In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase, a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers, dance crews, and UDC teachers. Dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, Les Twins, I.aM.mE, b-boy Lilou, and b-boy Hong 10 have performed at the showcase in the past.|$|E
5|$|Winchelsey further irritated Edward {{with his}} {{opposition}} to the Bishop of Lichfield, Walter Langton, who was the king's treasurer. The king was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> to be upset by the archbishop; the abbot of Oseney, in 1297, was so affected by a rebuke from him that he suffered a fatal heart attack. In 1299, Winchelsey and the king briefly reconciled, and the archbishop presided at the king's second marriage, to Margaret of France, at Canterbury. Winchelsey vigorously asserted his authority over his suffragan, or subordinant bishops, quarrelled with Pope Boniface VIII over a Sussex living, and was excommunicated by one of the pope's clerks in 1301. He was absolved in 1302.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session on Friday afternoon, Nico Rosberg was fastest, setting a time of 1:21.531. With the track tarmac still being very new, the surface was {{slippery}} and it was another session that {{saw a lot of}} drivers get caught out. The biggest accident of the practice came after just five minutes, when Max Verstappen crashed at the exit of the stadium, bringing out red flags. After the running resumed, Valtteri Bottas lost the rear of his Williams FW37, caused by a fault in his DRS flap, and crashed at turn one. He was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> having problems in the first corner, as Sergio Pérez, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Pastor Maldonado also went off there. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile had an off-track moment at turn four. Romain Grosjean had to end his first practice of the weekend early, when a clutch failure saw him park his car 28 minutes into the session. Jenson Button ran 25 laps and finished ninth fastest albeit spending half of the session in the pit lane, while the team equipped his car with a new power unit. Behind Rosberg, the two Red Bull drivers were second and third, ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
