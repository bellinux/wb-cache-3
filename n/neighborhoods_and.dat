5|$|Following the meeting, al-Bakri conferred with al-Shahbandar, {{who agreed}} to bring Damascus into the revolt, {{although}} this initial attempt did not materialize.

Al-Bakri maintained particularly close ties to Hasan al-Kharrat, the local boss (qabaday) of al-Shaghur {{and a friend of}} the al-Bakri family. In early August, upon al-Bakri's urging, al-Kharrat formed a militia, which would {{become one of the most}} effective rebel bands in the country. When the French authorities were informed of nationalist rebel plans, they began a wide-scale arrest campaign in the city on 27 August, detaining nearly all of Damascus's nationalist leaders and spokesmen, although al-Bakri, his brothers, and al-Shahbandar managed to evade arrest.|$|E
