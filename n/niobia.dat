Pronounced support effects were observed {{on the nature}} of the supported species. Thus, on alumina, the molybdenum was highly dispersed and predominantly present as polymolybdate clusters while, on <b>niobia,</b> there was evidence for a strong molybdena-support interaction, possibly with formation of a mixed niobium molybdenum oxide. The alumina support strongly stabilised supported oxidic nickel species towards reduction, in contrast with the <b>niobia</b> support.

The purpose of this work is to show the influence of the addition of <b>niobia</b> on the microstructure of ceramic coatings by using x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations.

40|$|The {{influence}} of thermal aging, at intermediate temperature (1 h at 250 °C) {{and in different}} environments, on the electronic and solid-state properties of stabilized 160 nm thick amorphous anodic <b>niobia,</b> grown on magnetron sputtered niobium metal, has been studied. A detailed physicochemical characterisation of the a-Nb 2 O 5 / 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte junction {{has been carried out}} by means of photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as well by differential admittance measurements. A change in the optical band gap (3. 45 eV) of <b>niobia</b> film has been observed after aging (3. 30 eV) at 250 °C in air for 1 hour. A cathodic shift (0. 15 - 0. 2 Volt) in the flat band potential of the junction has been observed by the differential admittance (DA) measurements carried out in a large range of electrode potential values (6 Volt) and ac frequencies (10 Hz- 5 kHz). The frequency dependence of DA data, in absence of an appreciable contribution from surface states distribution, agrees with expectations of the theory of amorphous semiconductor Schottky barrier. The fitting of both components of DA allowed to get information on the distribution of electronic density of states (DOS) as a function of energy and distance from metal oxide interface. The DA measurements evidenced for vacuum treated <b>niobia</b> film an insulating to semiconductor transition with possible metallization of the inner metal/oxide interface. These findings can help to explain the large changes in the measured values of capacitance, after aging, and the larger leakage current observed in <b>niobia</b> electrolytic capacitors...|$|E

Based on the DRIFTS and kinetic studies over NbCZ and Ce 0. 75 Zr 0. 25 O 2, the promotion mechanism by <b>niobia</b> loading was elucidated with an overall reaction pathway. Two different reaction routes, "L-H" mechanism via "NH 4 NO 3 + NO" at low temperatures (350 degrees C), are presented. The <b>niobia</b> addition increases the surface acidity and promotes the formation of nitrates species at low temperatures. In this way, the reaction between the ads-NH 3 and nitrates species is accelerated to form NH 4 NO 3 intermediates, which then decompose to N- 2 and H 2 O. The reaction of the ads-NH 3 species with gaseous NOx at high temperatures is also promoted due to the enhanced acidity and weakened thermal stability of nitrates after <b>niobia</b> loading...|$|E
40|$|Gold {{catalysts}} {{supported on}} <b>niobia</b> and alumina {{are active in}} glycerol oxidation performed in liquid basic solution {{in the presence of}} oxygen. Niobia-supported gold is only slightly less active than commercial Au/TiO 2 catalyst. XPS data allow to characterize gold nanoparticles on both supports. IR studies show that CO adsorbs on gold particles loaded on <b>niobia</b> producing well characterized terminal carbonyls whose C-O stretching frequency shifts up by decreasing CO coverage, an usual behaviour for gold carbonyls. Two families of gold nanoparticles on <b>niobia</b> are characterized by CO stretching frequencies of adsorbed CO at 2098 - 2112 cm(- 1) after reduction at 573 K and at 2108 - 2120 and 2125 - 2135 cm(- 1) after reduction at 773 K. However, after both reduction pretreatments such gold metal particles coexist with strongly oxidizing gold species which are able to convert CO into CO 2 at 153 - 193 K. Based on IR and XPS experiments, the lower activity of alumina-supported gold may be due to a lower density of corner and edge sites on Au nanoparticles, associated to the minor dispersing ability of alumina for gold.

40|$|Dispersed <b>niobia</b> {{catalysts}} {{were prepared}} via a non-aqueous synthesis route. The {{effects of the}} type of oxide support, the support thermal pre-treatment, the calcination temperature and the <b>niobia</b> loading on the activity and selectivity for mesityl oxide (MO) synthesis at 160 C were investigated in an autoclave reactor. The morphological and chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized via EDXRF, XRD, BET and Raman spectroscopy. The strength and nature of the acid sites were elucidated via in situ DRIFT spectra of the adsorption of pyridine as well as the temperature programmed desorption of NH 3 interacting with the surface oxide phase. All four catalyst parameters had significant effects on the catalytic properties. Significantly, the nature of the acidity was clearly linked to the catalyst activity and particularly the catalyst stability. Catalysts exhibiting predominantly Lewis acidity invariably deactivated despite good initial activity, with the final acetone conversion dependent on the catalyst formulation. In contrast, catalysts exhibiting Bronsted acidity showed no evidence of catalyst deactivation after 8 hours of reaction. A plausible mechanism which explains these observations is proposed. Catalysts exhibiting Lewis acidity were more active when the supports were first activated at elevated temperature, likely due to a stronger support-surface oxide interaction as a consequence of increased surface coordinative unsaturation of the support. SiO¬ 2 supported catalysts exhibiting Bronsted acidity were more active if the supports were initially activated at 100 C. Evidently, the hydroxyl groups on the oxide support contribute to the generation of Bronsted acidity. Different oxide supports gave rise to distinct acidic and catalytic properties in the <b>niobia</b> overlayer. The most striking example of this was the direct comparison of <b>niobia</b> dispersed onto two kinds of silica supports following the same preparative method. Unique and very strong acid sites were observed in <b>niobia</b> dispersed onto a commercial SiO¬ 2 catalyst carrier that were not observed in <b>niobia</b> dispersed onto fumed SiO¬ 2. For SiO 2 catalysts, the activity increased linearly with <b>niobia</b> loading regardless of calcination temperature. In contrast, Al 2 O 3 catalysts exhibited an initial increase in activity for MO synthesis with <b>niobia</b> loading followed by a decrease in activity after reaching a maximum activity below 1 / 3 monolayer coverage. The effect was more pronounced for catalysts exhibiting Bronsted acidity. It is proposed that adlineation sites are primarily responsible for catalytic activity in Nb 2 O 5 /-Al 2 O 3 catalysts exhibiting Bronsted acidity. <b>Niobia</b> catalysts were developed using commercially available catalyst carriers as supports. The macrokinetics of MO and MIBK syntheses were investigated in a benchtop fixed bed flow reactor. The catalysts showed excellent activity for MO and MIBK syntheses at 160 °C, typically 0. 9 to 1. 3 [g/hr*gcat]. However, the MIBK selectivity was constrained from 82 to 85 % due to the coproduction of 2 -propanol and diisobutyl ketone. The productivity for MO synthesis was found to be strongly dependent on the space velocity suggesting product inhibition. The intrinsic kinetics of the one-step synthesis of MIBK over a 15. 2 wt% Pd/Nb 2 O 5 /SiO 2 catalyst was investigated in an autoclave reactor. A kinetic model was developed and is reported. The one step synthesis of MIBK was investigated at the pilot plant scale via catalytic distillation (CD). An important finding was that while operating at 100 % reflux, the accumulation of water in the reactive section resulted in the suppression of the DAA dehydration reaction. The in situ removal of water from the reactive section via an overhead distillate stream operating at 83 to 97 % reflux directly resulted in an increase in MIBK productivity and hydrogen uptake efficiency by factors of about 20 yielding a moisture free reboiler product stream with as high as 53 wt% MIBK. The process was found to be controlled by the external mass transfer of hydrogen. Interestingly, the results suggest that the catalyst wetting efficiency affects the transport of hydrogen to the active sites as evidenced by the dependence of MO conversion on the reflux flow rate. The condition of minimum reflux flow rate and maximum hydrogen flow rate resulted in 97 % MO conversion and 90 wt% MIBK selectivity...|$|E

One might argue: {{is there anything}} fundamental to be discovered through the interplay between catalysis and surface science? Real catalysts of monometallic and bimetallic Co/Nb 2 O 5 and Pd-Co/Nb 2 O 5 catalysts showed interesting selectivity results on the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (Noronha et al. 1996, Rosenir et al. 1993). The presence of a noble metal increased the C+ 5 selectivity and decreased the methane formation depending of the reduction temperature. Model catalyst of Co-Pd supported on <b>niobia</b> and alumina were prepared and characterized at the atomic level, thus forming {{the basis for a}} comparison with "real" support materials. Growth, morphology and structure of both pure metal and alloy particles were studied. It is possible to support the strong metal support interaction suggested by studies on real catalysts via the investigation of model systems for <b>niobia</b> in comparison to alumina support in which this effect does not occur. Formation of Co 2 + penetration into the <b>niobia</b> lattice was suggested on the basis of powder studies and can be fully supported on the basis of model studies. It is shown for both real catalysts and model systems that oxidation state of Co {{plays a key role in}} controlling the reactivity in Fischer-Tropsch reactions systems and that the addition of Pd is a determining factor for the stability of the catalyst. It is demonstrated that the interaction with unsaturated hydrocarbons depends strongly on the state of oxidation. As ciências da catálise e da superfície têm desenvolvido independentemente temas básicos para o entendimento de processos catalíticos.

A presença de metal nobre aumentou a seletividade de C+ 5 e diminuiu a formação de metano dependendo da temperatura de redução.

Characterization {{of the structure}} and nature of surface active sites was attempted in order to correlate the CO hydrogenation activity of these systems {{with those of the}} Co/Al 2 O 3 and Co/Nb 2 O 5 catalysts. The effect of the reduction temperature on the CO hydrogenation activity and selectivity was studied, showing that interaction of cobalt and <b>niobia</b> surface species favored the selectivity for hydrocarbon chain growth. However, this effect is less pronounced on the niobia-promoted Co/Al 2 O 3 compared to Co/Nb 2 O 5 catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) results on Co/x%Nb 2 O 5 /Al 2 O 3 showed prevailing amounts of Co 2 + and Co 3 + after calcination and reduction at 573 K, while, after reduction at 773 K, besides metallic cobalt, the Co 2 + species still remains in contact with alumina, even for higher <b>niobia</b> loading. It seems that during this process formation and destruction of new interfaces involving Co 0 -NbOx sites takes place. Results suggest that Co 0, Co 0 -Co 2 +, and Co 0 -NbOx are the active sites at the surface. The relative abundance of Co 2 + species affects greatly the performance of the catalysts. DRIFTS and selectivity results suggest that these sites might be responsible for the reaction chain growth and therefore for the drastic change in the selectivity of CH 4 and C 5 + hydrocarbons mainly on the Co/Nb 2 O 5 catalyst. DRIFTS results on Co/Nb 2 O 5 /Al 2 O 3 showed the formation of -C=C- and -CH 3 - besides CHxO species. With increasing reduction temperature, the -C=C- species disappear while -CH 3 - fragments increased markedly, suggesting the formation of increasing amounts of hydrocarbons with higher chain length...|$|E
40|$|Dimethyl adipate {{was chosen}} to probe the {{behaviour}} of RuSn catalysts supported on different oxides, namely alumina, silica, ceria, <b>niobia</b> and titania on selective hydrogenation. The bimetallic catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation and characterised by Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy.

40|$|Cobalt-niobia {{catalysts}} {{were prepared}} using the colloidal sol-gel technique. Niobium chloride or <b>niobia</b> oxide {{were used as}} precursor. The differences between the procedures used are due to the methods of preparation of the colloidal suspensions and gelification. The catalysts were characterised using adsorption and desorption curves of Kr and N- 2 at 77 K, H- 2 -Chemisorption, XRD, FT-IR, XPS and electron microscopy investigations. Preparation of these catalysts without experimental precautions led to a very inhomogeneous structural and textural material. In contrast, the colloidal sol-gel technique controls both {{the structure of the}} <b>niobia</b> oxide and the tailoring of cobalt. A strong metal support interaction effect (SMSI) was present irrespective of the sample preparation variant. Although the rate of butane hydrogenolysis was low for all catalysts, a correlation between TOF and the catalyst crystallite size was found. Selectivity to methane, ethane, propane or to isomerization also depends on the catalyst crystallite size. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{science of}} {{catalysis}} and surface science have developed, independently, key information for understanding catalytic processes. One might argue: {{is there anything}} fundamental to be discovered through the interplay between catalysis and surface science? Real catalysts of monometallic and bimetallic Co/Nb 2 O 5 and Pd-Co/Nb 2 O 5 catalysts showed interesting selectivity results on the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (Noronha et al. 1996, Rosenir et al. 1993). The presence of a noble metal increased the C+ 5 selectivity and decreased the methane formation depending of the reduction temperature. Model catalyst of Co-Pd supported on <b>niobia</b> and alumina were prepared and characterized at the atomic level, thus forming {{the basis for a}} comparison with "real" support materials. Growth, morphology and structure of both pure metal and alloy particles were studied. It is possible to support the strong metal support interaction suggested by studies on real catalysts via the investigation of model systems for <b>niobia</b> in comparison to alumina support in which this effect does not occur. Formation of Co 2 + penetration into the <b>niobia</b> lattice was suggested on the basis of powder studies and can be fully supported on the basis of model studies. It is shown for both real catalysts and model systems that oxidation state of Co {{plays a key role in}} controlling the reactivity in Fischer-Tropsch reactions systems and that the addition of Pd is a determining factor for the stability of the catalyst. It is demonstrated that the interaction with unsaturated hydrocarbons depends strongly on the state of oxidation...|$|E
