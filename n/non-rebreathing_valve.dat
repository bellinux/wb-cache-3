40|$|In a {{randomized}} double-blind cross-over study on 20 spontaneously breathing, oxygen-dependent preterm infants {{who had received}} positive pressure ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} one-way non-rebreathing valves of aerosol spacer devices might impair rather than enhance the delivery of aerosols to small infants by metered dose inhalers (MDI). Ten infants were given 2 doses (200 mu g/dose) of MDI albuterol through a neonatal Aerochamber(R) 4 h apart. At tandem sequence, one dose was delivered with the <b>non-rebreathing</b> <b>Valve</b> of the Aerochamber(R) place; for the other dose, the valve had been removed. The experiment was repeated on another ten infants using a different spacer device (Babyhaler(R)) with or without its one-way inspiratory valve removed. During the first hour following aerosol administration, use of the non-valved spacers was associated with a significantly greater degree of tachycardia in both groups, and also lower transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension in the Aerochamber(R) group. All infants showed a reduction in respiratory system resistance and an improvement in functional residual capacity following albuterol treatment. In both groups, maximum reduction in respiratory system resistance, recorded 30 min after aerosol delivery, was significantly greater following the use of the non-valved spacers (Aerochamber(R) : 51. 2 +/- 3. 1 % vs. 35. 0 +/- 2. 8 %, P < 0. 0001; Babyhaler(R) 38. 8 +/- 2. 3 % vs. 19. 2 +/- 1. 4 %, P < 0. 0001) than following the use of the spacers with a valve. The findings provide indirect evidence supporting our hypothesis and suggest that when the MDI is used to deliver therapeutic aerosols to non-ventilated newborns or small infants, a spacer device without a <b>non-rebreathing</b> <b>valve</b> should be used.

40|$|Twenty-eight infants were anaesthetized with halothane, {{nitrous oxide}} and oxygen {{and allowed to}} breathe spontaneously through a non-rebreathing system during minor {{paediatric}} surgery. Carbon dioxide output was correlated negatively with body weight for infants greater than 10 kg, but not for children less than 10 kg. Carbon dioxide output was unchanged compared with before surgery. During spontaneous ventilation, anaesthetic diffi-culties in infants usually arise {{as a result of}} inadequate ventilation. High ventilatory frequencies, small tidal volumes and periodical variation of ventilation decrease the margin of safety during anaesthesia. The anaesthetist has to consider large variations in physiological variables because of different metabolic needs of infants of differing body weight (Benedict and Talbot, 1921; Lewis, Duval and Iliff, 1943; Karlberg, 1952). As the carbon dioxide output reflects the metabolic state of the patient, its measurement during anaes-thesia should be valuable. A <b>non-rebreathing</b> <b>valve</b> which avoided the risk of carbon dioxide rebreathing was used to study carbon dioxide output during anaesthesia with spontaneous ventilation in neonates and infants. The aim was to gather more knowledge of carbon dioxide elimination in infants during anaesthesia. Measurements were made before and during surgery. METHODS Twenty-eight children (weight 2. 7 - 21 kg) were investigated. Their characteristics and diagnoses are listed in table I. All children were fasted 4 - 5 h before operation.

40|$|Background: Exhaled breath {{contains}} {{thousands of}} gaseous {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) {{that may be used}} as non-invasive markers of lung disease. The electronic nose analyzes VOCs by composite nano-sensor arrays with learning algorithms. It has been shown that an electronic nose can distinguish the VOCs pattern in exhaled breath of lung cancer patients from healthy controls. We hypothesized that an electronic nose can discriminate patients with lung cancer from COPD patients and healthy controls by analyzing the VOC-profile in exhaled breath. Methods: 30 subjects participated in a cross-sectional study: 10 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, [age 66. 4 +/- 9. 0, FEV 1 86. 3 +/- 20. 7]), 10 patients with COPD (age 61. 4 +/- 5. 5, FEV 1 70. 0 +/- 14. 8) and 10 healthy controls (age 58. 3 +/- 8. 1, FEV 1 108. 9 +/- 14. 6). After 5 min tidal breathing through a <b>non-rebreathing</b> <b>valve</b> with inspiratory VOC-filter, subjects performed a single vital capacity maneuver to collect: dried exhaled air into a Tedlar bag. The bag was connected to the electronic nose (Cyranose 320) within 10 min, with VOC-filtered room air as baseline. The smellprints were analyzed by onboard statistical software. Results: Smellprints from NSCLC patients clustered distinctly from those of COPD subjects (cross validation value [CVV]: 85 %; M-distance: 3. 73). NSCLC patients could also be discriminated from healthy controls in duplicate measurements (CVV: 90 % and 80 %, respectively; M-distance: 2. 96 and 2. 26). Conclusion: VOC-patterns of exhaled breath discriminates patients with lung cancer from COPD patients as well as healthy controls. The electronic nose may qualify as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for lung cancer in the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E

Livanos and Marianthi Simou Laboratories, Thorax Foundation, 3 Department of Pathology, Evangelismos General Hospital, Athens, Greece; 4 Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG Div. Research Germany, Biberach, Germany Introduction: Resistive {{breathing}} (RB), {{a hallmark}} of obstructive airway diseases, is characterized by strenuous contractions of the inspiratory muscles that impose increased mechanical stress on the lung. RB is shown to induce pulmonary inflammation in previous healthy animals. Tiotropium bromide, an anticholinergic bronchodilator, is also shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects. The effect of tiotropium on RB-induced pulmonary inflammation is unknown. Methods: Adult rats were anesthetized, tracheostomized and breathed spontaneously through a two-way <b>non-rebreathing</b> <b>valve.</b> Resistances were connected to the inspiratory and/or expiratory port, to produce inspiratory resistive breathing (IRB) of 40 % or 50 % Pi/Pi,max (40 % and 50 % IRB), expiratory resistive breathing (ERB) of 60 % Pe/Pe,max (60 % ERB) or combined resistive breathing (CRB) of both 40 % Pi/Pi,max and 60 % Pe/Pe,max (40 %/ 60 % CRB). Tiotropium aerosol was inhaled prior to RB. After 6  h of RB, mechanical parameters of the respiratory system were measured and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. IL- 1 β and IL- 6 protein levels were measured in lung tissue. Lung injury was estimated histologically. Results: In all, 40 % and 50 % IRB increased macrophage and neutrophil counts in BAL and raised IL- 1 β and IL- 6 lung levels, tissue elasticity, BAL total protein levels and lung injury score. Tiotropium attenuated BAL neutrophil number, IL- 1 β, IL- 6 levels and lung injury score increase at both 40 % and 50 % IRB. The increase in macrophage count and protein in BAL was only reversed at 40 % IRB, while tissue elasticity was not affected. In all, 60 % ERB raised BAL neutrophil count and total protein and reduced macrophage count. IL- 1 β and IL- 6 levels and lung injury score were increased. Tiotropium attenuated these alterations, except for the decrease in macrophage count {{and the increase in}} total protein level. In all, 40 %/ 60 % CRB increased macrophage and neutrophil count in BAL, IL- 1 β and IL- 6 levels, tissue elasticity, total protein in BAL and histological injury score. Tiotropium attenuated the aforementioned alterations. Conclusion: Tiotropium inhalation attenuates RB-induced pulmonary inflammation.

40|$|S. Anderson, M. Chamberlain, S. Musgrove, A. Partusch, K. Tice and D. B. Thorp, PhD Gonzaga University, Spokane, WA The {{mammalian}} dive response (DR) elicited by facial submersion {{in water}} {{is characterized by}} a decreased heart rate (HR) and an elevated blood pressure (BP). The DR is said to be an oxygen-conserving mechanism based primarily on the bradycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction and decreased ventilation (VE) that occurs. Immediately upon facial submersion in cold water a transient period of tachycardia and increased VE, termed the cold shock response (CSR), is observed prior to the changes characteristic of the DR. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the DR in humans is an oxygen-conserving mechanism by quantifying oxygen consumption (VO 2) during facial submersion in different water temperatures. METHODS: Ten male and nine female participants (21 ± 0. 7 yr) performed four non-apnoeic, 2 min facial submersions to the temples with 8 min of rest prior to each facial submersion. Two facial submersions were performed in 5 °C water and two in 25 °C water; the order of which were randomized between subjects. HR was collected throughout using chest strap HR monitors. A tube was connected to the inspired port of a watertight <b>non-rebreathing</b> <b>valve</b> and extended above the surface of the water allowing participants to breathe during facial submersion. Expired air was directed to a metabolic cart to determine VO 2 and VE. Baseline (BL) values for HR, VO 2 and VE were taken as the average during the two minutes prior to facial submersion, CSR values were taken as the maximum for each variable during the first 30 seconds of facial submersion, and DR values were taken as the minimum during the last 90 seconds of facial submersion. These were averaged between the 5 °C and 25 °C trials to obtain one BL, CSR and DR value for each water temperature. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare BL, CSR, and DR for each variable between temperatures. RESULTS: Both HR and VE were greater during the CSR (92. 5 ± 3. 6 bpm, 16. 3 ± 0. 8 L/min, respectively) compared to BL (78. 9 ± 3. 2 bpm, 8. 7 ± 0. 4 L/min), while both were decreased from BL during the DR (60. 0 ± 4. 0 bpm, and 6. 0 ± 0. 4 L/min) (main effect of facial submersion, all p 3 ̆c 0. 05). The combined effect of facial submersion and cold water augmented the HR response, such that HRCSR was higher and HRDR was lower in the 5 °C condition (interaction effect, p 3 ̆c 0. 05). There was a main effect of water temperature such that VE was greater in the 5 °C condition (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Like HR and VE, the effect of facial submersion was such that VO 2 exceeded BL during the CSR and decreased below BL during the DR (BL: 5. 3 ± 0. 1, CSR: 9. 8 ± 0. 4, DR: 3. 1 ± 0. 2 mL/kg/min, p 3 ̆c 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The VO 2 data illustrate that the DR is an oxygen-conserving mechanism in humans, regardless of water temperature...|$|E
