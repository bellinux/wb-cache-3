40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 57 - 58) Gold-Nickel braze alloy is not {{compatible with}} nitrogen tetroxide, N 2 O 4. This incompatibility manifests itself by dealloying the nickel {{resulting in a}} gold sponge {{and the formation of}} <b>nickel</b> <b>nitrates,</b> Ni(N 03) 2. The miscibility gap on the gold-nickel phase diagram means that any alloy composition between 8 and 98 atomic percent nickel when slowly cooled will form a two phase alloy system. Rapid cooling or quenching from a temperature above the miscibility gap for any alloy composition will form a supersaturated single phase alloy. The thermodynamics of the gold-nickel system predicts a two phase alloy because the free-energy of gold-gold, and nickel-nickel bonds are lower than the gold-nickel bond when the system is slowly cooled. When the system is rapidly cooled the nucleation and growth of the two phase alloy is retarded and a single phase alloy is formed. A corrosion test was conducted using the gold-nickel braze alloy cooled at different rates which formed both a single phase alloy, and a two phase alloy. The corrosion weight loss in N 2 o 4 of the single phase alloy was 0. 17...|$|R
