40|$|This {{study was}} done to {{investigate}} the pre-settlement condition of the southern Des Moines Lobe landscape, with particular interest in the hydrological function of depressional wetlands. Soil survey maps were used to identify the soil formation environment from soil properties observed today. Understanding the factors of soil formation and geomorphology allows historical reconstructions of the landscape, hydrology, wildlife habitat, and potentially other areas of interest. This study interpreted and managed soil survey data to efficiently create a Quaternary geologic map, identify the extents of historical depressional wetlands, deduce information about the water budget of these wetlands, and estimate the region 2 ̆ 7 s <b>non-contributing</b> <b>area.</b> The Quaternary geologic map produced from the categorized soil map units added resolution and qualitatively showed close agreement with currently available Quaternary geologic maps. Comparison of depressional wetland soil extents with mapped existing wetlands in the National Wetland Inventory showed that 98. 5...|$|E
40|$|We analyse {{effects of}} species-interaction and spatiotemporal host {{distribution}} on persistence of Maculinea populations at isolated habitat sites. Maculinea butterflies are parasites of Myrmica ants. The butterfly caterpillars infest host ant {{nest in the}} vicinity of their initial oviposition plant. Thus, spatial distribution of initial host plants (oviposition plants), implies a spatial distribution of parasitism. We develop a generic spatially-explicit rule-based simulation model for a Maculinea systems, to analyse the influence of different spatially relevant parameters on the performance of a Maculinea population. Parameter variation considers spatial host plant distribution, initial spatial host ant distribution and budding-range, which defines the probability distribution of colonising distances of ants. In simulation runs, {{it can be seen that}} the spatial distribution of host ants adapts to the spatially distributed parasitism from Maculinea caterpillars. Areas without host plants (unexploited areas) are completely inhabited by host ants. In areas with host plants (exploited areas) mean density of host ants is lower. Ant nests show dynamics. They are abandoned or nest sites are recolonised. Because of spatial segregation of exploitable and non-exploitable areas and by small scale dispersal of host ants (budding), areas of different effectiveness for Maculinea population performance can be distinguished on a Maculinea habitat site: These are reproductive area, buffer, sink and <b>non-contributing</b> <b>area.</b> Consequently, number of host plants is not the only decisive factor for performance of a Maculinea population. As well it is important how well empty nest sites {{in the vicinity of}} host plants can be colonised by host ants. We find two different mechanisms, which limit re-growth of the Maculinea butterfly population and lead to different types of dynamics. Population viability analysis (PVA) is a standard method for single species systems. However, the Maculinea system consists of interacting species with more complex dynamics. There is still no standardised methodology for PVA of multi-species systems. We derive a phenomenological description of distributions of extinction times for populations in a large class of systems of interacting species. We find in analytical calculations that the long term behaviour of distributions of times to extinction in multi-species systems can be analysed with the ln(1 -P_{ 0 }) -method suggested for single species systems. Thus, this method can be transferred. Comparing distributions of times to extinction of single and interacting species, we find that long term extinction of established populations follows a similar process. However, on short time-scales, population cycles modulate extinction risk. In systems of interacting species, an initial transient phase can have strong influence on persistence of the population. In simulations of the Macu model, we observe that it takes up to 50 generations until the system reaches its established state. This can lead to a bottleneck of the population. We develop a landscape analysis method for multi-species systems. For that purpose, suitability of different landscapes is assessed for their ability to sustain particular populations. Suitability is measured by population persistence. Therefore, dynamics of the system and requirements of the populations are taken into account when assessing suitability. This method is applied to assess effects of the influence of different spatially relevant parameters. No major effects of initial host ant distribution on persistence of Maculinea populations can be found. In contrast, spatial distribution of host plants has a main effect. Thus, the host plant distribution can be considered as landscape structure of the Maculinea system on the site. Rules of thumb for suitable structures of host plant distributions and a spatial index are given. In general heterogeneous host plant distributions of intermediate density are a good option...|$|E
5000|$|Even within exorheic basins, {{there can}} be [...] "non-{{contributing}}", low-lying areas that trap runoff and prevent it from contributing to flows downstream during years of average or below-average runoff. In flat river basins, <b>non-contributing</b> <b>areas</b> can be a large fraction of the river basin, e.g. Lake Winnipeg's basin. A lake may be endorheic during dry years and can overflow its basin during wet years, e.g., the former Tulare Lake.|$|R
40|$|Study region: Prairie Pothole Region of North America. Study focus: The Prairie Pothole Region of North America has {{experienced}} extensive wetland drainage, potentially impacting peak flows and annual flow volumes. Some of this drainage {{has occurred in}} closed basins, possibly impacting lake water levels of these systems. In this study we investigated {{the potential impact of}} wetland drainage on peak flows and annual volumes in a 2242 Â km 2 watershed located in southeastern Saskatchewan (Canada) using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. New hydrological insights: The SWAT model, which had been calibrated and validated at daily and monthly time steps for the 1997 â 2009 period, was used {{to assess the impact of}} wetland drainage using three hypothetical scenarios that drained 15, 30, and 50 % of the <b>non-contributing</b> drainage <b>area.</b> Results of these simulations suggested that drainage increased spring peak flows by about 50, 79 and 113 %, respectively while annual flow volumes increased by about 43, 68, and 98 % in each scenario. Years that were wetter than normal presented increased peak flows and annual flow volumes below the average of the simulated period. Alternatively, summer peak flows presented smaller increases in terms of percentages during the simulated period.
