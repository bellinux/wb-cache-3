5|$|In {{the south}} range, {{parts of the}} medieval {{buildings}} survive and are incorporated into staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, {{can be seen to}} have been built <b>neatly</b> <b>on</b> top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded <b>neatly</b> <b>on</b> a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
25|$|Some {{companies}} {{included a}} complimentary blank cassette with their portable cassette recorders {{in the early}} 1980s. Panasonic's was a C14 and came with a song recorded on side one, and a blank side two. Except for C74 and C100, such non-standard lengths always {{have been hard to}} find, and tend to be more expensive than the more popular lengths. Home taping enthusiasts may have found certain lengths useful for fitting an album <b>neatly</b> <b>on</b> one or both sides of a tape. For instance, the initial maximum playback time of Compact Discs was 74 minutes, explaining the relative popularity of C74 cassettes.|$|E

50|$|The {{breeding}} season is from February to September, mainly during the monsoon. The nest is a rough cup of moss <b>neatly</b> lined <b>on</b> {{the inside and}} placed low on a moss covered rock, hole in tree or mud-bank. The usual clutch is four eggs which are pale sea-green with brown spotting, denser on the broad end.|$|R
25|$|Last week, Frank Hawks {{shuttled}} to East Aurora, N. Y. to {{show off}} his polliwog to a prospect, Sportsman J. Hazard Campbell. He landed <b>neatly</b> <b>on</b> the polo field in a nearby estate at about 5 p.m., climbed out, chatted awhile with Prospect Campbell and a cluster of friends. Presently he and Campbell took off smartly, cleared a fence, went atilt between two tall trees, and passed from sight. Then there was a rending crash, a smear of flame, silence. Half a mile the fearful group raced from the polo field. From the crackling wreck they pulled Frank Hawks; from beneath a burning wing, Prospect Campbell — both fatally hurt. The ship that could not stub its toe aground had tripped on overhead telephone wires.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} ago there were many {{children}} and men who turned out immediately after a snow-fall, and were daily to be met during the thaw, brushing the crossings as clean as they could. For this small service many foot passengers gladly gave a few small coins, regarding the sweepers not as beggars or vagrants, but as laborers, whose hard and disagreeable work enabled well-shod people to pass <b>neatly</b> <b>on</b> their way. There has, however, been a prohibition of street sweepers...The result is that on Wednesday last...there was not one crossing on which they snow and mud did not come full two inches above the sole of a thick gaiter, and it was entirely impossible to find a single crossing {{to the opposite side}} of the avenue which could be trod without sinking to the ankle...let us have the volunteer sweepers back for the comfort of a LADY PEDESTRIAN.|$|E
25|$|The PRR had {{a design}} style that it favored in its locomotives. One example was the square-shouldered Belpaire firebox. This British-style firebox was a PRR {{trademark}} that was rarely used by other locomotive builders in the U. S. PRR also used track pans extensively to retrieve {{water for the}} locomotive while in motion. Using this system meant that the tenders of their locomotives had a comparatively large proportion of coal (which could not be taken on board while running) compared to water capacity. Locomotives of the PRR had a clean look to them. Only necessary devices were used and they were mounted <b>neatly</b> <b>on</b> the locomotive. Smoke box fronts bore a round locomotive number board denoting a freight locomotive or a keystone number board denoting a passenger locomotive. Otherwise the smoke box was uncluttered except for a headlamp {{at the top and}} a steam-driven turbo-generator behind it. In later years the positions of the two were reversed, since the generator needs more maintenance than the lamp.|$|E

500|$|The {{autograph}} {{score is}} written <b>neatly</b> <b>on</b> non-Leipzig paper, probably while Bach {{still lived in}} Köthen. A Leipzig chronicle, [...] "", reported the social event: [...] "" [...] (...performed... with good applause his first music). [...] "Good applause" [...] means [...] "great approval" [...] rather than clapping of hands.

500|$|... "Devil Pray" [...] {{received}} mostly {{positive response}} from music critics. While {{noting that the}} song [...] "reaches back smartly, {{not only to the}} hoe-down pop of [...] 'Don't Tell Me', but to the subject matter, and bluesy gait of 'The House of the Rising Sun'," [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News praised [...] "he addition of a pulsing house beat [...] gives it yet another lure." [...] Bernard Zuel of Sydney Morning Herald also found similarities in [...] "Devil Pray" [...] with both songs, defining it as an [...] "acoustic guitar-with-electro-cowboy" [...] song, whose melody [...] "doesn't attempt to hide its familiarity with 'House of the Rising Sun'." [...] The Huffington Post Matthew Jacobs pointed out that Madonna evoked [...] "the more traditional dance palate for which she is known." [...] Jamieson Cox of Time enthusiastically wrote that the song [...] "could fit in <b>neatly</b> <b>on</b> the radio beside this year's British house-pop crossovers and Avicii's own 'Hey Brother'." [...] Kathy Iandoli of Idolator praised Avicii and Blood Diamonds for [...] "becom a divine pair for [...] where you can hear both of their styles woven into the beat." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent found that [...] "Devil Pray" [...] recalled [...] "the career-apex achievements of 'Like a Prayer', while Gavin Haynes of NME opined that the song is [...] "reminiscent of Lady Gaga's crazed 2013 dance tune 'Aura'." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{expedition}} provided clear {{photographs of}} the wrecks that confirmed their identities, collecting more than 1,500 photographs and 23 hours of video overall. These were the first pictures taken of the Scourge. The ships had sunk to the bottom, still upright, about 1500 ft apart and {{at a depth of}} around 300 ft of icy water. The wrecks were well-preserved, with masts and topmasts intact and cannonballs still <b>neatly</b> stacked <b>on</b> the decks.|$|R

60|$|The little dory was specklessly clean. In her bows lay a tiny anchor, two jugs of water, {{and some}} seventy fathoms of thin, brown dory-roding. A tin dinner-horn rested in cleats just under Harvey's right hand, beside an ugly-looking maul, a short gaff, and a shorter wooden stick. A couple of lines, with very heavy leads and double cod-hooks, all <b>neatly</b> coiled <b>on</b> square reels, {{were stuck in}} their place by the gunwale.|$|R
