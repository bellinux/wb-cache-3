5|$|The main {{legacy of}} the SSR Abkhazia is that it created, {{for the first time}} in modern history, a defined {{geographic}} entity under the name Abkhazia. The Abkhaz people were cognizant of their republic and its quasi-independent status, and though it was removed in 1931 they did <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> it had existed. The SSR Abkhazia would take a prominent role during the glasnost and perestroika era of the late 1980s, as Abkhaz leaders called for their state to once again be formed and break away from Georgia, citing the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent. This led to them restoring the 1925 SSR Abkhazian constitution, which ultimately led to the 1992–1993 war between Abkhazia and Georgia, and the modern Abkhaz–Georgian conflict.|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} in modern society, control-related and {{prescriptive}} technologies are dominant. [...] "When work is organized as {{a sequence of}} separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager," [...] she writes. [...] "In political terms, prescriptive technologies are designs for compliance." [...] For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also {{come to believe that}} there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. [...] "While we should <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept {{that there is only one}} way of doing 'it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|As an {{extension}} of his ideas on industriousness, Carp also advised Romanians to reject the PNL's economic antisemitism, insisting that the solution to all real economic problems was the capitalist work ethic. He witnessed with concern how antisemitism damaged Western attitudes about Romania. In the early 1870s, when Bismarck implied that Romania's Jews risked being stoned by their Christian neighbors, he replied (probably tongue-in-cheek): [...] "Your Excellency should <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> the Romanian has barely emerged out of the Stone Age." [...] His unpopular ideas on the Jewish issue only had one prominent Romanian disciple, the Junimist philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, who used them in denouncing the antisemitic Democratic Nationalist Party.|$|E

And such mastery means total freedom of choice in its use: not being a slave to one's abilities, but rather, being able to use them at will {{as a means to}} an end."

2500|$|Maria Feodorovna {{was pretty}} and popular. [...] Early on {{she made it}} a {{priority}} to learn the Russian language {{and to try to}} understand the Russian people. She rarely interfered with politics, preferring to devote her time and energies to her family, charities and the more social side of her position. Her one exception was her militant anti-German sentiment due to the annexation of Danish territories by Prussia in 1864, a sentiment echoed by her sister, Alexandra. Prince Gorchakov remarked about this policy: “it is our belief, that Germany will <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> both in Russia and in England a Danish Princess has her foot {{on the steps of the}} throne.” [...] Maria Feodorovna suffered a miscarriage in 1866 in Denmark while horseriding.|$|E

2500|$|The Austrian field marshal's {{anxiousness}} is best {{explained by}} {{a letter he}} received from Emperor Francis I of Austria on 29 January. Francis wrote, [...] "We must <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> the enemy can, from the South of France, move against our left, where the allies have few men, {{and that it is}} very necessary to hold strongly the road [...] which, in case of a check, would serve for retreat". Napoleon wanted Augereau to advance toward Chalon-sur-Saône to carry out the threat that Francis feared. On 21 February, Napoleon sent Augereau a letter urging the marshal to, [...] "pull on his boots of 1793". The emperor wrote, [...] "Count Bubna has no more than 10,000 miserable troops with which to oppose you, which will disappear like a fog before the sun".|$|E
2500|$|Joe Kennedy, vice {{president}} of marketing for GM marque Saturn, accepted concerns regarding the EV1's cost, the outdated lead-acid battery technology, and the car's limited range, saying [...] "Let us <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> technology starts small and grows slowly before technology improves and costs go down." [...] Some anti-taxation groups were against the exemptions and tax credits that EV1 lessees received, which they said constituted government-subsidized motoring for affluent professionals. Some of these groups, such as consumer organization Californians Against Utility Company Abuse (which mounted opposition to the use of taxpayer dollars to build public EV charging stations), were themselves accused of receiving their funding from oil companies interested in keeping gasoline cars on the roads. Concerns were also raised that the car had received only a limited launch, because GM had made a deal with CARB to delay the implementation of the first phase of the ZEV program, which had been scheduled to go into effect in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Semyon Vengerov {{quoted a}} source who knew Pisemsky closely as having called Yekaterina Pavlovna [...] "a perfect {{literary}} wife who took {{very close to}} her heart all the literary anxieties and troubles of her husband, all the jigsaws of his creative career, cherishing his talent and doing whatever was possible {{to keep him in}} conditions favourable to the development of his talent. Add to all this a rare leniency, of which she had to have a great deal of, to put up with Aleksey, who occasionally demonstrated qualities not congenial with being a family man." [...] Ivan Turgenev, in one of his letters, imploring Pisemsky {{to get rid of this}} spleen of his, wrote: [...] "I think I've told you this once, but I might as well repeat it.

2500|$|Although {{women did}} not have {{political}} power in Nazi Germany, a circle of influence did exist around Adolf Hitler. Within this circle, Hitler became acquainted with the British Unity Mitford and Magda Goebbels, wife of the Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. Magda Goebbels became known by the nickname [...] "First Lady of the Third Reich": she represented the regime during State visits and official events. Her marriage to Goebbels on December 19, 1931 was considered a society event, where Leni Riefenstahl was a notable guest. She posed as the model German mother for Mothers Day. Eleonore Baur, a friend of Hitler since 1920 (she {{had participated in the}} Beer Hall putsch) was the only woman to receive the Blood Order; she also participated in official receptions and was close to Heinrich Himmler, who even named her a colonel of the SS and permitted her free access to the concentration camps, which she went to regularly, particularly Dachau. Hitler did <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> he owed part of his political ascension to women integrated in the society world (aristocrats or industrialists), such as Elsa Bruckmann.|$|E
2500|$|... "The main {{aim of this}} (training) is to dignify {{the work}} of {{domestic}} staff {{in such a way}} that they can do their work with a scientific approach. I say 'with a scientific approach' because housework should be carried out as a true profession. We must <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> there are people who have wanted to present this work as something humiliating, but it is not. No doubt, the conditions under which this work used to be done were humiliating and sometimes they still are, even today, when domestic staff are subjected in their work to the whim of an arbitrary employer who does not guarantee their rights, and who gives them low wages and no affection... Any job that is well done is a wonderful service to society, and this is as true of domestic work as it is of the work of a professor or judge. The only work that is not a service is that of a person who works for his own self-interest...I understand that work in the home is especially important because through it so much good or harm can be done to families." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{these writers}} were {{refining}} an art that elevated Pierrot to criminal heights, others were imagining a pantomime animated by {{a much more}} conventional Pierrot. [...] The Petit Trait de pantomime [...] l'usage des gens du monde (1887), by the mime and scenarist Raoul de Najac, championed the pantomime as a recreation for the salonsand reminded its readers that, in devising such an entertainment, [...] "One must ... <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> one is in good company." [...] Najac's ideal Pierrot, consequently, is innocent of all [...] "indecent or funereal ideas," [...] like those that motivate Pierrot sceptique. [...] Such also had been the pure-hearted Pierrot of Legrand, a collection of whose pantomimes was publishedin {{the same year as}} Najac's treatiseby two fraternal men of the theater, Eugène and Félix Larcher. [...] In undertaking their collaboration, the Larchers discovered talents and ambitions in themselves, vis-à-vis the pantomime, that neither knew he possessed. [...] Eugène, in incarnating the Pierrot of one of Legrand's pantomimes, Le Papillon (The Butterfly), found that he was a more-than-competent mime, and Félix was inspired by his brother's performance to conceive the Cercle Funambulesque.|$|E
