5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for <b>negative</b> <b>selection</b> of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and <b>negative</b> <b>selection</b> of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or <b>negative</b> <b>selection</b> acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
25|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>selection</b> {{can occur}} at the double {{positive}} stage in the cortex. However the repertoire of peptides in the cortex is limited to those expressed by epithelial cells, and double positive cells are poor at undergoing <b>negative</b> <b>selection.</b> Therefore, the most important site for <b>negative</b> <b>selection</b> is the medulla, once cells are at the single positive stage. In order to remove thymocytes reactive to peripheral organs, the transcription factors Aire and Fezf2 drive the expression of multiple peripheral antigens, such as insulin, resulting in deletion of cells specific for those antigens. This allows single positive thymocytes {{to be exposed to}} a more complex set of self-antigens than is present in the cortex, and therefore more efficiently deletes those T cells which are autoreactive.|$|E

40|$|Held in {{conjunction}} with the 16 th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Copyright © 2002 IEEE – All Rights ReservedThe persistence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection may be in part attributed to its ability to evolve to evade neutralizing antibody (NAb) surveillance. We have tested the prediction that positive selection of V 3 is positively correlated with the strength of a patient’s NAb response by analyzing a data set containing both sequences from the principal neutralizing domain of HIV- 1 (V 3) and measures of the strength of the NAb responses of several patients. Only viral sequences from the patient with the strongest NAb response exhibited evidence of significant positive selection. To investigate the nature of selection by NAbs, we simulated the evolution of V 3 at the nucleotide level. Two forms of plausible NAb <b>selection</b> were used: <b>negative</b> frequency-dependent <b>selection</b> and <b>negative</b> viral-age-dependent <b>selection.</b> Assuming <b>negative</b> age-dependent <b>selection</b> rather than <b>negative</b> frequency-dependent <b>selection</b> better simulated the temporal pattern of V 3 variation from the patient with the strongest NAb response.

25|$|The key {{disadvantage}} in a gene rearrangement process for T cell receptors {{is that by}} random chance, some arrangements of gene fragments will create a T cell receptor capable of binding self-peptides presented on MHC class I or MHC class II. If T cells bearing these T cell receptors were to enter the periphery, they {{would be capable of}} activating an immune response against self, resulting in autoimmunity. <b>Negative</b> <b>selection</b> is the process evolved to reduce this risk. During <b>negative</b> <b>selection,</b> all thymocytes with a high affinity for binding self peptides presented on MHC class I or class II are induced to upregulate BCL2L11, a protein which drives apoptosis. Cells which do not have a high affinity for self-antigens survive <b>negative</b> <b>selection.</b> At this stage, some cells are also selected to become regulatory T cells, usually cells which have an intermediate affinity for self-peptide.|$|E

Its <b>negative</b> <b>selection</b> method relies on strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) to enrich for peptides representing N- and C-termini of proteins based on differences in peptide charge and pH. Additional orthogonal chromatography treatments change the biochemical character of the peptides for further enrichment before final LC-MS/MS analysis. Groups have continued to adapt and improve this technology for protease-substrate discovery.|$|E
25|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>selection</b> is not 100% effective, some autoreactive T cells escape thymic censorship, and are {{released}} into the circulation.

50|$|Alternative {{behaviors}} will {{be maintained}} through frequency-dependent selection {{because of their}} equal fitness benefits and functional equivalence.

25|$|About 98% of thymocytes die {{during the}} {{development}} processes in the thymus by failing either positive selection or <b>negative</b> <b>selection,</b> whereas the other 2% survive and leave the thymus to become mature immunocompetent T cells.

It has also been shown that Neanderthal ancestry has been selected against in conserved biological pathways, such as RNA processing.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there is}} only a limited {{repertoire}} of antigen that B cells can encounter within the thymus. B cell tolerance then must occur within the periphery after the induction of B cell tolerance within the thymus as a more diverse group of antigens can be encountered in peripheral tissues. This same positive and <b>negative</b> <b>selection</b> mechanism, but in peripheral tissues, is known as clonal anergy. The mechanism of clonal anergy is important to maintain tolerance to many autologous antigens. Active suppression is the other known mechanism of T cell tolerance. Active suppression involves the injection of large amounts of foreign antigen {{in the absence of an}} adjuvant which leads to a state of unresponsiveness. This unresponsive state is then transferred to a naïve recipient from the injected donor to induce a state of tolerance within the recipient.|$|E
25|$|TAILS, or “N-Terminomics,” was {{designed}} and developed by the Overall Lab to overcome the functional limitations of conventional proteomics by enriching both mature N-terminal peptides and newly generated N-terminal peptides of proteins produced by protease activity. Formaldehyde or isobaric tags including Isotope-coded Affinity Tags (ICAT), 4 to 8 plex Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), or 10plex Tandem mass tags (TMT) block primary amines prior to trypsin digestion of proteome samples.

Such an approach, called v-tables or Naive tables, is computationally less expensive that the c-tables discussed above. However it is still not a complete solution for incomplete information in the sense that v-tables are only a weak representation for queries not using any negations in selection (and not using any set difference either). The first example considered in this section is using a <b>negative</b> <b>selection</b> clause, WHERE Age <> 22, so it is also an example where v-tables queries would not report sure information.|$|E
