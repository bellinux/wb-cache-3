Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain signal level called the <b>noise</b> <b>threshold,</b> but above {{a higher level}} – the full improvement or full quieting threshold – the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5-15dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.|$|E

The 2004 GTO exhaust was a true dual system that followed the original Monaro exhaust routing, thus both tailpipes exited on the driver side of the vehicle.

40|$|Abstract — A message-passing decoder for GF (q) low-density parity-check codes is defined, {{which uses}} {{discrete}} messages from {{a subset of}} all possible binary vectors of length q. The proposed algorithm is a generalization to GF (q) of Richardson and Urbanke’s decoding “Algorithm E ” for binary codes. Density evolution requires a mapping between the probability distribution spaces for the channel, variable and check messages, and under the proposed algorithm, exact density evolution is possible. Symmetries in the message densities permit reduction {{in the size of}} the probability distribution space. <b>Noise</b> <b>thresholds</b> are obtained for LDPC codes on discrete memoryless channels, and as with Algorithm E, are remarkably close to <b>noise</b> <b>thresholds</b> under more complex belief propagation decoding.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{sufficiency}} {{condition for the}} presence of multipartite entanglement in thermal states stemming from the ground state entanglement. The condition is written in terms of the ground state entanglement and the partition function and it gives transition temperatures below which entanglement is guaranteed to survive. It is flexible and can be easily adapted to consider entanglement for different splittings, as well as be weakened to allow easier calculations by approximations. Examples where the condition is calculated are given. These examples allow us to characterize a minimum gapping behavior for the survival of entanglement in the thermodynamic limit. Further, the same technique can be used to find <b>noise</b> <b>thresholds</b> in the generation of useful resource states for one-way quantum computing. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures.

5000|$|As {{pointed out}} by Torr et al. , RANSAC can be {{sensitive}} to the choice of the correct <b>noise</b> <b>threshold</b> that defines which data points fit a model instantiated with a certain set of parameters. If such threshold is too large, then all the hypotheses tend to be ranked equally (good). On the other hand, when the <b>noise</b> <b>threshold</b> is too small, the estimated parameters tend to be unstable ( [...] i.e. by simply adding or removing a datum to the set of inliers, the estimate of the parameters may fluctuate). To partially compensate for this undesirable effect, Torr et al. proposed two modification of RANSAC called MSAC (M-estimator SAmple and Consensus) and MLESAC (Maximum Likelihood Estimation SAmple and Consensus). The main idea is to evaluate the quality of the consensus set ( [...] i.e. the data that fit a model and a certain set of parameters) calculating its likelihood (whereas in the original formulation by Fischler and Bolles the rank was the cardinality of such set). An extension to MLESAC which takes into account the prior probabilities associated to the input dataset is proposed by Tordoff. [...] The resulting algorithm is dubbed Guided-MLESAC. Along similar lines, Chum proposed to guide the sampling procedure if some a priori information regarding the input data is known, i.e. whether a datum is likely to be an inlier or an outlier. The proposed approach is called PROSAC, PROgressive SAmple Consensus.|$|E
