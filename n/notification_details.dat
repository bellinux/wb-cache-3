40|$|The CORBA Notification Service allows objects {{developed}} {{under this}} platform to communicate asynchronously. Nevertheless, {{the use of}} this service at implementation level implies a strong coupling between service and objects which use it. This coupling is due to the mixing of code. This mixing of code appears when we deal with two different aspects in the same object: event asynchronous communication and core functionality of the object. The use of aspect-oriented techniques let us avoid this problem whereas the extraction of this tangled and scattered code. In this paper, we propose the definition of an UML profile for dealing with the Event Notification Aspect in Corba distributed environments. This profile simplifies the application of this asynchronous communication. So we will have the event <b>notification</b> <b>details</b> perfectly separated from the basic functionality of the object details at design level. Finally, {{the use of this}} profile facilitates the generation of code regarding to the notification aspect. This code will be subsequently integrated with the objects which take part of the communication...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{epidemiology}} {{and management of}} nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection in Australian children is unknown. Methods: From July 2004 to June 2007, clinicians identified children with NTM infection {{as part of a}} nationwide active surveillance network. Following <b>notification,</b> <b>detailed</b> data were collected. Results: From 192 reports, data were received on 153 cases (response rate: 79. 7 %). Of these, 102 met inclusion criteria. The median age was 2. 9 years. Predisposing conditions were infrequent and included chronic respiratory disease (n = 12) and immunosuppression (n = 6). Lymphadenitis was the most frequent presentation (n = 68) with pulmonary and disseminated disease infrequent (n = 14 and 3, respectively), NTM was isolated in 68 cases with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex most frequently isolated (33 / 68; 48. 5 %). Surgery was performed in 78 cases and 42 children were treated with antimycobacterial therapy. Twenty-five subjects received surgery and antimycobacterial therapy. Follow-up data were available for 77 children with recurrence observed in 18 cases. Complete excision was associated with a higher rate of treatment success when compared with all other therapies (OR: 9. 48 [95 % CI: 2. 00 - 44. 97], P = 0. 001). Mycobacterium lentiflavum infection accounted for 4. 4 % of culture confirmed cases and had a lower rate of treatment success than other species (0 % vs. 78. 2 %; P = 0. 016). Conclusions: The incidence of NTM infection in Australian children is 0. 84 of 100, 000 (95 % CI: 0. 68 - 1. 02). Infection occurs most often in young children without predisposing conditions. Despite therapy, there was recurrence in 23. 4 % of cases...|$|R

In the case of the index case not being available at home, proxy interviews are conducted. After interviewing, details of contacts (including household contacts, friends, colleagues, class fellows etc.) are recorded on a specific form. All the listed contacts are asked (either face to face or by telephone) to visit the Respiratory Clinic at PGH for screening for active or latent TB. After finishing the interview, one copy of the finalized list of contacts is given to the responsible staff at the Respiratory Clinic of PGH. Once the contact arrives at the Respiratory Clinic, DOTS staff responsible for contact tracing performs a TST. The contact is advised to re-visit the DOTS center between the next 48 – 72 [*]h (i.e. on the third day). At the same time, the contact is advised to undergo a radiological examination (chest X-ray) at the Radiology Department of PGH. Developed X-ray film is dispatched to the Respiratory Department. A medical doctor at the Respiratory Department examines the chest X-ray and informs the staff nurse at the DOTS clinic, whether or not the X-ray findings are indicative of possible TB. In these cases, the contact is further investigated using TB-specific laboratory tests.|$|R

Tensions emanate from conflicting approaches to the implementation of information privacy law that results in different regimes and the implementation of different types of protections. Shared weaknesses arise from an overt focus on specified types of personal information which results in ‘one size fits all’ legal remedies.

The study objective was to explore the knowledge, opinion and barriers regarding TB Notification among private practitioners offering TB services in Alappuzha, Kerala state, India. This was a mixed-methods study with quantitative (survey) and qualitative components conducted between December 2013 and July 2014. The survey, using a structured questionnaire, among 169 private practitioners revealed that 88 % were aware of mandatory <b>notification.</b> All patient-related <b>details</b> requested in the notification form (except government-issued identification number) were perceived to be important and easy to provide by more than 80 % of practitioners. While more than 95 % felt that notification should be mandatory, punitive action in case of failure to notify was considered unnecessary by almost two third. General practitioners (98 %) {{were more likely to}} be aware of notification than specialists (84 %). (P< 0. 01). Qualitative purposive personal interviews (n= 34) were carried out among private practitioners and public health providers. On thematic framework analysis of the responses, barriers to TB notification were grouped into three themes: 'private provider misconceptions about notification', 'patient confidentiality, and stigma and discrimination 'and 'lack of cohesion and coordination between public and private sector'. Private practitioners did not consider it necessary to notify TB cases treated with daily regimen.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{contrast}} to seasonal influenza epidemics, {{where the majority}} of deaths occur amongst elderly, a considerable part of the 2009 pandemic influenza related deaths concerned relatively young people. In the Netherlands, all deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection had to be notified, both during the 2009 - 2010 pandemic season and the 2010 - 2011 influenza season. To assess whether and to what extent pandemic mortality patterns were reverting back to seasonal patterns, a retrospective analyses of all notified fatal cases associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection was performed. Methods The <b>notification</b> database, including <b>detailed</b> information about the clinical characteristics of all notified deaths, was used to perform a comprehensive analysis of all deceased patients with a laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection. Characteristics of the fatalities with respect to age and underlying medical conditions were analysed, comparing the 2009 - 2010 pandemic and the 2010 - 2011 influenza season. Results A total of 65 fatalities with a laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus infection were notified in 2009 - 2010 and 38 in 2010 - 2011. During the pandemic season, the population mortality rates peaked in persons aged 0 - 15 and 55 - 64 years. In the 2010 - 2011 influenza season, peaks in mortality were seen in persons aged 0 - 15 and 75 - 84 years. During the 2010 - 2011 influenza season, the height of first peak was lower compared to that during the pandemic season. Underlying immunological disorders were more common in the pandemic season compared to the 2010 - 2011 season (p = 0. 02), and cardiovascular disorders were more common in the 2010 - 2011 season (p = 0. 005). Conclusions The mortality pattern in the 2010 - 2011 influenza season still resembled the 2009 - 2010 pandemic season with a peak in relatively young age groups, but concurrently a clear shift toward seasonal patterns was seen, with a peak in mortality in the elderly, i. e. ≥ 75 years of age. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{foreclosure}} {{of property}} tax liens performs an essential economic function by reconnecting underutilized properties {{to the real}} estate market. To clear title in an efficient and just manner, local jurisdictions foreclosing on tax liens require clear, balanced procedures {{for the provision of}} notice to affected parties. In its 2006 decision in Jones v. Flowers, the U. S. Supreme Court found that the foreclosing jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s lack of direct follow-up on returned notice mailings denied the addressee due process because the foreclosing party did not take steps that would be chosen by one desirous of actually informing the property owner. In subjecting to direct constitutional review the myriad notification decisions a foreclosure petitioner must make in conducting diligent attempts at notification, Jones, though rightly decided, threatens the validity of tax foreclosure proceedings and the titles that result from them in a fundamentally different way than earlier precedents that made notification more rigorous without loss of clarity. After demonstrating the Court 2 ̆ 7 s historical use of rules and standards in this area of notice and opportunity to be heard, this Article will show how the development of constitutional safe harbors can be used to resolve the shortcomings of the rule/standard dichotomy. Deploying a theoretical framework for the judicial fostering of fair and efficient constitutional safe harbors, this Article advocates legislative enactment of and judicial support for <b>detailed</b> <b>notification</b> protocols tailored to the particular needs and behaviors of the different types of land interest holders entitled to foreclosure notice. In order to provide reliable guidance to foreclosing parties, these notice procedures should be designed to meet a higher standard developed in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s due process jurisprudence. If a court finds a set of legislated protocols reasonably certain to inform the interested parties for whom they were designed, then that court should judge the constitutionality of notification choices that come before it against that certified rule. Such an approach would be preferable to reviewing those decisions directly using vague, albeit generally less restrictive, constitutional standards such as reasonably calculated... to apprise or chosen by one desirous of actually informing. Notification protocols that meet this due process super standard of reasonable certainty can become safe harbors for those pursuing tax foreclosure remedies while still assuring full compliance with the guarantees of notice and opportunity to be heard embodied in constitutional jurisprudence. due process, notice and opportunity to be heard, tax foreclosure, constitutional safe harbor, rules, standards, pliability rule...|$|R
40|$|The cruise is a {{contribution}} to SEAFO resulting from a co-operation between SEAFO, the EAF-Nansen project, and the FAO Deep-sea programme. The aim is to facilitate activities {{in support of the}} efforts by RFMOs to meet objectives in relation to the United Nations General Asssembly (UNGA) resolution 61 / 105 and the associated FAO Guidelines on Bottom Fisheries in the high seas. Furthermore, the southeastern Atlantic ABNJ was selected by the recently initiated GEF-sponsored FAO ABNJ programme (“Common Oceans”) as an area of particular attention, involving the relevant RFMO with competent to regulate bottom fishing in that region is the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO). Despite a shortage of data on the occurrence of ‘vulnerable marine ecosystems’ (VMEs, as defined in the FAO Guidelines), SEAFO has introduced comprehensive measures to protect such ecosystems from significant adverse impacts within the convention area. The convention area consist of agreed limited ‘existing fishing areas’, i. e. areas were fisheries were conducted within a recent reference period, and more extensive ‘new fishing areas’ where this was not the case. Commercial harvesting is essentially restricted to the ‘existing fishing areas’, but further regulated by other measures such as species-specific TACs, gear restrictions and other measures aimed to conserve e. g. sharks. To conduct exploratory fisheries in ‘new fishing areas’ parties need to submit a <b>notification</b> and <b>detailed</b> plan and report to the Organization for approval. SEAFO has furthermore closed 10 subareas of the convention area to all fishing activity, a regulation most recently revised in 2011. Best available bathymetry data were compiled to locate subareas recognised in the FAO guidelines as VME features, essentially primarily seamounts. As fishing is restricted to the upper 2000 m of any feature, a map of areas shallower than 2000 m was the basis of further selection. In SEAFO such areas are seamounts or seamount complexes of various sizes and shapes. The spatial distribution of VME indicators such as corals and sponges (i. e. as given in FAO guidelines) is not well known in SEAFO, but the benthic and pelagic biogeographical patterns have been described. It was therefore decided to close 10 potential fishing areas that represented the range of features and the major biogeographical zones of the region. Some of these were actual fishing areas; others were either not fished or lightly fished. The end result was the set of ten closures with various shapes and sizes, ranging from single seamounts to rather wider areas comprising several seamounts or mid-Atlantic Ridge segments. While SEAFO took significant steps to ensure conservation of VMEs, the shortage of information on the distribution patterns of VME indicators remains unsatisfactory. Some new data were acquired by recent fishing experiments in existing and new fishing areas, and by Spanish-Namibian research activity on the Valdivia Bank. However, even within the relatively restricted actual fishing areas, the documentation remains scattered and limited. Similarly, the Scientific Committee of SEAFO struggles with data shortage on the fish resources actually harvested in the convention area, primarily Patagonian toothfish, pelagic armourhead, alfonsino, deep-sea red crab, and associated bycatch species. Stock assessments are generally highly uncertain and fully dependant on fisheries-generated data, hence conservation measures implemented by SEAFO remain largely precautionary rather than tuned to good estimates of abundances and productivity. Catches currently remain rather limited, i. e. collectively less than 1000 t, but some species are valuable and tend to attract interest from fishing parties that would value not only enhanced opportunities but also management based on more reliable stock assessments. This project thus aims to supplement and extend knowledge and databases on VME indicators as well as fisheries resources and will accordingly conduct targeted investigations in the currently used fishing areas of the convention area, primarily on the Walvis Ridge. In addition, some of the fishing closures will be visited to document presence-absence of VME indicators and describe distribution patterns. New data from these targeted studies will enhance the quality of fish stock assessments and help analyse the appropriateness of VME closures currently implemented solely based on feature characteristics and biogeographical affinity. Main conclusions: VMEs indicators were located in all seamounts prospected but differences in structure and development state were observed. In some seamounts coral rubble, sediment-clogged, mostly dead coral framework and living coral framework were observed from the base to the summit all along the slope. Current system associated to each seamount, depth and probably other depth-dependent environmental factors driven the presence and development of deep-water reefs. Continuous research efforts are needed to increase knowledge about biodiversity and structure. Understanding their dynamics will improve effective management and conservation of this vulnerable ecosystems. FAO, EAF-Nansen project / Deep-sea Norway projec...|$|R
