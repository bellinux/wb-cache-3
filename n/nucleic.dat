5|$|The 'virino hypothesis' postulates {{that the}} TSE agent is a foreign, self replicating <b>nucleic</b> acid or <b>nucleic</b> acid {{fragment}} bound to PrP.|$|E
5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of <b>nucleic</b> acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired <b>nucleic</b> acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired <b>nucleic</b> acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanostructures}} must be rationally {{designed so}} that individual <b>nucleic</b> acid strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with specification of a desired target structure or function. Then, the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined, specifying the arrangement of <b>nucleic</b> acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the primary structure design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each <b>nucleic</b> acid strand.|$|E
5|$|Structural DNA nanotechnology, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as SDN, {{focuses on}} synthesizing and characterizing <b>nucleic</b> acid complexes and materials where the assembly has a static, equilibrium endpoint. The <b>nucleic</b> acid double helix has a robust, defined three-dimensional geometry {{that makes it}} possible to predict and design the structures of more complicated <b>nucleic</b> acid complexes. Many such structures have been created, including two- and three-dimensional structures, and periodic, aperiodic, and discrete structures.|$|E
5|$|Assembly {{takes place}} in the cell when the newly created viral {{proteins}} and <b>nucleic</b> acid combine to form hundreds of new virus particles.|$|E
5|$|Because {{molecular}} diagnostics {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free <b>nucleic</b> acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular diagnostics methods based on <b>nucleic</b> acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} <b>nucleic</b> acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of <b>nucleic</b> acid thermodynamics and <b>nucleic</b> acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of <b>nucleic</b> acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E
5|$|In {{bioinformatics}} problems {{involving the}} folding structure of RNA, single-page book embeddings represent classical forms of <b>nucleic</b> acid secondary structure, and two-page book embeddings represent pseudoknots.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos are {{synthetic}} {{molecules that}} {{are the product of}} a redesign of natural <b>nucleic</b> acid structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard <b>nucleic</b> acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard <b>nucleic</b> acid bases, those bases are bound to morpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological pH range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.|$|E
5|$|NSP6 is a <b>nucleic</b> acid binding {{protein and}} is encoded by gene 11 from an {{out-of-phase}} open reading frame.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nucleic</b> acid {{design has}} similar goals to protein design. In both, the {{sequence}} of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures. <b>Nucleic</b> acid design {{has the advantage of}} being much computationally easier than protein design, because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure's energetic favorability, and detailed information about the overall three-dimensional folding of the structure is not required. This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. <b>Nucleic</b> acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their function because of proteins' increased ability to fold into complex structures, and the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Solid state crystal {{structures}} have been determined for many complexes of alkali metal ions in small peptides, <b>nucleic</b> acid constituents, carbohydrates and ionophore complexes.|$|E
5|$|The exocyclic amino {{groups in}} all <b>nucleic</b> bases except for T and U are {{protected}} with acyl protecting groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleobases}} {{are classified}} into two types: the purines, A and G, being fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the six-membered rings C and T. A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (U), usually takes {{the place of}} thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial <b>nucleic</b> acid analogues have been created to study the properties of <b>nucleic</b> acids, or for use in biotechnology.|$|E
5|$|Thymine and uracil, <b>nucleic</b> {{bases of}} {{thymidine}} and uridine, respectively, {{do not have}} exocyclic amino groups and hence do not require any protection.|$|E
5|$|Uncoating happens {{inside the}} cell when the viral capsid is removed and {{destroyed}} by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral <b>nucleic</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|A Holliday {{junction}} is a branched <b>nucleic</b> acid {{structure that}} contains four double-stranded arms joined together. These arms may adopt {{one of several}} conformations depending on buffer salt concentrations and the sequence of nucleobases closest to the junction. The structure is named after the molecular biologist Robin Holliday, who proposed its existence in 1964.|$|E
5|$|A protein as a {{stand-alone}} infectious agent stands {{in contrast to}} all other known infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, all of which contain <b>nucleic</b> acids (DNA, RNA, or both). For this reason, a minority of researchers still consider the prion/TSE hypothesis unproven.|$|E
5|$|After any of {{the above}} {{approaches}} are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised. <b>Nucleic</b> acid design is the process of assigning a specific <b>nucleic</b> acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E
5|$|After protein {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} have been translated from <b>nucleic</b> acid chains, {{they can be}} edited by appropriate enzymes. Although this {{is a form of}} protein affecting protein sequence, not explicitly covered by the central dogma, there are not many clear examples where the associated concepts of the two fields {{have much to do with}} each other.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{the design}} and manufacture of artificial <b>nucleic</b> acid structures for technological uses. In this field, <b>nucleic</b> acids are used as non-biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells. Researchers in the field have created static structures such as two- and three-dimensional crystal lattices, nanotubes, polyhedra, and arbitrary shapes, and functional devices such as molecular machines and DNA computers. The field is beginning {{to be used as}} a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures. Potential applications in molecular scale electronics and nanomedicine are also being investigated.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{focuses on}} forming <b>nucleic</b> acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities {{related to their}} overall structures, such as computation and mechanical motion. There is some overlap between structural and dynamic DNA nanotechnology, as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured dynamically, or {{can be made to}} form dynamically in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged <b>nucleic</b> acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the <b>nucleic</b> acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} susceptibility to nucleases under certain situations: >99% of infectivty was destroyed, {{but there was no}} reduction of prion protein, suggesting the presence of a <b>nucleic</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} categories: catabolism, the {{breaking}} down of organic matter for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate, by cellular respiration, and anabolism, the building up of components of cells such as proteins and <b>nucleic</b> acids. Usually, breaking down releases energy and building up consumes energy.|$|E
5|$|Most often, H-phosphonate {{building}} blocks are protected at the 5'-hydroxy group {{and at the}} amino group of <b>nucleic</b> bases A, C, and G {{in the same manner}} as phosphoramidite {{building blocks}} (see below). However, protection at the amino group is not mandatory.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nucleic</b> acid {{amplification}} {{tests and}} adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB. These tests, however, are not routinely recommended, as they rarely alter {{how a person}} is treated. Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended.|$|E
5|$|PrPSc {{experimentally}} transmitted {{between one}} species and another results in PrPSc with the amino-acid {{sequence of the}} recipient species, suggesting that <b>nucleic</b> acid-mediated replication of the donor agent does not occur.|$|E
5|$|RNA thermometers, {{along with}} riboswitches, {{are used as}} {{examples}} {{in support of the}} RNA world hypothesis. This theory proposes that RNA was once the sole <b>nucleic</b> acid present in cells, and was replaced by the current DNA → RNA → protein system.|$|E
5|$|Research on RNA {{has led to}} many {{important}} biological discoveries and numerous Nobel Prizes. <b>Nucleic</b> acids were discovered in 1868 by Friedrich Miescher, who called the material 'nuclein' since it {{was found in the}} nucleus. It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain <b>nucleic</b> acids. The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939. Severo Ochoa won the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with Arthur Kornberg) after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory. However, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not RNA synthesis. In 1956 Alex Rich and David Davies hybridized two separate strands of RNA to form the first crystal of RNA whose structure could be determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the other}} ions in cytosol are quite different from those in extracellular fluid and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and <b>nucleic</b> acids than {{the outside of the}} cell structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological laboratory testing. This {{can be done by}} virus isolation in cell cultures, <b>nucleic</b> acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (serology). Virus isolation and <b>nucleic</b> acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative {{in the early stages of}} the disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>nucleic</b> acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. <b>Nucleic</b> acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E
5|$|Uncoating is {{a process}} in which the viral capsid is removed: This may be by {{degradation}} by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the viral genomic <b>nucleic</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|VP3 {{is part of}} {{the inner}} core of the virion and is an enzyme called guanylyl transferase. This is a capping enzyme that catalyses the {{formation}} of the 5' cap in the post-transcriptional modification of mRNA. The cap stabilises viral mRNA by protecting it from <b>nucleic</b> acid degrading enzymes called nucleases.|$|E
5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, <b>nucleic</b> acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E
