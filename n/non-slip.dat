5|$|Unlike the MacBook Air, the MacBook {{follows the}} same design first {{seen in the}} MacBook Pro; however, it is rounder on the edges than {{previous}} laptops in the MacBook line. This model has an all-white fingerprint-resistant glossy palm rest, unlike the grayish surface of its predecessor, and uses a multi-touch glass trackpad like the one found on the MacBook Pro. The video-out port is Mini DisplayPort. The bottom of the MacBook features a rubberized <b>non-slip</b> finish. The built-in battery of the late 2009 revision, a feature introduced {{earlier in the year}} with the MacBook Pro, is claimed by Apple to last seven hours compared with five hours in the older models. However, in tests conducted by Macworld, the battery was found to last only about four hours while playing video at full brightness with AirPort turned off. However, Apple's battery life was calculated with the brightness at the middle setting and while browsing websites and editing word documents, not with video and at full brightness. Gizmodo also reached about the same conclusion in their tests, but with AirPort turned on. The battery included in the mid-2010 model holds an additional five watt-hours over the previous model's and is claimed to last up to ten hours.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{problems}} of <b>non-slipping</b> contact, <b>non-slipping</b> adhesive contact, and <b>non-slipping</b> adhesive contact with a stretched substrate are sequentially studied under the plane strain theory. The main results are obtained as follows:(i) The explicit solutions {{for a kind of}} singular integrals frequently encountered in contact mechanics (and fracture mechanics) are derived, which enables a comprehensive analysis of <b>non-slipping</b> contacts. (ii) The <b>non-slipping</b> contact problems are formulated in terms of the Kolosov–Muskhelishvili complex potential formulae and their exact solutions are obtained in closed or explicit forms. The relative tangential displacement within a <b>non-slipping</b> contact is found in a compact form. (iii) The spatial derivative of this relative displacement will be referred to in this study as the interface mismatch eigenstrain. Taking into account the interface mismatch eigenstrain, a new <b>non-slipping</b> adhesive contact model is proposed and its solution is obtained. It is shown that the pull-off force and the half-width of the <b>non-slipping</b> adhesive contact are smaller than the corresponding solutions of the JKR model (Johnson et al., 1971). The maximum difference can reach 9 % for pull-off force and 17 % for pull-off width, respectively. In contrast, the new model may be more accurate in modeling the <b>non-slipping</b> adhesion. (iv) The <b>non-slipping</b> adhesions with a stretch strain (S-strain) imposed to one of contact counterparts are re-examined and the analytical solutions are obtained. The accurate analysis shows that under small values of the S-strain both the natural adhesive contact half-width and the pull-off force may be augmented, but for the larger S-strain values they are always reduced. It is also found that Dundurs’ parameter β may exert a considerable effect on the solution of the pull-off problem under the S-strain. These solutions may be used to study contacts at macro-, micro-, and nano-scales...|$|R

40|$|Escherichia coli DinB (DNA {{polymerase}} IV) possesses {{an enzyme}} architecture resulting in specialized lesion bypass function {{and the potential}} for creating − 1 frameshifts in homopolymeric nucleotide runs. We have previously shown that the mutagenic potential of DinB is regulated by the DNA damage response protein UmuD 2. In the current study, we employ a pre-steady-state fluorescence approach to gain a mechanistic understanding of DinB regulation by UmuD 2. Our results suggest that DinB, like its mammalian and archaeal orthologs, uses a template slippage mechanism to create single base deletions on homopolymeric runs. With 2 -aminopurine as a fluorescent reporter in the DNA substrate, the template slippage reaction results in a prechemistry fluorescence change that is inhibited by UmuD 2. We propose a model in which DNA templates containing homopolymeric nucleotide runs, when bound to DinB, are in an equilibrium between <b>non-slipped</b> and slipped conformations. UmuD 2, when bound to DinB, displaces the equilibrium in favor of the <b>non-slipped</b> conformation, thereby preventing frameshifting and potentially enhancing DinB activity on <b>non-slipped</b> substrates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{recently}} proposed a generalized JKR model for <b>non-slipping</b> adhesive contact between two elastic spheres {{subjected to a}} pair of pulling forces and a mismatch strain (Chen, S., Gao, H., 2006 c. <b>Non-slipping</b> adhesive contact between mismatched elastic spheres: a model of adhesion mediated deformation sensor. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 54, 1548 – 1567). Here we extend this model to adhesion between two mismatched elastic cylinders. The attention is focused on how the mismatch strain affects the contact area and the pull-off force. It is found that there exists a critical mismatch strain at which the contact spontaneously dissociates. The analysis suggests possible mechanisms by which mechanical deformation can affect binding between cells and molecules in biology...|$|R

Wooden utility poles drilled about four deep into the final ice pier support electrical and telephone service to the pier. Moreover, during the final construction phase, personnel mount shorter poles in the ice edge to serve as bollards to secure the pier to the shore at McMurdo.

When it's carved by hand, an intō ("seal-engraving blade"), a mirror, and a small specialized wooden vice are used. An intō is a flat-bladed pencil-sized chisel, usually round or octagonal in cross-section and sometimes wrapped in string to give the handle a <b>non-slip</b> surface. The intō is held vertically in one hand, with the point projecting from one's fist on the side opposite one's thumb. New, modern intō {{range in price from}} less than US$1 to US$100.|$|E
25|$|During development, Camm and the Hawker {{design team}} had placed a high {{priority}} on making the Tempest easily accessible to both air and ground crews; to this end, the forward fuselage and cockpit areas of the earlier Hurricane and the Tempest and Typhoon families were covered by large removable panels providing access to as many components as possible, including flight controls and engine accessories. Both upper wing roots incorporated panels of <b>non-slip</b> coating. For the pilot a retractable foot stirrup under the starboard root trailing edge was linked {{to a pair of}} handholds which were covered by spring-loaded flaps. Through a system of linkages, when the canopy was open the stirrup was lowered and the flaps opened, providing easy access to the cockpit; as the canopy was closed, the stirrup was raised into the fuselage and the flaps snapped shut.|$|E

An implicit assumption made in their study was that the contact region remains symmetric {{with respect to the}} center of the cylinder. This assumption is, however, not self-consistent because the resulting energy release rates at two contact edges, which are supposed to be identical, actually differ from each other. Here we revisit the original problem of Chen and Gao and derive the correct solution by removing this problematic assumption. The corrected solution provides a proper insight into the concept of orientation-dependent adhesion strength in anisotropic elastic solids...|$|R

2500|$|According to Honda, [...] "Engineers {{started with}} Honda’s Global Light Truck {{platform}} and transformed 93% {{of the components}} into a mission-specific platform using approximately 44% high-strength steel across the unibody and seven high-strength steel cross members to create a fully boxed ladder frame that is fully integrated into the unibody. [...] Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] According to Autoweek, The Ridgeline's [...] "unibody has many braces, brackets, and reinforced areas that require more welding than traditional pickups." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted an aluminum hood that supports a unique cold air intake system for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the radiator to support torque production and deep water fording which Honda attempted to patent. [...] This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that are also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to their size, Honda incorporated small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to reduce air turbulence which Honda also attempted to patent. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat load floor (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. [...] This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a rear garnish that shields the rear glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion. [...] The bed is built out of steel-reinforced Sheet Molding Composite (SMC) which is dent resistant, corrosion resistant, and is covered with a <b>non-slip</b> coating. [...] It is supported by high-strength steel crossmembers (three under the bed and two in the rear cab wall) to safely secure and support heavy loads, even under conditions that would cause the SMC to fail or during collisions that would try to force that load into the cab.|$|E
