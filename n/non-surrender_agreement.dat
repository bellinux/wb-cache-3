40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss and compare the {{multilateral}} and bilateral efforts to prevent the ICC from exercising its jurisdiction over nationals of states non-parties to the Rome Statute. In particular, the US secured the adoption of Security Council resolutions no. 1422 (2002), 1487 (2003), 1497 (2003), 1593 (2005) and launched a campaign for the conclusion of bilateral non-surrender agreements: the differences between the resolutions and between them and the agreements are analysed. None of the resolutions above can be qualified as an exercise of the Security Council's power to request the ICC not to commence or proceed with investigations or prosecutions under Article 16 of the Rome Statute, as this provision was not conceived to cover future and hypothetical cases. Furthermore, by adopting resolutions 1422 and 1487 and by including the paragraphs on the exclusive jurisdiction of the contributing state in resolutions 1497 and 1593, the Security Council acted ultra vires, since no threat to the peace can be found in order to justify the exercise of Chapter VII powers. The resolutions are also in contrast with the principles and purposes of the UN. As to the bilateral non-surrender agreements, they cannot be qualified as "international agreements pursuant to which the consent of the sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court" as required by Article 98 (2) of the Statute, since they prohibit the surrender to the ICC of any individual who is "present" on the territory of the other party and they do not require the state to which the accused has been transferred to investigate and prosecute the case. Should Italy conclude a <b>non-surrender</b> <b>agreement</b> with the US, it would incur international responsibility. The law giving effect to such an agreement in the Italian legal order would also be in contrast with Articles 10 (1) and 11 of the Constitution...|$|E
50|$|According to the Department of State website, the Bureau secures {{military}} base access and overflight permission {{to support the}} deployment of U.S. military forces. It negotiates the status of U.S. military forces and International Criminal Court <b>non-surrender</b> <b>agreements.</b> It is also responsible for coordinating the participation of coalition combat and stabilization forces, and assisting other countries in reducing the availability of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), which are shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of the Rome Treaty establishing the permanent International Criminal Court is to advance the unification of international criminal law. Whilst it may be contended that this body of law is acquiring a great degree of specificity and uniformity in content through the ICC Statute, both its development and importantly its scope are fundamentally reliant on its interpretation and application at national level; {{it is here that}} the enforcement of complementarity measures are fragmented. In this piece, the validation of the ICC surrender and deferral rationale and mechanisms are analysed against the ICC Statute’s procedural safeguards vis-à-vis national ones. Problems of ICC Treaty implementation go beyond the mere Treaty language; notwithstanding the principle of pacta sunt servanda, these lie in the contradiction between the legal principle in question (complementarity) and interpretation and reconciliation with constitutionalism. Whereas the ICC Treaty arguably erodes national sovereignty, varying implementation methods will define, broaden or limit the scope and the jurisdictional reach of the ICC. This may be illustrated for instance, from observing the extent to which traditional extradition defences have survived the ICC surrender model, regional amnesties and ICC Article 98 <b>non-surrender</b> <b>agreements.</b> The Court’s jurisdiction may not be triggered automatically nor be imposed on states through the mere accession to the Rome Treaty. The fragmented application of the ICC Statute, which may be evidenced also through the multiplicity of Rome Treaty implementation methods, reflects the jurisdictionally imbalanced ICC legal regime...|$|R
