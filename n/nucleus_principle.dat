Image features based on colour, texture and the geometry of the cells and parasites are generated, as well as features that make use of a priori knowledge of the classificationproblem and mimic features used by human technicians. The first order features provides the basic mathematical ranges for different types of parasites.

We studied MN recruitment in two muscle pairs, the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles, and the MG and posterior biceps femoris (PBF) muscles because these pairs are coactivated reliably in stretch and cutaneous reflexes, respectively. For 29 / 34 MG-LG pairs of MNs, the MN with lower CV was recruited first either in all trials (548 / 548 trials for 22 pairs) or in most trials (225 / 246 trials for 7 pairs), whether the MG or the LG MN in a pair was recruited first. Intertrial variability in the force thresholds of MG and LG MNs recruited by stretch was relatively low (coefficient of variation = 18 % on average). Finally, punctate stimulation of the skin over the heel recruited 4 / 4 pairs of MG-LG MNs in order by CV. By all of these measures, recruitment order is as consistent among MNs from these two ankle muscles as it is for MNs supplying the MG muscle alone. For MG-PBF pairings, the MN with lower CV was recruited first in the majority of trials for 13 / 24 pairs and in reverse order for 9 / 24 pairs. The recruitment sequence of coactive MNs supplying the MG and PBF muscles was, therefore, random with respect to axonal conduction velocity and not organized as predicted by the size principle.

Today, the upper limit for distance measurement, involving the most commonly studied atomic pairs such as 13 C- 15 N and 13 C- 13 C, is about 5 - 6 Å. However, longer distances define often the key structural constraints and such upper limit prevents the study of major structural problems, such as drug–target interaction or DNA– protein interaction. Therefore, there is a crucial interest {{in the development of}} SSNMR methods for long range distance measurement. Here, we present an original approach in this respect: tritium solid-state NMR.

40|$|The Project in Canada to Search for Supersymmetric Objects (PICASSO) {{searches}} for {{cold dark matter}} through the direct detection of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) via spin-dependent and spin independent interactions with 19 F <b>nuclei.</b> The detection <b>principle</b> {{is based on the}} superheated droplet technique; the detectors consist of a gel matrix with millions of liquid droplets of superheated fluorocarbon (C 4 F 10) dispersed in it. In order to reduce the background, it is essential to distinguish the signature of different background particles interacting in the detector. A dedicated setup was developed in order to study the response of the C 4 F 10 droplets in the presence of different backgrounds. The main objectives of this research are to identify the actual size (diameter) of the droplet increases due to phase transition and to check and establish the correlation between the droplet size and the maximum amplitude of the signal. In addition, the alpha-neutron discrimination was studied by observing each event’s image frames and the associated acoustic signal to get the amplitude distribution. The mean ratio of bubble size to droplet size was found to be 5. 48, independent of temperature and type of interacting particle. Furthermore, no correlation was found between the droplet size and the maximum amplitude of the signal. As for the discrimination studies, the analysis of the signal events has confirmed that alphas generated outside the active liquid in the gel are much more difficult to discriminate from neutron than when alphas are generated inside the active liquid.

40|$|We briefly {{review the}} {{significance}} of quantum corrections in the total energy of systems with voids: bubble nuclei, atomic clusters and the inhomogeneous phase of neutron stars. It was suggested {{a long time ago}} that very large nuclei might not undergo a Coulomb explosion if they acquire a new topology, that of a bubble or a torus 1. When a void is formed, while the density and therefore the total volume is kept unchanged, the surface area of such a nucleus naturally increases and that leads to an increased surface energy and less binding. However, at the same time the average distance between protons increases as well and the total Coulomb energy then decreases. The balancing of these two types of energy and the fact that configurations with larger binding energy than the familiar compact geometries exists is the reason why bubble–like and torus–like <b>nuclei</b> could in <b>principle</b> be someday observed. It was realized however that shell effects play a crucial role in stabilizing these new shapes 2. During the last decade many experimentalists have tried to manufacture highly charged metallic clusters, but, again, Coulomb repulsion prevented their creation. The idea that objects with a different topology, in particular bubble–like charged metallic clusters could be a possible route to create highly charged metallic clusters was recently put forward 3, and again the stabilizing role of the shell corrections was noted as playing a decisive role. There was an aspect of bubble systems, which for mysterious reasons never caught the attention of previous authors:Where should one position a bubble inside a nucleus? Symmetry considerations seem to suggest that a spherica...|$|R
