Correlated <b>deposit</b> withdrawals of <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> {{could be mitigated}} if <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> are more diversified, i. e. held by more individuals. This paper examines the link between a broader access to <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> prior to the 2008 crisis and the dynamics of <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> growth in the crisis, while controlling for relevant covariates. Employing the proxies of Honohan (2008) for access to deposits and of Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper (2012) {{for the use of}} <b>bank</b> <b>deposits,</b> the authors find that greater access to <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> can make the deposit funding base of banks more resilient in times of financial stress.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} behaviour of <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> is to a {{large extent}} influenced by interest payments. In Italy this problem is particularly serious because, in the past, interests on <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> were paled only once a year (in December). The seasonally of <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> thus changes over time and it is highly correlated with the level of interest rates.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} interest rate regulation, and subsequent deregulation, on the efficacy of monetary policy and rigidity of retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates in Hong Kong. Using an error-correction model, we find that interest rate deregulation increases the efficacy of monetary policy by improving the correlation between retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates and market interest rates and increasing the degree of long-term pass-through for retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates. Our study also shows that the adjustments in retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates are asymmetric and rigid upwards during the regulated period, but tend to be rigid downwards during the deregulated period. The spreads between retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates and market rates have also tightened sharply after the removal of interest rate controls.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} the empirical behavior of conventional <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> {{rates and the}} rate of return on retail Islamic profit-and-loss sharing (PLS) investment accounts in Malaysia and Turkey, using monthly data from January 1997 to August 2010. The analysis shows that conventional <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates and PLS returns exhibit long-run cointegration and the time-varying volatility of conventional <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates and PLS returns is correlated and is statistically significant. The pairwise and multivariate causality tests show that conventional <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates Granger cause returns on PLS accounts. These findings have policy implications in terms of price stability and financial stability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on a reduced-form {{equation}} {{derived from}} a simultaneous model of bank loan demand and supply, this study finds that the equilibrium bank loan has a negative relationship with the discount rate and the 10 -year U. S. government bond yield; it has a positive relationship with <b>bank</b> <b>deposits,</b> industrial production, appreciation of the yuan, and the inflation rate. A lower discount rate or more <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> will increase <b>bank</b> loan supply. Conversely, a higher discount rate or less <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> will reduce <b>bank</b> loan supply. Hence, the bank lending channel is confirmed...|$|R

The implementation of individual regression analysis has detected a positive and meaningful relationship between growth domestic product, financial deepening, inflation rate and the number of branches on one side and <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> on the other side. In addition, the study has confirmed a negative and meaningful relationship between two variables of dependency burden as well as interest charged on bank’s clients and <b>bank</b> <b>deposit.</b> However, the result of our survey does not indicate that there was any relationship between interest rate paid to customers and <b>bank</b> <b>deposit...</b>|$|R
