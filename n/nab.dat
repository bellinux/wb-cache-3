To assess the importance of <b>NAbs</b> in the milieu on DC development, we examined the status of DCs in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a disease characterized by paucity of B cells and circulating antibodies. We demonstrate that the in vitro differentiation of DCs is severely impaired in these patients, at least in part because of low levels of circulating <b>NAbs.</b> We identified <b>NAbs</b> reactive with the CD 40 molecule as an important component that participates in the development of DCs.

40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease, {{characterized by the}} accumulation of oxidized lipoproteins and apoptotic cells, both containing various "oxidation- specific" neoepitopes. Adaptive immune responses to oxidation-specific epitopes {{have been shown to}} play an important role in atherogenesis. However, accumulating evidence suggests that these epitopes are also recognized by components of innate immunity, such as scavenger receptors on macrophages, as well as natural antibodies (<b>NAbs).</b> <b>NAbs</b> are mostly of the IgM isotype which are selected by evolution and represent the humoral arc of innate immunity. In my thesis, I provide multiple lines of evidence that oxidation-specific epitopes constitute a dominant, previously unrecognized target of <b>NAbs</b> in both mice and humans. For example, using reconstituted mice expressing solely IgM <b>NAbs,</b> I showed that ̃ 30 % of all <b>NAbs</b> bind to model oxidation epitopes, as well as to atherosclerotic lesions and apoptotic cells.

Because oxidative processes are ubiquitous, these epitopes might exert selective pressure to expand <b>NAbs,</b> which in turn may play an important role in mediating homeostatic functions consequent to inflammation and cell death. This is demonstrated by the ability of <b>NAbs</b> to facilitate apoptotic cell clearance. These findings provide novel insights into the functions of <b>NAbs</b> in mediating host homeostasis and into their roles in health and diseases, which may lead to novel diagnostic and possibly therapeutic approaches to deal with consequences of oxidative stress such as atherogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} public health issue. There {{is a need}} for new approaches to develop new antiviral compounds or other therapeutic strategies to limit viral transmission. The envelope glycoproteins gp 120 and gp 41 of HIV are the main targets for both silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and neutralizing antibodies. There is an urgency to optimize the efficiency of the neutralizing antibodies (<b>NABs).</b> In this study, we demonstrated that there is an additive effect between the four <b>NABs</b> and AgNPs when combined against cell-associated HIV- 1 infection in vitro Results Four <b>NABs</b> (Monoclonal antibody to HIV- 1 gp 41 126 - 7, HIV- 1 gp 120 Antiserum PB 1 Sub 2, HIV- 1 gp 120 Antiserum PB 1, HIV- 1 gp 120 Monoclonal Antibody F 425 B 4 e 8) with or without AgNPs of 30 - 50 nm in size were tested against cell free and cell-associated HIV IIIB virus. All <b>NABs</b> inhibited HIV- 1 cell free infection at a dose response manner, but with AgNPs an antiviral additive effect was not achieved Although there was no inhibition of infection with cell-associated virus by the <b>NABs</b> itself, AgNPs alone were able to inhibit cell associated virus infection and more importantly, when mixed together with <b>NABs</b> they inhibited the HIV- 1 cell associated infection in an additive manner. Discussion The most attractive strategies to deal with the HIV problem are the development of a prophylactic vaccine and the development of effective topical vaginal microbicide. For two decades a potent vaccine that inhibits transmission of infection of HIV has been searched. There are vaccines that elicit <b>NABs</b> but none of them has the efficacy to stop transmission of HIV- 1 infection. We propose that with the addition of AgNPs, <b>NABs</b> will have an additive effect and become more potent to inhibit cell-associated HIV- 1 transmission/infection. Conclusions The addition of AgNPs to <b>NABs</b> has significantly increased the neutralizing potency of <b>NABs</b> in prevention of cell-associated HIV- 1 transmission/infection. Further exploration is required to standardize potentiation of <b>NABs</b> by AgNPs. It is also required to evaluate in vivo toxicity of AgNPs before AgNPs could be incorporated in any antiviral vaginal creams. </p...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{antibodies}} (<b>NAbs)</b> are pre-existing antibodies with germline origin {{that arise}} {{in the absence of}} previous exposure to foreign antigens. <b>NAbs</b> are produced by B- 1 lymphocytes and are primarily of the IgM isotype. There is accumulating evidence that - in addition to their role in antimicrobial host defense - <b>NAbs</b> exhibit important housekeeping functions by facilitating the non-immunogenic clearance of apoptotic cells as well as the removal of (neo-) self antigens. These properties are largely mediated by the ability of <b>NAbs</b> to recognize highly conserved and endogenously generated structures, which are exemplified by so-called oxidation-specific epitopes (OSEs) that are products of lipid peroxidation. The generation of OSEs as well as their interaction with the immune system have been studied extensively in the context of atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the vascular wall that is characterized by the accumulation of cellular debris and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (OxLDL). Both apoptotic cells as well as OxLDL carry OSEs that are targeted by <b>NAbs.</b> Therefore, OSEs represent stress-induced neo-self structures that mediate recognition of metabolic waste (e. g. cellular debris) by <b>NAbs,</b> allowing its safe disposal, which has fundamental implications in health and disease...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{antibodies}} (<b>NAbs)</b> {{constitute an}} important component in vertebrate immune system, but, in spite of this, have often been dismissed as "non-specific background" signals. We observed a significant positive relationship between water python (Liasis fuscus) body length/age and levels of antibodies reactive with two administered antigens (tetanus and diphtheria). However, no humoral immune response to the antigens was observed. The lack of elevated immune response, and the age-associated increase in antibody titres, strongly suggest that the antibodies consisted of polyreactive <b>NAbs,</b> and that absence of an elevated immune response was caused by such high levels of <b>NAbs</b> {{that they were able}} to mask the epitopes of the antigens. In our study area pythons feed mainly on rodents that frequently, before being killed, are able to inflict numerous bites to the snakes. The bites most likely transmit pathogens such as bacteria. As <b>NAbs</b> have been shown to act as a first line defence against bacterial infections, the high levels of <b>NAbs</b> in the pythons may be an adaptation to reduce pathogenic effects of bacteria transmitted by the prey when the snakes are feeding.

For 1 ≤ a ≤ b, and a + b ≥ d, we will see that <b>Na,b,d</b> = 1 + p + p 2 + · · ·+ pr, where r = r(a, b) is a somewhat irregular function of a and b (the precise rule is given i...|$|R
