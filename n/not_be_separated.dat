5|$|Thomas {{attended}} {{a series of}} crisis meetings in Chicago with Connant, Groves, Arthur Compton, Kenneth Nichols and Enrico Fermi. It was agreed that the isotopes could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated,</b> so high-purity plutonium would not be required. Thomas therefore decided to disband his plutonium purification team. The Los Alamos laboratory {{then turned to the}} technologically much more difficult task of building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated,</b> and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, the Swedish team {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} Berkeley team's inability to detect element 102 in 1958, maintaining that they did discover it. However, later work has shown that no nobelium isotopes lighter than 259No (no heavier isotopes could have been produced in the Swedish experiments) with a half-life over 3minutes exist, and that the Swedish team's results are most likely from thorium-225, which has a half-life of 8minutes and quickly undergoes triple alpha decay to polonium-213, which has a decay energy of 8.53612MeV. This hypothesis is lent weight {{by the fact that}} thorium-225 can easily be produced in the reaction used and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> out by the chemical methods used. Later work on nobelium also showed that the divalent state is more stable than the trivalent one and hence that the samples emitting the alpha particles could not have contained nobelium, as the divalent nobelium would not have eluted with the other trivalent actinides. Thus, the Swedish team later retracted their claim and associated the activity to background effects.|$|E

5|$|Nelvana {{licensed}} Cardcaptor Sakura in North America, {{dubbed the}} series into English with Ocean Studios featuring Carly McKillip as Sakura, and released {{it under the}} name Cardcaptors. This version was heavily edited from the original Japanese version. The initial version of the dub covered all 70 episodes, although character names were changed, some Japanese text was changed to English, and controversial subjects such as same-sex relationships were edited out. The musical score was completely replaced with new music {{and some of the}} sound effects were replaced when they could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> into separate tracks, although the original opening and ending themes were dubbed into English. This version aired in Australia on Network Ten and Cartoon Network, in Ireland on RTÉ2, in the UK on CiTV and Nickelodeon, and in Canada on Teletoon (which also aired the episodes with a French dub). An alternative English dub of the series was produced by Omni Productions to air on Animax Asia and it has been shown entirely unedited and uncut making it very faithfully closer to the original Japanese version, which it broadcast on its English-language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia.|$|E
5|$|A then-record {{crowd of}} 13,500 descended on Seedhill for {{the visit of}} Darlington on 4 April, but the top two teams in the {{division}} could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> as the game finished in a 1–1 draw. Nelson remained second in the table going into the Easter period, during which teams played four matches {{in the space of}} five days. The first of these games ended in a 2–1 defeat away at Crewe Alexandra, despite Newnes' first goal since September. John Stevenson then scored his second Nelson goal the following day in a 1–1 draw with Bradford Park Avenue. On 13 April, the team avenged their loss to Crewe with a comprehensive 7–0 victory at Seedhill, their biggest winning margin in the Football League. Joe Eddleston opened the scoring and went on to net his third hat-trick of the season, taking his tally of goals to 25, a total that would never be beaten during Nelson's time in the League. The other goals were added by Laycock, who scored twice, Chadwick and Cameron, who netted his last goal for Nelson. However, the team then took just three out of an available ten points {{at the end of the}} season, ending their hopes of returning to the Second Division. Following a 1–1 draw at Doncaster Rovers, Nelson suffered their first and only home defeat of the season, losing 4–2 to Wrexham. On 21 September the team achieved their final win of the campaign, beating Southport 2–1 thanks to two goals from Laycock. The 1924–25 season ended with consecutive away losses at Durham City and bottom-of-the-league Rotherham County, leaving Nelson with second in the Third Division North on 53 points, ahead of third-placed New Brighton on goal average.|$|E

25|$|The {{evidence}} for ectomycorrhizal priming {{is so far}} inconclusive. Field evidence suggests that ectomycorrhizal fungi may be increasing the rate of soil carbon degradation, however lab tests show that exudation from fine roots decreases with increasing ectomycorrhizal colonization, which suggests that abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi should reduce priming effects. Brzostek et al. (2012) report variation in form of nitrogen produced in the rhizosphere of trees that vary in mycorrhizal type, however the effects of root and mycorrhizal priming could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated.</b>|$|E

25|$|A rebel {{during the}} reign of Kamose, Teti son of Pepi, has been {{identified}} by Vandersleyen as the same person as Teti son of Minhotep, by arguing that Pepi is a diminutive of Minhotep. If these two persons were the same person, it would require that the reign of Nubkheperre Intef and Kamose could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by too many years. However, Wolfgang Helck has argued that the frequency of these names is due instead to a large family in the area of Coptos with ties to the Sixth Dynasty, since Teti and Pepy were names of important Sixth Dynasty Pharaohs.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} 'Zephyr et Flore' {{is set on}} Mount Olympus in Greece, where Boreas, the north wind, plots to abduct Flora, the wife of Zephyr, the west wind.

Nine muses in mourning bring Zephyr's body to Mount Olympus where, after his funeral procession, he comes back to life. The muses tie Flora securely to Zephyr's wrist so they will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> again and Boreas is punished.|$|E
25|$|When Henry III (last direct male from Claude of France) died, Brittany {{passed as}} part of the Crown to the next heir of France, Henry of Navarre, rather than to Claude's most senior heirs (either Henry II, Duke of Lorraine or Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia). While these nobles were {{technically}} Henry's heirs, there were problems with both claimants to the Ducal crown. The most important issue was that the crown, as a Sovereign Duke, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from that of the French Crown.

Also in 1940, Fothergill and South Melbourne player Herbie Matthews tied for first place in Brownlow Medal voting as best and fairest in the VFL, with a then-record 32 votes; at the time, neither player won the Brownlow Medal itself, as their records could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> on countback and there was no provision for a shared medal, but both men were awarded Brownlow Medals in 1989 when the VFL decided to retrospectively eliminate the countback from the award.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in an {{international}} football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team that led the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner. If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> after the extra time, there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each) to determine which team progressed to the next round. The silver goal replaced the golden goal from the previous two championships and was used in the semi final between Greece and the Czech Republic.|$|E
