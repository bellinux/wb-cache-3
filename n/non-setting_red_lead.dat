30|$|Raman spectroscopic {{analysis}} of Labrus carneus identified vermillion and <b>red</b> <b>lead,</b> which were present throughout the painting together with another unidentified red pigment used {{to paint the}} scales throughout the body. The analysis also demonstrated that Bauer generally used <b>red</b> <b>lead,</b> <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> mixed with vermillion, <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> mixed with a yellow pigment or vermillion mixed with a yellow pigment {{in order to produce}} orange in the Fauna Graeca paintings. The oranges used in Labrus carneus all appear visually similar. However, as above, it was difficult to isolate the exact location of areas painted with each pigment with Raman spectroscopy and XRF alone.|$|R

50|$|There was (and is) {{considerable}} confusion {{among the}} names of ancient and medieval pigments.

40|$|The {{construction}} of spectral discoloration model, based on aging test and simulating degradation experiment, was proposed {{to detect the}} aging degree of <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> pigment in ancient murals and to reproduce the spectral data supporting digital restoration of the ancient murals. The degradation process of <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> pigment under the aging test conditions was revealed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and spectrophotometer. The simulating degradation experiment {{was carried out by}} proportionally mixing <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> and lead dioxide with referring to the results of aging test. The experimental result indicated that the pure <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> was gradually turned into black lead dioxide, and the amount of tiny particles of the aging sample increased faced with aging process. Both the chroma and lightness of <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> pigment decreased with discoloration, and its hue essentially remains unchanged. In addition, the spectral reflectance curves of the aging samples almost started rising at about 550 [*]nm with the inflection moving slightly from about 570 [*]nm to 550 [*]nm. The spectral reflectance of samples in long- and in short-wavelength regions was fitted well with the logarithmic and linear function. The spectral discoloration model was established, and the real aging <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> pigment in Dunhuang murals was measured and verified the effectiveness of the model...|$|R

30|$|The pseudo-colour {{image in}} Fig.  7 shows the mapping of areas of {{vermillion}} (appears yellow) and <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> (appears transparent). The {{main body of}} the fish appears to be painted in <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> alone with no vermillion. The dorsal and pectoral fins and areas of the gills and eye clearly contain vermillion, whereas the pelvic fin appears to be painted in <b>red</b> <b>lead.</b> The tips of the dorsal and pectoral fins appear purple in the pseudo-colour image, indicating a copper blue. The scales however appear to be painted in a red lake. The light red/pink colour of the red used in the delineation of the scales in the pseudo-colour image and subsequently confirmed by Raman spectroscopy suggests this contained neither vermillion nor <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> and was likely to be an organic lake pigment. In this case the pseudo-colour appears similar to that of lac, madder or brazilwood lakes, but not to that of carmine/cochineal. It {{is important to note that}} what was sold as ‘red lake’ by colourmen and apothecaries in the eighteenth century often referred to a number of materials—cochineal and brazilwood among them [27 – 29]. A 1738 manual states for example that “[Red] Lake is to be had in most colour shops ready prepared in shells for water-colours” [26].|$|R

30|$|The {{other two}} {{pigments}} {{taken from the}} RCE-collection are <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> and lead white, which are both toxic as well. The lead white pigment was produced by the Dutch lead white factory in Schoonhoven de Kat. This company was founded in 1778 and became the largest lead white producing company in West-Europe in 1963 [53], but due to diminishing demand it had to close down in the 1990 ′s. The Schoonhoven company produced lead white according to the Dutch or stack-process whereby lead sheets are first exposed to acetic acid to form lead acetate and subsequently to carbonic acid and warmth, produced by horse manure, resulting in basic lead carbonate (lead white). In the 20 th century the procedure was somewhat adjusted for health safety reasons; the horse manure was replaced by coke fire and heating by a steam-boiler [54]. The <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> pigment was produced by the firm ‘Sikkens verkoop Nederland N.V.’, Sassenheim, The Netherlands. XRD-analysis proved the presence of <b>lead</b> tetroxide (<b>red</b> <b>lead).</b>|$|R

60|$|But {{in trying}} Experiments {{of this kind}} care must be had that the Light be {{sufficiently}} homogeneal. For if Bodies be illuminated by the ordinary prismatick Colours, they will appear neither of their own Day-light Colours, nor of the Colour of the Light cast on them, but of some middle Colour between both, as I have found by Experience. Thus <b>red</b> <b>Lead</b> (for instance) illuminated with the ordinary prismatick green will not appear either red or green, but orange or yellow, or between yellow and green, accordingly as the green Light by which 'tis illuminated {{is more or less}} compounded. For because <b>red</b> <b>Lead</b> appears <b>red</b> when illuminated with white Light, wherein all sorts of Rays are equally mix'd, and in the green Light all sorts of Rays are not equally mix'd, the Excess of the yellow-making, green-making and blue-making Rays in the incident green Light, will cause those Rays to abound so much in the reflected Light, as to draw the Colour from red towards their Colour. And because the <b>red</b> <b>Lead</b> reflects the red-making Rays most copiously in proportion to their number, and next after them the orange-making and yellow-making Rays; these Rays in the reflected Light will be more in proportion to the Light {{than they were in the}} incident green Light, and thereby will draw the reflected Light from green towards their Colour. And therefore the <b>red</b> <b>Lead</b> will appear neither red nor green, but of a Colour between both.|$|R
40|$|Red lead, a {{semiconductor}} pigment used {{by artists}} since antiquity, {{is known to}} undergo several discoloration phenomena. These transformations are either described as darkening of the pigment caused by the formation of either plattnerite (β-PbO 2) or galena (PbS) or as whitening by which <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> is converted into anglesite (PbSO 4) or (hydro) cerussite (2 [*]PbCO 3 ⋅Pb(OH) 2; PbCO 3). X-ray powder diffraction tomography, a powerful analytical method that allows visualization of the internal distribution of different crystalline compounds in complex samples, was used to investigate a microscopic paint sample from a Van Gogh painting. A very rare lead mineral, plumbonacrite (3 [*]PbCO 3 ⋅ Pb(OH) 2 ⋅PbO), was revealed to be present. This is the first reported occurrence of this compound in a painting dating from before the mid 20 th century. It constitutes the missing link between {{on the one hand}} the photoinduced reduction of <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> {{and on the other hand}} (hydro) cerussite, and thus sheds new light on the whitening of <b>red</b> <b>lead...</b>|$|R

50|$|During the Roman Empire, {{the term}} minium could refer {{either to the}} pigment made from ground {{cinnabar}} or to the less expensive <b>red</b> <b>lead.</b> The name came from the river Minius in Iberia (now forming part of the Spanish-Portuguese border and known as Miño or Minho), located near the main Roman cinnabar mines.

The minium of <b>red</b> <b>lead</b> was easy to make and less expensive than the pigment made from the mineral cinnabar, and it was bright and cheerful, so it became the most commonly used bright red in Medieval painting until the introduction of vermilion.|$|R
