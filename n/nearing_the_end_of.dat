This action required many of the same safety requirements as in the Atlantic, but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential subjects.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge was}} built because the {{previous}} bridge, built in 1956, was <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> its life span.

The new bridge was designed, unlike its predecessor, without large, overhead steel arches, {{because it would have}} been twice as costly to build. The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907.|$|E
5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E

5|$|In February 2003, the PL {{board of}} {{directors}} agreed to reintroduce a playoff system {{to be used for}} the 2004 NPB season. If a first-place team had a substantial lead in the standings <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the regular season, there was no pennant (league champion) race and little excitement until the Japan Series began. The decision to add a PL playoff was an attempt to rectify this problem and increase the league's popularity. The new postseason plan initiated a two-stage playoff in which the top three PL teams competed. In the First Stage, the teams that finished the newly shortened, 135-game regular season with the second- and third-best records played each other in a best-of-three series. The winner of this series faced the league's top finisher in the second final stage. The Final Stage winner advanced to the Japan Series, where they competed against the CL's Climax Series champion team.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> her term as {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{announced her}} intent {{to run for}} governor in 1983. Her opponents for the Democratic nomination included Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane and Grady Stumbo, the former secretary of the state's Department of Human Resources. Collins had the support of many leaders in the Democratic Party, but just before the primary, Governor Brown endorsed Stumbo, charging that both Sloane and Collins would use their gubernatorial appointment power to dispense party patronage. Although this was a common practice at the time, Brown notably shunned it during his term. With 223,692 votes, Collins edged out Sloane (219,160 votes) and Stumbo (199,795 votes) to secure the nomination. Sloane asked for a recanvass of the ballots, but ultimately decided it would not change the outcome and conceded defeat.|$|E
