2500|$|On 4 September 2014, the Army {{issued a}} <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention</b> {{to buy up}} to 155 EC145/UH-72s as a {{training}} platform [...] "on an other than full and open competitive basis". AgustaWestland launched a judicial bid to have the acquisition declared illegal, having claimed at a hearing that the EC145 did not offer the best value for the money and that its [...] "restricted flight maneuver envelope" [...] impeded its use for training. Airbus defended the Army's position, noting their previous selection of the EC145, claiming AgustaWestland's figures of EC145 costs were exaggerated, {{and that it was}} already in use in training roles. Bell Helicopter also criticized the decision, but did not take legal action. [...] On 14 October 2014, a Federal Claims Court issued a temporary order denying the US government's challenge of AgustaWestland's action until the Army issues a final justification and approval (J) to sole-source the procurement. The Army contended that the UH-72A falls under the 2006 LUH contract, and so not requiring a new J, effectively nullifying the court challenge. The court sided with AugustaWestland, rejecting the Army's J, and halted procurement of UH-72s for training after finding that the Army had exaggerated the costs and time required for acquiring a training helicopter. They also found negligence in their initial acquisition process of the UH-72 that effectively tied them to Airbus for the airframe's serviceable life. The court ordered the Army to either conduct a procurement for new training helicopters or stop buying UH-72 trainers. The Army is appealing the decision.|$|E

6000|$|But, {{these are}} small oases, and I am soon back again in {{metropolitan}} Arcadia. It is my impression {{that much of}} its serene and peaceful character is attributable {{to the absence of}} customary Talk. How do I know but there may be subtle influences in Talk, to vex the souls of men who don't hear it? How do I know but that Talk, five, ten, twenty miles off, may get into the air and disagree with me? If I rise from my bed, vaguely troubled and wearied and sick of my life, in the session of Parliament, who shall say that my noble friend, my right reverend friend, my right honourable friend, my honourable friend, my honourable and learned friend, or my honourable and gallant friend, may not be responsible for that effect upon my nervous system? Too much Ozone in the air, I am informed and fully believe (though I {{have no idea what it}} is), would affect me in a marvellously disagreeable way; why may not too much Talk? I don't see or hear the Ozone; I don't see or hear the Talk. And there is so much Talk; so much too much; such loud cry, and such scant supply of wool; such a deal of fleecing, and so little fleece! Hence, in the Arcadian season, I find it a delicious triumph to walk down to deserted Westminster, and see the Courts shut up; to walk a little further and see the Two Houses shut up; to stand in the Abbey Yard, like the New Zealander of the grand English History (concerning which unfortunate man, a whole rookery of mares' nests is generally being discovered), and gloat upon the ruins of Talk. Returning to my primitive solitude and lying down to sleep, my grateful heart expands with the consciousness that there is no adjourned Debate, no ministerial explanation, nobody to give <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention</b> to ask the noble Lord at the head of her Majesty's Government five-and-twenty bootless questions in one, no term time with legal argument, no Nisi Prius with eloquent appeal to British Jury; that the air will to-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, remain untroubled by this superabundant generating of Talk. In a minor degree it is a delicious triumph to me to go into the club, and see the carpets up, and the Bores and the other dust dispersed to the four winds. Again, New Zealander-like, I stand on the cold hearth, and say in the solitude, 'Here I watched Bore A 1, with voice always mysteriously low and head always mysteriously drooped, whispering political secrets into the ears of Adam's confiding children. Accursed be his memory for ever and a day!' ...|$|E
