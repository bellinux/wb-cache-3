The death of Mallaby incited instant reaction in the Allied army because they knew Mallaby was on a <b>non-combat</b> <b>mission</b> that day.

Commander P.A. [...] "Tony" [...] Lilly was in commmand. Assigned to TF 77—the fast carrier force operating in the Sea of Japan—Uhlmann resumed the screening and plane guard duties which had occupied {{much of her time}} in World War II. She later joined TF 95, a blockade and escort force, and carried out day and night bombardment of the Korean coast. While conducting a routine observation patrol off Wonsan Harbor's Hodo Peninsula on the morning of 20 August, the destroyer came under fire from seven enemy shore batteries. Gun flashes on the beach provided a warning only moments before shells began to fall 1,000 yd from the destroyer. All hands went quickly to battle stations as Uhlmann commenced evasive maneuvers, increased to flank speed, and opened fire on the shore installations. In short order, she reduced the enemy on shore to two guns, while she steamed among near misses, some of which came as close as 15 yd. Fragments from the shell explosions carried away a radio antenna during the half hour engagement. Ordered by TG 95.2 to break off the action, Uhlmann withdrew out of range of the shore batteries. Commander Lilly was awarded the Bronze Star with combat [...] "V" [...] for [...] "inflicting extensive damage upon the enemy" [...] and contributing [...] "immeasurably {{to the success of the}} siege of Wonsan". Lilly recalled another <b>non-combat</b> <b>mission.</b> [...] "We had one espionage mission.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the twenty-first century}} non-combat activities of China's armed forces as defined in a 2009 official release titled "Building Non-Combat Military Operation Ability” 1 {{in order to understand}} the historical development, domestic drivers and broader implications of China's contemporary <b>non-combat</b> <b>missions.</b> The paper focuses primarily on disaster relief and domestic stability maintenance, two types of operations that are ideal for examining how the internal drivers of <b>non-combat</b> <b>missions</b> are manifested in practice. Both Chinese and Western PLA analysts frequently view non-combat activities primarily as a component of China's growing international military presence rather than analyzing the domestic scope and causes of these operations. Indeed, participation in international <b>non-combat</b> <b>missions</b> allows China's armed forces to achieve unprecedented operational experience outside of China's immediate periphery and has also helped enhance China's international soft power. This thesis, however, demonstrates that People's Liberation Army (PLA) and People's Armed Police (PAP) twenty-first century <b>non-combat</b> <b>missions</b> are chiefly designed to achieve domestic goals. These include maintaining regime stability, balancing complex civil-military relations, and preserving the PLA's image as an army "serving the people” amid complex internal and external national security environments. I argue that an "outward-looking" approach focused on the international ramifications of PLA and PAP non-combat operations is insufficient to fully understand these missions, and it can potentially distort our view of China's broader military development. As vital conduits for bolstering CCP regime stability, Chinese civil-military relations and the PLA's image as a people-centric force, China's twenty-first century domestic non-combat operations, driven by internal security challenges arising from socioeconomic, military and historical developments in post-reform China, will likely continue to grow in importance and scope as these trends persist and intensify, thereby ensuring that the military retains a prominent role in China. As a result, twenty-first century non-combat operations have the potential to impede outward Chinese military development rather than simply expand Chinese interests abroad as more resources are needed to pursue internal security objectives...|$|R

50|$|The Marine Corps {{relies on}} the Navy for sealift to provide its rapid {{deployment}} capabilities. In addition to basing {{a third of the}} Fleet Marine Force in Japan, Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) are typically stationed at sea so they can function as first responders to international incidents. The United States Army maintains light infantry units capable of rapid worldwide deployment, but those units do not match the combined-arms integration of an MAGTF and lack the logistics that the Navy provides. Therefore, the Marine Corps is often assigned to <b>non-combat</b> <b>missions</b> such as the evacuation of Americans from unstable countries and providing humanitarian relief during natural disasters. In larger conflicts, Marines act as a stopgap, to get into and hold an area until larger units can be mobilized. The Corps performed this role in World War I and the Korean War, where Marines were the first significant combat units deployed from the United States and held the line until the country could mobilize for war. To aid rapid deployment, the Maritime Pre-Positioning System was developed: fleets of container ships are positioned throughout the world with enough equipment and supplies for a Marine Expeditionary Force to deploy for 30 days.|$|R
