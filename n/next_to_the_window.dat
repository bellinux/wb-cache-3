Both died early June 8, 2005, from serious internal injuries suffered in the first explosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{feature of this}} gallery is a large picture window and view of an outdoor mound. Sculptures of a Calusa family stand on the mound next to a palm-thatched house, suggesting that the visitor is looking outside and into the past. Inside, interpretive panels discuss mounds and Calusa town plans. <b>Next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> an interactive model shows a cutaway view of a mound and explains archaeologists' methods of interpreting the past.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Fish began making small {{paintings}} {{of objects in}} her immediate environment generally showing a section rather than the entire unit. These subjects included part of a brick wall, the winter sky seen through a window, hexagonal tiles on a bathroom floor, and tar paper siding on a neighboring building. A reviewer said, [...] "There is something comforting, and charismatically fascinating in staring at these familiar patterns." [...] Of this new work she said, [...] "I encounter the subjects continually so they become extremely familiar, though I don't work from observation. I don't place the canvas <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and paint what's outside. I don't look at the subject and paint at the same time. So there's memory and recollection in the work, but time is telescoped." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters {{took several}} shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel, {{but only the}} shot of Tank Man {{climbing}} the tank was chosen. It was not until several hours later that {{the photo of the}} man {{standing in front of the}} tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Wah's negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A [...] "foreign" [...] photographer accompanying him suddenly said, [...] "I am not gonna die for your country," [...] and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.|$|E
2500|$|The south {{elevation}} {{is dominated}} by a side porch covered by an open lattice beam pergola which runs {{the entire length of}} the building. [...] The front of the side porch is bordered by a lava stone wall that matches the front porch. [...] The lattice beams are supported by seven lava stone columns. [...] Starting near the southwestern corner, there are double casement windows bordered by wood-molding frames. [...] The windows are separated by wide mullions with a header sill above. [...] <b>Next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> group, there is a single wooden door that has been sealed closed. [...] Then there is group of six bay windows. [...] The main side entrance is a wooden door with a large glass panel insert. [...] The door is flanked on both sides by five-pane sidelight windows in wooden frames. [...] East of the entrance are three casement windows with diamond-obelisk art glass in wooden frames. [...] A second floor dormer is centered in the middle of the south façade.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{starts with}} an acting {{sequence}} in which JoJo confronts her boyfriend David, played by junior defender Mike Zaher, after she spots {{him at a}} house party flirting with another girl, with a drink in his hand. In the dramatic opening scene, JoJo is very upset. The couple talk and David finally invites JoJo to an important soccer game for his team. As the video progresses, JoJo sings <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in her room. She walks around the room looking at photos, reminiscing about the time they spent together and how generally ungrateful he was. These shots are intercut with David playing at the important soccer game. In the video's finale, rain begins to pour on the game. We see JoJo taking down photographs of the couple and picking up a stuffed animal that David had bought her in happier times. She takes it outside and throws it in the garbage can. It is raining, proving {{that this is the}} same moment as the game and she has chosen not to attend. David's team is down one goal with 2:14 seconds remaining in the second half. As he makes the shot for the home team, JoJo sings in the rain. He is not quick enough, failing to score the tying goal and the game ends, suggesting that JoJo's absence from the game has had an unfavourable effect on his performance. The video ends with the camera zooming out and panning away from JoJo's window as the rain subsides. Noticeable in the video is a poster for the Rockcorps Boost Mobile concert at Radio City Music Hall on September 24, 2005, an ad for Q-Tip's single [...] "For the Nasty", and the book [...] "Riding on a Blue Note: Jazz and American Pop" [...] by Gary Giddins, which she is reading on top of the car at the game. The fountain in front of the Universal City Hard Rock Cafe is also visible.|$|E
50|$|Jeff - Jeff's {{installation}} {{is going}} swimmingly until Jeff and Fred decide to screw their window into their shim (which would cause <b>the</b> shim <b>to</b> split). Then, Fred, {{believing that the}} screws that came into <b>the</b> <b>window</b> were too small (due <b>to</b> believing that <b>the</b> screws should be flush with <b>the</b> <b>window's</b> inside frame - and hence the predrilled holes are too big), proceeds <b>to</b> void <b>the</b> <b>window's</b> warranty by drilling holes <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window's</b> predrilled holes. When informed by Andrew of Fred's mistake, though, they do manage to finish.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, {{the show}} had a massive revamp, with the rocket and flower clocks and <b>the</b> three <b>windows</b> put in storage {{in favour of}} a newer style Play School. The main clock was now simply called the Play School Clock, which was {{controlled}} {{by one of the}} presenters standing {{at the top of the}} clock and turning a winding device, which caused <b>the</b> clue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> story <b>to</b> slide down a slippery dip. That was soon replaced by the Hickory Dickory Clock which featured clockwork resembling the [...] "Hickory Dickory" [...] nursery rhyme. That was soon replaced by the Train Clock which resembles a train station with a clock above it. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> were also heavily changed. They were now built into a massive rotating prop which was built underneath the clock (shown one week) and 'controlled' by one of the presenters pulling a lever back and forwards. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> (now including a diamond window) would spin around and would slowly be eliminated as <b>the</b> <b>window</b> they would look through until they got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fourth <b>window</b> and <b>the</b> camera would slowly zoom in and fade out into the fill. The order in which they appear is Square~Diamond~Round~Arched~Square. That was soon replaced by windows with animation where Jemima stands <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> round <b>window,</b> Little Ted stands <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> square <b>window,</b> Big Ted stands <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diamond <b>window</b> and Humpty stands <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arched <b>window</b> and <b>the</b> <b>window</b> chosen goes through to pre-recorded footage.|$|R

60|$|He went <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> The {{night was}} black, {{and he could}} see nothing from it. The rain still pattered heavily against the glass. He inferred, from hearing it, that the window was {{at the back of the}} house, remembering that the front was {{sheltered}} from the weather by the court and the buildings over it.|$|E
60|$|They {{had barely}} {{time to take}} their seats. As my place was <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> I felt bound to help the porter hand in the small packages. The man Delora, who was {{wrapped up in a}} fur coat, and who looked ghastly ill, thanked me courteously enough, but the girl ignored my assistance. They took the two corner seats at the further end of the carriage. Delora {{immediately}} composed himself to sleep.|$|E
60|$|They {{then went}} into the third-class waiting room, and sat down. There were a good many peasants, and others there; and when the doors opened {{for them to go}} on to the platform, and enter the {{carriage}}s, they saw it was hopeless to try and get a carriage to themselves. They did, therefore, the best they could; putting Tim <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> while Percy sat next to, and Ralph opposite to him. The rest of the compartment was filled with country people.|$|E
25|$|Modern window {{units with}} IG {{typically}} completely replace the older double-hung unit, and include other improvements such as better sealing between {{the upper and}} lower windows, and spring-operated weight balancing that removes the need for large hanging weights inside <b>the</b> wall <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> allowing for more insulation around <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and reducing air leakage, provides robust protection against the sun and will keep the house cool in the hot summer and warm in winter. These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>to</b> swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of <b>the</b> IG <b>window</b> from inside <b>the</b> building.|$|R
50|$|On {{the east}} (main) elevation, the facade {{is divided into}} three pavilions by {{abstracted}} pilasters. The upper five floors rest on a two-story piano nobile crested by an ornamental string course. Carved eagles perch above the main entry doors at the north and south. The facade of the third through seventh floors is divided into ten bays of <b>windows,</b> with <b>the</b> first and tenth bays being above the north and south entries. <b>The</b> end <b>window</b> bays are flanked by incised pilasters. Between the pilasters and above <b>the</b> <b>window</b> bays are incised panels with a carved U.S. shield in the center. The pilasters dividing the central bays are incised at <b>the</b> inside <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> Limestone mutules support a simple cornice. The roof is red clay tile.|$|R
50|$|ER-2 and ER-9 trains {{contain an}} even number of cars; of each {{adjacent}} pair, one {{is equipped with}} motors and the other carries pneumatic equipment. Cars with cabs carry pneumatic equipment, and motor cars are easily recognizable because of pantographs on their roofs. Not every car is equipped with toilets; on some trains there are as few as two per train, near the driver's cab. Each car has four automatic doors, two on each side. When the train stops, doors on the platform side open simultaneously. Doors may be equipped with stairs, to allow for low station platforms. The doors are narrower than in metro trains. An elektrichka is bare-bones transportation with simple benches (each seating three) <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
60|$|It will {{be remembered}} that Mr. Slope, when leaving his billet-doux {{at the house of}} Mrs. Bold, had been {{informed}} that it would be sent out to her at Plumstead that afternoon. The archdeacon and Mr. Harding had in fact come into town together in the brougham, and it had been arranged that they should call for Eleanor's parcels as they left on their way home. Accordingly they did so call, and the maid, as she handed to the coachman a small basket and large bundle carefully and neatly packed, gave in at the carriage window Mr. Slope's epistle. The archdeacon, who was sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> took it and immediately recognized the hand-writing of his enemy.|$|E

40|$|The towers that paint Montrealis skyline are {{relics of}} the 20 th century. Towers that express {{the power of}} capital on the outside {{turn out to be}} almost empty from within.

I {{remember}} an attorney working in one of those skyscrapers telling me “the <b>windows</b> are for <b>the</b> lawyers and here in the dark open space is where you can find the slaves. ” His words took my imagination to think of a boat in the ancient times where slaves where rowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rhythm of the drums. But then I realized the contradiction here - I told him “you should place your “slaves” <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> if you want {{them to be able to}} row and bring your boat to safe land. ...|$|R
50|$|The library {{corner is}} in the quiet corner {{opposite}} the entrance.

50|$|The capital {{above the}} pulpit with its four heads of angels is more delicately {{executed}} {{than the rest}} {{and is the only}} one on which figures appear. Carvings of the symbols of the four Evangelists - man, lion, ox and eagle - can be seen in <b>the</b> chancel <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of Saints Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which flank St Thomas and St Paul in the two central lancets and there is finely carved tracery on the wall panels {{as well as on the}} oak altar. The stone pulpit is fairly heavy in style but elaborately ornamented. Attractive original wrought iron light fittings are still in use in the nave. Eight modern roundels on <b>the</b> chancel wall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left and right of the altar are symbolic representations of aspects of the Holy Communion.|$|R
50|$|Some window {{managers}} {{display a}} small icon in the titlebar that may {{vary according to}} the application on which it appears.
