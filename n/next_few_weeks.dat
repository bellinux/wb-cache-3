40|$|We prove {{a version}} of the Cohen [...] Lenstra {{conjecture}} over function fields (completing the results of our prior paper). This is deduced from two more general theorems, one topological, one arithmetic: We compute the direct limit of homology, over puncture-stabilization, of spaces of maps from a punctured manifold to a fixed target; and we compute the Galois action on the set of stable components of Hurwitz schemes. Comment: This article has been temporarily withdrawn owing to a gap which affects Section 6, 12 and some theorems of the introduction: the homological stabilization maps used in this paper and the previous paper are not exactly the same. We have been able to fix this under additional restrictions, although not in general. A modified version will be posted in the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>week...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{internal}} {{disputes between}} the McMahons led to Linda McMahon {{being in a}} comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who {{took the opportunity to}} have a public affair with Trish Stratus. McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out.

He said that such ads were indecent and should be prohibited on radio and television between the hours of 6am and 10pm, in accordance with Federal Communications Commission policy. Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held a town hall meeting on the issue of health care at South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police.

In addition to delivering {{the troops and}} their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling {{the approach of the}} transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on 14 October that heavily damaged the airfield's runways, destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most of the available aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
40|$|Steps {{taken in}} the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> days and <b>weeks</b> will decisively shape the post-Qaddafi order. As Libyans prepare for the Qaddafi regime’s {{imminent}} demise, the country faces a pivotal moment of historic proportions. Steps {{taken in the}} <b>next</b> <b>few</b> days and <b>weeks</b> will decisively shape the post-Qaddafi order. The new, still nascent, Libyan leadership, faces a dual, difficult legacy which it will need to overcome: four decades of an autocratic regime that failed to build genuine state institutions and six months {{of a civil war}} that, together with inevitable human and material losses, exposed old divisions and fissures while prompting new ones. The challenge for that leadership, as well as for international actors who enabled its drive into Tripoli, is threefold: to establish a broadly inclusive and representative transitional governing body; address immediate security risks; and find an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, the search for accountability and justice and, on the other, the imperative of avoiding arbitrary score-settling and revenge.

30|$|Irrespective {{of storage}} conditions, {{the rates of}} {{respiratory}} CO 2 release of log sections remained high {{during the first two}} weeks post harvest and declined rapidly within the <b>next</b> a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> as logs become dehydrated. A logical recommendation for the forestry industry would be to apply fumigation treatments after 4 – 6 weeks post harvest to reduce the interference with insecticides. The respiration rate increased nearly 50 % for every 10 °C increase in temperature so the CO 2 issue is exacerbated during the warm summer months when a temperature-driven stimulation of respiratory processes will result in very high CO 2 concentrations in ship holds. Also, because respiratory processes are strongly dependent on moisture availability, any actions that can be taken to accelerate moisture loss will mitigate the CO 2 issue.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Newcastle United were linked with a £6 million bid for Brown, as a {{replacement}} for their outgoing captain Kevin Nolan. Brown stated {{that he did not want}} to leave Celtic and that he felt privileged to be the captain. He also said that he wanted to sign a new contract as his current deal was to expire at the end of the season. Internazionale and Juventus were also reportedly looking to sign him on a free transfer if he did not sign a new contract. After protracted talks, Brown announced on 29 August that he was to sign a new contract in the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> Due to his SPL suspension incurred at the end of the 2010–11 season, Brown's first match of the new campaign was Scotland's 2–1 win over Denmark on 10 August. He suffered an ankle injury in this match, but played in the next five games for Celtic and the next international match. He missed Celtic's 4–0 win over Motherwell, on 10 September, due to the injury and then the 2–0 loss to Atlético Madrid five days later.|$|E

5000|$|Venizelos was a Greek liberal {{politician}} {{who served as}} Prime Minister several times between 1910 and 1933. In World War I, Venizelos tried to bring Greece into the war on the Allied side, causing a clash with King Constantine I and hence leading to the National Schism between supporters of the King and the Prime Minister. In 1915, Venizelos stated {{in an interview with}} a British journalist: [...] "Whatever happens within the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> critical <b>weeks,</b> let England never forget that Greece is with her, heart and soul, remembering her past acts of friendship in times of no less difficulty, and looking forward to abiding union in days to come." [...] Venizelos's willingness to defy the King and to have Greece fight on the Allied state was due in part to his Anglophilia as he genuinely believed that Britain had much to teach the Greeks, leading him to help found the Anglo-Hellenic Educational Foundation in 1918 {{while at the same time}} believing an alliance with the British Empire would allow the Greeks to finally achieve the Megali Idea (the [...] "Great Idea" [...] i.e. bringing the Greeks of Anatolia living under Ottoman rule into the Kingdom of Greece).|$|R

5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E
5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Cardinal de Bernis {{entered the}} {{conclave}} {{at the end}} of March and took the leadership of the anti-Jesuit faction from the hands of Cardinal Orsini, who could have blocked Zelanti’s actions only with the great difficulties. Bernis immediately established a regular correspondence with French ambassador Marquis d'Aubeterre, which was in violation of the fundamental law of the conclave. Ambassadors of France and Spain urged Bernis to insist that the election of the future pope be made to depend on his written engagement to suppress the Jesuits. Bernis refused, answering that demanding from the future pope a written or oral promise to destroy the Society of Jesus would be in violation of the canon law. In spite of this refusal, during the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> Bernis consecutively rejected all candidates proposed by Zelanti as too devoted to the Jesuits. In this way twenty-three out of twenty-eight papabile were eliminated, among them strongly pro-Jesuit Cardinal Fantuzzi, who at some point was very close to achieving election to the papal throne, as well as Cavalchini, Colonna, Stoppani, Pozzobonelli, Sersale, and several others.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of the Browns drafting Clifford Charlton and Junkin's desire to move back inside, the Browns planned to move him back to inside linebacker for the 1988 season. He spent training camp competing with Eddie Johnson for the second inside linebacker position alongside Mike Johnson, {{and by the end of}} preseason play, Junkin had won the starting job. In his first career start against the Kansas City Chiefs, Junkin had six tackles, including the first one of the game in a 6–3 Browns win. A month later, Junkin injured his knee, and was forced to miss several games. He returned to the team in early November, but Johnson had played so well in Junkin's absence that he spent the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> as the backup inside linebacker.

On May 6, Arakawa and Lincoln met with Coleco and Universal in Los Angeles. Hadl reiterated his stance that Donkey Kong infringed Universal's rights to King Kong. Lincoln countered that Nintendo had discovered many unlicensed uses of King Kongs name and characters and that Universal's trademark on these was less than 10 years old. In private, Greenberg tried to persuade Nintendo to sign a licensing agreement; he had not told them that he had already done so. By the end of the meeting, Hadl agreed to send a chain of title to Nintendo regarding Universal's ownership of the King Kong name.
