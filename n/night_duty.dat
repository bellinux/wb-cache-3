In preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, his unit moved to Eichwalde in East Prussia.

25|$|The Toronto Police {{is one of}} the English-speaking world’s oldest modern {{municipal}} police departments; older than, for example, the New York City Police Department which was formed in 1845 or the Boston Police Department which was established in 1839. The London Metropolitan Police of 1829 is generally recognized as the first modern municipal department. In 1835, Toronto retained five full-time constables—a ratio of about one officer for every 1,850 citizens. Their daily pay was set at 5 shillings for day duty and 7 shillings, 6 pence, for <b>night</b> <b>duty.</b> In 1837 the constables’ annual pay was fixed at £75 per annum, a lucrative city position when compared to the mayor’s annual pay of £250 at the time.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{this thesis}} {{is to show}} {{different}} solutions for the staff scheduling in health services. There will be shown various issues that this special assignment problem brings. The text will describe solutions using mathematical modeling and one solution using heuristics. Solutions of the mathematical models are divided into two parts. The first part describes two models that address the assignment problem for <b>night</b> <b>duties</b> only. The second part describes two more models that address the assignment problem for the whole day. The models are compared with each other. Among other things, there are also described several possibilities how different models could be combined. Model example is calculated for the staff allocation on <b>night</b> <b>duties.</b> The example uses some of the conditions from the two models that solve this assignment problem...|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} Gurkha no.4 {{dress was}} adapted from the combat dress of their regular counterparts, and was {{also known as the}} night dress, as they were worn during <b>night</b> <b>duty.</b> They were also worn for civil security duty and training, as well as range practices at any time of the day. The long sleeves of the dark blue shirt was similarly rolled up and down depending on duty requirements and time of day, and was devoid of metal accoutrements. Junior officers wore their service numbers using white embroidered lettering on a dark blue Velcro backing fixed above their right breast pocket. Ranks were sewn on the right sleeves and made of embroidered, white cloth. The dark blue trousers were tucked into combat boots, and was topped by a dark blue beret.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} the prevalence and associated factors of burnout among nurses in a Nigerian general hospital. Methods. A total sampling method was utilized. Measurements. Burnout was evaluated using the Maslach Burnout Inventory; GHQ- 12 {{was used to}} determine the presence of psychiatric morbidity. Results. A high level of burnout was identified in 39. 1 % of the respondents in the area of emotional exhaustion (EE), 29. 2 % in the area of depersonalization and 40. 0 % in the area of reduced personal accomplishment. Multivariate analysis showed that doctor/nurse conflict (OR = 3. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 9 − 6. 3), inadequate nursing personnel (OR = 2. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 5 – 5. 1), and too frequent <b>night</b> <b>duties</b> (OR = 3. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 7 – 5. 6) were predictors of burnout in the area of EE, doctor/nurse conflict (OR = 3. 4, 95 % CI: 2. 2 – 7. 6) and too frequent <b>night</b> <b>duties</b> (OR = 2. 4, 95 % CI 1. 5 – 4. 8) in the area of D, high nursing hierarchy (OR = 2. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 5 – 4. 8), poor wages (OR = 2. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 6 – 5, 6), and too frequent <b>night</b> <b>duties</b> (OR = 2. 3, 95 % CI: 2. 3 – 4. 5) in the area of RPA. Conclusions. Prevalence of burnout among these nurses was high. The government therefore needs to look into factors that will enhance nurses' recruitment and retention for effective health care delivery system...|$|R
2500|$|Residencies are {{traditionally}} hospital-based, {{and in the}} middle of the twentieth century, residents would often live (or [...] "reside") in hospital-supplied housing. [...] "Call" [...] (<b>night</b> <b>duty</b> in the hospital) was sometimes as frequent as every second or third night for up to three years. Pay was minimal beyond room, board, and laundry services.

2500|$|Originally the Clydesdales were {{transport}}ed by train. Cross-country truck transport {{was introduced in}} 1940. Today, the traveling hitches {{are on the road}} at least 10 months every year, based out of St. Louis, Missouri, Merrimack, New Hampshire and Fort Collins, Colorado. At St. Louis, there are several tours that provide a visit to the Budweiser Clydesdale Paddock and Stables, The first Clydesdale hitch was based in Merrimack, New Hampshire, [...] and tours there today allow visitors to visit the Budweiser Clydesdales up close at the Clydesdale Hamlet. And Fort Collins is the home to the Clydesdales West Coast Team. When the horses are not touring, they can be seen as part of a tour and visitors can have a picture taken with them. There are ten horses that travel on each team. [...] Eight are in harness when performing at any one time and the other two horses provide alternates for the hitch as needed. Several professional handlers accompany each team. Often, one handler has <b>night</b> <b>duty</b> to provide round-the-clock care for the horses. Transportation for each hitch requires three 50-foot semis. Two carry the horses, the third transports a red, white and gold beer wagon and other equipment. The horses' comfort is enhanced with air-cushion suspension and thick rubber flooring, and cameras in the trailers enable the drivers to watch the horses during transport. The team stops each night at local stables.|$|E
