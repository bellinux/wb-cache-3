Many argue that the <b>Control</b> <b>Measures</b> were obsolete and Malaysia was going backwards. However, the critics began to change its viewpoint after one year of implementation of the <b>Control</b> <b>Measures.</b> There were many signs of recovery which have been observed and collected as evidences. Primary Research was done by using the questionnaire instrument and many people from different walks of life ranging from the entrepreneur, executives to ordinary people have given positive comments on the effectiveness of the <b>Control</b> <b>Measures.</b> In addition, Secondary Research was also carried out with the collection of local and foreign comments. These comments show favor for the <b>Control</b> <b>Measures.</b> In addition, many economic and financial indicators were collected and analyzed as evidences of supporting the effectiveness of the Selective <b>Control</b> <b>Measures.</b> The thesis was not prepared to favor any politician or any party of the Government.

A difference is made between Technical means which can be applied in installations and for the sealing of the soil surface and <b>Control</b> <b>measures</b> which {{can be divided into}} technical <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> and management <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> The findings of this survey are that the actually achieved level of soil protection depends on the combination of technical means and <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> This signifies that technical means and <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> cannot be considered separately. An evaluation of the different methods for soil protection can therefore only be made in a framework which allows for the comparison of the combinations of technical means and <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> Sources of emissions and their patterns are described as well as the adequate means and measures for soil protection. Risk-reducing design approaches and management methods are explained and some methods of risk-assessment are mentioned briefly. The report includes a recommendation to investigate the possibilities of defining a specified and quantitative level of soil protection by using risk-analysis. This approach should then be used for the evaluation of different combinations of technical means and <b>control</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

The nurse works with different patients and can therefore {{be a source of}} infection. The patients in the critical care units are especially susceptible to infections, because their immune systems are susceptible to diseases, surgical interventions, mal-nutrition, indwelling lines and -catheters. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the application of infection <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> in critical care units of a private hospital. Guidelines were developed to improve the application of infection <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> The purpose is attained by firstly the evaluation of the application of infection <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> by critical care nurses and secondly by determining if the structure of the critical care units facilitate the application of infection <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> This is done {{with the aid of a}} literature-based control list.

40|$|This study {{considered}} a simple SIR {{model for the}} spread of epidemics amongst holdings of a producer community in Northern Germany, based on the directed network of animal movements. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficiency of different <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> to reduce the epidemic size substantially. The currently applied <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> based on the distance to an infected holding were compared with the <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> based on the specific network-based centrality parameters. We found that network-based measures led to a more efficient control of epidemics with a much smaller number of removed holdings. To assess the impact of different holding types, the analysed <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> were implemented by both including and excluding these holding types. The comparison revealed a crucial role of multipliers in the spread of an epidemic. The network- based <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> depending on the removal by out-degree, outgoing infection chain, betweenness centrality and outgoing closeness centrality showed the best results: In the three-year network, on average, 2. 75, 4. 15, 3. 73 and 3. 43 times more holdings had to be removed by the <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> based on the 1, 3, 5 and 10 km radius to reduce the epidemic to the same size compared with the network-based <b>control</b> <b>measures.</b> In an area with a higher holding density, the improvement of the network-based <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> may become even more obvious. The removal of holdings based on the above-mentioned centrality parameters did thus not only rapidly decompose the network into fragments, but also reduced the epidemic size most efficiently...|$|R

The economic appraisal consists of an assessment (i. e. quantification and valuation) of the on-site and off-site impacts of soil erosion, and its mitigation, on ecosystem services. Many erosion <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> result in negative financial and economic returns. This explains why farmers are generally reluctant to implement erosion <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> without compensation.
