40|$|A case {{of primary}} intra{{pulmonary}} <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> with {{hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy}} and asbestosis is described. The essential histological features of this rare tumour are detailed, and the five authentic cases previously reported are reviewed. The pathogenesis of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy and its occurrence in this case are discussed. After surgical removal of the tumour recurrence appeared in the chest within six months. It responded poorly to radiotherapy, and death from metastases occurred 16 months after operation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Neurogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> {{is a rare}} tumour {{which has}} many synonyms, {{including}} neurofibrosarcoma, malignant Schwannoma, and malignant neurilemmoma. This diversity reflects the uncertainty regarding the cell of origin. Whilst {{it seems that the}} majority of neurogenic neoplasms, benign and malignant, are of Schwann cell origin, the possibility has been raised that they may be neurofibromatous. i. e., derived from perineural fibroblasts. An uncommitted attitude to the histogenesis of this group of tumours is adopted here by referring to them as neurogenic, either benign or sarcomatous...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{case report}} of a 46 years old female {{diagnosed}} to be neurofibroma arising from the left middle meatus. She underwent endoscopic sinus surgery {{and there is no}} recurrence till 3 months. A short review of literature is also presented. Keywords: Neurofibroma, middle meatus, endoscopic sinus surgery. Peripheral nerve sheath tumours are divided into neurofibroma, schwannoma and <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcoma.</b> Neurofibroma and Schwannoma are classified as benign and both are believed to arise from a common origin- the Schwann cell. 1 Though these neurogeni...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{affected}} by {{neurofibromatosis type 1}} (NF 1) are at higher risk of developing soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) than the general population. The clinical findings and outcome in 43 children and adolescents with NF 1 treated for STS in the Italian protocols between 1988 and 2004 are reported. METHODS: The study included 37 patients with <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcomas</b> (36 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors [MPNST], 1 triton tumor) and 6 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). The prevalence of NF 1 observed {{during the study period}} was 43...|$|R
40|$|Extract: Malignant {{peripheral}} nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) usually {{occur in the}} deep soft tissues in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF- 1) in association with or arising from a {{peripheral nerve}}, but MPNSTs may also occur in patients without evidence of NF- 1. MPNSTs used {{to be referred to}} as neurofibrosarcomas, <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> malignant schwannomas, and ‘‘Triton tumors’’ when heterologous mesenchymal elements such as rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, or osteosarcoma were present, but MPNST is now the preferred term. MPNSTs may also arise in the skin, and these neoplasms are referred to as cutaneous or superficial MPNSTs (SMPNSTs). MPNSTs, as a group, are rare, and SMPNSTs are even rarer...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} to Leu- 7 {{have been reported}} to recognize a constituent of myelin-associated glycoprotein. Because of this, the authors studied 20 cases of neurofibrosarcoma (NFS), 7 of leiomyosarcoma (LMS), 3 of fibrosarcoma (FS), 8 of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), 5 of monophasic spindle cell synovial sarcoma (MSS), 5 of neurilemmoma, and 5 of neurofibroma for Leu- 7 reactivity, to determine its utility in differential diagnosis. Selected examples of each tumor type were also studied ultrastructurally. Leu- 7 was compared with the expression of S- 100 protein, myelin basic protein, desmin, cytokeratin, and epithelial membrane antigen in the 43 neoplasms. Fifteen examples of NFS, 2 of LMS, and 2 of MSS were Leu- 7 +; 2 neurofibromas and 4 neurilemmomas also demonstrated reactivity with this antibody. In contrast, all cases of FS and MFH were Leu- 7 -. Synovial sarcomas could be effectively separated from NFS by reactivities for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen in the former, but not the latter, lesions. However, LMSs and NFSs demonstrated significant immunocytochemical overlap, including shared positivity for S- 100, desmin, and myelin basic protein in several cases. These results suggest that Leu- 7 has restricted utility in immunohistochemical diagnosis, and must be utilized only in concert with other antigens. Moreover, it would appear that in selected instances, smooth-muscle and <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcomas</b> must be separated on the basis of clinical, histopathologic, and ultrastructural features alone...|$|R
40|$|We had {{a patient}} who complained macroheamaturia, right dull dorsal pain and the tumor of the right lumbar region. After some {{examinations}} he was diagnosed clinically as renal tumor and his right kidney was removed. Pathologically the tumor was diagnosed as renal <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (malignant schwannoma) as based on the microscopic findings which was characterized by the palisading of nuclei and on the electroscopic finding which was characterized by the external lamina around the tumor cell membrane. In Japan since 1960, 152 cases of renal sarcoma was reported, but we could not find malignant schwannoma in them...|$|E
40|$|Malignant {{peripheral}} nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) also termed as spindle cell malignancy of the {{peripheral nerve}} Schwann cells or <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> represents approximately 10 &#x 0025; of all soft tissue sarcomas. This tumour is usually {{found in the}} lower extremities and only 10 - 12 &#x 0025; of all lesions occur {{in the head and}} neck region, which makes it a rare entity. The diagnosis of MPNST has been described as one of the most difficult and elusive diagnosis in the soft tissue diseases because of its non-specific presentation both clinically and histopathologically. This was overcome by the use of immunohistochemistry. A case of MPNST of the left maxillary antrum in a 45 -year -old male patient is reported...|$|E
40|$|The presentation, treatment, {{and outcome}} of 12 {{patients}} with high-grade <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (NS) of the extremity {{were compared with}} those of 21 patients with high-grade extremity soft-tissue sarcoma of nonneural origin in a retrospective study from January 1976 to January 1988. Pain and neurologic deficit were more common in the NS group. Limb-sparing surgery was carried out with equal frequency in both groups. Local recurrence was six times more frequent in the NS group at three-year follow-up (59 % vs 10 %). Width of resection margin was the dominant prognostic variable bearing on local control after limb-sparing surgery. Anatomic and functional constraints tended to limit resection margin in patients with NS arising from mixed motor-sensory or predominantly motor nerves...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} 70 monoclonal antibodies obtained from the Third International Workshop on Human Leukocyte Antigens (Oxford, 1986) to mark T lymphocytes in B 5 -fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. No staining occurred with 65 of the antibodies; however, 5 antibodies marked small lymphocytes in the T-cell areas of human tonsil. Two antibodies which strongly labeled lymphocytes, UCHL 1 and T 2 / 48, were used to examine 106 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 29 cases of Hodgkin's disease, {{and a variety of}} normal and neoplastic tissues. UCHL 1 and T 2 / 48 each marked 86 % (37 / 43) of B 5 -fixed T-cell lymphomas. Only 50 % of formalin-fixed T-cell lymphomas were marked with these antibodies. UCHL 1 marked 1. 8 % (1 / 56) of the B-cell lymphomas, compared with T 2 / 48, which marked 19. 6 % (11 / 56) of the B-cell lymphomas. T 2 / 48 had the interesting attribute of marking cells of the follicular mantle-zone and intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma, suggesting that the antibody recognizes a B-cell differentiation antigen. No Reed-Sternberg cells, epithelial neoplasms, <b>sarcomas,</b> <b>neurogenic</b> tumors, or normal nonlymphoid tissue were marked by either antibody. These antibodies successfully mark T cells in paraffin tissue sections and should aid in the investigation and characterization of abnormal lymphoid proliferations, "undifferentiated" malignant neoplasms, and immunologically mediated disorders...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-An {{analysis}} of chromosome aberrations in human tumors {{was performed in}} 29 cases of soft tissue sarcoma. The tumor tissues were disaggregated with collagenase and the cells cultured for 2 - 3 days. Analyzable metaphases were obtained in 15 cases, 4 of which showed only normal karyotypes. The remaining 11 tumors showed various numerical and structural abnormalities in their karyotypes: 8 tumors were near-diploid and the remaining 3 were near-triploid. G- and Q-banding analyses revealed clonal abnormalities in the 11 cases {{with the presence of}} marker chromosomes; 15 different chromosomes were involved in chro-mosome rearrangements, chromosomes 1 and 2 being the most frequently affected. Because of the heterogeneity of the tumor group investigated (<b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> 2 liposarcomas, neuro-fibrosarcoma, synovial cell sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, an...|$|E
40|$|DURING {{the last}} five years the authors have studied the electrophoretic {{patterns}} of the serum proteins from approximately 2, 000 patients who suf-fered from the wide variety of pathologic conditions encountered in general hospital practice. Throughout this period, interest has been directed to the clinical significance of protein moieties with abnormal electrophoretic mobil-ities, and within the last year, especial attention has been focused upon a component which migrates between alpha- 2 and beta globulins. Since there is confusion in the literature regarding the designation of abnormal serum proteins migrating between alpha- 2 and beta globulins, a chronologic resume of pertinent nomenclature is presented in table 1. In 1951 Bernfeld and co-workers 4 reported a protein with mobility midway between alpha- 2 and beta globulins in serum from a patient with <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> of the kidney. The authors designated this protein fraction "alpha- 3 globulin. " In 1953 Bernfeld and associates 5 reported "alpha- 3 " globulinemia in a case of rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Teratoma with a {{malignant}} somatic component (TMSC) is rare but described in adults, whereas information on pediatric presentation is sparse. PROCEDURE: The Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica identified 14 cases of TMSC. Clinical files and pathology specimens were reviewed. RESULTS: The series (9 female, 5 male) showed the following disease: testis (2), sacrococcygeal (3), ovary (3), retroperitoneum (3), mediastinum (2), and foot soft tissue (1). Distribution of the somatic component was: carcinoma (4), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (1), neuroblastoma (3), rhabdomyosarcoma (3), rhabdomyosarcoma plus liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, <b>neurogenic</b> <b>sarcoma</b> (1), chondrosarcoma plus neuroectodermal sarcoma (1), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (1). Three patients were in stage I, four in stage II, three in stage III, and four in stage IV. All but one patient underwent surgery and only females showed carcinoma components. Nine patients relapsed or progressed and eight died. Six patients {{are alive and}} disease-free. Two patients underwent complete resection and four were treated based on transformed histologies. Relapse-free and overall survival rates were 35. 7 % and 42. 8 %, respectively (median follow-up, 31 months). CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis for germ cell tumors (GCTs) containing MSC is worse than that for GCTs. The pediatric disease {{appears to be more}} heterogeneous in tumor site distribution and MSC histology than in adults. Our series suggests no effects of age, histology, or gender on outcome. Surgery has an essential role in localized disease, with complete resection highly desirable. Chemotherapy optimized for histology should include reagents directed to the somatic malignancy, if chemosensitive. Malignant GCT warrants GCT-directed chemotherapy...|$|E
