To determine the physical factors involved in bowel occlusion, we created an experimental model using New Zealand rabbits in acute experiments under general anaesthesia.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer suitable for multi-band transceivers is proposed. The multi-band PLL frequency synthesizer uses a switched tuning voltage- controlled oscillator (VCO) that covers a frequency range of 111 to 297 MHz with a low average conversion gain of 41. 71 MHZ/V. A key design feature of the multi-band PLL frequency synthesizer is that the VCO tuning switches are controlled only by the <b>normal</b> <b>loop</b> dynamics. No external control is needed for the synthesizer to switch to different bands of operation. The multi-band PLL frequency synthesizer is implemented in a standard 1. 2 []m CMOS technology using a 2. 7 V supply. The frequency synthesizer has a measured frequency range of 111 to 290 MHz with phase noise up to - 96 dBc/Hz at a 50 kHz carrier offset.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) in prospectively differentiating between fibrotic and active inflammatory small bowel stenosis in patients with Crohn′s disease (CD). Materials and Methods: A total of 111 patients with histologically proven CD presenting with clinical and plain radiographic signs of small bowel obstruction underwent coronal and axial MRI scans after oral administration of polyethylene glycol solution. A stenosis was judged present if a small bowel segment had > 80 % lumen reduction as compared to an adjacent <b>normal</b> <b>loop</b> and mural thickening of > 3 mm. At {{the level of the}} stenosis, both T 2 signal intensity and post-gadolinium T 1 enhancement were quantified using a 5 -point scale (0 : very low; 1 : low; 2 : moderate; 3 : high; and 4 : very high). A stenosis was considered fibrotic if the sum of the two values (activity score: AS) did not exceed 1. Results: A small bowel stenosis was identified in 48 out of 111 patients. Fibrosis was confirmed at histology in all of the 23 patients with AS of 0 or 1, who underwent surgery within 3 days of the MRI examination. In the remaining 25 patients (AS: 2 - 8), an active inflammatory stenosis was suspected and remission of the obstructive symptoms was obtained by means of medical treatment. One of these patients (AS: 2), however, underwent surgery after 14 days, due to recurrence. MRI had 95. 8 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity, and 97. 9 % accuracy in the diagnosis of fibrotic stenosis.

40|$|Spotify Radio {{allows users}} to find new music within Spotify’s vast back-catalogue, {{offering}} a potential infinite avenue of discovery. Nevertheless, the radio service has also been disliked and accused of playing the same artists over and over. We decided {{to set up an}} experiment with the purpose to explore the possible limitations found within "infinite archives" of music streaming services. Our hypothesis was that Spotify Radio appears to consist of an infinite series of songs. It claims to be personalised and never-ending, yet music seems to be delivered in limited loop patterns. What would such loop patterns look like? Are Spotify Radio’s music loops finite or infinite? How many tracks (or steps) does a <b>normal</b> <b>loop</b> consist of? To answer these research questions, at Umeå University’s digital humanities hub, Humlab, we set up an intervention using 160 bot listeners. Our bots were all Spotify Free users. They literally had no track record and were programmed to listen to different Swedish music from the 1970 s. All bots were to document all subsequent tracks played in the radio loop and (inter) act within the Spotify Web client as an obedient bot listener, a liker, a disliker, and a skipper. The article describes different research strategies when dealing with proprietary data. Foremost, however, it empirically recounts the radio looping interventions set up at Humlab. Essentially, the article suggests a set of methodologies for performing humanist inquiry on big data and black-boxed media services that increasingly provide key delivery mechanisms for cultural materials. Spotify serves as a case in point, yet principally any other platform or service could be studied in similar ways. Using bots as research informants can be deployed within a range of different digital scholarship, so this article appeals not only to media or software studies scholars, but also to digitally inclined cultural studies such as the digital humanities...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work from}} our {{laboratory}} identified several specific sites in Escherichia coli tRNAfMet {{that are essential}} for recognition of this tRNA by E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6. 1. 1. 10). Particularly strong evidence indicated a role for the nucleotide base at the wobble position of the anticodon in the discrimination process. To further investigate the structural requirements for recognition in this region, we have synthesized a series of tRNAfMet derivatives containing single base changes in each position of the anticodon. In addition, derivatives containing permuted sequences and larger and smaller anticodon loops have been prepared. The variant tRNAs have been enzymatically synthesized in vitro. The procedure involves excision of the normal anticodon, CAU, by limited digestion of intact tRNAfMet with pancreatic RNase. This step also removes two nucleotides from the 3 ' CpCpA end. T 4 RNA ligase is used to join oligonucleotides of defined length and sequence to the 5 ' half-molecule and subsequently to link the 3 ' and modified 5 ' fragment to regenerate the anticodon loop. The final step of the synthesis involves repair of the 3 ' terminus with tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. The synthetic derivative containing the anticodon CAU is aminoacylated with the same kinetics as intact tRNAfMet. Base substitutions in the wobble position reduce aminoacylation rates by at least five orders of magnitude. The rates of aminoacylation of derivatives having base substitutions {{in the other two}} positions of the anticodon are 1 / 55 to 1 / 18, 500 times normal. Nucleotides that have specific functional groups in common with the normal anticodon bases are better tolerated at each of these positions than those that do not. A tRNAfMet variant having a six-membered loop containing only the CA sequence of the anticodon is aminoacylated still more slowly, and a derivative containing a five-membered loop is not measurably active. The <b>normal</b> <b>loop</b> size can be increased by one nucleotide with a relatively small effect on the rate of aminoacylation, indicating that the spatial arrangement of the nucleotides is less critical than their chemical nature. We conclude from these data that recognition of tRNAfMet requires highly specific interactions of methionyl-tRNA synthetase with functional groups on the nucleotide bases of the anticodon sequence...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphogenetic}} {{process of}} cardiac looping transforms the straight heart tube into a curved tube that resembles {{the shape of}} the future four-chambered heart. Although great {{progress has been made in}} identifying the molecular and genetic factors involved in looping, the physical mechanisms that drive this process have remained poorly understood. Recent work, however, has shed new light on this complicated problem. After briefly reviewing the current state of knowledge, we propose a relatively comprehensive hypothesis for the mechanics of the first phase of looping, termed c-looping, as the straight heart tube deforms into a c-shaped tube. According to this hypothesis, differential hypertrophic growth in the myocardium supplies the main forces that cause the heart tube to bend ventrally, while regional growth and contraction in the omphalomesenteric veins (primitive atria) and compressive loads exerted by the splanchnopleuric membrane drive rightward torsion. A computational model based on realistic embryonic heart geometry is used to test this hypothesis. The behavior of the model is in reasonable agreement with available experimental data from control and perturbed embryos, offering support for our hypothesis. The results also suggest, however, that several other mechanisms contribute secondarily to <b>normal</b> <b>looping,</b> and we speculate that these mechanisms play backup roles when looping is perturbed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal {{fluctuations}} in Josephson junctions is usually analysed using the Ambegaokar-Halperin (AH) {{theory in the}} context of thermal activation. "Enhanced" fluctuations, demonstrated by broadening of current-voltage characteristics, have previously been found for proximity Josephson junctions. Here we report measurements of micron-scale <b>normal</b> metal <b>loops</b> contacted with thin superconducting electrodes, where the unconventional loop geometry enables tuning of the junction barrier with applied flux; for some geometries, the barrier can be effectively eliminated. Stronger fluctuations are observed when the flux threading the <b>normal</b> metal <b>loop</b> is near an odd half-integer flux quantum, and for devices with thinner superconducting electrodes. These findings suggest that the activation barrier, which is the Josephson coupling energy of the proximity junction, is different from that of conventional Josephson junctions. Simple one dimensional quasiclassical theory can predict the interference effect due to the loop structure, but the exact magnitude of the coupling energy cannot be computed without taking into account the details of the sample dimensions. In this way, the physics of this system is similar to the phase slipping process in thin superconducting wires. Besides shedding light on thermal fluctuations in proximity junctions, the findings here also demonstrate a new type of superconducting interference device with two normal branches sharing the same SN interface {{on both sides of the}} device, which has technical advantages for making symmetrical interference devices.

Thirty years ago it was shown that on a fixed sodium intake of 175 meq/d 36 of 100 unselected hypertensives, in whom PA has been excluded on contemporary criteria, had 24 hour urinary aldosterone levels above the upper limit of normotensive controls.
