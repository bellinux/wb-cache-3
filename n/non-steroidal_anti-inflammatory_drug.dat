25|$|When {{journalists and}} {{physicians}} began {{focusing on the}} narcotic contents of the patent medicines, some of their makers began replacing the opium tincture laudanum with acetanilide, a particularly toxic <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drug</b> with analgesic as well as antipyretic properties that had been introduced into medical practice under the name Antifebrin by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886. But this ingredient change probably killed more of the nostrum's users than the original narcotics did, since acetanilide not only caused an alarming cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia but was later discovered to cause liver and kidney damage.|$|E

40|$|Background Peptic ulcer {{etiology}} {{has been}} changing because of H. pylori decline. Objectives To estimate peptic ulcer prevalence in 10 years-interval {{and compare the}} association with H. pylori and use of <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs.</b> Methods Records assessment in two periods: A (1997 - 2000) and B (2007 - 2010), searching for peptic ulcer, H. pylori infection and <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> use. Results Peptic ulcer occurred in 30. 35 % in A and in 20. 19 % in B. H. pylori infection occurred in 73. 3 % cases in A and in 46. 4 % in B. <b>Non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> use was 3. 5 % in A and 13. 3 % in B. Neither condition occurred in 10. 4 % and 20. 5 % in A and B respectively. Comparing both periods, we observed reduction of peptic ulcer associated to H. pylori (P= 0. 000), increase of peptic ulcer related to <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> (P= 0. 000) and idiopathic peptic ulcer (P= 0. 002). The concurrent association of H. pylori and <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> was also higher in B (P= 0. 002). Rates of gastric ulcer were higher and duodenal ulcer lower in the second period. Conclusions After 10 years, the prevalence of peptic ulcer decreased, as well as ulcers related to H. pylori whereas ulcers associated to <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> increased. There was an inversion {{in the pattern of}} gastric and duodenal ulcer and a rise of idiopathic peptic ulcer...|$|R

2500|$|Horses form ulcers in {{the stomach}} fairly commonly, a disease called equine gastric ulcer syndrome. [...] Risk factors include confinement, {{infrequent}} feedings, {{a high proportion of}} concentrate feeds, such as grains, excessive <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drug</b> use, and the stress of shipping and showing. [...] Gastric ulceration has also been associated with the consumption of cantharidin beetles in alfalfa hay which are very caustic when chewed and ingested. [...] Most ulcers are treatable with medications that inhibit the acid producing cells of the stomach. Antacids are less effective in horses than in humans, because horses produce stomach acid almost constantly, while humans produce acid mainly when eating. Dietary management is critical.

2500|$|Both {{active and}} passive {{stretching}} exercises that include hip and knee extension {{should be the}} focus of the program. Stretching the hip into extension and limiting excessive knee flexion avoids placing the rectus femoris in a position of passive insufficiency, thereby maximizing the stretch to the iliopsoas tendon. Strengthening exercises for the hip flexors may also be an appropriate component of the program. A <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drug</b> regimen as well as activity modification or activity progression (or both) may be used. [...] Once symptoms have decreased a maintenance program of stretching and strengthening can be initiated. Light aerobic activity (warmup) followed by stretching and strengthening of the proper hamstring, hip flexors, and iliotibial band length is important for reducing recurrences.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} use of <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> and serious, acute non-infectious liver injury. DESIGN [...] Retrospective cohort study, cross over design. SETTING [...] Health records from provincial database in Saskatchewan, Canada, 1982 - 6. SUBJECTS [...] 228, 392 adults who contributed 645, 456 person years. All were either using or had used <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number and type of prescriptions for <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs.</b> Admission to hospital for newly diagnosed acute liver injury. RESULTS [...] There were 34 admissions to hospital; 16 among subjects currently using <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> and 18 among subjects who were not. The incidence rate among current users was 9 per 100, 000 person years (95 % confidence interval 6 to 15 per 100, 000 person years). Subjects currently using <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> had twice the risk of newly diagnosed liver injury as those not currently taking these drugs (rate ratio 2. 3; 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 to 4. 9) and an excess risk of 5 per 100, 000 person years. The age and sex adjusted risk ratio was 1. 7 (0. 8 to 3. 7). The strength of the association increased when only cases with no concomitant use of other hepatotoxic drugs were considered (4. 0; 0. 9 to 19. 0). The rate ratio for people having received one to nine prescriptions was constant. There was no increased risk with long duration of treatment (1. 0; 0. 3 to 3. 5). CONCLUSIONS [...] There is a small excess risk of serious, acute non-infectious liver injury {{associated with the use}} of <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: A 15 -fold {{increased}} risk of gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported with concurrent use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs.</b> Recent guidance cautions against concurrent prescription, particularly in older people. Aim: To quantify the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with current exposure to <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs,</b> selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and both drugs concurrently. Methods: We conducted a case-control analysis of 11 261 cases with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 53 156 controls matched by gender, age and general practice from computerized primary care data. We coupled this with self-controlled case series analysis. Results: Both drugs were associated with a twofold {{increased risk}} of gastrointestinal bleeding (odds ratio = 2. 38, 95 % confidence interval 2. 08 - 2. 72 for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and odds ratio = 2. 15, 95 % confidence interval 2. 02 - 2. 28 for <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs).</b> This increased risk was marginally higher for concurrent prescription (odds ratio = 2. 93, 95 %confidence interval 2. 25 - 3. 82). The self-controlled analysis showed a greater incidence rate ratio for gastrointestinal bleeding with <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> (2. 71, 95 % confidence interval 2. 51 - 2. 91) and lower incidence rate ratio with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (1. 71, 95 % confidence interval 1. 48 - 1. 98). The incidence rate ratio when both drugs were combined was 3. 25, 95 % confidence interval 1. 95 - 5. 42. Estimates were similar after restricting to people over 80 years of age. Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was not specifically related to class of <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> and was similar when we looked at tricyclic anti-depressants. Conclusions: Our study suggests {{that the risk of}} gastrointestinal bleeding is not substantially increased when <b>non-steroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>drugs</b> and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are prescribed together, compared with their use alone...|$|R
