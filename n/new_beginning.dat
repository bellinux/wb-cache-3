5|$|Another rematch from Wrestle Kingdom 9 was {{scheduled}} for February14 at NJPW The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> in Sendai between Togi Makabe and Tomohiro Ishii for the NEVER Openweight Championship. When Makabe was sidelined with influenza, NJPW stripped him of the title and scheduled another match, in which Ishii defeated Tomoaki Honma for the now-vacant title. Ishii and Makabe had their title rematch on April29, when Makabe regained the NEVER Openweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoes {{made their}} debuts for New Japan Pro Wrestling at Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome, teaming with Toru Yano in {{a victory over}} Bullet Club members Bad Luck Fale, Tama Tonga, and Yujiro Takahashi {{to become the first}} NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champions. Through their {{affiliation}} with Yano, the Briscoes also became part of the Chaos stable. The three made their first successful title defense the following day against another Bullet Club trio of Fale, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson. On February 11 at The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> in Osaka, the Briscoes and Yano lost the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship to Fale, Tonga and Takahashi in their second defense. The Briscoes and Yano regained the title three days later at The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> in Niigata. On February 20 at , the Briscoes and Yano lost the title to The Elite (Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks).|$|E
5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The Final Chapter because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A <b>New</b> <b>Beginning,</b> it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> as almost a direct sequel to The Final Chapter, did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The Final Chapter.|$|E

They lost it, however, {{in their first}} defense, to Johnny Kashmere and Justice Pain on July 28, 2001 at What About Lobo?

5|$|February's The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> tour {{featured}} Bullet Club defending both {{of their}} tag team championships and the re-ignition of a rivalry between Devitt and his former partner Ryusuke Taguchi, who returned from an eight-month injury break. Devitt dominated his encounters with Taguchi {{for most of the}} tour, including pinning him in his return eight-man tag team match on February 2, but at the tour ending event, The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> in Osaka, Taguchi pinned his former partner in a tag team match, where he teamed with Togi Makabe and Devitt with Fale. In March, Bad Luck Fale made it to the finals of the 2014 New Japan Cup, but was defeated there by Shinsuke Nakamura. As the one-year anniversary of the break-up of Apollo 55 approached, the rivalry between Devitt and Taguchi escalated, leading to Taguchi challenging his rival to a Loser Leaves Town match. The stipulation, however, was never made official for their April 6 Invasion Attack 2014 match. During the match, Devitt got into an argument with The Young Bucks, after the two repeatedly interfered in the match despite his orders not to do so. This led to The Young Bucks turning on Devitt, who responded by diving onto his Bullet Club stablemates. After Taguchi defeated Devitt, the two men shook hands, ending their rivalry with each other and Devitt's association with Bullet Club. Devitt's resignation from NJPW was announced the following day.|$|E
5|$|On February 11 at The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> in Osaka, Fale, Takahashi and Tonga {{defeated}} the Briscoes and Yano in a rematch {{to capture the}} NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Later that same event, The Young Bucks lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to Matt Sydal and Ricochet in a three-way match, also involving reDRagon. Three days later at The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> in Niigata, Fale, Takahashi and Tonga lost the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship back to the Briscoes and Yano. Also during the event, Anderson and Gallows received a rematch for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but were again defeated by Makabe and Honma, who were afterwards challenged by Tonga, who stated that his partner would be a new member of Bullet Club. In the main event of the show, Omega defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi to win the IWGP Intercontinental Championship, which had been vacated following Shinsuke Nakamura's departure from NJPW. On February 20 at , Anderson and Gallows wrestled their final NJPW match, an eight-man tag team match, where they, along with Fale and Tonga, were defeated by Bobby Fish, Hirooki Goto, Katsuyori Shibata and Kyle O'Reilly. Later that same event, Omega and The Young Bucks {{defeated the}} Briscoes and Yano to bring the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship back to Bullet Club, while also making Omega a double champion in the process.|$|E

5|$|Romeo Santos {{began his}} career as the lead member of Aventura, an urban bachata infused band. The band rose to {{popularity}} in the 2000s, has sold over 1.7 million albums in the U.S., and had the best-selling Latin album of 2009, The Last. Soon after the band's separation in early 2011, Santos signed a record deal with Sony Music Latin and Jive Records to record his debut solo album, Formula, Vol. 1. According to his manager Johnny Marines, the contract was worth US$10,000,000. Santos felt that the record was a continuation of his career rather than a <b>new</b> <b>beginning.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Second World War {{caused a}} drastic setback to the {{emerging}} breed, with {{the vast majority of}} breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of sixty dogs dropped to three during the 1940s. Following the war, just six dogs would survive as the <b>new</b> <b>beginning</b> from which all present-day Cavaliers descend. These dogs were Ann's Son, his litter brother Wizbang Timothy, Carlo of Ttiweh, Duce of Braemore, Kobba of Kuranda and Aristide of Ttiweh. The numbers increased gradually, and in 1945 the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Before Charles's restoration, the Navigation Acts of 1650 {{had hurt}} Dutch trade by giving English vessels a monopoly, and {{had started the}} First Dutch War (1652–1654). To lay {{foundations}} for a <b>new</b> <b>beginning,</b> envoys of the States General appeared in November 1660 with the Dutch Gift. The Second Dutch War (1665–1667) was started by English attempts to muscle in on Dutch possessions in Africa and North America. The conflict began well for the English, with the capture of New Amsterdam (renamed New York in honour of Charles's brother James, Duke of York) and a victory at the Battle of Lowestoft, but in 1667 the Dutch launched a surprise attack on England (the Raid on the Medway) when they sailed up the River Thames to where {{a major part of}} the English fleet was docked. Almost all of the ships were sunk except for the flagship, Royal Charles, which was taken back to the Netherlands as a trophy. The Second Dutch War ended with the signing of the Treaty of Breda.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{revealed}} to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth-century French fantasy literature, the film uses the conventions of the genre —that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts— and openly details these conventions. Marie and Adrienne's 'lives' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose, each with only {{the memory of her}} suicide and her last emotions remaining. Julien, like the audience, is eventually confronted with Marie's nightmare of repetition. Elements of the horror genre are used, not to scare but to explore memory and loss. To stay with Marie, Julien first has to forget about her, and at the end they have the promise of a <b>new</b> <b>beginning.</b> Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy. Marie's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death, and may reflect a fantasy of turning back the menopause. The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie, Our Day Will Come, that represents love as a pledge, the only music used in the film.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a <b>new</b> <b>beginning</b> and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|On January 5, 2017, Dragon Lee made a {{surprise}} return to NJPW, attacking Hiromu Takahashi (the former Kamaitachi) and Tetsuya Naito during their match against Kushida and Michael Elgin. Following the match, Dragon Lee posed with Takahashi's IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship belt. This led to Lee unsuccessfully challenging Takahashi {{for the title}} on February 11 at The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> in Osaka. The following May, Dragon Lee realized one of his goals in professional wrestling, when he was announced as {{a participant in the}} Best of the Super Juniors 24 tournament. In his opening match of the tournament on May 17, Dragon Lee handed rival Hiromu Takahashi his first singles loss since returning to Japan at the end of 2016. Dragon Lee finished the tournament on May 31 with a record of four wins and three losses, failing to advance to the finals. Dragon Lee returned to NJPW the following October, teaming with Titán in the 2017 Super Jr. Tag Tournament, from which they were eliminated in the first round by Bushi and Hiromu Takahashi.|$|E

The record symbolizes a <b>new</b> <b>beginning</b> for the band, incorporating new elements into their previous musical styles, including gothic rock, symphonic rock and pop music as well as the use of choirs on several songs. The writing process for the album took over 18 months to complete; most of the songs were written by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo, while production was handled by Dave Fortman.|$|E

The new confidence of this period can also be seen in infrastructure projects, of which the Forth Road Bridge (opened 1962) was a key example.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, Dorada {{returned}} to Japan {{to take part}} in the Fantastica Mania 2015 tour, during which he and Atlantis won the Fantastica Mania 2015 Tag Tournament. Dorada's participation in the tour was built around a rivalry with La Sombra, which culminated in a singles match between the two on January 19, where La Sombra was victorious. During the final event, Dorada announced he had signed a one-year contract with NJPW. After doing interviews suggesting the unification of his CMLL World Welterweight Championship and the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, Dorada entered the IWGP title picture by challenging reigning champion Kenny Omega on February 11 at The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning</b> in Osaka. He received his title shot on April 5 at Invasion Attack 2015, but was defeated by Omega. The following month, Dorada entered the 2015 Best of the Super Juniors. He finished third in his block with a record of five wins and two losses, failing to advance to the finals of the tournament. On December 19, Dorada lost the CMLL World Welterweight Championship to Bushi following outside interference from Bushi's Los Ingobernables de Japon stablemate Evil. He regained the title from Bushi on January 22, 2016, at Fantastica Mania 2016. Dorada's final match under his NJPW contract took place two days later.|$|E

5|$|In late 2007 {{following}} the band's Stadium Arcadium tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{went on a}} hiatus, with Kiedis citing exhaustion as the main reason. The band's hiatus lasted until October 2009 when they started to write and rehearse for their tenth album however absent from these rehearsals was Fruciante although present was the band's touring guitarist, Josh Klinghoffer leading many to speculate Frusciante had again left the band. Speculation proved to be true with Frusciante already having quit the band {{for a second time}} on July 29, 2009 however it wasn't until December 2009 in a post on his official website that he made his departure from the band official to the public. He stated that he left Red Hot Chili Peppers during the hiatus to focus on a solo career. Klinghoffer, who acted as a sideman during 2007 dates on the band's Stadium Arcadium tour and on John Frusciante's solo projects, joined the band on October 12, 2009; however, his membership was not announced until February 8, 2010. With Klinghoffer, the band saw this as a <b>new</b> <b>beginning</b> and in August 2011 they released their tenth-studio album, I'm with You. During this tour, the band added backing musicians, Mauro Refosco and Chris Warren (also Smith's drum technician) to their touring lineup.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, Devitt, Taguchi and Hirooki Goto {{won their}} second J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament {{in a row}} by {{defeating}} the team of Giant Bernard, Jushin Thunder Liger and Karl Anderson in the finals of the three-day-long tournament. On 24 July, Devitt received his rematch for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship at a DDT event, {{but was unable to}} regain the title from Ibushi. This led to a match on 14 August, where Apollo 55 successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against the Golden☆Lovers. On 11 September, Apollo 55 defeated Taichi and Taka Michinoku to make their seventh successful IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship defense, breaking the record for most defenses during a single reign. When Kota Ibushi was forced to vacate the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship after dislocating his left shoulder, Devitt, as the previous champion, was ushered into a decision match to determine a new champion. On 19 September, Devitt defeated Kushida to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time. On 10 October at Destruction '11, Devitt and Taguchi lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to the No Remorse Corps (Davey Richards and Rocky Romero). Devitt made the first successful title defense of his second IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship reign on 12 November at Power Struggle, defeating Taka Michinoku, and followed that up by defeating the man who had pinned him for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, Davey Richards, in his second defense on 4 December. On 23 December, Devitt defeated the other half of No Remorse Corps, Rocky Romero, to make his third IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship defense. On 4 January 2012 at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, Devitt and Taguchi defeated Richards and Romero to once again regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, starting Devitt's record-breaking sixth reign as one half of the champions. On 12 February at The <b>New</b> <b>Beginning,</b> Apollo 55 lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship back to the No Remorse Corps in their first defense.
