The northern-most and eastern-most points claimed by India are both in territory disputed between India and China.

5|$|Some authors like Boog and Lewin opine {{that while}} Creveld's {{statistics}} regarding the losses of supplies are <b>not</b> <b>wrong</b> {{and that the}} vast distances were a big problem, {{the failure of the}} seaborne supply lines was still a deciding factor because operationally effective supplies often failed to arrive at decisive moments of the campaigns. Douglas Austin points out that the overall port capacity at Tobruk and Benghazi was actually sufficient and that the recently published Enigma intercepts show that it was the bulk losses at sea (and not unloading or getting the supplies to forward areas) that had the greater impact on Rommel's decisions {{as well as those of}} other German commanders, like Kesselring. Levine dismisses poor port capacity and lack of transport vehicles as the Afrika Korps' crucial weaknesses, citing evidences gathered on British intelligence by Hinsley and Bennett. Others point out Rommel's dependence on captured resources as compensation for the unstable supply lines and unfulfilled promises (by 1942, 85% of his transport were captured vehicles). Butler opines that the myth of Rommel's bad logistical management is the result of rumours started by Halder.|$|E

25|$|The Rig Veda, in {{the tenth}} Mandala, {{contains}} a hymn {{in which they}} sing to each other. Yami proposes marriage to Yama but Yama flatly refuses as he considers it incest.

However, the hymns abruptly end, without the final outcome being known. In later version of the tale, they are depicted as the first human beings and it is conjectured that Yami was successful in becoming Yama’s wife.|$|E
25|$|Wat Phra Dhammakaya {{replied to}} {{the critics of}} the Cetiya {{building}} project that the building had begun before the crisis, when the economy was still booming; therefore, the timing was <b>not</b> <b>wrong.</b> The temple also raised examples of other important Thai building projects that had been realized during crises. Finally, the temple posed the question: if, despite the crisis, people were still buying alcohol and cigarettes and still going to the movies, then {{what was wrong with}} donating for a religious building? The temple also responded to its critics about the accusations of wealth, stating that the temple's wealth was used for the laypeople and Buddhist education, not for other purposes. Building large buildings benefited Buddhism as a whole, not just the temple, because it helped strengthen the religion. Apart from donating to hospitals or schools, financially supporting Buddhism should also be done, because it would help foster ethics in society.|$|E
25|$|The {{interests}} objection {{claims that}} what makes murder wrong {{is not just}} the deprivation of a valuable future, but the deprivation of a future that one has an interest in. The embryo has no conscious interest in its future, and so (the objection concludes) to kill it is <b>not</b> <b>wrong.</b> The defender of Marquis-style arguments may, however, give the counterexample of the suicidal teenager who takes no interest in his or her future, but killing whom is nonetheless wrong and murder. If the opponent responds that one can have an interest in one's future without taking an interest in it, then the defender of the Marquis-style argument can claim that this applies to the embryo. Similarly, if an opponent claims that what is crucial is having a valuable future which one would, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve (whether or not one does in fact desire to preserve it), then the defender may ask why the embryo would not, under ideal conditions, desire to preserve its future.|$|E

Just when he realizes that and moves to return he discovers a village being terrorized by a colddrake, a type of dragon. Before he can even think to do anything, he witnesses the dragon killing an elderly man. He pulls himself together and kills the dragon, but the unfortunate timing gives Vanyel the impression that he is a coward. The Tayledras later explain that he is not at all cowardly and that his reactions were normal.|$|E

[...] The reviewer judges that [...] "Probably we shall <b>not</b> <b>wrong</b> the cultivated annalist of Selborne by giving {{the first place to}} Bewick." [...] However, comparing them as people, [...] "Bewick has not the slightest claim to rank with Gilbert White as a naturalist. White was what Bewick never was, a man of science; but, if no naturalist, Bewick was a lover of nature, a careful observer, and a faithful copier of her ever-varying forms. In this, and in this alone, lies his charm." ...|$|E
500|$|Bilheimer {{accepted}} Costa's proposition, {{and subsequently}} wrote, produced, and directed Not My Life {{as an independent}} film. Bilheimer, who had received an Academy Award nomination for The Cry of Reason, said that [...] "the unrelenting, unpunished, and craven exploitation of millions of human beings for labor, sex, and hundreds of sub-categories thereof is simply the most appalling and damaging expression of so-called human civilization we have ever seen." [...] Bilheimer's wife, Heidi Ostertag, is Worldwide Documentaries' Senior Producer, and she co-produced Not My Life with him. She said that she found making a film about human trafficking difficult because [...] "people {{do not want to}} talk about this issue." [...] Bilheimer found that the connections he had made during the production of A Closer Walk were also useful when producing Not My Life because the poor and the outcast are at the greatest risk of both HIV/AIDS and human trafficking; there is, for this reason, much overlap between the groups victimized by these two afflictions. Bilheimer attempted to fashion the film in such a way that every part of it would illustrate a statement made by Abraham Lincoln: [...] "If slavery is <b>not</b> <b>wrong,</b> nothing is wrong." ...|$|E

500|$|Animal rights {{organization}} PETA accused the film's producers of using animals {{that had previously}} been abused. Two chimpanzees who appear in the movie, Cody and Sable, were surrendered by their owner to settle a lawsuit that documented allegations of beatings and mistreatment. The film's director, Tom Shadyac, said of PETA's criticisms [...] "They're <b>not</b> <b>wrong.</b> There's a certain amount of hypocrisy whenever you work with animals, even to show, which we hope we're showing, that respect of all of God's creation...I don't know. I respect their criticism." [...] PETA was also critical of Birds & Animals Unlimited, the primary animal supplier to the film, for alleged serious and continuing violations of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act, including failure to comply with veterinary care requirements and failure to provide shelter from heat and sunlight, which PETA details and claims it can document. A Universal Studios spokesperson declared: [...] "The live animals used in the filming of Evan Almighty were supplemented by a great number of computer-generated animals, {{but it would have been}} impossible to depend on CGI exclusively as some key scenes in the film demonstrate the need for peaceful and productive co-existence between man and animals. One of the most prominent, inescapable messages of the film is the responsibility that humans have to protect and care for animals." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1950s}} Hollywood's output of movie musicals {{had begun to}} wane, and he worked on only two during that decade. He made his movie acting debut in It's Always Fair Weather (1955), {{directed}} by Gene Kelly and Donen, in which Kelly, Kidd and Dan Dailey played three ex-GIs meeting {{ten years after the}} war, only to discover they had little in common. The film featured an exuberant number in which the three dance with garbage can lids fastened to their feet. The downbeat film was a critical success but was not heavily promoted by the studio, and failed at the box office. The film was originally designed to be a sequel to the 1949 film On the Town, but Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin were unavailable, and the film lacked chemistry between the three actors. The production was marked by constant strife between Donen and Kelly, with much of it stemming from Donen striving unsuccessfully to include a ten-minute dance solo by Kidd, [...] "Jack and the Space Giants". Kelly rejected that, which Kidd took as a personal insult, and Donen went further, ending his collaboration with Kelly {{for the rest of their}} lives. The [...] "Jack" [...] number appears as a bonus feature on a DVD of the film, and one commentator suggests that Kelly's judgment was <b>not</b> <b>wrong,</b> as the number was listless and did not advance the plot.|$|E
