30|$|Traditionally, milled wood lignin (MWL) is {{considered}} to be a representative source of <b>native</b> <b>lignin</b> and has been extensively used for the elucidation of <b>native</b> <b>lignin</b> structure. This is currently the most common procedure for the isolation of lignin from wood. However, the yield of MWL is relatively low as revealed by Björkman [19]. Furthermore, lignin yield is dependent on milling time. Nevertheless, longer milling time leads to chemical modification of the lignin, such as increase in carbonyl content and phenolic hydroxyl content as well as decrease in molecular weight and cleavage of aryl ether linkages [20]. Whiting and Goring concluded that MWL is not representative of the whole lignin in wood but primarily originates in the secondary wall of the cell according to the structural studies of dioxane-extracted lignin from compound middle lamella and secondary wall of spruce [21, 22]. To overcome these limitations, a preparative method combining physical and chemical treatments for lignin isolation and purification, such as milling and enzymatic attack, was recently introduced. Chang et al. [23] isolated lignin by extracting MWL first, and subsequently the residue was treated with cellulolytic enzymes followed by 96 % aqueous dioxane extraction to isolate cellulolytic enzyme lignin (CEL). CEL has higher molecular weights and β-O- 4 ′ inter-linkages, but a lower lignin condensation compared to MWL. The higher yield of CEL extracted from wood helps us understand the lignin structure as a whole. CEL is preferred over MWL for studies of lignin structure as it can be isolated in higher yield with less degradation due to ball milling [23, 24].|$|E

40|$|Under {{alkaline}} conditions {{hydrogen peroxide}} {{can be used}} either as a 1 ignin-degrading or a 1 ignin-preserving bleaching agent. If heavy metal ions are present and/or silicate is absent in the reaction medium, hydrogen peroxide decomposes via hydroxyl radicals and superoxide ions to oxygen and water. These decomposition products are able to react for example with phenolic lignin structures and thereby cause a partial degradation of lignin. In such a system peroxide could act as a bleaching and delignifying agent {{at the same time}} and these properties can be utilized for the bleaching of chemical pulps. In order to elucidate the factors which influence the degradation of phenolic structures by oxidation with alkaline hydrogen peroxide the lignin model compounds-methylsyringyl alcohol was studied. By determining the first order reaction rate constants for the oxidation, the main results which were obtained indicate that phenolic lignin structures can be efficiently degraded especially if:A. The pH in the bleaching liquor is close to the pK -valueàfor hydrogen peroxide. B. The ionic strength in the bleaching medium is as high as possible. C. A fixed amount of heavy metal ions (manganese) is added to the bleaching liquor. In the presence of silicate and diethylentriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA) hydrogen peroxide is stabilized against decomposition. Under these conditions alkaline hydrogen peroxide is able to react only with lignin units containing conjugated carbonyl groups such as quinone, aryl-oe-carbonyl and cinnamaldehyd structures, leading to an elimination of the chromophoric structures without any substantial dissolution of lignin.

The consequences of strong noncovalent intermolecular interactions between oligomeric and/or polymeric lignin components are encountered during enzyme-catalyzed lignin degradation {{and in the}} properties of lignin-based plastics. A new chapter in the 30 -year quest for functional lignin-depolymerizing enzymes has been opened. The lignin-degrading capacity of the flavin-dependent monooxygenase, salicylate hydroxylase acting as a putative lignin depolymerase, has been characterized using a water-soluble <b>native</b> softwood <b>lignin</b> substrate under mildly acidic aqueous conditions. When macromolecular lignins undergo lignin-depolymerase catalyzed degradation, the cleaved components tend to associate with one another, or with nearby associated lignin complexes, through processes mediated by the enzyme acting in a non-catalytic capacity. As a result, the radius of gyration (Rg) falls rapidly to approximately constant values, while the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the substrate rises more slowly to an extent dependent on enzyme concentration. Xylanase, when employed in an auxiliary capacity, is able to facilitate dissociation of the foregoing complexes through its interactions with the lignin depolymerase. The flavin-dependent lignin depolymerase must be reduced before reaction with oxygen can occur to form the hydroperoxy intermediate that hydroxylates the lignin substrate prior to cleavage. In {{the absence of the}} cofactor, NADH, the necessary reducing power can be provided (albeit more slowly) by the lignin substrate itself. Under such conditions, a simultaneous decrease in Rg and Mw is initially observed during the enzymatic process through which the lignin is cleaved. The partially degraded product-lignins arising from lignin depolymerase activity can be readily converted into polymeric materials with mechanical properties that supersede those of polystyrene. Methylation and blending of ball-milled softwood lignins with miscible low-Tg polymers, or simple low-molecular-weight compounds, readily produce plastics with 80 - 100 % lignin contents that exhibit > 60 MPa tensile strengths and > 10 % elongations at break. X-ray powder diffraction analyses reveal that these materials are largely composed of associated lignin complexes. During casting, continuity between the macromolecular species is established through conformational changes in the peripheral components of the associated complexes that make up the plastics. Such a working hypothesis is supported by atomic force microscopy of surfaces created by ultramicrotomy of these new lignin-based polymeric materials...|$|R

A commercial pine wood Kraft lignin (Indulin AT) was solubilized instantaneously {{at room temperature}} and 7 – 11 bars autogeneous pressure, while a commercial mixed wheat straw/Sarkanda grass soda lignin (Protobind™ 1000) was solubilized within 3 h at ambient temperature, and 30 min at. 85 °C. Hydroxide salts were not required. Wheat straw, poplar and spruce organosolv lignins, as well as elephant grass <b>native</b> <b>lignin</b> (MWL) were also solubilized, albeit at lower values. Different sequences of solubilisation and extraction were tested on the Protobind™ 1000 lignin. The remaining lignin residues were characterized by FTIR, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), elemental analysis (ICP), 2 D-NMR and 31 P NMR. Liquid ammonia is not an innocent solvent, as some nitrogen was incorporated in the residual lignin which then rearranged to higher molecular weight fractions. Nevertheless, the mild solubilisation conditions make liquid ammonia an attractive candidate as a solvent for lignin in future biorefinery processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{residual}} lignin in birch wood after a hot water extraction in a batch reactor was investigated {{as a function}} of extraction temperature and time. A kinetic model fitting the experimental data was then developed to explain delignification of wood during a hot water treatment. Results showed that delignification kinetics involves simultaneous degradation and condensation reactions, with degradation of lignin being much faster than its condensation. <b>Native</b> <b>lignin</b> in wood was successfully modeled as the sum of two fractions with different degradation rates. The rates of degradation and condensation increased along with increasing extraction temperature. The proportion of acid-soluble lignin to acid-insoluble (Klason) lignin in the wood residue decreased with increasing extraction temperature and time, probably due to chemical and structural changes in the lignin during the hot water treatment. Condensed lignin was predominantly determined as Klason lignin. On the other hand, the amount of soluble lignin in the extraction liquor increased slightly with temperature, but remained mostly constant after any extraction time. An insoluble fraction in the liquor that originated from precipitated lignin fragments is believed to contain traces of degradation products from carbohydrates or other degradation compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{one-step}} ethanolysis {{approach to}} upgrade lignin to monomeric aromatics using a CuMgAl mixed oxide catalyst is studied in detail. The influence of reaction temperature (200 - 420 °C) {{on the product}} distribution is investigated. At low temperature (200 - 250 °C), recondensation is dominant, while char-forming reactions become significant at high reaction temperature (> 380 °C). At preferred intermediate temperatures (300 - 340 °C), char-forming reactions are effectively suppressed by alkylation and Guerbet and esterification reactions. This shifts the reaction toward depolymerization, explaining high monomeric aromatics yield. Carbon- 14 dating analysis of the lignin residue revealed that {{a substantial amount of}} the carbon in the lignin residue originates from reactions of lignin with ethanol. Recycling tests show that the activity of the regenerated catalyst was strongly decreased due to a loss of basic sites due to hydrolysis of the MgO function and a loss of surface area due to spinel oxide formation of the Cu and Al components. The utility of this one-step approach for upgrading woody biomass was also demonstrated. An important observation is that conversion of the <b>native</b> <b>lignin</b> contained in the lignocellulosic matrix is much easier than the conversion of technical lignin...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{chemical}} composition of wood {{depends on a}} number of different factors, such as wood species, anatomical parts of wood, geographic location, habitation, growth, climatic characteristics, and degree of fungal and insect attacks. Recent studies report that the content of certain wood chemical components differed significantly in dependence on different sampling locations. As an extension of the mentioned studies, this study was aimed at investigating the influence of sampling locations which differ among themselves according to specific ecological factors (soil type, altitude and phytocoenoses) on the {{chemical composition}} of a wood <b>native</b> <b>lignin</b> (NL) model by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Materials and Methods: The beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) sapwood NL samples from seven sampling locations were used that differ among themselves according to specific ecological factors. NL was isolated according to a modified Brauns method described in previous research, and the FT-IR transmission spectroscopic technique was used for its characterization. The content of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl units (S), as well as syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio was estimated for different sampling locations. The observed FT-IR peaks were assigned and quantified as percentages of the peak spectral heights, and the differences between NL were discussed in terms of lignin composition. Results: The results of statistical analysis of the NL contents showed significant differences between some sampling locations regarding phytocoenoses, soil type and altitude, as well as within some locations with the same sign of the mentioned ecological factors. The obtained FT-IR spectral results revealed that the observed NL composition differs in S/G ratios linked to different sampling locations, as evidenced by relative heights of FT-IR peaks at 1282 – 1283 cm- 1 (represent G units) and 1327 – 1331 cm- 1 (represent S units). The estimated relationship between the content of guaiacyl and syringyl units of the NL model structure was assigned from 63. 06 - 36. 94 % and 71. 62 – 28. 38 %. For different sampling locations the S/G ratios were from 0. 40 – 0. 59. Conclusions: Statistical analysis and comparison between the results of NL content for all sampling locations showed significant differences between some sampling locations with regard to phytocoenoses, soil type and altitude, as well as within some locations with the same sign of the mentioned ecological factors. Furthermore, the results of this study, such as the obtained FT-IR spectras of NL, different S/G ratios and the content of guaiacyl and siringyl units, showed the significant influence of sampling locations on the chemical composition of the wood <b>native</b> <b>lignin</b> model in terms of the content of the observed phenylpropane units...|$|E
