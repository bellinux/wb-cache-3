5|$|MEPs in Parliament are {{organised}} into seven different parliamentary groups, including thirty <b>non-attached</b> members known as non-inscrits. The two largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S). These two groups {{have dominated the}} Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. As {{a result of being}} broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence {{have more in common with}} parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.|$|E

All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for interpretation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining segment of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Behind them there is an EU flag attached to the wall with national flags in rows each side of it.|$|E

40|$|Assumed having axial symmetry, the {{streamer}} discharge {{is often}} described by a fluid model in cylindrical coordinate system, which consists of convection dominated (diffusion) equations with source terms, coupled with a Poisson's equation. Without additional care for a stricter CFL condition or special treatment to the negative source term, popular methods used in streamer discharge simulations, e. g., FEM-FCT, FVM, cannot ensure the positivity of the particle densities for the cases in attaching gases. By introducing the positivity-preserving limiter proposed by Zhang and Shu ppl and Strang operator splitting, this paper proposed a finite difference scheme with a provable positivity-preserving property in cylindrical coordinate system, for the numerical simulation of streamer discharges in <b>non-attaching</b> and attaching gases.

2500|$|While Buddhism {{does not}} see {{anything}} wrong with wealth gained ethically, it does see greed and craving for riches as negative, and praises contentment as 'the greatest wealth'. Poverty and debt are seen as causes of suffering, immorality and social unrest if they prevent one from having basic necessities and peace of mind. For laypeople, Buddhism promotes the middle way between a life of poverty and a materialistic or consumerist life in which one is always seeking to enrich oneself and to buy more things. For Buddhist laypersons then, to be Buddhist does not mean to reject all material things, but, according to Sizemore and Swearer: [...] "it specifies an attitude to be cultivated and expressed in whatever material condition one finds oneself. To be <b>non-attached</b> is to possess and use material things but not to be possessed or used by them. Therefore, the idea of non-attachment applies all across Buddhist society, to laymen and monk alike." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of heavy negative ions by the attachment of low-energy electrons to oxygen molecules was studied for {{small amounts of}} oxygen mixed with methane or carbon dioxide. The rate of attachment in both cases was found {{to depend on the}} electron energy, the pressure of the oxygen and the <b>non-attaching</b> gas, and on the kind of <b>non-attaching</b> gas. In general, the attachment increases as electron enprgy decreases or as either oxygen or total pressure increases. The value of the attachment coefficient in oxygencarbon dioxide mixtures is about 100 times its value in oxygen-methane mixtures. This large difference is probably due in part to differences in electron energy and partly to differences in the stabilizing qualities of the two molecules. Dissociative attachment, which should be pressure independent, does not occur at the low energies that were used in this work. Both methane and carbon dioxide are to differences in the stabilizing qualities of the two molecules. Dissociative attachment, which should be pressure independent, does not occur at the low energies that were used in this work. Both methane and carbon dioxide are sometimes used as filling gases for Geiger and proportional counters. The high sensitivity of carbon dioxide to oxygen contamination indicates that very pure gas should be used if the best operation is to be obtained. The low sensitivity of methane recommends it for counters where careful purification of the gas is difficult and particularly for flow counters where the possibility of contamination by atmospheric oxygen exists.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of negative streamers during electric breakdown of a <b>non-attaching</b> gas {{can be described}} by a two-fluid model for electrons and positive ions. It consists of continuity equations for the charged particles including drift, diffusion and reaction in the local electric field, coupled to the Poisson equation for the electric potential. The model generates field enhancement and steep propagating ionization fronts {{at the tip of}} growing ionized filaments. An adaptive grid refinement method for the simulation of these structures is presented. It uses finite volume spatial discretizations and explicit time stepping, which allows the decoupling of the grids for the continuity equations from those for the Poisson equation. Standard refinement methods in which the refinement criterion is based on local error monitors fail due to the pulled character of the streamer front that propagates into a linearly unstable state. We present a refinement method which deals with all these features. Tests on one-dimensional streamer fronts as well as on three-dimensional streamers with cylindrical symmetry (hence effectively 2 D for numerical purposes) are carried ou...|$|R

40|$|Rhodotorula glutinis as an {{antagonism}} show good biocontrol performance against various postharvest {{diseases in}} fruits. In the present study, strong attachment capability of R. glutinis to spores and hyphae of Botrytis cinerea was observed. Further {{analysis showed that}} certain protein components on the yeast cell surface played critical role during the interaction between R. glutinis and B. cinerea. The components mainly distributed at the poles of yeast cells and might contain glycosylation modification, as tunicamycin treated yeast cells lost attachment capability to B. cinerea. To investigate contributions of attachment capability of R. glutinis to its biocontrol efficacy, yeast cells were mutagenized with 3 % methane-sulfonic acid ethyl ester (EMS), and a mutant CE 4 with stable <b>non-attaching</b> phenotype was obtained. No {{significant difference was found}} on colony, cell morphology, reproductive ability and capsule formation between the mutant and wild type. However, there was a distinct difference in India ink positive staining patterns between the two strains. Moreover, wild type strain of R. glutinis showed better performance on inhibiting spore germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea than CE 4 strain when yeast cells and B. cinerea were co-cultured in vitro. In biocontrol assay, both wild type and CE 4 strains showed significant biocontrol efficacy against gray mould caused by B. cinerea in apple fruit, whereas, control effect of CE 4 strain was lower than that of wild type.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{provides information on}} dynamic aspects of developing oocytes in the ovary during the growth period of the medaka from larva to juvenile. After hatching, the ovary increases in a longitudinal length, in proportion to body growth, although its width exhibits a slightly steeper rise from 13 – 14 mm total length (TL). In the ovary of larvae measuring 13 mm TL or greater, the largest oocytes enter stage IV in which the chorion (egg envelope) with attaching and villi (<b>non-attaching</b> filaments) begins to form. When body size reaches 14 mm TL, the composition of developing oocytes (follicles) in an ovary shifts from the previtellogenic to the early vitellogenic patterns. After larvae attain a body size of more than 15 mm TL, the largest size of oocytes continues to increase steeply with great variation among individuals as body growth progresses. It was {{also found that the}} total number of oocytes in an ovary continues to increase in proportion to body growth during metamorphosis. Moreover, the metrical data reveal that small oocytes of 45 μm in diameter represent a dominant population in the oocyte composition in each ovary, irrespective of body size, and that the ovary always retains oogonia and small oocytes 9 – 18 μm in diameter in the range of 9 – 15 per cent. It is conceivable that recruitment of new oocytes may occur directly from oogonia in the germinal nests (germinal cradles) that are located in the epithelial regions surrounding large oocytes and {{at the edge of the}} luminal wall of the ovary...|$|R
40|$|The {{deviation}} of bacteria transport and deposition patterns on grains in porous media from theory {{has resulted in}} the inability to accurately predict transport distances in aquifers, with consequences of polluting drinking water sources (springs, boreholes and wells). Due to the importance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) as an indicator of faecal contamination of drinking water supplies, this thesis research focused on their transport in saturated porous media. The objectives were to (i) study inter-strain and intra-strain attachment variability among multiple E. coli strains, (ii) characterize the distribution of sticking efficiencies within cell populations (iii) develop a methodology to measure minimum values of sticking efficiencies, and (iv) to assess the contribution of various cell properties on bacterial attachment to quartz grains. Most of this research was carried out under laboratory conditions (e. g. column and batch experiments), but a part of this work focused on the transport characteristics of E. coli strains isolated at the termination point of groundwater flow lines (springs) in Kampala, Uganda. The underlying hypothesis was that transport by a group of E. coli strains could possibly be characterized by a similar set of transport parameters. Transport of E. coli strains isolated from different sources of the environment was studied using saturated quartz columns. Short (7 cm) and long (1. 5 - 25 m) columns were used to investigate inter-strain attachment variations among E. coli strains, distributions in attachment efficiency within E. coli strains and to develop a methodology to measure the minimum sticking efficiency. Furthermore, long column experiments were applied {{in order to be able}} to measure low sticking efficiency values. Prior to the experiments E. coli strains were cultured and their phenotypic characteristics and selected genes encoding structures at the outer membrane were measured to investigate their effects on transport/attachment. The results indicated that none of the studied cell characteristics significantly influenced E. coli attachment on sedimentary quartz grains; however, cell motility and antigen- 43 expression promoted attachment to quartz grains over relatively short transport distances. For spring E. coli isolates from Kampala, a substantial percentage belonged to the same serotype (E. coli O 21 :H 7). Therefore, we concluded that strains possessing this particular serotype may possess certain characteristics that promote their selective transport through the aquifers in the Kampala area in Uganda and might have determined an overall transport homogeneity observed for this particular group of E. coli isolates. With the exception of spring E. coli isolates which showed overall inter-strain transport homogeneity, results indicated that intra-strain and inter-strain attachment heterogeneities existed within and among the various E. coli strains, respectively. Environmentally relevant low values of sticking efficiencies were measured over long transport distances and thus demonstrated the importance of the use of long columns for this type of research. The measured low values of sticking efficiency indicated that, for bacterial populations leaked into groundwater environments, sub-populations may possess <b>non-attaching</b> characteristics and therefore increase their chances of being transported over considerable distances, that might be underestimated using common drinking water protection guidelines. Intra-strain attachment variability resulted in a power-law distribution between fraction of cells and their sticking efficiencies. Minimum sticking efficiency was extrapolated from the power-law distribution. The minimum sticking efficiency is defined as the sticking efficiency belonging to a bacteria fraction of 0. 001 % of initial bacteria mass flowing into a column, after removal of 99. 999 % (5 log reduction) of the original bacteria mass has taken place. Values extrapolated were lower than those measured from experiments; the low values make the minimum sticking efficiency a valuable tool in delineating well-head protection areas in real-world cases. Future research should focus on cell surface structures known to be involved in initial attachment to host tissues and/or abiotic surfaces. In addition, we advocate to carry out field bacteria transport experiments instead of laboratory experiments, since interpreting the results of the latter is limited by transport dependent scale issues.
