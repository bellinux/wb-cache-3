25|$|Convergent evolution. When {{considering}} a single character state, parsimony will automatically assume that two organisms that share that characteristic {{will be more}} closely related than those who don’t.

25|$|Peter Singer, a bioethicist {{and author}} of Animal Liberation {{published}} in 1975, suggested that consciousness {{is not necessarily the}} key issue: just because animals have smaller brains, or are ‘less conscious’ than humans, does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not capable of feeling pain. He goes on further to argue that we do not assume newborn infants, people suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases or people with learning disabilities experience less pain than we would.|$|E

25|$|Riepe {{states that}} the Ajivikas belief in predeterminism does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were pessimistic. Rather, just like Calvinists belief in predeterminism in Europe, the Ajivikas were optimists. The Ajivikas simply {{did not believe in}} the moral force of action, or in merits or demerits, or in after-life {{affected}} because of what one does or does not do. Actions had immediate effects in one's current life but without any moral traces, and both the action and the effect was predetermined, according to the Ajivikas.|$|E
25|$|The Toegye School, {{founded by}} Yi Hwang, {{believed}} that Li (rationality) was absolute, while Qi (material) was relative (this, however, does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{believed that the}} Li was in any way superior to the Qi). They also believed that the Li and the Qi were completely different, and that the human ethics were Li (rational), while the human emotions were Qi (material). The latter idea was attacked by Yi I, who believed that ethics were just a positive side of the emotions. The Toegye School were {{the majority of the}} Southerners, and remained the contender of the Giho School to the eighteenth century.|$|E

Oversized Chihuahuas are seen in some of the best, and worst, bloodlines. Chihuahuas do not breed true for size, and puppies from the same litter can mature drastically different sizes from one another. As well, larger breeding females are less likely to experience dystocia. Typically, the breed standard for both the long and short coat Chihuahua will be identical except for the description of the coat. Chihuahuas have large, round eyes and large, erect ears, set in a high, dramatically rounded skull.|$|E

25|$|Bank of England {{notes are}} the only {{banknotes}} that are legal tender in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes are not legal tender anywhere, and Jersey, Guernsey and Manx banknotes are only legal tender in their respective jurisdictions. Although these banknotes are not legal tender in the UK, this does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are illegal under English law, and creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose. Traders may, on the other hand, choose not to accept banknotes as payment, as contract law across the United Kingdom allows parties {{not to engage in}} a transaction at the point of payment if they choose not to.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, a new {{coat of arms}} was adopted. Like the DRA coat of arms, this coat {{prominently}} featured Mount Ararat {{along with}} the Soviet hammer and sickle and red star behind it. The inclusion of Ararat brought objections from Turkey because the mountain is part of its territory. The Kremlin retorted that although the Turkish symbol was the crescent, surely it did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> laid claim to the moon. The Soviet Union broke apart in 1991 and Armenia thus became an independent republic. In 1992, a slightly {{modified version of the}} DRA's coat of arms was adopted and has remained in place ever since.|$|E
25|$|The 9th, 11th and 13th chords {{are known}} as {{extended}} tertian chords. As the scale repeats for every seven notes in the scale, these notes are enharmonically equivalent to the 2nd, 4th, and 6th– except they are more than an octave above the root. However, this does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must be played in the higher octave. Although changing the octave of certain notes in a chord (within reason) does {{change the way the}} chord sounds, it does not change the essential characteristics or tendency of it. Accordingly, using 9th, 11th and 13th in chord notation implies that the chord is an extended tertian chord rather than an added chord (see Added Chords below).|$|E

60|$|It is {{certainly}} not the doctrine of the New Testament. Whatsoever St. Paul meant by bidding his disciples crucify the flesh, with its affections and lusts, he did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> thereby <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were to deify the flesh, as the heathen round them did in their profligate mysteries and in their gladiatorial exhibitions.|$|R
25|$|As enemy aliens, Frisch and Peierls were {{initially}} {{excluded from the}} Maud Committee, but the absurdity of this was soon recognised, and they were made members of its Technical Subcommittee. This did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were cleared for radar work. When Oliphant made the services of his secretary available for typing up the Peierl's and Frisch's papers for the Maud Committee in September 1940, they {{were not allowed to}} enter the Nuffield Building where she worked, so Peierls submitted them for typing by dictaphone on wax cylinders. Frisch and Peierls thought at first that uranium enrichment was best achieved though thermal diffusion, but as the difficulties with this approach became more apparent they switched to gaseous diffusion, bringing in a fellow refugee from Germany, Franz Simon, as an expert on the subject. Peierls also recruited yet another refugee from Germany, Klaus Fuchs, as his assistant in May 1941.|$|E
500|$|Several {{groups and}} {{persons in the}} Netherlands have called for legal action against Wilders, while others defended his right to free speech. On 15 August 2007, a {{representative}} of the Prosecutors' Office in Amsterdam declared that dozens of reports against Wilders had been filed, and that they were all being considered. Attempts to prosecute Wilders under Dutch anti-hate speech laws in June 2008 failed, with the public prosecutor's office stating that Wilders' comments contributed to the debate on Islam in Dutch society and also had been made outside parliament. The office released a statement reading: [...] "That comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of Muslims does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are punishable. Freedom of expression fulfils an essential role in public debate in a democratic society. That means that offensive comments can be made in a political debate." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E

500|$|At Bayreuth {{performances}} audiences do not applaud {{at the end}} of {{the first}} act. This tradition is the result of a misunderstanding arising from Wagner's desire at the premiere to maintain the serious mood of the opera. After much applause following the first and second acts, Wagner spoke to the audience and said that the cast would take no curtain calls until the end of the performance. This confused the audience, who remained silent {{at the end of}} the opera until Wagner addressed them again, saying that he did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not applaud. After the performance Wagner complained, [...] "Now I don't know. Did the audience like it or not?" [...] At subsequent performances some believed that Wagner had wanted no applause until the very end, and there was silence after the first two acts. Eventually it became a Bayreuth tradition that no applause would be heard after the first act, but this was certainly not Wagner's idea. In fact during the first Bayreuth performances Wagner himself cried [...] "Bravo!" [...] as the Flowermaidens made their exit in the second act, only to be hissed by other members of the audience. At some theatres other than Bayreuth, applause and curtain calls are normal practice after every act; at other major theatres, including the Metropolitan Opera in New York, the Bayreuth custom is followed.|$|E
500|$|The Inaccessible rail is {{endemic to}} the {{uninhabited}} Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha {{group in the}} mid-Atlantic Ocean. The island is [...] in area and has a temperate wet oceanic climate with high rainfall, limited sunshine and persistent westerly winds. The rail is found in almost all habitats {{on the island and}} at all altitudes, from sea-level to [...] It reaches its highest densities in fields of tussock grass (Spartina arundinacea), with 10 birds per hectare, and in tussock grass mixed with ferns (Blechnum penna-marina) and sedges, with 15 birds per hectare. This habitat is found close to the shore and surrounds most of the island on the steep cliffs. The Inaccessible Island rail can also be found in upland fern-bush heath, dominated by wind-stunted tree-ferns (Blechnum palmiforme) and in the island forest in the central plateau which is dominated by Island Cape myrtle (Phylica arborea)—which can reach [...] where sheltered—and Blechnum palmiforme. In both these habitats the population is estimated to be two birds per hectare. It will also forage among boulders on the beaches, but has not been found in the short dry grasses on the cinder cones (the scientists making the observations cautioned that this does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> never use the habitat). It frequently uses natural cavities among boulders or tunnels through grasses created by frequent use to move around while concealed.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, [...] "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming." [...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will leave the show. Falchuk insisted that [...] "it was never our plan or our intention to let them go.... They are not done with the show after this season." ...|$|E
