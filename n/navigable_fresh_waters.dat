5000|$|The English rule used to {{distinguish}} {{between public and private}} waters was based on the limit of the tide, for those waters that were navigable were subject to admiralty jurisdiction. In the U.S., this rule had been extended to include <b>navigable</b> <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> [...] "reasonably capable of valuable use as a public way." [...] However, it was not always clear that a pond - isolated from the ocean or a navigable river, but otherwise in the public domain - was reserved for public use. Furthermore, the ability to hunt and fish on public lands had been denied to citizens during feudal times, and that [...] "system of legal inequality in the enjoyment of public property" [...] was precisely what the colonists sought to avoid. Thus, a new rule defining public waters needed to be established that was not based on the navigability of the waters.By the English rule thus modified, the legal title of New Hampshire land was in the king, who held it as trustee in his official and representative capacity, with no private interest. The dry land, and the soil under fresh rivers, brooks, and small ponds, was convertible, by his grant, into private property, for settlement, and for the advancement of the common welfare. The seashore, arms of the sea, and large ponds, by reason of their special adaptation to public uses, were set apart and reserved as public waters. They could not be converted into private estate or subjected to a private easement, by the trustee's grant, or by any act of the executive branch of the government. The distinction is between what the trustee held for public use and what he held for the purpose of sale or other appropriation to private use for the public benefit.In 1647 the want of a definition of “great ponds” was supplied,[...] [...] that no town shall appropriate to any particular person or persons any great pond containing more than ten acres of land, and that no man shall come upon another's propriety sic without their leave.|$|R

Salt-water adapted turtles {{were exposed to}} <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> for 4 d before being returned to salt water. During the initial salt water phase, absolute and relative water flux rates were 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 l d(- 1) and 123. 0 +/- 6. 8 ml kg(- 1) d(- 1), respectively. When turtles were exposed to <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> rates increased by approximately 30 %. Upon return to salt water, rates decreased to original levels. Plasma osmolality, Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) decreased during exposure to <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> and subsequently increased during the return to salt water. The Na(+) :K(+) ratio was elevated during the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> phase and subsequently decreased upon return to salt water. Aldosterone and corticosterone were not altered during exposure to <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> Elevated water flux rates during <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> exposure reflected an increase in water consumption, resulting in a decrease in ionic and osmotic concentrations.

50|$|Changing {{landscape}} {{for the use}} of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> in the local environment and also affects the cycle of <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> As a result, more <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture. However, since agriculture is the human activity that consumes the most <b>fresh</b> <b>water,</b> this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems.

Results from a multiple regression between FCWA and various atmospheric and oceanic indices show that the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> content on the shelves is mainly controlled by atmospheric vorticity on quasi-decadal timescales.

40|$|During glacial periods, {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentration {{increases and}} decreases by around 15 ppm. At the same time, the climate changes gradually in Antarctica. Such climate {{changes can be}} simulated in models when the AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Oceanic Circulation) is weakened by adding <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> to the North Atlantic. The impact on the carbon cycle is less straightforward, and previous studies give opposite results. Because the models and the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes were different in these studies, it prevents any direct comparison and hinders finding whether the discrepancies arise from using different models or different <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes. In this study we use the CLIMBER- 2 coupled climate carbon model to explore the impact of different <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes. In both preindustrial and glacial states, the addition of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> and the resulting slow-down of the AMOC lead to an uptake of carbon by the ocean and a release by the terrestrial biosphere. The duration, shape and amplitude of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> flux all {{have an impact on}} the change of atmospheric CO 2 because they modulate the change of the AMOC. The maximum CO 2 change linearly depends on the time integral of the AMOC change. The different duration, amplitude, and shape of the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> flux cannot explain the opposite evolution of ocean and vegetation carbon inventory in different models. The different CO 2 evolution thus depends on the AMOC response to the addition of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> and the resulting climatic change, which are both model dependent. In CLIMBER- 2, the rise of CO 2 recorded in ice cores during abrupt events can be simulated under glacial conditions, especially when the sinking of brines in the Southern Ocean is taken into account.
