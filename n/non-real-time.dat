25|$|Recent {{advances}} in vehicle electronics {{have led to}} a move towards fewer, more capable computer processors on a vehicle. A typical vehicle in the early 2000s would have between 20 and 100 individual networked microcontroller/Programmable logic controller modules with <b>non-real-time</b> operating systems. The current trend is toward fewer, more costly microprocessor modules with hardware memory management and real-time operating systems. The new embedded system platforms allow for more sophisticated software applications to be implemented, including model-based process control, artificial intelligence, and ubiquitous computing. Perhaps {{the most important of these}} for Intelligent Transportation Systems is artificial intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Machinima creators {{have used}} {{different}} methods to handle limited character expression. The most typical ways that amateur-style machinima gets around limitations of expression include {{taking advantage of}} speech bubbles seen above players' heads when speaking, relying on the visual matching between a character's voice and appearance, and finding methods available within the game itself. Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker include the ability to manipulate characters and objects in real-time, though the former relies on community addons {{to take advantage of}} certain engine features, and the latter renders scenes using <b>non-real-time</b> effects. In the Halo video game series, helmets completely cover the characters' faces. To prevent confusion, Rooster Teeth's characters move slightly when speaking, a convention shared with anime. Some machinima creators use custom software. For example, Strange Company uses Take Over GL Face Skins to add more facial expressions to their characters filmed in BioWare's 2002 role-playing video game Neverwinter Nights. Similarly, Atussa Simon used a [...] "library of faces" [...] for characters in The Battle of Xerxes. In some cases, some game companies may provide such software; examples include Epic Games' Impersonator for Unreal Tournament 2004 and Valve Corporation's Faceposer for Source games. Another solution is to blend in non-machinima elements, as nGame did by inserting painted characters with more expressive faces into its 1999 film Berlin Assassins. It may be possible to point the camera elsewhere or employ other creative cinematography or acting. For example, Tristan Pope combined creative character and camera positioning with video editing to suggest sexual actions in his controversial film Not Just Another Love Story.|$|E

50|$|The key RTLinux design {{objective}} was to add hard real-time capabilities to a commodity operating system to facilitate the development of complex control programs with both capabilities. For example, one might want to develop a real-time motor controller that used a commodity database and exported a web operator interface. Instead of attempting to build a single operating system that could support real-time and <b>non-real-time</b> capabilities, RTLinux was designed to share a computing device between a real-time and <b>non-real-time</b> operating system so that (1) the real-time operating system could never be blocked from execution by the <b>non-real-time</b> operating system and (2) components running in the two different environments could easily share data. As the name implies RTLinux was originally designed to use Linux as the <b>non-real-time</b> system but it eventually evolved so that the RTCore real-time kernel could run with either Linux or BSD UNIX.|$|E
50|$|Currently, five ATM Forum-defined service {{categories}} exist (see Table 1). The basic {{differences among}} these service categories {{are described in}} the following sub-sections. These service categories provide a method to relate traffic characteristics and QoS requirements to network behaviour. The service categories are characterised as being real-time or <b>non-real-time.</b> CBR and rt-VBR are the real-time service categories. The remaining three service categories (nrt-VBR, UBR and ABR) are considered <b>non-real-time</b> service categories.|$|E

50|$|A {{collaborative}} editor {{is a form}} {{of collaborative}} software application that allows several people to edit a computer file using different computers, a practice called collaborative editing. There are two types of collaborative editing: real-time and <b>non-real-time.</b> In real-time collaborative editing (RTCE), users can edit the same file simultaneously, whereas in <b>Non-real-time</b> collaborative editing, the users do not edit the same file at the same time (similar to revision control systems). Collaborative real-time editors generally permit both the above modes of editing in any given instance.|$|E
50|$|CPU {{shielding}} is {{a practice}} where on a multiprocessor system or on a CPU with multiple cores, real-time tasks can run on one CPU or core while <b>non-real-time</b> tasks run on another.|$|E
50|$|In more {{advanced}} systems, real-time tasks share computing resources with many <b>non-real-time</b> tasks, and the ready list can be arbitrarily long. In such systems, a scheduler ready list implemented as a linked list would be inadequate.|$|E
50|$|Real-time {{processes}} {{run on the}} INtime kernel, and <b>non-real-time</b> processes run on Windows. Windows application threads {{communicate with}} their real time counterparts on the INtime kernel through a special API that facilitates coordination and data sharing.|$|E
5000|$|A Texas Instruments TI-990 {{minicomputer}} {{performed the}} <b>non-real-time</b> Fast Fourier transform processing necessary {{to convert from}} the frequency domain specification to the time domain waveform buffer format. It also handled user interaction such as specifying sound parameters. The second version used a TMS-9900 microprocessor for the same functions ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{difference between}} real-time and <b>non-real-time</b> graphics is the interactivity desired in real-time graphics. Feedback is typically the main motivation for pushing real-time graphics to its furore. In cases like films, the director has the complete control and determinism {{of what has}} to be drawn on each frame, typically involving weeks or even years of decision-making involving a number of people.|$|E
50|$|The IXP1200 {{integrates}} a StrongARM SA-1100-derived {{core and}} six microengines, which were RISC microprocessors with an instruction set optimized for network packet workloads. The StrongARM core performed <b>non-real-time</b> functions while the microengines manipulated network packets. The processor also integrates static {{random access memory}} (SRAM) and synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) controllers, a PCI interface and an IX bus interface.|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>non-real-time</b> {{but highly}} {{accurate}} intonation control in formant synthesis include {{the work done}} in the late 1970s for the Texas Instruments toy Speak & Spell, {{and in the early}} 1980s Sega arcade machines and in many Atari, Inc. arcade games using the TMS5220 LPC Chips. Creating proper intonation for these projects was painstaking, and the results have yet to be matched by real-time text-to-speech interfaces.|$|E
50|$|The upper most {{level of}} the control {{hierarchy}} is the warehouse management system (WMS), or host. This system handles the business aspects of the system such as receiving customer orders, allocating inventory, and generating shipping manifests or bills of lading) and invoices based on order fulfillment information and shipping information received from the material handling control system (WCS). It typically interacts with the material handling system on a <b>non-real-time</b> basis.|$|E
5000|$|The early {{advantage}} OpenFlight {{held over}} many 3d geometry model file formats (.obj, [...]dxf, [...]3ds) was its specific real-time 3d graphics industry design. This {{means that the}} format is polygon based (rather than NURB surfaces), and provides a real-time tree structure essential for real-time IG systems. Most early graphics file formats worried more about visual esthetics for <b>non-real-time</b> based rendering graphics packages such as Wavefront Technologies, or Alias Systems Corporation.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{real-time}} applications {{have benefited}} from TAO's use of familiar software concepts to present a solution to challenging real-time software problems. In general, real-time systems require predictable timing characteristics and robustness since they are used in mission-critical domains. Other real-time applications require low development cost and fast time to market. TAO addresses both of these by providing an already-implemented general-purpose communications framework that uses concepts familiar to <b>non-real-time</b> portions of the software industry.|$|E
5000|$|On October 9, 2007, {{voice chat}} {{has come into}} {{the current version of}} Voodoo. [...] "Sequenced Voice Chat" [...] works by sending clips up to 20 seconds of your voice out to the users in your chat room, <b>non-real-time.</b> [...] "Even {{streamed}} voice chat is not 'realtime' given the high latency typically encountered - it just 'seems' it. Likewise, nobody in any of our tests expressed a feeling that things were 'out of sync' in any problematic way." ...|$|E
50|$|UC allows an {{individual}} {{to send a message}} on one medium and receive the same communication on another medium. For example, one can receive a voicemail message and choose to access it through e-mail or a cell phone. If the sender is online according to the presence information and currently accepts calls, the response can be sent immediately through text chat or a video call. Otherwise, it may be sent as a <b>non-real-time</b> message that can be accessed through a variety of media.|$|E
50|$|The common {{business}} {{definition of}} Unified Communications (UC) is {{the integration of}} real-time enterprise communication services with <b>non-real-time</b> communication services, such as unified messaging (i.e., the integration of email, voicemail, SMS and fax.) Through its Unified Communications Services line of business, West delivers cloud-based UC technology (a.k.a. Unified Communications as a Service or UCaaS) which include enterprise voice, conferencing and collaboration, network management, unified messaging and presence, contact center and client application integration. West also provides videoconferencing, Skype for Business integration, webcasts and other digital media services.|$|E
5000|$|Buffering is used {{throughout}} high performance network systems to handle {{delays in the}} system. In general, buffer size {{will need to be}} scaled proportionally to the amount of data [...] "in flight" [...] at any time. For very high performance applications that are not sensitive to network delays, it is possible to interpose large end to end buffering delays by putting in intermediate data storage points in an end to end system, and then to use automated and scheduled <b>non-real-time</b> data transfers to get the data to their final endpoints.|$|E
5000|$|According to the NRO, the {{incremental}} upgrade of GRAB's Tattletale package was POPPY. The second program, Poppy, operated from 1962 to 1977. The [...] "fact of" [...] the Poppy program, along with limited technical information, was declassified in 2004. At least three NRO operators did the preliminary processing of the POPPY data, one measuring the orbital {{elements of the}} satellite and the selected polarization, while the second operator identified signals of interest. The third operator did more detailed, <b>non-real-time,</b> analysis of the signal, and transmitted information to NSA.|$|E
50|$|Unified {{communications}} (UC) products integrate multiple interactive, real-time enterprise communication methods, such as instant messaging, desktop sharing, and telephony with <b>non-real-time</b> {{communication services}} such as unified messaging (integrated voicemail, e-mail, SMS, and fax). UC products can enable administrators to control and manage these methods. The HP Network Optimizer SDN Application for Microsoft Lync functions as a unified communications-and-collaboration (UC&C) application {{that is designed to}} improve voice quality with Lync; in March 2014 it received a NetEvents Cloud Innovation award in the category of SDN Solution for the Enterprise.|$|E
50|$|Unified {{communications}} {{is sometimes}} confused with unified messaging, {{but it is}} distinct. Unified communications refers to both real-time and <b>non-real-time</b> delivery of communications based on the preferred method and location of the recipient; unified messaging culls messages from several sources (such as e-mail, voice mail and faxes), but holds those messages only for retrieval at a later time. Unified communications allows for an individual to check and retrieve an e-mail or voice mail from any communication device at any time. It expands beyond voice mail services to data communications and video services.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the sixth}} {{consecutive}} year, VDC Research recognized Wind River as the embedded Linux market leader for its Wind River Linux platform. The VDC study which covered {{the global market}} for commercially available real time operating systems (RTOS) and <b>non-real-time</b> operating systems, determined that Wind River led the market for worldwide shipments of both RTOS and embedded Linux, and related services. [...] According to VDC, Wind River retains its longstanding position as the traditional RTOS market leader for its portfolio of embedded products and services, led by its VxWorks RTOS.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} used was to only virtualize the guest interrupt control. This method allowed the real-time kernel {{to convert the}} guest operating system into a system that was completely preemptible but that could still directly control, for example, storage devices. In particular, standard drivers for the guest worked without source modification although {{they needed to be}} recompiled to use the virtualization [...] "hooks". See also paravirtualization. The UNIX [...] "pipe" [...] was adapted to permit real-time and <b>non-real-time</b> programs to communicate although other methods such as shared memory were also added.|$|E
5000|$|While {{this game}} {{generated}} considerable political controversy, {{it is being}} mentioned here {{as a reminder of}} how asymmetrical modern conflict can be, and the challenges that asymmetric thinking can present to intelligence capabilities and assumptions. LTG Paul K. Van Riper, USMC (ret.) commanded the enemy military in a Gulf scenario. According to Robert B. Oakley, ambassador and later special envoy to Somalia, who played the Red civilian leader, Van Riper was [...] "out-thinking" [...] Blue Force from {{the first day of the}} exercise. He also maneuvered Red forces frequently, potentially defeating <b>non-real-time</b> IMINT.|$|E
50|$|Circa 1997, Randy Waterhouse (Lawrence's grandson) joins his old {{role-playing}} game companion Avi Halaby {{in a new}} startup, providing Pinoy-grams (inexpensive, <b>non-real-time</b> video messages) to migrant Filipinos via new fiber-optic cables. The Epiphyte Corporation {{uses this}} income stream to fund {{the creation of a}} data haven in the nearby fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta. Vietnam veteran Doug Shaftoe, the son of Bobby Shaftoe, and his daughter Amy do the undersea surveying for the cables and engineering work on the haven is overseen by Goto Furudenendu, heir-apparent to Goto Engineering. Complications arise as figures from the past reappear seeking gold or revenge.|$|E

50|$|Unified Communications (UC) is a {{marketing}} buzzword describing {{the integration of}} real-time, enterprise, communication services such as instant messaging (chat), presence information, voice (including IP telephony), mobility features (including extension mobility and single number reach), audio, web & video conferencing, fixed-mobile convergence (FMC), desktop sharing, data sharing (including web connected electronic interactive whiteboards), call control and speech recognition with <b>non-real-time</b> communication services such as unified messaging (integrated voicemail, e-mail, SMS and fax). UC {{is not necessarily a}} single product, but a set of products that provides a consistent unified user-interface and user-experience across multiple devices and media-types.|$|E
50|$|Software synthesis' roots go {{back as far}} as the 1950s, when Max Mathews of Bell Labs {{wrote the}} MUSIC-N {{programming}} language, which was capable of <b>non-real-time</b> sound generation. The first synthesizer to run directly on a host computer's CPU was Reality, by Dave Smith's Seer Systems, which achieved a low latency through tight driver integration, and therefore could run only on Creative Labs soundcards. Some systems use dedicated hardware to reduce the load on the host CPU, as with Symbolic Sound Corporation's Kyma System, and the Creamware/Sonic Core Pulsar/SCOPE systems, which power an entire recording studio's worth of instruments, effect units, and mixers.|$|E
5000|$|One {{capability}} that a host {{can provide}} to a plugin is a [...] "worker thread". In programming terms, {{this means that}} the plugin can offload some work to be done in another thread that the host provides. This is generally useful because a plugin is usually run in the real-time audio thread of an application, and hence cannot do any <b>non-real-time</b> safe operations (disk-accesses, system calls, etc.). To make it easy for the plugin to achieve its goals (e.g.: load a file from disk), the host can provide a worker thread. The host provides the LV2_Extension for the worker thread [...] and the plugin is then able to use it.|$|E
5000|$|Gate weave, {{known in}} this context as [...] "telecine weave" [...] or [...] "telecine wobble", caused by the {{movement}} of the film in the telecine machine gate, is a characteristic artifact of real-time telecine scanning. Numerous techniques have been tried to minimize gate weave, using both improvements in mechanical film handling and electronic post-processing. Line-scan telecines are less vulnerable to frame-to-frame judder than machines with conventional film gates, and <b>non-real-time</b> machines are also less vulnerable to gate weave than real-time machines. Some gate weave is inherent in film cinematography, as it introduced by the film handling within the original film camera: modern digital image stabilization techniques can remove both this and telecine/scanner gate weave.|$|E
5000|$|One {{compelling}} {{example of}} the need for QoS on the Internet relates to congestion collapse. The Internet relies on congestion avoidance protocols, as built into Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), to reduce traffic under conditions that would otherwise lead to [...] "meltdown". QoS applications, such as VoIP and IPTV, require largely constant bitrates and low latency, therefore they cannot use TCP and cannot otherwise reduce their traffic rate to help prevent congestion. QoS contracts limit traffic that can be offered to the Internet and thereby enforce traffic shaping that can prevent it from becoming overloaded, and are hence an indispensable part of the Internet's ability to handle a mix of real-time and <b>non-real-time</b> traffic without meltdown.|$|E
