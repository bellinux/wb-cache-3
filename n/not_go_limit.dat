30|$|The {{proposed}} {{clipping circuit}} {{was comprised of}} four comparators whose job was {{to ensure that the}} state variable function w(t) did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond its <b>limits.</b> The comparators clipped w(t) at its top and bottom boundaries. It basically acts as a switch in which if the comparators detect a certain value in the device they activate a switch and set the device at a particular voltage. So, when w(t) reached the upper boundary of the device, the device is connected to a voltage source of value D, which effectively clips w(t) at D. This operation occurs when the voltage bias is positive.|$|R

50|$|At {{unspecified}} time Cárcer {{was nominated}} to the Valencian ayuntamiento; {{according to some}} sources the appointment might {{have taken place in}} 1926 and according to other it occurred in January 1927. Neither his exact position nor role is clear; referred to either as regidor, concejal or teniente de alcalde, he was noted as engaged in trade, scholarship, festivities and local suburban administration. He resigned from the city council in August 1928, but in February 1929 was again noted as active; it is not clear when he ceased. Received by Alfonso XIII in 1930, in the early 1931 he was acknowledged as running in the local elections, but nothing is known of their outcome; most likely he lost.In the early months of the Republic Cárcer, initially appearing at good terms with local authorities, engaged in conservative meetings united with his old-time rival, Chicharro. Some sources report him taking part in the pro-Alfonsist Acción Española and running for the Cortes from Albocàsser and Vinaròs, information not confirmed elsewhere. By the Left he was clearly recognized as a reactionary enemy: in September 1931 some of his property went up in flames. In February 1932 the civil governor acknowledged him as inflammatory speaker and declared that his meetings would be monitored by the security to ensure he does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> off <b>limits.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Middleware is {{actually}} a resource manager that guarantees the implementation of all policies, contracts to be satisfied, and it ensures that contracts do <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond the <b>limits</b> of network capacity. It also authentication, so that only the legitimate users could avail the network resources according to the agreed format. The middleware {{is supposed to be}} the backbone for QoS assurance and the system behavior depends on it. This paper proposes design of a middleware based on a bandwidth constrained QoS model for multi hop ad hoc networks. Our model is designed not only on the basis of conceptualization but we have considered the basic functionalities available in networking equipments like routers etc. The elements of QoS aware middleware are admission control, resource reservation, policy control and a feedback module. Finally we discuss our future work to find the primary and alternative route to the destinations by keeping the bandwidth constraints in mind...|$|R
40|$|Even {{with much}} {{activity}} {{over the past}} decade, including organized efforts {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the representation of both space and time in digital databases is still problematic and functional space-time systems have <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> beyond the <b>limited</b> prototype stage. Why is this the case? Why did it take twenty years from the ®rst GIS for the for representation and analysis in the temporal, as well as the spatial dimension, to begin? I explore the answers to these questions by giving a historical overview of the development of space-time representation in the geographic information systems and database communities and a review of the most recent research. Within the context of this perspective, I also question what seems to be a spirit of self-accusation in which the lack of functional space-time systems has been discussed in the literature and in meetings of GIS researchers. I close by offering my own interpretation of current research issues on space-time data models and languages...|$|R

When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond the <b>limit</b> to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|R
40|$|On the {{principle}} of urban and rural land resources overall allocation, aiming at serving the urbanization development and new socialist countryside construction, the urban and rural land resource demand have been forecasted under the two scenarios of benchmark-growth and high-growth based on the analysis of economic growth and construction land demand trend of eastern coastal areas in 2010 and 2020. The results of demand forecast of the construction land show 1056. 9 × 10 4 hm 2 in 2010 and 1153. 4 × 10 4 hm 2 in 2020. The average annual increment of construction land is 17. 45 × 10 4 hm 2 from 1996 to 2004. In the following 15 years, the ratio of construction land digging out potential through improving the existing land and rural land redevelopment will be 3. 7 % in 2010 and 9. 3 % in 2020, {{in order to ensure}} that the construction land use would <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond the <b>limit</b> in the process of rapid urbanization and industrialization in eastern coastal areas. Finally, aiming at the regional land resource safety, some measures to advance urban-rural harmonious development energetically and land resource sustainable use in eastern coastal developed areas of China have been put forward...|$|R
40|$|Areas {{the most}} {{susceptible}} to wind erosion {{were chosen for}} the comparison of potential and real erodibility of soil by wind. All the areas {{are located in the}} Southern Moravia, the south-east of the Czech Republic. Ambulatory measurements of parameters required for wind erodibility determination were done during 2006 in three districts that are heavily endangered by wind erosion (districts of Breclav, Znojmo and Uherske Hradiste). Potential and real erodibility by wind was determined from wind velocity, soil humidity, content of clay and non-erodible soil particles. Potential soil loss does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> over the <b>limit</b> of the tolerable amount of soil loss 10 t. ha –  1. year –  1 at any studied area, even though all the three areas belong to the ones strongly susceptible to wind erosion. On the other hand, the tolerable soil loss for real erodibility 1. 4 g. m –  2 was exceeded at two regions. Non-objectivity in the erodibility evaluation of heavy clay soils follows out of the results, as so as evident necessity of new knowledge concerning the determination of wind erosion intensity, because to date used equations come out of presumption that the more clay particles soil contains, the less susceptible to wind erosion is, which is inaccurate...|$|R
40|$|Varying {{numbers of}} adult desert pupfish (Cyprinodon macularius) and {{mosquitofish}} (Gambusia affinis) were introduced separately into experimental habitats open to egress to determine resource requirements for each species and {{the relation between}} numbers and resources. Laboratory environments in which "voluntary" colonization was achieved, were created for both species. Results indicated that both species have the innate ability to regulate numbers in their respective populations to available resources via emigration. The number of resident fish varied directly with experimental reductions of cover. When adult mosquitofish were introduced into open tanks with established populations of adult desert pupfish in habitats containing constant resources, {{there was no significant}} change in population size for either species as compared to single species populations over a 5 -day period. Adult desert pupfish and mosquitofish are able to coexist successfully in habitats open to egress for 5 days because they utilize available resources in very different ways and the number of fish that become residents do <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond resource <b>limits.</b> These data suggest that replacement of desert pupfish by mosquitofish in the American Southwest is a phenomenon that is the result of more long-term interactions between all life stages of the species and {{may be more likely to}} occur in environments of low complexity and closed to egress...|$|R

Hunting is magnificent up to the moment the shot is fired. After that it is another matter. It is useless for sportsmen {{to tell me that}} they, in particular, hunt right, conserve the game, do <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond the <b>limit,</b> and all that sort of thing. I do not believe them and I never met the guide who did. A rifle is made for killing. When a man goes out with one he means to kill. He may keep within the law, {{but that is not the}} question. It is a question of spirit, and men who love to hunt are yielding to and always developing the old primitive instinct to kill. The meaning of the spirit of life is not clear to them. An argument may be advanced that, according to the laws of self-preservation and the survival of the fittest, if a man stops all strife, all fight, then he will retrograde. And that is to say if a man does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> to the wilds now and then, and work hard and live some semblance of the life of his progenitors, he will weaken. It seems that he will, but I am not prepared now to say whether or not that would be well.

6000|$|September 29th.--Yesterday {{we walked}} to the British Museum. A {{sentinel}} or two kept guard before the gateway of this extensive edifice in Great Russell Street, and there was a porter at the lodge, and one or two policemen lounging about, but entrance was free, and we walked in without question. Officials and policemen were likewise scattered about the great entrance-hall, none of whom, however, interfered with us; so we took whatever way we chose, and wandered about at will. It is a hopeless, and to me, generally, a depressing business to go through an immense multifarious show like this, glancing at a thousand things, and conscious of some little titillation of mind from them, but really taking in nothing, and getting no good from anything. One need <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond the <b>limits</b> of the British Museum to be profoundly accomplished in all branches of science, art, and literature; only it would take a lifetime to exhaust it in any one department; but to see it as we did, and with no prospect of ever seeing it more at leisure, only impressed me with the truth of the old apothegm, [...] "Life is short, and Art is long." [...] The fact is, the world is accumulating too many materials for knowledge. We do not recognize for rubbish what is really rubbish; and under this head might be reckoned very many things one sees in the British Museum; and, as each generation leaves its fragments and potsherds behind it, such will finally be the desperate conclusion of the learned.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} large sample of {{candidate}} galaxies at z ≈ 7 – 10, {{selected in the}} Hubble Ultra Deep Field using the new observations of the Wide Field Camera 3 that was recently installed to Hubble Space Telescope. Our independent analysis does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond the <b>limit</b> that the current data allow, but is more complete at the faint levels as compared to other studies. In addition, we have extended our search to z ≈ 10, which is a new regime {{that has not yet}} been probed. To date, our sample is the largest one of its kind, and is composed of 20 z 850 -dropouts (four new discoveries), 15 Y 105 -dropouts (nine new discoveries) and 20 J 125 -dropouts (all new discoveries). While the surface densities of the z 850 -dropouts are close to what predicted by earlier studies, those of the Y 105 - and J 125 -dropouts are completely unexpected. To describe the inferred luminosity functions at z ≈ 8 – 10, we are forced to evoke a set of extremely unusual Schechter function parameters: as compared to their counterpart at z ≈ 7, here L ∗ decreases by a factor of ten and Φ ∗ increases by two orders of magnitude. Assuming that the fitted Schechter luminosity functions are still valid beyond our current detection limit, this would imply a sudden emergence {{of a large number of}} low-luminosity galaxies when looking back in time to z ≈ 10, which, while seemingly exotic, would naturally fit in the picture of the cosmic hydroge...|$|R
40|$|International {{intellectual}} property (IP) protection {{is at the}} heart of controversies over the impact of economic interests on social or environmental concerns. Some see IP rights as unduly encroaching upon human rights and societal interests, others argue for stronger enforcement and additional exclusivity to incentivize new innovations and creations. Underlying these debates is the perception that international IP treaties set out minimum standards of protection - which presumably allow for additional protection with only the sky being the limit. This article challenges this view and explores the idea of maximum standards or ceilings within the existing body of international IP law. It looks at the relation between IP treaties and subsequent agreements or national laws which offer stronger protection. In particular, within the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), an important qualification may serve as a door opener for ceilings: While additional IP protection may <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond mandatory <b>limits</b> within TRIPS, the qualification not to “contravene” TRIPS is unlikely to safeguard TRIPS flexibilities against TRIPS-plus norms. The article further identifies and examines the rationales for maximum standards in international IP protection as: (1) Legal security and predictability about the boundaries of protection; (2) the global protection of users’ rights; and (3) the free movement of goods, services and information. Examples of mandatory limits in the existing IP treaties and in ongoing initiatives can implement these. However, most of the relevant treaty norms are optional. The article concludes with some observations on the need for more comprehensive and precise maximum standards...|$|R
