[...] The Department established an expert committee comprising twelve people, including ten medical specialists. It first met on 24 September 2013 and was originally expected to report within three months. One task was appointing doctors to the review and appeals panels required by the Act, which was accomplished by December. On 19 December 2013, Minister Reilly signed several statutory instruments: those specifying regulations for certification, review, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions,</b> and a commencement order specifying 1 January 2014 as the date the Act and regulations would come into force.|$|E

In this special, various authors have reflected on the successfulness of a broad codification process in 1998, which introduced rules on the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions,</b> policy rules, subsidies, enforcement and supervision of administrative authorities in the Dutch General Administrative Law Act (GALA). The editors asked the contributors whether {{the objectives of the}} rules introduced were met and how the rules turned out to function in practice. In this overarching article, the NALL-editors reflect on the general lessons to be learned for the GALA-legislator. In these lessons they also take into consideration the initiatives for a law of administrative procedure of the European Union...|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the Department of Immigration’s (DIAC) {{obligation}} to provide an unsuccessful visa applicant with a letter that clearly explains the decision and information about DIAC’s <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> adverse <b>decisions</b> was not well coordinated or consistent. There was variation in the quality <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> letters, many <b>of</b> which fell short of best practice standards. The Ombudsman recommended that DIAC conduct {{a comprehensive review of}} its management <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> letters, to improve their quality and consistency. Specific recommendations in the report were for DIAC to introduce quality assurance measures, introduce consistent letter templates, use plain English in letters, improve the description of review rights and adopt minimum standards for explaining the reasons for decisions. DIAC has accepted all the Ombudsman’s recommendations. The Ombudsman notes the reforms that have been implemented by DIAC, as part of a more sweeping reform program in the Department. These include the introduction of a Letter Improvement Program, and publication of a Best Practice Guide for reasons for decision, based on an Administrative Review Council publication. The Ombudsman’s report also notes the complex task faced by DIAC in dealing with over 12, 000 visa applications each day, relating to over 140 different visa classes, processed at 68 offices overseas and nine offices in Australia...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of supply chains {{is a very}} comprehensive task. Predictability and response to incidents in process executions are challenging. With Supply Chain Event Management (SCEM), researchers propose an approach for overcoming these problems through proactive monitoring and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> crucial process activities across the supply chain. The identification and definition of such crucial activities and information needs are necessary to handle possible abnormalities although they are challenging task which have not been solved in SCEM research so far. Hence, we propose a modeling approach which allows the conceptual specification of an adequate information exchange along the supply chain.

40|$|In a service-oriented architecture, {{adaptive}} and evolvable applications {{should be}} able to select, configure and compose different existing application services to deal with the changes which can arise from runtime contextual changes or the change of user requirements and preferences. To support this, hybrid service composition approaches have been proposed, in which the core of the application logic is specified in terms of processes, while rules are employed to specify the conditions and constraints to adapt the application behaviour. The rules are then exposed as a decision service which can be employed by the process to make adaptation decision with respect to runtime circumstances. The interaction between processes and decision services are generally performed in a synchronous request-response manner. We argue that such an interaction is not efficient to support different types of adaptation at runtime and therefore asynchronous interaction should also be supported. In this paper, we present an adaptive service provisioning architecture and a decision service template allowing both synchronous request-response interaction and asynchronous notification. To motivate the proposed architecture and the decision service template, we use a blood pressure monitoring scenario from the homecare domain. We also explain the implementation of the proposed approach based on commercially available rule and process engines. Finally, we discuss: 1) what is the efficient way (synchronous request-response interaction vs. asynchronous <b>notification)</b> <b>of</b> calling <b>decision</b> service to execute different types <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> rules; and 2) to what extent the use <b>of</b> a <b>decision</b> service facilitates dealing with unforeseen changes...|$|R
5000|$|So-called [...] "centralised" [...] (European Medicines Agency / European Commission) MAs were {{introduced}} by Regulation 2309/93 and became available in January 1995 (i.e. some 2 {{years after the}} introduction of the original SPC legislation for medicinal products). The introduction of these authorisations added a new layer of complexity to the issue of determination of the date of a MA. This is because there are two dates associated with [...] "centralised" [...] authorisations, namely: (1) the date of the European Commission's decision to issue an authorisation; and (2) the date <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> that <b>decision</b> to the MA applicant. Date (2) is usually a few days (e.g. 2 to 4 days) later than date (1). Although the standard practice of many national patent offices seems to be to calculate SPC term based upon date (1), an October 2011 article in Scrip Regulatory Affairs by Mike Snodin argues that this standard practice is incorrect and that date (2) should be used instead (with the result that some products may be entitled to a slightly longer SPC term than previously thought). Paramount amongst the reasons for preferring date (2) to date (1) is that a [...] "centralised" [...] authorisation does not become effective until it is notified to the MA applicant.|$|R

Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
