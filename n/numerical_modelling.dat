Advances in <b>numerical</b> <b>modeling</b> methodologies and the ability to collect high-resolution position data of salmonids within a reservoir have led to interesting issues of <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> calibration. Presently, more emphasis is being placed on higher-order hydrodynamics, such as accelerations, turbulence and energy dissipation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> is {{developed}} to investigate long-term soil-geosyn-thetic interaction in typical geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures. The <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> employs the {{finite element method}} with a time marching scheme while incorpo-rating a generalized creep law for geosynthetics and a visco-plastic constitutive law for soil. To verify the <b>numerical</b> <b>model,</b> two well-controlled laboratory long-term soil-geo-synthetic performance tests were analyzed. One performance test used cohesive back-fill {{and the other a}} granular backfill. As a result of soil-geosynthetic interaction, the cohesive backfill test exhibited significant deformation with time, while the granular backfill test demonstrated little deformation with time. It is shown that the <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> is capable of simulating the long-term soil-geosynthetic interactive behavior of both long-term performance tests. To illustrate the importance of the long-term soil-geosynthetic interaction, the <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> was used to analyze the long-term per-formance of two 3 m high geosynthetic-reinforced soil retainingwalls, onewith a cohe...|$|R

The methods of {{development of a new}} dynamic component for a <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> of cavitation mass transfer is presented in the paper. Application of the new method resulted in a new dynamic component for <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> of cavitation mass transfer, which takes into account fluid viscosity in Reley-Plesset equation. Relying on the methods being considered fundamentally new hydroautomatic devices such as cavitation mass flow stabilizers and flow dividers could be designed. The new dynamic component has become the basis for the new <b>numerical</b> <b>model</b> of cavitation mass transfer.
