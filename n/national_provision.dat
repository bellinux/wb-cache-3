The school employs 81 staff, including teachers, therapists and autism consultants, and the school board is headed by founder, ARC president and Member of Parliament Denise Phua. Operating costs of the school are paid by the Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service, while other costs, estimated at S$5 million per year, are funded through fees, donations, merchandise sales and fundraising events. Under the partnership between Pathlight School and Eden School, the two schools have a centralised admission system and share various resources; together, they form the <b>national</b> <b>provision</b> of education for children across the autism spectrum.|$|E

60|$|Among other shopkeepers in the High Street {{there was}} Chuffles, the grocer, a small, hairy, silently intent polygamist, who was given rough music by {{the youth of}} the {{neighbourhood}} because of a scandal about his wife's sister, and who was nevertheless totally uninteresting, and Tonks, the second grocer, {{an old man with}} an older, very enfeebled wife, both submerged by piety.

5000|$|In Case E-5/15, Matja Kumba, the {{national}} court asked, firstly, whether an average weekly working time of 84 hours (7-7 rotation) in a cohabitant care arrangement constitutes {{a breach of}} Article 6 of the Working Time Directive (Directive 2003/88/EC); secondly, whether a <b>national</b> <b>provision,</b> under which an employee’s consent to working more than 60 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement cannot be revoked, {{is compatible with the}} rights that employees have under the Directive; and thirdly, whether a dismissal following a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment” within the meaning of the Directive. With regard to the first question, the Court noted that it is for {{the national}} court to assess the amount of working time in the case at hand, taking into account the factors clarified by the Court. Working time amounting to an average of 84 hours per week in a cohabitant care arrangement is compatible with Article 6 of the Directive, in circumstances governed by Article 22(1)(a), provided that the worker has explicitly, freely and individually agreed to perform such work, and the general principles of the protection of the safety and health of the worker are observed. With regard to the second question, the Court noted that the Directive does not contain a provision concerning revocation of consent. It is for national law to determine whether such revocation of consent is possible. However, a complete inability to revoke consent, even in exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, may prove incompatible with the Directive, since the possibility for a worker to consent to exceeding the maximum weekly working time is expressly conditional on the EEA State respecting the general principles of the protection of {{the health and safety of}} workers, cf. Article 22(1)(a) of the Directive. With regard to the third question, the Court noted that, typically, a dismissal due to a failure to consent to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period constitutes a “detriment”. However, a notice of dismissal and offer of re-engagement on new terms, following a refusal by a worker to agree to a working time arrangement of more than 48 hours over a seven-day period, is not to be considered a “detriment” if the termination of the employment is based upon reasons that are fully independent of the worker’s refusal to agree to perform such additional work.|$|E

40|$|Defence date: 26 April 2012 Examining Board: Professor Heike Schweitzer, Universität Mannheim and European University Institute (Supervisor) Professor Hans-Wolfgang Micklitz, European University Institute Professor Lorenzo F. Pace, Università degli Studi del Molise Professor Harm Schepel, Kent Law SchoolThe {{enactment}} of Regulation 1 / 2003 radically {{changed the rules}} for the application of Art. 101 and Art. 102 TFEU, replacing the existing system of prior administrative authorisation by one of a directly applicable exception coupled with the possibility of national authorities applying Art. 101 (3) TFEU. Concerns over substantial consistency in the application of European competition law (“ECL”) were the main reason for the introduction of the so-called rule of convergence under Art. 3 of Regulation 1 / 2003. Although Art. 3 expanded and gave statutory weight to the assertion of supremacy of ECL over national competition law (“NCL”), initially acknowledged in the Walt Wilhelm judgement, it did not rule out completely the possibility of Member States applying stricter NCL to unilateral conduct adopted by undertakings (Art. 3 (2) second sentence). Prima facie, the exception would cover <b>national</b> <b>provisions</b> prohibiting the abuse of economic dependence/superior bargaining power, resale below cost/at a loss, as well as some types of unilateral conduct not related to economic dependence (e. g. boycott). An inquiry into four selected jurisdictions (France, Germany, Italy and the UK) reveals that not all <b>national</b> <b>provisions</b> whose primary goal is “the protection of competition on the market” (Rec. 9 of Regulation 1 / 2003) should be taken as a legitimate manifestation of plurality compatible with the concerns over substantive consistency mirrored in Art. 3 (2) second sentence. The primary reason for this selective approach is that some <b>national</b> <b>provisions,</b> in particular those that prohibit per se resale below cost/at a loss, want a valid economic rationale for the purpose of competition law. Conversely, other stricter <b>national</b> <b>provisions</b> may be regarded as performing a complementary role vis-à-vis ECL, as it may be the case of the prohibition of economic dependence applied to the automotive and food-supply sectors. Despite the substantial changes introduced by Art. 3 in the relationship between ECL and NCL, Art. 3 (2) second sentence can be regarded as a continuation of the case law inaugurated by the Walt Wilhelm judgement, recognising, albeit in more limited terms, that “unitas in diversitate” is an integrating part of competition law...|$|R
