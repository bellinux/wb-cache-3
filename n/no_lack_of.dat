25|$|This {{conclusion}} was challenged {{in the same}} journal by James R.

Furthermore, <b>no</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> awareness of blindness (a characteristic of cortical blindness) was reported in Acts, {{nor is there any}} indication of memory loss. Additionally, Paul's blindness remitted in sudden fashion, rather than the gradual resolution typical of post-ictal states, and no mention is made of epileptic convulsions; indeed such convulsions may, in Paul's time, have been interpreted as a sign of demonic influence, unlikely in someone accepted as a religious leader.|$|E
25|$|The poor {{financial}} {{returns on}} investment of all small Ontario railways {{in the late}} 1870s caused severe discontent among the bondholders. Many charged that the TG's troubles were due to the narrow gauge which made freight haulage uneconomic. From 1877 there were many calls for converting the gauge to standard gauge, {{but in fact the}} line had <b>no</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> capacity. The real issue was overcapacity during a protracted traffic slump. In any case no-one would volunteer the capital to convert the gauge. Eventually there were warnings that the line was becoming unsafe due to the deterioration of wooden trestles and iron rails, and would soon have to close. The Bondholders lost patience and seized the line. They approached the Grand Trunk Railway, which obtained control of the TG and financed the renewals and gauge conversion in late 1881. Unfortunately the GTR encountered its own financial problems in digesting the Great Western Railway, and had to cede control to the Ontario and Quebec Railway, a proxy for the Canadian Pacific Railway, on August 1, 1883.|$|E
5000|$|Section 158 {{provides}} {{instructions on}} {{the proper use of}} EMHC: [...] "the extraordinary minister of Holy Communion may administer Communion only when the Priest and Deacon are lacking, when the Priest is prevented by weakness or advanced age or some other genuine reason, or when the number of faithful coming to Communion is so great that the very celebration of Mass would be unduly prolonged." [...] However, many parishes do not follow these instructions. This is contrary to Canon Law. [...] Some routinely use EMHCs when there is <b>no</b> <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> Priests and Deacons, or they employ a large number of EMHCs, reducing the Communion distribution to a few minutes. One factor is <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge of the Vatican instructions. Another is the popularity of participating in this service.|$|R

Skírnir responds that he is of none of these groups, yet that he has indeed sought her out. Skírnir offers Gerðr 11 golden apples (or apples of eternal life, in a common emendation) to gain her favor. Gerðr rejects the apples—no matter who offers them—and adds that neither will she and Freyr be together {{as long as they}} live. Skírnir offers Gerðr a ring, here unnamed, that produces eight more gold rings every ninth night and [...] "was burned with Odin's young son". Gerðr responds that she is not interested in the ring, for she shares her father's property, and Gymir has <b>no</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> gold.|$|E
500|$|Following his death, Watts' mother {{moved the}} family to Llanfawr Farm in Llangefni and Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, towns {{on the island of}} Anglesey in North Wales, where they lived with Watts' {{maternal}} grandparents, Nikki and Hugh Roberts, for three years. During this time, Watts attended a Welsh language school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni. She later said of her time in Wales: [...] "We took Welsh lessons in a school {{in the middle of nowhere}} while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt and pick up the regional accent. It's obviously significant now, me being an actress. Anyway, there was quite a lot of sadness in my childhood, but <b>no</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> love." [...] In 1978, her mother remarried (though she would later be divorced again) and Watts and her brother then moved to Suffolk, where she attended Thomas Mills High School. Watts has stated that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and from the time she watched the 1980 film Fame.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{significance}} that the Great Wall seemed to have, scholarly {{treatment of the}} Wall itself remained scant during the 20th century. Joseph Needham bemoaned this dearth when he was compiling the section on walls for his Science and Civilisation in China: [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> travelers' description of the Great Wall, but studies based on modern scholarship {{are few and far}} between, whether in Chinese or Western languages." [...] In 1990, Arthur Waldron published the influential The Great Wall: From History to Myth, where he challenged the notion of a unitary Great Wall maintained since antiquity, dismissing it as a modern myth. Waldron's approach prompted a re-examination of the Wall in Western scholarship. Still, as of 2008, there is not yet a full authoritative text in any language that is devoted to the Great Wall. The reason for this, according to The New Yorker journalist Peter Hessler, is that the Great Wall fits into neither the study of political institutions (favoured by Chinese historians) nor the excavation of tombs (favoured by Chinese archeologists). Some of the void left by academia is being filled by independent research from Great Wall enthusiasts such as ex-Xinhua reporter Cheng Dalin (成大林) and self-funded scholar David Spindler.|$|E

500|$|While animal {{products}} {{were to be}} avoided during times of penance, pragmatic compromises often prevailed. The definition of [...] "fish" [...] was often extended to marine and semi-aquatic animals such as whales, barnacle geese, puffins and even beavers. The choice of ingredients may have been limited, {{but that did not}} mean that meals were smaller. Neither were there any restrictions against (moderate) drinking or eating sweets. Banquets held on fish days could be splendid, and were popular occasions for serving illusion food that imitated meat, cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways; fish could be moulded to look like venison and fake eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish roe and almond milk and cooking them in coals. While Byzantine church officials took a hard-line approach, and discouraged any culinary refinement for the clergy, their Western counterparts were far more lenient. There was also <b>no</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> grumbling about the rigours of fasting among the laity. During Lent, kings and schoolboys, commoners and nobility, all complained about being deprived of meat for the long, hard weeks of solemn contemplation of their sins. At Lent, owners of livestock were even warned to {{keep an eye out for}} hungry dogs frustrated by a [...] "hard siege by Lent and fish bones".|$|E
