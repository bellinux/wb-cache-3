25|$|REM {{sleep is}} physiologically {{different}} from the other phases of sleep, which are collectively referred to as <b>non-REM</b> <b>sleep</b> (NREM sleep, NREMS, synchronized sleep). REM and <b>non-REM</b> <b>sleep</b> alternate within one sleep cycle, which lasts about 90 minutes in adult humans. As sleep cycles continue, they shift towards a higher proportion of REM sleep. The transition to REM sleep brings marked physical changes, beginning with electrical bursts called PGO waves originating in the brain stem. Organisms in REM sleep suspend central homeostasis, allowing large fluctuations in respiration, thermoregulation, and circulation which do not occur in any other modes of sleeping or waking. The body abruptly loses muscle tone, a state known as REM atonia.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the other}} {{observations}} about sleep included decrease of sympathetic activity and increase of parasympathetic activity in <b>non-REM</b> <b>sleep,</b> and increase of heart rate and blood pressure accompanied by decrease in homeostatic response and muscle tone during REM sleep.

25|$|Generally speaking, {{the body}} suspends {{homeostasis}} during paradoxical sleep. Heart rate, cardiac pressure, cardiac output, arterial pressure, and breathing rate quickly become irregular {{when the body}} moves into REM sleep. In general, respiratory reflexes such as response to hypoxia diminish. Overall, the brain exerts less control over breathing; electrical stimulation of respiration-linked brain areas does not influence the lungs, as it does during <b>non-REM</b> <b>sleep</b> and in waking. The fluctuations of heart rate and arterial pressure tend to coincide with PGO waves and rapid eye movements, twitches, or sudden changes in breathing.|$|E
25|$|The main {{function}} of the ARAS is to modify and potentiate thalamic and cortical function such that electroencephalogram (EEG) desynchronization ensues. There are distinct differences in the brain’s electrical activity during periods of wakefulness and sleep: Low voltage fast burst brain waves (EEG desynchronization) are associated with wakefulness and REM sleep (which are electrophysiologically similar); high voltage slow waves are found during <b>non-REM</b> <b>sleep.</b> Generally speaking, when thalamic relay neurons are in burst mode the EEG is synchronized {{and when they are}} in tonic mode it is desynchronized. Stimulation of the ARAS produces EEG desynchronization by suppressing slow cortical waves (0.3–1Hz), delta waves (1–4Hz), and spindle wave oscillations (11–14Hz) and by promoting gamma band (20 – 40Hz) oscillations.|$|E
50|$|REM {{sleep and}} slow-wave sleep play {{different}} roles in memory consolidation. REM {{is associated with}} the consolidation of nondeclarative (implicit) memories. An example of a nondeclarative memory would be a task that we can do without consciously thinking about it, such as riding a bike.

50|$|Sleep is {{important}} for the body in order to restore itself from the depletion of energy during wakefulness and allows for recovery since cell division occurs the fastest during the <b>Non-REM</b> cycle. <b>Sleep</b> is also important for maintaining the functioning of the immune system, as well as helping with the consolidation of information previously learned and experienced into the memory. If sleep deprived, recall of information is typically decreased. Dreams that occur during sleep have been shown to increase mental creativity and problem solving skills.|$|R

25|$|The neural {{control of}} normal sleep {{states and the}} {{relationship}} to narcolepsy are only partially understood. In humans, narcoleptic sleep {{is characterized by a}} tendency to go abruptly from a waking state to REM sleep with little or no intervening <b>non-REM</b> <b>sleep.</b> The changes in the motor and proprioceptive systems during REM sleep have been studied in both human and animal models. During normal REM sleep, spinal and brainstem alpha motor neuron hyperpolarization produces almost complete atonia of skeletal muscles via an inhibitory descending reticulospinal pathway.

In narcolepsy, the reflex inhibition of the motor system seen in cataplexy has features normally seen only in normal REM sleep.|$|E

Initially, {{it was expected that}} the brainstem, which was implicated in arousal would be inactive, but this was later on found to have been due to low resolution of PET studies and it was shown that there is some slow wave activity in the brainstem as well. However, other parts of the brain, including the precuneus, basal forebrain and basal ganglia are deactivated during sleep. Many areas of the cortex are also inactive, but to different levels. For example, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is considered the least active area while the primary cortex, the least deactivated.|$|E
25|$|Mammals have wide {{diversity}} in sleep phenomena. Generally, {{they go through}} periods of alternating non-REM and REM sleep, but these manifest differently. Horses and other herbivorous ungulates can sleep while standing, but must necessarily lie down for REM sleep (which causes muscular atony) for short periods. Giraffes, for example, only need to lie down for REM sleep {{for a few minutes}} at a time. Bats sleep while hanging upside down. Inversely to humans and rats, male armadillos get erections during <b>non-REM</b> <b>sleep.</b> Early mammals engaged in polyphasic sleep, dividing sleep into multiple bouts per day. Higher daily sleep quotas and shorter sleep cycles in polyphasic species as compared to monophasic species, suggest that polyphasic sleep may be a less efficient means of attaining sleep’s benefits. Small species with higher BMR may therefore have less efficient sleep patterns. It follows that the evolution of monophasic sleep may hitherto be an unknown advantage of evolving larger mammalian body sizes and therefore lower BMR.|$|E

25|$|Dr. David M. Maurice (1922-2002), an eye {{specialist}} and semi-retired adjunct professor at Columbia University, proposed that REM sleep {{was associated with}} oxygen supply to the cornea, and that aqueous humor, the liquid between cornea and iris, was stagnant if not stirred. Among the supportive evidences, he calculated that if aqueous humor was stagnant, oxygen from iris had to reach cornea by diffusion through aqueous humor, which was not sufficient. According to the theory, when the animal is awake, eye movement (or cool environmental temperature) enables the aqueous humor to circulate. When the animal is sleeping, REM provides the much-needed stir to aqueous humor. This theory {{is consistent with the}} observation that fetuses, as well as eye-sealed newborn animals, spend much time in REM sleep, and that during a normal sleep, a person's REM sleep episodes become progressively longer deeper into the night.
