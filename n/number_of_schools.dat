5|$|Many of the government-operated {{residential}} {{schools were}} run by churches of various denominations, {{with the majority}} administered by Roman Catholics. Between 1867 and 1939, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> operating at one time peaked at 80 schools in 1931. Of those schools, 44 were operated by Roman Catholics; 21 were operated by the Church of England / Anglican Church of Canada; 13 were operated by the United Church of Canada, and 2 were operated by Presbyterians. The approach of using established school facilities set up by missionaries was employed {{by the federal government}} for economic expedience: the government provided facilities and maintenance, while the churches provided teachers and their own lesson-planning. As a result, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> per denomination was less a reflection of their presence in the general population, but rather their legacy of missionary work.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, as Gothic art {{gave way}} to the International Gothic era, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> {{developed}} in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of illuminated manuscripts. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as Melchior Broederlam and Robert Campin, the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship. Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and House of Valois-Anjou dukes such as Philip the Bold, Louis I of Anjou and Jean, Duke of Berry. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, Philip the Good and his son Charles the Bold. The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined {{towards the end of the}} century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and prints, both engravings and woodcuts, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as Martin Schongauer and Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
