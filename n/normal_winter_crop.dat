40|$|India is {{predicted}} {{to be one of}} the most vulnerable agricultural regions to future climate changes. Here, we examined the sensitivity of <b>winter</b> <b>cropping</b> systems to inter-annual climate variability in a local market and subsistence-based agricultural system in central India, a data-rich validation site, in order to identify the climate parameters to which <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> – mainly wheat and pulses in this region – might be sensitive in the future. We used satellite time-series data to quantify inter-annual variability in multiple climate parameters and in <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> cover, agricultural census data to quantify irrigation, and field observations to identify locations for specific crop types. We developed three mixed-effect models (250 m to 1 km scale) to identify correlations between crop cover (wheat and pulses) and twenty-two climate and environmental parameters for 2001 - 2013. We find that winter daytime mean temperature (November–January) is the most significant factor affecting <b>winter</b> <b>crops,</b> irrespective of crop type, and is negatively associated with <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> cover. With pronounced winter warming projected in the coming decades, effective adaptation by smallholder farmers in similar landscapes would require additional strategies, such as access to fine-scale temperature forecasts and heat-tolerant <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> varieties...|$|R

40|$|Pigeonpeas (Cajanus cajan) are {{normally}} sown in June or July in India, {{at the beginning}} of the monsoon, but trials were carried out at Hyderabad by sowing in October or November as a <b>winter</b> <b>crop.</b> The duration of the crop, especially of the ‘medium’ and ‘late’ cultivars, was much reduced. In 1975 – 76, October-sown pigeonpeas gave yields comparable to those of the normal season but much lower yields were produced by planting in November 1975. ‘Medium’ and ‘late’ cultivars significantly outyielded early ones. Optimum plant populations for <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> were 3 – 5 times higher than {{are normally}} used in the monsoon.

40|$|Vegetation {{in natural}} desert and agro-ecosystems was {{investigated}} in the middle sector of Egypt. The vegetation was classified by the Two Way Indicator Species Analysis technique (TWINSPAN) into nine vegetational groups representing seven habitat types: desert, fallow land, <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> of old cultivated land, summer crops of old cultivated land, Citrus orchards, <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> of reclaimed land, and summer crops of reclaimed land. Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) demonstrates that soil factors especially soil texture, CaCO 3, organic carbon and electric conductivity contribute significantly to the distribution of species. In all habitat types, species diversity is higher in winter than in summer season. The weed species diversity is greater in the reclaimed areas compared to the old cultivated land and in <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> than in summer ones...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the study of small mammal {{communities}} (species composition, daily activity and spatial distribution) in the agrocoenosis. The fields of <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> that were surrounded by similar fields or by <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> with meadow vegetation were researched. The Mus musculus became the dominant species in the <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> agrocoenosis. The R. Sylvaemus living near the border with field-protective forest belts (and 25 meters field around) are subdominant group. Marked single finds Mus musculus in the forest and R. Sylvaemus in the field (at a distance before 50 meters). It is shown that the presence of meadow vegetation increases the species diversity of mice in the agrocoenosis. In the middle of this field a subdominantion group is Microtus arvalis s. l. and Cricetulus migratorius. The both species prefer a neighborhood with meadow vegetation. The method of recapture, followed by labeling with animals, made it possible to fix the movement for a distance of about 400 m. during the night (maximum values were males Mus musculus). The activity of small mammals in the <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> was timed to coincide with the day-night cycles, with high activity from 01 : 00 to 04 : 00 am, and minimum activity after 09 : 00 hours of the morning before 08 : 00 p...|$|R

40|$|Autumn Northern Bullfinch {{abundance}} at bird observatories {{around the}} Baltic Sea con-firmed periodic irruptive behaviour outside of its <b>normal</b> <b>wintering</b> range, but age-ratio data suggested dispersal was not linked to reproductive success. Rowan berries are im-portant food of Fennoscandian Northern Bullfinches and show synchronised masting in annual fruit production over large spatial scales. Norwegian and Finnish annual berry abundance indices from 1972 – 2004 {{were used to}} test the hypothesis that poor rowanberry production in <b>normal</b> <b>wintering</b> areas was responsible for efflux of birds to other areas. Annual Finnish wintering bird surveys and catches at local bird observatories correlated with rowanberry abundance indices, supporting the prediction that highest Bullfinch abundance would occur in <b>normal</b> <b>wintering</b> areas in years with heavy rowanberry crops. Northern Bullfinch autumn abundance at Danish and Swedish bird observatories (outside the <b>normal</b> <b>winter</b> range) showed inverse correlations with Norwegian rowanberry crops, supporting the prediction of highest irruptions in years of lowest rowanberry abundance from the <b>normal</b> <b>wintering</b> range. These data suggest that at large spatial scales, berry masting can have profound effects on the annual distribution and migratory behaviour of birds consuming the crop. 1...|$|R
40|$|Optimized {{application}} of nitrogen from livestock manure will reduce nitrogen losses {{and result in}} higher yields. Practical recommendation Nitrogen application from livestock manure to <b>winter</b> and spring <b>crops</b> has different effects on crop yields depending on the pre-crop {{and the amount of}} ammonium-N provided. The results above show that nitrogen availability from livestock manure is limited. Based on the results, the following recommendations can be made: •	If the pre-crop is not nitrogen-fixing, apply 20 to 60 kg of ammonium-N from livestock manure prior to sowing of crops. •	Livestock manure application to a spring crop after nitrogen-fixing clover-grass is not yield effective and may bear the risk of nitrogen losses. •	If livestock manure is difficult to access, choose cereals that are competitive against weeds. Spring oats and win-ter rye are the best options for spring- and <b>winter</b> <b>crops,</b> respectively. •	Where nitrogen is a limited resource, yield potential is higher in <b>winter</b> <b>crops</b> than in spring crops. If weeds are abundant and difficult to control in a poorly fertilized <b>winter</b> <b>crop,</b> spring crops might be the better option. •	Try not to compromise the nitrogen-supply of certain grass seeds, i. e. ryegrass, which need at least 100 to 110 kg of ammonium-N per ha for optimum growth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{remote sensing}} {{technology}} {{in combination with}} geographic information system (GIS) can render reliable information on land use change detection. The analysis of the spatial extent and temporal change of cropland using remotely sensed data is of critical importance to agricultural sciences. This study described a method of using reflectance factor of multi-sensor data for identification and detection of change of the <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> cultivated land. For this study the LANDSAT images (MSS, TM and ETM+) of Durgapur Upazila/Thana during winter season were acquired of 02 Feb., 1977, 11 Nov., 1998 and 17 Nov., 2000. For the recognition of feature from the images, supervised classification was followed. The images were classified into four significant land uses/land covers type viz. cropped area, current fallow (agricultural) land, water bodies and marshy land. These classification types were identified based on the land use classification scheme level- 1. For generating the <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> cultivated area map, pixels of <b>winter</b> <b>crop</b> area were extracted from the classified image of each date. Afterwards, winter cultivate...|$|R
40|$|Temperatures {{from the}} end of October until mid-November were well above average across most of Europe, and the highest in our records (since 1975) for the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Baltic countries.
