Based on periodic surveys conducted between December, 1967 and June, 1968, numbers of harbor seals in Oregon were estimated to be not more than 500 in 1967 - 68 and most were found outside estuaries on offshore islands. However, a population of harbor seals in excess of 2, 000 was once found in Oregon. Simpson Reef, Hunter's Island, Rogue River Reef, and Gull Rock were locations of the major concentrations of harbor seals in Oregon. The Columbia River, once attested to have {{the greatest number of}} seals in Oregon, now has no year-around resident seals, and the number of seals entering the river or remaining in the river for extended periods appears to be at an all-time low. Numbers of <b>northern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> in Oregon were estimated to be about 1, 000 in 1967 - 68. There were two breeding colonies or rookeries in Oregon, the largest on Orford Reef 3 nd the smaller at <b>Sea</b> <b>Lion</b> Caves. Other locations used by <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> included the Rogue River Reef, Simpson Reef, Three Arch Rock, and Tillamook Head. Since Kenyon and Scheffer (1953) previously estimated the <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> population of Oregon to be 1, 000 animals in 1953, it was concluded that the population in Oregon was relatively stable.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{the literature on}} incidental catches of pinnipeds by commercial fisheries using both passive and active fishing gear. Few incidental catch data were available for most species, although {{a substantial amount of}} information has recently become available for species in the North Pacific Ocean and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean off Eastern Canada. Incidental catches in passive gear appear to be of sufficient magnitude to have contributed to population declines of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and Kuril seals (Phoca vitulina stejnegeri) in the North Pacific and harp seals (P. groenlandica) from the Barents Sea. Incidental catches in active gear appear at least partially responsible for the decline of <b>northern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Eumetopias jubatus) in the North Pacific. Detrimental impacts of incidental catches are also indicated for New Zealand <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Phocarctos hookeri) off the Auckland Islands, harbour seals (P. vitulina concolor) off Newfoundland and Alaska, grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the eastern Baltic and for endangered Mediterranean (Monachus monachus) and Hawaiian (M. schauinslandi) monk seals. Several factors appear to influence incidental catches of pinnipeds, including behavioural traits of individual species, age of individuals, fishing gear type, and the temporal and spatial overlap of a species' range with fishing activities. More and better data on incidental catches of marine mammals (pinnipeds and cetaceans) and sea-birds by individual fisheries are required in order to evaluate properly the magnitude of the problems and their potential impact on specific populations...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 This paper lists, {{and gives}} {{individual}} accounts of, those Oregon mammals {{that at some}} time have {{been referred to as}} being of a status other than common. Although rare and endangered wildlife species were listed on a national level in the United States, the large areas of land included in the range of some species often allow population changes in local areas to go undetected. Several authorities have recognized the need for local and regional studies to determine the status of wildlife species. No comprehensive study of the mammals of Oregon has been conducted since 1936. I reviewed the available literature concerning Oregon mammals and compiled a working list of species. All species that were referred to as "uncommon, rare, or scarce" were included for additional study. Specimens deposited in museum and personal collections were examined and the date and location of collection of specimens of each species under investigation were recorded. Collection sites of specimens were depicted on maps. Mammalogists, game biologists, naturalists, trappers, and outdoorsmen having knowledge of Oregon mammals were interviewed, and asked to comment on the current distribution and abundance of the species with which they were familiar. Information from all sources was used to develop criteria for placing each species into one of the following categories: recently extirpated, endangered, rare, status undetermined, or not presently rare or endangered. Mammals were classified as follows: Mammals recently extirpated from Oregon; grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), wolf (Canis lupus), bison (Bison bison). Endangered mammals in Oregon; Richardson ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsoni), kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), sea otter (Enhydra lutris), wolverine (Gulo luscus), lynx (Lynx canadensis), Columbian white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus leucurus). Rare mammals in Oregon; Maiheur shrew (Sorex preblei), Merriam shrew (Sorex merriami), Ashland shrew (Sorex trigonirostris), Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), white-footed vole (Arborimus (Phenacomys) albipes), ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), fisher (Martes pennanti), northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Mammals of undetermined status in Oregon; fringed myotis (Myotis thysanodes), western pipistrelle (Pipistrellus hesperus), Washington ground squirrel (Spermophilus washingtoni), little pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris). Mammals evaluated but not presently rare or endangered in Oregon; hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), white-tailed hare (Lepus townsendii), pigmy rabbit (Sylvilagus idahoensis), antelope ground squirrel (Ammospermophilus leucurus), Bottae pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae), dark kangaroo mouse (Microdipodops megacephalus), Heerman kangaroo rat (Dipodomys heermanni), heather vole (Phenacomys intermedius), red tree mouse (Arborimus (Phenacomys) longicaudus), California meadow mouse (Microtus californicus), sagebrush vole (Lagurus curtatus), marten (Martes americana), badger (Taxidea taxus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), <b>northern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> (Eumetopias jubata), California sea lion (Zalophus californicus), harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), mountain lion (Felis concolor), Idaho white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ochrourus). The necessary use of imprecise terms such as "very uncommon" in defining categories of classification injected a degree of subjectivity into the proposed classification. However, it is believed that this study consolidated existing knowledge, and that it will provide a basis for future, more detailed studies which may reveal basic ecological requirements of rare and endangered forms of mammals in Oregon...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} seasonal {{and annual}} variation in numbers of Steller (<b>northern)</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Eumetopias jubatus) at the South Farallon Islands from counts conducted weekly from 1974 to 1996. Numbers of adult and subadult males peaked during the breeding season (May–July), whereas numbers of adult females and immature individuals peaked during the breeding season and from late fall through early winter (September–December). The seasonal pattern varied significantly among years for all sexes and age classes. From 1977 to 1996, numbers present during the breeding season decreased by 5. 9 % {{per year for}} adult females and increased by 1. 9 % per year for subadult males. No trend in numbers of adult males was detected. Numbers of immature individuals also declined by 4. 5 % per year during the breeding season but increased by 5. 0 % per year from late fall through early winter. Maximum number of pups counted declined significantly through time, although few pups were produced at the South Farallon Islands. The ratio of adult females to adult males averaged 5. 2 : 1 and declined significantly with each year, whereas no trend in the ratio of pups to adult females was discernible. Further {{studies are needed to}} determine if reduced numbers of adult females in recent years have resulted from reduced survival of juvenile or adult females or from changes in the geographic distribution of females...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Presentation date: 1987 - 05 - 28 <b>Northern</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Eumetopias lubatus) {{were studied}} at three sites (Rogue Reef, Oregon, Marmot Island, Alaska, and T. Ugamak Island, Alaska) during the 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 {{breeding}} seasons. Data {{were collected on}} female activity budgets, attendance patterns, births, copulations, population structure, and patterns of seasonal and daily abundance. Females {{spent most of their}} time on land in rest, maternal care, and comfort behaviors. Little time was devoted to sexual, movement, and agonistic behaviors. Significant differences were observed in behaviors between females of different maternal status, at different sites, and at different times-of-day. Females without young rested more, were less aggressive, and spent more time at sea than those with young. Females with pups and older young spent similar amounts of time in nursing, but only those with pups gave other care to their young. Females with pups spent the most time ashore. These differences are due to the necessity of females to attend to their young. Rogue Reef females were the least active and least aggressive. Females at Marmot Island were more active, more aggressive, and showed the least change in behavior by time-of-day of any site. Ugamak Island females were intermediate in behavior to the other sites, but showed the strongest time-of-day effects. These differences appear related to thermal, tidal, and substrate differences among the three sites. Females with pups were the largest group of animals on the rookeries. This group's reproductive cycle and behavior shaped the demographic patterns of primary rookeries, and as a result primary rookeries had many features in common. These included high pupping rates, low pup mortality, low numbers of juveniles, maximum abundance in late June to early July, and low animal abundance during the remainder of the year. Rookeries with few pups (secondary rookeries) had earlier peaks in seasonal abundance, greater pup mortality, and greater variation in juvenile numbers. Variability in the behavior of females and differences in rookery population structure require care to be exercised when observations are generalized from one site to the population as a whole...|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 Energetic {{demands are}} high for <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> during spring when females are {{pregnant}} and lactating and males {{are preparing for}} extended fasting during the breeding season. Therefore, I predicted that the distribution of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> in spring would {{be influenced by the}} distribution of spring-spawning aggregations of high-energy Pacific herring (Clupeapallasii) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) in southeastern Alaska. Monthly aerial surveys at 23 Steller <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> haul outs revealed that haulout use was seasonally dynamic. Some <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> haulouts were only occupied during spring. Other haulouts exhibited pronounced increases in the number of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> during certain seasons. <b>Sea</b> <b>lion</b> haulouts with peak numbers of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> in spring were significantly closer to forage fish aggregations than haulouts with peak numbers of <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> at other times of year.
