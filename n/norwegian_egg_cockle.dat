5000|$|Namdangli Cockle Festival: The coastal {{topographical}} {{features of}} the Hongseong area, particularly the Cheonsu Bay ares, {{make it possible to}} get lots of <b>egg</b> <b>cockles.</b> <b>Egg</b> <b>cockles</b> taste unique and not easy to eat in city areas. Because of these reasons, the festival gradually became successful. However, an oil spill around Taean made it difficult to host this festival recently. Fortunately, Hongseong did not suffer direct damage from the oil spill. The county took place as the host on Jan 16 of 2008.|$|R
50|$|Laevicardium mortoni, or Morton's <b>egg</b> <b>cockle,</b> is {{a species}} of bivalve mollusc in the family Cardiidae. It can be found along the Atlantic coast of North America, ranging from Nova Scotia to Brazil.|$|R
50|$|Laevicardium elatum, common name's {{the giant}} <b>egg</b> <b>cockle,</b> giant Pacific cockle {{and the yellow}} {{cardinal}} cockle is a species of saltwater clam, a cockle, a marine bivalve mollusc in the family Cardiidae, the cockles.

50|$|A cockle is a small, edible, marine bivalve mollusc. Although {{many small}} edible {{bivalves}} are loosely called cockles, true cockles are {{species in the}} family Cardiidae. True cockles live in sandy, sheltered beaches throughout the world. The distinctive rounded shells are bilaterally symmetrical, and are heart-shaped when viewed from the end. Numerous radial evenly spaced ribs are {{a feature of the}} shell in most but not all genera (for an exception, see the genus Laevicardium, the <b>egg</b> <b>cockles,</b> which have very smooth shells).|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the more}} common foods {{that can be seen}} in kopi tiams, besides the ever-popular eggs and toast, consist of char kway tiao (fried flat rice noodles (hor fun), {{sometimes}} cooked with <b>eggs</b> and <b>cockles),</b> Hokkien mee (yellow wheat noodles served with various seafood as well as egg) and, possibly the most common, nasi lemak, or coconut rice (a Malay dish of coconut-flavoured rice, served with sambal chilli paste, egg, and fried anchovies).|$|R

5000|$|Their {{geographical}} territory was {{abundant in}} rich food sources from land animals to sea life and plants and animals. For meat, deer, bear, elk, duck, swan, and small rodents such as squirrel. With ocean food it was mussels, sea <b>eggs,</b> <b>cockles,</b> clams, seaweed, herring, trout, crab, urchin, sea lion, seal, {{all kinds of}} salmon. For berries and plants, it was different kinds of wild blueberry, blackberry, salmon berry, salal berry, five different kinds of grass and the roots of different plants. Ooligans were once in their river system and Ooligan grease was once made from it. Sea food, particularly salmon was their main staple. It was this abundance of sea food and salmon that their diet was considerably heavy on natural fats and oils. This left relatively small amounts of carbohydrates in the diet. To ensure that essentials vitamins are acquired, they eat almost all parts of animals which they harvest. Bones used for soup stock provide leached calcium, as do ground calcined shells. Vitamin A is obtained from liver. Vitamin C is primarily found in berries and some other plants, such as skunk cabbage leaves. Intestines and stomachs can be eaten to provide vitamin E and the vitamin B complexes. Within the decade following the establishment of Fort Langley in 1827 the Squamish had begun extensive farming of potatoes. [...] Recent shifts away from a traditional diet, relatively low in carbs and sugar has led to many health problems in the present day Squamish community.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are: 1. Determine changes {{in the number of}} species of fishes and bivalves before Phase I and during Phase I at Bolsa Chica Marsh. 2. Determine if California Department of Fish and Game's predicted benefits in Phase I were achieved by increases in fish species. 3. Determine influences of water management practices upon fish and bivalve composition. This report is divided into two major topics: (1) the fishes and the bivalves collected in July, August, and September 1980 and (2) a discussion of the project objectives after four quarters of sampling. Fifteen species of fishes and eight species of bivalves were collected from inner Bolsa Bay and south Bolsa slough in July, August, and September 1980. Giant kelpfish, Heterostichus rostratus; gray smoothhound, Mustelus californicus; California halibut, Paralichthys californicus; yellowfin croaker, Umbrina roncador; Washington clam, Saxidomus nuttalli; <b>egg</b> <b>cockle,</b> Laevicardium substriatum; and a small burrowing clam, Cooperella subdiaphana, have not been previously reported from inner Bolsa Bay. The number of fish species in outer Bolsa Bay changed from 10 prior to Phase I to 18 during Phase I. The number of fish species in inner Bolsa Bay and south Bolsa slough changed from three prior to Phase I to 24 during Phase I. Eleven species of bivalves were found in outer Bolsa Bay both prior to Phase I and during Phase I. The number of bivalve species in inner Bolsa Bay changes from two prior to Phase I to nine during Phase I. With the water management practices of Phase I in inner Bolsa Bay and south Bolsa slough; the number of resident fish species is 14, while the number of resident bivalves is five. All three study objectives are discussed and recommendations are made on water management practices concerning fishes and bivalves in inner Bolsa Bay and south Bolsa slough. (33 pp. ...|$|R

5000|$|Kono {{made her}} {{restaurant}} debut with chef Reine Sammut in 1997 {{and soon after}} {{went to work for}} Alain Passard as a kitchen assistant. Passard's philosophy was similar to her great-uncle's, in that he taught her that artistry must come from quality products. He taught her that colors, shapes, odors, and taste must be rigorously selected. She studied with him for three years, working her way up the ladder at his restaurant L'Arpège to become his second chef. She did not like being in charge of other employees and left after a few months to begin working as a personal chef. Taking on international clients, Kono traveled worldwide cooking for celebrities, like Dany Boon, Bernadette Chirac, Judith Godrèche and others. In 2004, she designed a menu with French chef Richard Pommiès for Laurent Taieb's restaurant [...] "Le Kong", which features Japanese-French fusion cuisine. The following year, Frédéric Laffont produced a documentary about her as part of his series [...] "Secrets de cuisine" [...] which was broadcast on France 5. In 2005, Fauchon hired her as head chef of salty products and she revised several of their standards catering options, to create a lighter more international flair. She cooked risottos with Japanese rice, developed a lighter version of the house specialty <b>Norwegian</b> <b>eggs</b> and created a best-seller in the catering department, skewers of scallops with lemongrass.|$|R
5000|$|Sar Hor Fun (Chinese : 沙河粉) - Ipoh {{is famous}} for its flat rice noodles, which is {{prepared}} with local unfiltered spring water. There are two varieties: Kai see hor fun [...] (Chinese : 鸡丝河粉) is served in a clear chicken and prawn soup with chicken shreds, prawns and spring onions. Chau hor fun (Chinese : 炒河粉） is fried with a little dark gravy, as opposed to Penang char kway teow （炒粿条） which has no gravy but is fried with <b>egg,</b> prawns and <b>cockles.</b> It is also different from Cantonese-style wat tan ho （滑蛋河） which is completely immersed in clear, egg-starch gravy.|$|R
50|$|The Skagerrak is {{habitat for}} {{approximately}} 2,000 marine species, {{many of them}} adapted to its waters. For example, a variety of Atlantic cod called the Skagerrak cod spawns off the <b>Norwegian</b> coast. The <b>eggs</b> are buoyant and the hatchlings feed on zooplankton. Juveniles sink to the bottom {{where they have a}} shorter maturity cycle (2 years). They do not migrate but remain local to Norwegian fjords.|$|R
40|$|During {{the years}} 1986 to 1988 eight cruises were {{conducted}} in the central and western parts of the Barents Sea. The cruises, together spanning the time period from January to July, covered most developmental stages of the phytoplankton spring bloom. Temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll a, and zooplankton were generally sampled at each station. Size frequency distributions of eggs and nauplius stages of the copepods Calanus finmarchicus, C. glacialis, C. hyperboreus, Pseudocalanus sp., and Metridia sp., are given. Cluster analysis and a subjective method of classification grouped the sampling stations into environmental regions {{on the basis of}} environmental variables. The environmental variables were related to size of eggs (diameter) and nauplii (carapax length) of C. finmarchicus by a linear method of canonical ordination (Redundancy Analysis). A significant overall difference in size of eggs and nauplii between environmental regions was demonstrated. The size of eggs and nauplius stages N 1 to N 3 were positively correlated with distance from the Norwegian Sea, {{and the size of the}} females were positively correlated both with distance from the <b>Norwegian</b> Sea and <b>egg</b> size. Egg size was negatively correlated with temperature. lt was concluded that advection of smaller sized adult females into the Barents Sea gave rise to a population of small sized eggs and young nauplii. The maternal effect may be a direct process where bigger females spawn bigger eggs, or more indirectly where the females spawn bigger eggs at low temperatures. The feeding stages N 4 and N 6 were positively correlated with chlorophyll content (assumed to represent food supply), and negatively correlated with temperature. Chlorophyll and temperature were inter-correlated, and the contribution of each particular variable to the relationship could not be estimated. Thus, after the nauplii start to feed, food supply and/or temperature have greatest influence on size, and soon mask size patterns due to maternal effects...|$|R
