40|$|<b>Naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> cotton is <b>naturally</b> {{pigmented}} fibre that grows {{in shades of}} brown and green. Because the colour {{is present in the}} fibres, fabrics made of them {{do not have to be}} dyed. The elimination of the dyeing process can save up to one half of the cost of preparing textiles and also lowers disposal costs for toxic dye waste dangerous to human health and the environment. In spite of the economic and ecological benefits resulting from the elimi-nation of the dying process, the application of the <b>naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> cotton in the world textile industry is still limited. The low quality of fibres is considered as the most important reason for the limitation of <b>naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> cotton application.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine seed cotton yield and yield components and major lint quality traits of investigated coloured cotton lines comprising white linted local standard cotton varieties. Field trials were established in randomized block design with four blocks. According to two year’s results, it was determined that <b>naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> cottons were found similar to both white linted standard cotton varieties for sympodia number and seed cotton yield. For boll number per plant, except green cotton line all coloured cotton lines were similar to standard varieties or even some of them were better than standards. For ginning outturn, dark brown, cream and green cotton lines were found statistically similar to standard Maras- 92. But all <b>naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> cotton lines had lower seed cotton weight per boll and generally lower fiber quality than white linted standard varieties. For fiber length and fiber strength cream cotton line was the best coloured cotton. And for fiber fineness only green cotton line was better than both standards.

2500|$|Absinthe that is artificially {{coloured}} or {{clear is}} aesthetically stable, {{and can be}} bottled in clear glass. If <b>naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> absinthe is exposed to light or air for a prolonged period, the chlorophyll gradually becomes oxidised, which {{has the effect of}} gradually changing the colour from green to yellow green, and eventually to brown. The colour of absinthe that has completed this transition was historically referred to as feuille morte (dead leaf). In the preban era, this natural phenomenon was favourably viewed, for it confirmed the product in question was <b>coloured</b> <b>naturally,</b> and not artificially with potentially toxic chemicals. Predictably, vintage absinthes often emerge from sealed bottles as distinctly amber in tint due to decades of slow oxidation. [...] Though this colour change presents no adverse impact to the flavour of absinthe, it is generally desired to preserve the original colour, which requires that <b>naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> absinthe be bottled in dark, light resistant bottles. Absinthe intended for decades of storage should be kept in a cool (room temperature), dry place, away from light and heat. Absinthe should not be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, as the anethole may polymerise inside the bottle, creating an irreversible precipitate, and adversely impacting the original flavour.|$|R

40|$|There are {{two major}} {{competing}} explanations for the counter-intuitive presence of bright coloration in certain orb-web spiders. Bright coloration could lure insect prey to the web vicinity, increasing the spider's foraging success. Alternatively, the markings could function as disruptive camouflage, {{making it difficult for}} the insect prey to distinguish spiders from background colour variation. We measured the prey capture rates of wasp spiders, Argiope bruennichi, that were blacked out, shielded from view using a leaf fragment, or left <b>naturally</b> <b>coloured.</b> <b>Naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> spiders caught over twice the number of prey as did either blacked-out or leaf-shielded spiders, and almost three times as many orthopteran prey. Spectrophotometer measurements suggest that the bright yellow bands on the spider's abdomen are visible to insect prey, but not the banding on the legs, which could disguise the spider's outline. Thus, our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that bright coloration in the wasp spider acts as a visual lure for insect prey and weak support for the hypothesis that the arrangement of the banding pattern across the spider's body disguises the presence of the spider on the web. 6 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Many {{animals have}} {{conspicuous}} body colour that may serve physiological, camouflage or communicative functions. This {{study investigated the}} influence of bright coloration in orb-web spiders on the response of predator and prey using Argiope keyserlingi, the St Andrew 2 ̆ 7 s Cross spider. This species has three conspicuous yellow bands on its dorsal abdominal surface. These bands could act as camouflage devise through disruptive colouration or attract prey to the web by exploiting colour preferences in the insect visual system. In the field, naturally yellow spiders captured more prey than spiders where the yellow bands were coloured over with black marker. Similarly, some prey (Harlequin beetles: Tectocoris diophthalamus) moved towards yellow spiders and away from blackened spiders in Y-choice tests. However, native bees (Trigona carbonaria) {{did not seem to}} discriminate <b>naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> spiders at a distance when approaching a spider on a web or an empty web. Similarly, praying mantid predators (Pseudomantis albofimbriata) preferred blackened spiders over yellow spiders in a Y-maze, but they showed no preference when offered an empty web and a web occupied by a <b>naturally</b> <b>coloured</b> spider. Thus our data suggest that the main function of the conspicuous yellow bands is crypsis, perhaps via disruptive colouration that obscures the outline of the spider...|$|R

50|$|Alexander Buchanan, a foreman in a Paisley fabric mill, is {{credited}} with introducing chenille fabric to Scotland in the 1830s. Here he developed a way to weave fuzzy shawls. Tufts of <b>coloured</b> <b>wool</b> were woven together into a blanket that was then cut into strips. They were treated by heating rollers {{in order to create}} the frizz. This resulted in a very soft, fuzzy fabric named chenille. Another Paisley shawl manufacturer went on to further develop the technique. James Templeton and William Quigley worked to refine this process while working on imitation oriental rugs. The intricate patterns used to be difficult to reproduce by automation, but this technique solved that issue. These men patented the process but Quigley soon sold out his interest. Templeton then went on to open a successful carpet company that became a leading manufacturer throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|R
