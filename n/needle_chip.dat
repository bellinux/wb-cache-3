30|$|One {{proposed}} {{process to}} create the single crystalline W nanotip is as follows. First, electro migration in ordinary polycrystalline W needle was occurred by supplying high electric field. Secondly, a small migrated chip in the W needle was penetrated into the h-BN thin film by supplied high electric force. Thirdly, sudden large current was flown from the W <b>needle</b> <b>chip,</b> and the chip was partially heated by field emission current. Finally, the h-BN thin film was blown up by the extreme large current and the chip would grow a single crystalline W nanotip under the high electric field.|$|E

50|$|While {{packaged}} as a wafer, {{automatic test}} equipment (ATE) can connect to the individual units using a set of microscopic <b>needles.</b> Once the <b>chips</b> are sawn apart and packaged, test equipment can connect to the chips using ZIF sockets (sometimes called contactors).|$|R
50|$|There is {{continuing}} disagreement regarding ground cover within 30 ft of structures. In certain cases, TRPA regulations require ground cover to provide protection from soil erosion on disturbed soil. Ground cover may often be lawn or other landscaping, however site-specific native vegetation, or naturally occurring forest litter {{such as a}} thin layer of pine <b>needles</b> or wood <b>chips</b> is generally the environmentally preferable alternative, and is more cost-effective and easier to maintain. While some groups argue that utilizing pine <b>needles</b> and wood <b>chips</b> as ground cover up to the 30 foot perimeter of a structure is a violation of California Public Resources Code 4291 requiring defensible space in California, a ½ to 1 in covering of forest litter (duff layer) is not sufficient to carry a flame intense enough to burn structures from a distance of 30 ft away. Regardless, TRPA staff and local fire groups are investigating possible non-flammable or flame-retardant alternatives to provide both soil protection and fire prevention. In addition, TRPA staff and Board members are working with the local fire protection districts to simplify procedures for homeowners to implement defensible space requirements around their homes, and eliminate confusion and possible conflicts regarding TRPA erosion control requirements and defensible space requirements, and to ease restrictions on use of heavy machinery in sensitive areas near communities.|$|R
40|$|The {{thin layer}} drying of pine forest {{residues}} consisting of bark, <b>needles,</b> leaves, and <b>chips</b> was experimentally conducted at air temperatures of 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 oC. Physical and chemical properties of fractionated forest residues {{were determined to}} evaluate its fuel properties. The experimental data obtained from thin layer drying study were fitted with Lewis, Page, and Henderson and Pabis equations to evaluate the drying behavior of the forest residues. Among the three drying models, the Henderson and Pabis model fitted well with the experimental drying data at the tested temperatures (40, 50, 60, 70, 80 oC), achieving R 2 values of 0. 992, 0. 994, 0. 997, 0. 989, and 0. 983, respectively. The drying constant k for the forest residues was increased with increase in drying air temperature and was correlated {{in the form of}} a second order regression equation. The thin layer drying data developed from this study will be useful for designing low temperature dryers for forest residues...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{mechanical}} probe {{station is}} a laboratory device used to physically acquire {{signals from the}} internal nodes of a chip. The station allows positioning of thin probing <b>needles</b> on the <b>chip's</b> surface, either using humanly operated manipulators or automatically. To protect a bit k against probing, one usually encodes k as ℓ bit-shares {s j } 0 ≤j≤ℓ− 1 where {s j } 0 ≤j≤ℓ− 2 are random and s ℓ− 1 = k ⊕ s 0 ⊕, … ⊕s ℓ− 2. If each s i is stored at a different RAM location, the opponent needs to probe all the ℓ cells to learn k. Let k = {k 0, …, k n− 1 } be an n-bit key recorded in an n × ℓ matrix as {s i, j } 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, 0 ≤ j ≤ ℓ− 1. To force the attacker to probe scattered data, we look for a function f mapping {i, j} to geometrical {x, y} coordinates such that, for u ≠ v, the minimal distance between r i,u and r i,v is as large as possible. This paper solves this problem by exploiting the module structure of. We infer a theoretical lower bound on f's scattering capacity and compare the algorithm's performance with an approximate upper bound. The result is quite satisfying...|$|R
