The approach takes both processing and representational considerations into account thus avoiding problems, such as variation and complexity, encountered in non-integrated accounts. New data from a series of tests on both comprehension and production with an agrammatic Broca’s aphasic patient are presented and discussed in light of the new proposal. Reduction of these asymmetries to a special case of the more general theory of locality allows generalizations to be made, which might be extended over different populations...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Agrammatism in Broca's aphasia is a {{language}} disorder that {{is characterized by}} a selective syntactic deficit, often in comprehension as well as in speech production. According to the Trace Deletion Hypothesis (TDH, Grodzinsky, 1990, 1995, 2000), the deficit in comprehension in agrammatic aphasia is attributed to impaired representation of structures with <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>order</b> derived by syntactic movement. The central research question of our study was whether this generalisation holds in languages that have richer morphology than English. The generalisability of the TDH to morphologically rich languages is not obvious, given that case or gender morphology can provide explicit cues to the detection of the Agent in a sentence and thus might help the agrammatic individual to decide notwithstanding syntactic problems who is doing what to whom in a sentence comprehension task. Our previous studies have shown that an impairment in movement-derived structures is evident i...|$|E

5000|$|Scrambling is {{a common}} term for pragmatic <b>word</b> <b>order.</b> In the Chomskyan tradition, every {{language}} is assumed to have a basic <b>word</b> <b>order</b> which is fundamental to its sentence structure, so languages which exhibit {{a wide variety of}} different orders are said to have [...] "scrambled" [...] them from their [...] "normal" [...] <b>word</b> <b>order.</b> The notion of scrambling has spread beyond the Chomskyan tradition and become a general concept that denotes many <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>orders</b> in numerous languages. Scrambling often (but not always) results in a discontinuity; the scrambled expression appears at a distance from its head in such a manner that crossing lines are present in the syntactic tree. Scrambling discontinuities are distinct from topicalization, wh-fronting, and extraposition discontinuities. Scrambling does not occur in English, but it is frequent in languages with freer <b>word</b> <b>order,</b> such as German, Russian, Persian and Turkic languages.|$|R

Especially, the so-called Broca’s Area and its role in syntactic processing has thereby come into focus. The present paper presents neuroimaging studies which have imployed the most important experimental paradigms in this respect, namely, the processing of sentences with syntactic violations and of sentences with <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>order.</b> We argue that neuronal language processing can only be explained in a dynamic model. In such a model, not only neuronal localisation, but also temporal information needs to be taken into account.

40|$|Sentence {{processing}} {{deficits in}} aphasia become evident whenever patients {{have to rely}} on syntactic structure in order to derive the correct sentence interpretation. Aphasics are known to have difficulty in comprehending reversible <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>order</b> sentences compared to canonical word order (cf. Mitchum & Berndt, 2008). Representational accounts (e. g. Grodzinsky, 1995) assume that this difficulty with noncanonical sentences reflects disturbances in underlying syntactic representations. In contrast, according to processing accounts structural representations are unimpaired, but sentence comprehension is affected by a processing deficit, which leads to slowed processing or intermittent breakdowns of the parser (cf. Thompson & Choy, 2009). Studies investigating aphasic online sentence processing in addition to tradional off-line performance measures (e. g. Caplan et al., 2007; Dickey et al., 2007; Hanne et al., 2010) provide new evidence towards structurally unimpaired but delayed syntactic processing in aphasia. However, in order to gain a better insight into patients ’ deficits, it is instructive to examine aphasic sentence comprehension within a computational architecture designe...|$|E

30|$|While studies {{based on}} the Competition Model have {{extensively}} studied the identification of thematic roles in non-canonical strings, the task of deciding {{one of the two}} nouns as the agent does not require a string of words to be fully acceptable.

To obtain a more fine-grained evaluation of the acceptability of the <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>orders,</b> we decided to assess the acceptability with a 7 -point Likert scale.

30|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} valuable {{data on the}} acceptability of <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>orders</b> among younger and older native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. Previous theoretical and experimental studies demonstrated that OSV <b>word</b> <b>order</b> is preferred over SOV <b>word</b> <b>order</b> in Chinese. However, our results suggest that this preference for OSV can be modulated by {{the factor of age}} and therefore is not invariant. Specifically, whereas OSV was judged significantly more acceptable than SOV in the younger adults, the acceptability of OSV in the older adults was only neutral and did not significantly deviated from that of SOV. While only speculations are allowed with the data available at the moment, there must be an underlying cause for this striking difference. On one hand, the difference can be an indication of a possible quantitative difference in the use of OSV between different age groups. On the other hand, it also seems possible that the reduced acceptability of OSV in the older adults can be associated with age-related differences in sentence processing. Future corpus-based and experimental work are required to examine the possible explanations proposed in the present study.|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} Dislocation Focus Construction (DFC) (also {{known as}} “Right Dislocation”) in colloquial Chinese (including Cantonese and Mandarin) gives rise to various <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>orders.</b> In DFCs, the {{sentence}} particle (SP) occurs in a sentence-medial position. The pre- and post-SP materials are demonstrated to be syntactically connected, based on four diagnostic tests, namely (i) the zinghai ‘only’ test, (ii) the doudai (“wh-the-hell”) test, (iii) polarity item licensing, and (iv) Principle C violations. The findings offer {{new insights into the}} syntax of the Chinese left periphery and constraints on focus movement. First, the observations entail that Chinese CPs are head-initial, and an XP is obligatorily moved around the SP to a position higher than the CP. Second, the XP-raising in the DFC is argued to be driven by focus because of the focus interpretation induced. It is discovered that the focus movement is subject to the Spine Constraint, which turns out to be remarkably similar to the properties of the Nuclear Stress Rule (e. g., selection of focus set and metrical invisibility). It is argued that the DFC is the syntactic realization of the rule...|$|R
30|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the lower acceptability of OSV in the older adults {{might be related to}} cognitive ageing. Older adults are generally found to have relatively worse performance during online sentence processing (Wlotko et al. 2010), recent studies have provided compelling evidence that native Chinese speakers are no exception (Xu et al. 2017; Z. Zhu et al. 2018). Previous studies in English and Korean report that age effects are most pronounced in the processing of structures with non-canonical word orders, such as object relative clauses and object clefts in English (Stine-Morrow et al. 2000; Caplan et al. 2011) and the OSV word order in Korean (Oh et al. 2016; Sung 2017). In a similar vein, considering that OSV is a <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>order</b> in Chinese, it is possible that older native speakers of Chinese might also have more difficulties when processing OSV sentences relative to younger adults. Although acceptability judgements can only be made after the processing of a sentence and therefore are not directly linked with processing performance, subjective acceptability and processing performance measures can often be correlated, as is evident in the data of Wang et al. (2012) and Wang 王路明 (2015). Hence, it also seems worthwhile to scrutinize whether the lower acceptability of OSV in the older adults is associated with age-related differences in the processing of OSV by using experimental methods, which has not yet been done in the literature.|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} this long history, most work {{to date on the}} phonology-syntax {{interface}} in Bantu languages suffers from limitations, due to the range of expertise required: intonation, phonology, syntax. Quite generally, intonational studies on African languages are extremely rare. Most of the existing data has not been the subject of careful phonetic analysis, whether of the prosody of neutral sentences or of questions or other focus structures. There are important gaps in our knowledge of Bantu syntax which in turn limit our understanding of the phonology-syntax interface. Recent developments in syntactic theory have provided a new way of thinking about the type of syntactic information that phonology can refer to and have raised new questions: Do only syntactic constituent edges condition prosodic phrasing? Do larger domains such as syntactic phases, or even other factors, like argument and adjunct distinctions, play a role? Further, earlier studies looked at a limited range of syntactic constructions. Little research exists on the phonology of focus or of sentences with <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>order</b> in Bantu languages. Both the prosody and the syntax of complex sentences, questions and dislocations are understudied for Bantu languages. Our project aims to remedy these gaps in our knowledge by bringing together a research team with all the necessary expertise. Further, by undertaking the intonational, phonological and syntactic analysis of several languages we can investigate whether there is any correlation among differences in morphosyntactic and prosodic properties that might also explain differences in phrasing and intonation. It will also allow us to investigate whether there are cross-linguistically common prosodic patterns for particular morpho-syntactic structure...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} issue in language acquisition, especially from a usage-based perspective, is {{to explain how}} children are able to generalise from item-based knowledge to a more general pattern-based form of knowledge. Casenhiser and Goldberg (2005) demonstrated experimentally how children came to learn mappings between novel phrasal forms and novel meanings. They showed that children could learn meaning associated with a novel word order {{on the basis of}} a minimal input, even without the help of a stable morphological cue. The goal of the current work is to try to reproduce the experiment of Casenhiser and Goldberg in another language, i. e. French. Moreover, French has some notable differences from English. Especially, although it follows the same verb order as English, word order is not as constrained, changing the word order for emphasis and other pragmatic reason is not unusual. So changing word order may not provide a sufficient cue for children to learn new syntactic patterns (Kail and Charvillat, 1986). The experiment reproduced Casenhiser and Goldberg's in two different settings. A new grammatical construction will be associated to an original meaning (apparition of an object). Children have only 16 examples to learn this new association between grammatical construction and meaning. The test procedure is a forced choice between new uses of the new test examples were not used during the training phase) and distracters. Two types of new constructions were tested: one wih a <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>order</b> (NNV), and one with a new preposition. The results showed that young French children aged 3 to 4 were able to reproduce the results obtained by English children, but only with the new preposition, not with the NNV structure. The results suggest that, although the same principle maybe involved in all language, cros-linguistic differences can exist...|$|E
30|$|Prior {{theoretical}} and experimental work {{has demonstrated that}} the subject-object-verb (SOV) <b>word</b> <b>order</b> is more restricted {{and more difficult to}} process than the object-subject-verb (OSV) <b>word</b> <b>order</b> in Chinese. However, few studies have investigated the actual acceptability of <b>non-canonical,</b> verb-final <b>word</b> <b>orders</b> among native speakers. In this study, we conducted a paper-based survey with a group of younger adults and a group of older adults. Non-canonical sentences with and without animacy contrasts were tested with three tasks: acceptability judgement, grammaticality judgement, and subject selection. Our results have two main implications. First, contrary to previous studies, the results suggested that animate-animate-verb (AAV) sentences generally have very poor acceptability, and they may be mostly regarded as uninterpretable. Second, and importantly, we found that while a preference for OSV over SOV was observed in younger adults, it was not evident in older adults. This suggests that the preference for the OSV <b>word</b> <b>order</b> might be modulated by the factor of age.|$|R
40|$|Some natural {{languages}} grammatically allow {{different types}} of changing <b>word</b> <b>orders,</b> such as object scrambling and topicalization. Scrambling and topicalization are more related to syntax and semantics/phonology, respectively. Here we hypothesized that scrambling should activate the left frontal regions, while topicalization would affect the bilateral temporal regions. To examine such distinct effects in our {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study, we targeted the Kaqchikel Maya language, a Mayan language spoken in Guatemala. In Kaqchikel, the syntactically canonical <b>word</b> <b>order</b> is verb-object-subject (VOS), but at least three <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>orders</b> (i. e., SVO, VSO, and OVS) are also grammatically allowed. We used a sentence-picture matching task, in which the participants listened to a short Kaqchikel sentence and judged whether a picture matched the meaning of the sentence. The advantage of applying this experimental paradigm to an understudied language such as Kaqchikel is that it will allow us to validate the universality of linguistic computation in the brain. We found that the conditions with scrambled sentences [+scrambling] elicited significant activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus and lateral premotor cortex, both of which have been proposed as grammar centers, indicating the effects of syntactic loads. In contrast, the conditions without topicalization [-topicalization] resulted in significant activation in bilateral Heschl’s gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, demonstrating that the syntactic and phonological processes were clearly dissociated within the language areas. Moreover, the pre-supplementary motor area and left superior/middle temporal gyri were activated under relatively demanding conditions, suggesting their supportive roles in syntactic or semantic processing. To exclude any semantic/phonological effects of the object-subject <b>word</b> <b>orders,</b> we performed direct comparisons while making the factor of topicalization constant, and observed localized activations in the left inferior frontal gyrus and lateral premotor cortex. These results establish that the types of scrambling and topicalization have different impacts on the specified language areas. These findings further indicate that the functional roles of these left frontal and temporal regions involve linguistic aspects themselves, namely syntax versus semantics/phonology, rather than output/input aspects of speech processing...|$|R
30|$|Now the {{question}} comes that why age-related {{differences were found}} only in the OSV-interpreted IAV strings but not the AIV and AAV strings. First, we think {{that there might be}} little or no room for age-related changes in the acceptability of AIV and AAV strings (i.e., floor effects). The {{results of the present study}} strongly indicate that the acceptance of <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>orders</b> in Chinese is dependent on the resolvable syntactic relations of the pre-verbal nouns, which in turn rely on the existence of semantic cues such as animacy contrast. For AAV strings, the lack of animacy contrast hinders a comprehender from further interpreting these strings. This directly leads to the poor acceptability of AAV strings and leaves no room for age to play a role. For AIV strings, the animacy contrast makes it possible to analyse the syntactic relations of the pre-verbal nouns. Thus, they should at least have a random chance to be judged as acceptable. Meanwhile, the use of the SOV <b>word</b> <b>order</b> is known to be rather restricted in Chinese. As we have seen, the acceptability and grammaticality of AIV strings in the younger group did not go beyond the neutral or chance level. It is possible that the overall neutral judgement is both the least and the most that AIV strings can have; as a result, age can impose little effects on the acceptability of these strings. The IAV strings are similar to the AIV strings in the sense that the syntactic relations of the pre-verbal nouns can be resolved with the help of animacy cues. An important difference, however, is that the OSV <b>word</b> <b>order</b> is less restricted than the SOV <b>word</b> <b>order</b> both syntactically and semantically in Chinese. In addition, OSV has also been demonstrated to be easier to process than SOV. Because of the properties of the OSV <b>word</b> <b>order,</b> the OSV-interpreted IAV strings should have the potential to be judged as more acceptable. Therefore, the possible overall acceptability of IAV strings is not constrained to the neutral level but can range from merely neutral to somewhere on the more acceptable side.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{spontaneous}} speech of speakers of Standard Indonesian (SI) with agrammatic Broca's aphasia {{has not yet}} been characterised, although there are features of SI that are relevant for the discussion of agrammatic speech. Aims: The {{purpose of this study was}} to find the characteristic features of agrammatism in SI. SI is spoken by about 200 million people and it is important for clinical and rehabilitation purposes to characterise agrammatism in SI. Methods & Procedures: A total of 21 adults (6 with Broca's aphasia and 15 without history of neurological problems) participated in the study; 300 words of a {{spontaneous speech}} sample from each participant underwent syntactic and morphological analyses. The study focused on the defining characteristics of SI agrammatic speech, analysing syntactic and morphological variables. Outcomes & Results: The study showed that some characteristics of agrammatic speech in Indo-European languages are also found in SI (slower speech rate, shorter MLU, simpler sentence structure, fewer syntactic particles). However, there are also results that are typical for SI agrammatic speech (normal/above normal verb production, overuse of inflectional affixes compared to derivational ones, normal production of sentences with <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>order,</b> such as passives). Conclusions: For the first time, features of SI agrammatic speech are described. Agrammatic SI can be characterised by a low speech rate and the production of short sentences, just as in other languages. However, several characteristics that have been reported for other languages (e. g., reduced use of verbs) have not been found for SI agrammatic speech, whereas there are agrammatic characteristics in SI that have not been mentioned before for other languages (e. g., reduced number of derivational morphemes, combined with normal number of inflectional morphemes and good access to passive structures). It is argued that this is inherent to the structure of SI. The value of the variables for clinical purposes is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Extract] This third {{volume of}} the working papers series Interdisciplinary Studies on Information Structure {{illustrates}} the diversity of approaches in play at the SFB 632 "Information Structure" (www. sfb 632. uni-potsdam. de). The seven papers included offer {{a wide spectrum of}} new research findings and ongoing debates concerning focus and other information structural phenomena. Four of the papers are based on presentations at the third internal SFB workshop in Gülpe in October 2004. Contributing to this volume are members of every thematic group at the SFB, i. e. a theory developing project, typologically and diachronically oriented projects, psycholinguistic projects, and a phonetic database project. The first paper in this volume by Elke Kasimir (Project A 4 : "Focus Evaluation, Anaphoricity, Discourse Coherence") discusses the reliability of the commonly used question-answer test as a focus diagnostic tool. The complications assumed by Kasimir in considering a category of givenness and her proposed alternative account are challenged and discussed in the following paper by Thomas Weskott (Project C 1 : "Contextually Licensed <b>Non-canonical</b> <b>Word</b> <b>Order</b> in Language Comprehension"). In the third paper, Paul Elbourne, also from the A 4 project, looks at four phenomena that are particularly troublesome for theories of ellipsis and offers a new semantic analysis. While these papers treat their subjects on the basis of English examples, the data of the fourth contribution by Ines Fiedler and Anne Schwarz (Project B 1 : "Focus in Gur and Kwa Languages") come from five Ghanaian languages of the Gur and Kwa language group. These languages have some morphosyntactically heavily marked focus constructions which are analyzed and diachronically interpreted. Taking a diachronic approach as well, Roland Hinterhölzl, Svetlana Petrova and Michael Solf (Project B 4 : "The Role of Information Structure in the Development of Word Order Regularities in Germanic") examine the interaction between information structure and word order in Old High German based on data from the Tatian translation (9 th century) and find support that the finite verb form in Early Germanic distinguishes the information structural domains of Topic and Focus...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that certain discourse conditions are necessary for the felicitous use of four non-canonical syntactic constructions in English, topicalizations, left-dislocations, wh-clefts, and it-clefts. However, the distribution of these forms does not correlate one-to-one with the presence of these necessary conditions. Speakers must choose to use these constructions for other reasons. Additionally, a natural language generation algorithm that selects these statistically-rare forms based only on these conditions will overgenerate. If it selects clausal word order based only on frequency, however, these forms will never be selected or will be used in meaningless ways. The purpose of this dissertation is to devise a more complete model of when human speakers generate these constructions in order to further understanding of syntactic form selection and to better characterize these forms 2 ̆ 7 conditions of use for purposes of NLG. The model of syntactic choice presented explicitly ties the goals of the communicative agent to the linguistic forms selected to achieve those goals. Three types of communicative goals that speakers achieve through the use of non-canonical syntax are argued for (1) attention marking, (2) discourse relation, and (3) information-structure focus disambiguation. The evidence supporting the model is based on naturally-occurring tokens from a corpus of spontaneous oral discourse. This same corpus, annotated with low-level properties of the discourse context surrounding utterances with <b>non-canonical</b> <b>word</b> <b>order,</b> is then used to train a statistical model that can approximate some aspects of the theoretical model. The statistical model supports the claim that communicative goals of signaling discourse relations do correlate significantly with the use of particular non-canonical forms. The statistical model is also used as a probabilistic classifier, which could be utilized as a stochastic method for selecting syntactic form based on discourse context as part of a natural language generation system. The probabilistic classifier shows improvement over a naive classifier when applied to training data. The probabilistic classifier is a first attempt to utilize more than just frequency counts as a basis for syntactic form selection and instead incorporate aspects of the semantic content of surrounding discourse context as a basis for using a particular form. ...|$|E
