5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} colors, {{depending}} on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be <b>nearly</b> <b>invisible,</b> marked only by swirling debris {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E

5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because {{of their ability to}} produce <b>nearly</b> <b>invisible</b> welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made to}} transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is <b>nearly</b> <b>invisible</b> in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E

50|$|In optics, defocus is the {{aberration}} {{in which}} an image is simply out of focus. This aberration is familiar {{to anyone who has}} used a camera, videocamera, microscope, telescope, or binoculars. Optically, defocus refers to a translation along the optical axis away from the plane or surface of best focus. In general, defocus reduces the sharpness and contrast of the image. What should be sharp, high-contrast edges in a scene become gradual transitions. Fine detail in the scene is blurred or even becomes <b>invisible.</b> <b>Nearly</b> all image-forming optical devices incorporate some form of focus adjustment to minimize defocus and maximize image quality.|$|R

Derrick Jensen As with [...] "terrorism" [...] the concept of [...] "state terrorism" [...] is controversial. The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the Committee was conscious of 12 international Conventions on the subject, and none of them referred to State terrorism, which was not an international legal concept. If States abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law. Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that it is [...] "time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law". However, he also made clear that, [...] "regardless of the differences between governments {{on the question of the}} definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is that any deliberate attack on innocent civilians non-combatants, regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism." ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} a beta-emitting radionuclide (holmium- 166 -chitosan complex) as a sclerosing agent {{for the treatment of}} renal cysts. Materials and Methods: Using 10 30 mCi of holmium- 166 -chitosan complex, 20 renal cysts in 17 patients (14 male and 3 female patients, ranging in age from 47 to 82 years) were treated by percutaneous sclerotherapy under ultrasonographic guidance. The volume of the cysts before and after the sclerotherapy and the percentage change in volume were calculated in order to {{evaluate the}} response to therapy, which was classified as either complete regression (<b>invisible),</b> <b>nearly</b> complete regression ( 50 volume%). Results: The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 36 months (mean 28 months). Eighteen cysts (90 %) regressed completely (n= 11, 55 %) or near-completely (n= 7, 35 %). Partial regression was obtained in one patient (5 %) and there was no regression in one patient (5 %). No significant complications were encountered. Conclusion: The holmium- 166 -chitosan complex seems to be useful as a new painless sclerosing agent for the treatment of renal cysts with no significant complications...|$|R

25|$|Hydrogen {{has one of}} {{the widest}} explosive/ignition mix range with air of all the gases with few {{exceptions}} such as acetylene, silane, and ethylene oxide. That means that whatever the mix proportion between air and hydrogen, a hydrogen leak will most likely lead to an explosion, not a mere flame, when a flame or spark ignites the mixture. This makes the use of hydrogen particularly dangerous in enclosed areas such as tunnels or underground parking. Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames burn in the ultraviolet color range and are <b>nearly</b> <b>invisible</b> to the naked eye, so a flame detector is needed to detect if a hydrogen leak is burning. Hydrogen is odorless and leaks cannot be detected by smell.|$|E
25|$|Chromatophores {{are also}} used as a {{biomarker}} of blindness in cold-blooded species, as animals with certain visual defects fail to background adapt to light environments.

Therefore, pharmaceutical companies have developed a biological assay for rapidly identifying potential bioactive compounds using melanophores from the African clawed frog. Other scientists have developed techniques for using melanophores as biosensors, and for rapid disease detection (based on the discovery that pertussis toxin blocks pigment aggregation in fish melanophores). Potential military applications of chromatophore-mediated colour changes have been proposed, mainly as a type of active camouflage, which could as in cuttlefish make objects <b>nearly</b> <b>invisible.</b>|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the best}} known closed {{captioning}} option for film theaters is the Rear Window Captioning System from the National Center for Accessible Media. Upon entering the theater, viewers requiring captions are given a panel of flat translucent glass or plastic on a gooseneck stalk, which can be mounted {{in front of the}} viewer's seat.

The panel can be positioned so that the viewer watches the movie through the panel, and captions appear either on or near the movie image. A company called Cinematic Captioning Systems has a similar reflective system called Bounce Back. A major problem for distributors has been that these systems are each proprietary, and require separate distributions to the theater to enable them to work. Proprietary systems also incur license fees.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} some reasons to believe that {{seasonal}} changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus {{is known to have}} a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above. During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim. This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox. Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the albedo patterns. In addition, the microwave data showed increases in pole–equator contrast after the 1986 solstice. Finally in the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright), whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity, such as cloud formations and stronger winds, having bolstered expectations that it would brighten soon. In particular, an analog of the bright polar collar present in its southern hemisphere at −45° was expected to appear in its northern part. This indeed happened in 2007 when Uranus passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, whereas the southern collar became <b>nearly</b> <b>invisible,</b> although the zonal wind profile remained asymmetric, with northern winds being slightly slower than southern.|$|E

500|$|Countershading uses graded colour to {{counteract}} the effect of self-shadowing, creating an illusion of flatness.

500|$|Like all mushrooms, {{the fruit}} body of Geastrum triplex is the visible {{part of a}} larger organism. Hidden from sight are masses of <b>nearly</b> <b>invisible</b> fungal threads called mycelium, which form the active feeding and growing {{structures}} of the fungus. The fruit body—created when environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are optimal—is designed to produce and disseminate spores. Geastrum triplex has the largest fruit body of the earthstar mushrooms. The immature fruit body is typically [...] in diameter, and up to [...] broad (Roody gives a larger value here, up to 11.5cm) after the rays have spread out. It is composed of a roughly spherical to egg-shaped structure, the endoperidium, topped by an opening, the ostiole, covered by fragments of tissue that form a small pointed beak (a peristome). The endoperidium is typically lacking any sort of stem (it is sessile) grayish brown to [...] "wood brown" [...] when young but light yellow-brown in dried, unopened specimens. The outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, develops splits which radiate from the apex and form between four and eight rays that separate from the endoperidium. The latter's thin and papery envelope surrounds a mass of spores and fertile tissue known as the gleba. The central part of the gleba contains a pseudocolumella (a columella not attached to the stalk), that is typically cylindrical or club-shaped, and extends up from the base. Because of the variability in columella persistence, size, structure and shape within the genus, its value for identification is limited.|$|E
500|$|Iapetus is {{the third-largest}} of Saturn's moons. Orbiting the planet at [...] km, {{it is by}} far the most distant of Saturn's large moons, and also has the largest orbital inclination, at 15.47°. Iapetus has long been known for its unusual two-toned surface; its leading {{hemisphere}} is pitch-black and its trailing hemisphere is almost as bright as fresh snow. Cassini images showed that the dark material is confined to a large near-equatorial area on the leading hemisphere called Cassini Regio, which extends approximately from 40°N to 40°S. The pole regions of Iapetus are as bright as its trailing hemisphere. Cassini also discovered a 20km tall equatorial ridge, which spans nearly the moon's entire equator. Otherwise both dark and bright surfaces of Iapetus are old and heavily cratered. The images revealed at least four large impact basins with diameters from 380 to 550km and numerous smaller impact craters. No evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered. A clue to the origin of the dark material covering part of Iapetus's starkly dichromatic surface may have been found in 2009, when NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope discovered a vast, <b>nearly</b> <b>invisible</b> disk around Saturn, just inside the orbit of the moon Phoebe—the Phoebe ring. Scientists believe that the disk originates from dust and ice particles kicked up by impacts on Phoebe. Because the disk particles, like Phoebe itself, orbit in the opposite direction to Iapetus, Iapetus collides with them as they drift in the direction of Saturn, darkening its leading hemisphere slightly. Once a difference in albedo, and hence in average temperature, was established between different regions of Iapetus, a thermal runaway process of water ice sublimation from warmer regions and deposition of water vapor onto colder regions ensued. Iapetus's present two-toned appearance results from the contrast between the bright, primarily ice-coated areas and regions of dark lag, the residue left behind after the loss of surface ice.|$|E
