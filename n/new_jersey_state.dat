5|$|NY284 {{begins at}} the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> line {{in the town of}} Minisink as a northerly {{continuation}} of that state's Route284. The route heads northwest for a short distance into the village of Unionville, where it serves as the main thoroughfare through the community. In the center of the village, the highway reaches an intersection with County Route36 (CR36, named Main Street), which heads west to the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> line and becomes CR651 upon entering Sussex County. NY284 turns north at this junction, passing a handful of homes before bending to the northwest and leaving the village limits for less developed areas of Minisink.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1927, {{the route}} was {{a branch of}} pre-1927 Route 6, which had run south from Camden and split into two {{branches}} in Mullica Hill that ran to Salem and Bridgeton. In the 1927 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> highway renumbering, Route 46 was designated along the former branch of pre-1927 Route 6 that ran from Bridgeton to Mullica Hill. In the 1953 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> highway renumbering, which stated that no state route and U.S. route could share the same number, Route 46 was changed to Route 77 to avoid a conflict with US 46 in North Jersey.|$|E

5|$|In the 1953 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> highway renumbering, Route 3 was realigned {{to follow}} {{the entire length of}} the Route S3 freeway. In addition, Route 3 in Secaucus was shifted off the Paterson Plank Road to the newly built Secaucus Bypass. The {{original}} alignment of Route 3 became Route 153. Only the section west of Paterson Plank Road was state-maintained after the renumbering, and the entire route was eliminated by the 1990s. In the mid-1950s, Route 3 was planned as one of the original routes of the Interstate Highway System; however, the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>State</b> Highway Department had deemed it too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards and Interstate 280 was favored instead. In 1959, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as Interstate 495 and Route 3 was truncated back to U.S. Route 1/9 in North Bergen.|$|E

5|$|Route 12 was legislated {{as a new}} {{route in}} the 1927 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> highway {{renumbering}} that was to run from Frenchtown east to Route 28 in Raritan borough, running along its current alignment to Flemington and following present-day US 202 to Raritan. By the 1940s, US 202 and Route 29 were designated along the alignment of Route 12 between Flemington and Raritan, cutting the route's eastern terminus back to Flemington. In the 1953 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> highway renumbering, Route 12 was officially legislated to run from Frenchtown to US 202 and Route 69 (now Route 31) in Flemington. There are currently plans to modify or eliminate the three traffic circles along Route 12 in Flemington in order to ease traffic congestion along the route.

When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route3 became part of the new NY10, which initially began at the <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> line and ended in Saranac Lake. North of Albany, the route followed modern NY5, NY50, and NY9N through Schenectady and Saratoga Springs to reach the North Country at Lake George. Past this point, NY10 continued north on what is now US9, NY8, NY28, NY28N, and NY30 to Tupper Lake via Chestertown, Wevertown, North Creek, and Long Lake. At Tupper Lake, the route headed east on current NY3 to Wawbeek before taking a more circuitous route to Saranac Lake by way of modern NY30, NY186, and NY86.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, the Lincoln Highway was legislated {{as part of}} pre-1927 Route 1 between New Brunswick and Elizabeth and as pre-1927 Route 13 between Trenton and New Brunswick in 1917. In the 1927 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> highway renumbering, Route 27 was {{designated}} to run from Trenton to the intersection of Frelinghuysen Avenue and Astor Street in Newark, replacing the portions of Routes 1 and 13 that ran along the Lincoln Highway. With {{the creation of the}} U.S. Highway System, U.S. Route 1 {{was designated}} along the length of Route 27 from 1927 until sometime before the 1940s, when the U.S. Route 1 designation was moved to Route 26, Route S26, and Route 25 between Trenton and Newark. U.S. Route 206 was designated along the portion of route between Trenton and Princeton by the 1940s. In the 1953 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> highway renumbering, the southern terminus of Route 27 was cut back to Princeton to avoid the U.S. Route 206 concurrency.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> highway renumbering, a spur of Route 41 called Route S41 was legislated to {{run from}} the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge south to Berlin along what is today Route 73. A {{southern}} extension of Route S41 called Route S41A was proposed {{to run from}} Berlin south to Route 42 (now U.S. Route 322) in Folsom in 1938. In the 1953 <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>state</b> highway renumbering, Route S41 and Route S41A were renumbered to Route 73 in order to match Pennsylvania Route 73. With {{the establishment of the}} 500-series county routes in 1952, the current alignment of Route 73 between Berlin and Blue Anchor became a part of County Route 561 while it became County Route 561 Spur between Blue Anchor and Folsom. By 1969, Route 73 was designated south of Berlin along County Route 561 and County Route 561 Spur to the Atlantic City Expressway. By the 2000s, Route 73 was extended south along with County Route 561 Spur from the Atlantic City Expressway to U.S. Route 322.|$|E
