50|$|In {{the case}} of Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board, Mr. Hill was charged with ten counts of robbery, however, he was soon acquitted of all charges. After the charges were dropped, he then sued Hamilton's police service {{as well as some}} of the {{officers}} who were involved in his arrest. Hill argued that the police were negligent in conducting a thorough investigation because the police officers did not properly interview the witnesses, which ultimately led to his arrest. Hill's lawsuit was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada because there was not enough evidence to support Hill's findings that the police were negligent in their duty or standard of care. What is important to note about this particular trial is that three out of the nine Supreme Court Judges did not view the <b>negligent</b> <b>tort</b> claim as being lawful or practical because a strict duty of care towards suspects would therefore interfere with how the police operate in terms of apprehending offenders and investigating crimes.|$|E
40|$|Most {{people think}} that {{breaking}} a promise is immoral, and that a breach of contract {{is a kind of}} broken promise. However, the law does not explicitly recognize the moral context of breach of contract. In these studies, I considered the effect of moral intuitions in three contracts contexts: assigning damages after a breach, making a decision about whether or not to breach a contract when it would be efficient to do so, and breaching a contract that stipulates the damages {{in the body of the}} agreement. Using a series of web-based questionnaires, I asked subjects to read breach of contract cases and answer questions about the legal, financial, and moral implications of each case. In Section 1, I found that subjects 2 ̆ 7 moral intuitions affected their assessment of appropriate damages for breach. Subjects were more punitive toward the breacher when the motivation appeared to be greed than when the motivation appeared to be fear. When presented with identical losses, one from an intentional breach of contract and the other from a <b>negligent</b> <b>tort,</b> subjects were more punitive toward the breacher than the negligent tortfeasor. Section 2 asked subjects to consider the breach decision from the point-of-view of the would-be breacher. When asked to put themselves into the position of a promisor who must decide whether to exploit an efficient breach opportunity, subjects were much less likely to breach than an economic hypothesis would predict. Subjects 2 ̆ 7 predictions about the legal ramifications of breach indicated that they thought that specific performance and punitive damages were both likely results, and that even when they were informed that damages would not exceed expectation level, they were still averse to breach. Section 3 attempts to reconcile the importance to subjects of moral norms of promising with the economic efficiency of some breaches of contract. In the last experiment, subjects were asked to think about the effect of a liquidated damages clause on their intuitions. Subjects required less money to breach contracts with liquidated damages than otherwise identical contracts. ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the problem with the {{apportionment}} of responsibility in the case is not the jury's verdict, but rather New York's tort-reform-produced state apportionment law. Traditionally, courts do not compare intentional and negligent fault. [...] The Restatement Third of Torts: Apportionment of Liability recommends a rule to prevent juries from having to make comparisons like the terrorist-Port Authority comparison in this case. However, if a jurisdiction does compare these intentional and <b>negligent</b> <b>torts,</b> courts' second-best position is to do what the NYS Appeals Court did—to uphold all jury apportionments, even those that assign greater, or perhaps far greater, responsibility to negligent than intentional parties.|$|R
5000|$|The key {{difference}} between intentional <b>torts</b> and <b>negligent</b> <b>torts</b> {{is that the}} plaintiff must prove the additional element that the defendant acted with the specific intent to perform (i.e., acted with a mental state of intentionally performing) the act that was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries (so-called malice). [...] "The concept of 'intention' in the intentional torts does not require that defendants know that their acts will result in harm to the plaintiffs. Defendants must know only that their acts will result in certain consequences." [...] Under doctrines such as transferred intent, the plaintiff need not always prove that the defendant acted {{with the intent to}} bring about the specific injury that actually occurred.|$|R
50|$|Each {{theory of}} {{liability}} has certain conditions, or elements, {{that must be}} proven by the claimant before liability will be established. For example, the theory of negligence requires the claimant to prove that (1) the defendant had a duty; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the defendant's breach caused the injury; and (4) that injury resulted in recoverable damages. Theories of liability can also be created by legislation. For example, under English law, {{with the passing of}} the Theft Act 1978, it is an offense to evade a liability dishonestly. Payment of damages usually resolves the liability. A given liability may be covered by insurance. In general, however, insurance providers only cover liabilities arising from <b>negligent</b> <b>torts</b> rather than intentional wrongs or breach of contract.|$|R
50|$|As {{a matter}} of public policy, damages {{available}} for intentional torts tend to be broader and more generous than for <b>negligent</b> <b>torts.</b> To preserve individual well-being and overall social welfare, society generally wishes to deter its members from intentionally attacking each other. For example, in the United States, it is easier to get punitive damages (damages above and beyond compensatory damages) if one can prove that the tort was intentional. Similarly, in most Australian jurisdictions, intentional torts are not included in civil liability legislation, thus excluding the threshold of injury and damages payouts from various legislated limitations and caps. But it is harder to prove intentional torts because as with many felony crimes, one must prove subjective elements involving the content of the defendant's mind, and defendants do not always express their harmful intent out loud or in writing.|$|R
5000|$|A false or {{apparent}} conflict {{occurs when}} the state offering the protection has no actual interest in the endorsement of that protection against the particular parties to the case. For example, some states prohibit spouses from suing one another for <b>negligent</b> <b>torts,</b> {{in order to prevent}} them from colluding in order to collect from insurance companies. Other states permit such suits, on the theory that people should be able to recover for their injuries, and possible collusion can be presented as a factor for the jury to deal with. Suppose that a couple, A and B, live in state X, which prohibits these suits, and they travel to state Y, which permits these suits. While in state Y, A negligently injures B, and upon their return to state X, B sues A in the court of state X, asserting that the law of state Y should govern. In this case, since neither party is from state Y, state Y has no interest in the application of the law to these persons.|$|R
5000|$|Special damages - {{quantifiable}} dollar losses {{suffered from}} the date of defendant's <b>negligent</b> act (the <b>tort)</b> up to a specified time (proven at trial). Special damage examples include lost wages, medical bills, and damage to property such as one's car.|$|R
5000|$|Business or {{economic}} torts typically involve commercial transactions, and include tortious interference with trade or contract, fraud, injurious falsehood, and negligent misrepresentation. <b>Negligent</b> misrepresentation <b>torts</b> are distinct from contractual cases involving misrepresentation {{in that there}} is no privity of contract; these torts are likely to involve pure economic loss which has been less-commonly recoverable in tort. One criterion for determining whether economic loss is recoverable is the [...] "foreseeability" [...] doctrine. The economic loss rule is highly confusing and inconsistently applied. In 2010, {{the supreme court of the}} U.S. state of Washington replaced the economic loss doctrine with an [...] "independent duty doctrine".|$|R
40|$|This {{article will}} focus on {{reforming}} the <b>tort</b> of <b>negligent</b> hiring to limit the liability of employers while also ensuring the compensation of certain victims when the employer fails {{to meet the requirements}} of the reformed tort. While the tort is currently recognized by most states, the states that have recognized the tort have different standards for liability and little clarity is provided to employers on how to avoid liability. By creating certainty in the marketplace through a reformed <b>negligent</b> hiring <b>tort,</b> states can encourage business activity from civic-minded businesses while holding businesses, which fail to exhibit good civic behavior, strictly liable for the actions of its employees in certain situations...|$|R
2500|$|Torts may be {{categorized}} in several ways, with a particularly common division between <b>negligent</b> and intentional <b>torts.</b> Quasi-torts {{may be used}} to refer to torts which are similar to but somewhat different from typical torts. Particularly in the United States, [...] "collateral tort" [...] is used to refer to torts in labour law such as intentional infliction of emotional distress ("outrage"); or wrongful dismissal; these evolving causes of action are debated and overlap with contract law or other legal areas to some degree.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Negligent</b> {{misrepresentation}} as <b>tort</b> {{where no}} contractual privity exists was disallowed in England by Derry v Peek however, this position was overturned in Hedley Byrne v Heller in 1964 so that such actions were allowed if a [...] "special relationship" [...] {{existed between the}} plaintiff and defendant. United States courts and scholars [...] "paid lip-service" [...] to Derry; however, scholars such as William Prosser {{argued that it was}} misinterpreted by English courts. The case of Ultramares Corporation v. Touche (1932) limited the liability of an auditor to known identified beneficiaries of the audit and this rule was widely applied in the United States until the 1960s. The Restatement (Second) of Torts expanded liability to [...] "foreseeable" [...] users rather than specifically identified [...] "foreseen" [...] users of the information, dramatically expanding liability and affecting professionals such as accountants, architects, attorneys, and surveyors. As of 1989, most U.S. jurisdictions follow either the Ultramares approach or the Restatement approach.|$|R
