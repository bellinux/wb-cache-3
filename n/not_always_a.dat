5|$|Parthia {{had always}} posed {{a threat to}} Rome in the east, but the real battlefront was along the Rhine and Danube rivers. Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia were {{the first step in}} {{expanding}} Roman dominions to the Danube. Victory in battle was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Wallwork {{moved to}} West Bromwich Albion, {{where he was}} the Player of the Year for 2004–05. He was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> regular in the side however, and spent time on loan at Bradford City, Barnsley and Huddersfield Town. His spell at Barnsley was cut short when he was stabbed in a nightclub, causing him to miss more than two months of the 2006–07 season. Wallwork was {{transferred}} to Sheffield Wednesday in January 2008, but was released just four months later. In December 2011, he was sentenced to 15 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to three counts of receiving stolen goods.|$|E
5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} are <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis {{makes use of}} this property. SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances {{have shown that the}} former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem to play an important role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E

25|$|The consuls' {{terms of}} office were <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> modern {{calendar}} year, but ordinary consuls were elected or appointed annually. The traditional list of Roman consuls used by the Romans to date their years began in 509.|$|E
25|$|Cation-heterocycle {{interaction}} is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> cation-π interaction; {{in some cases}} it is more favorable for the ion to be bound directly to a lone pair. For example, this is thought to be the case in pyridine-Na+ complexes.|$|E

25|$|The French {{language}} {{is a symbol of}} Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan. It remains a spoken language of the Métis, francophones and various other peoples who live there today. However, French was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> priority in the town’s schools.|$|E
25|$|The {{church that}} has the {{function}} of cathedral is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> large building. It might be as small as Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. But frequently, the cathedral, {{along with some of}} the abbey churches, was the largest building in any region.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the {{commander}} of the band has been a Captain, if {{the commander}} is a senior. If there are no seniors, the commander has been an enlisted officer. Over the years, the Drum Major was <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> senior, especially in early years of the band.|$|E

25|$|Although {{white was}} <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> {{recognized}} {{color in the}} various German Spitz breeds, it was generally the preferred color in the US. In a display of patriotism in the era around World War I, dog owners began referring to their pets as American Spitz rather than German Spitz.|$|E
25|$|As President, Ciampi was not {{considered}} to be close to the positions of the Vatican and the Catholic Church, in a sort of alternance after the devout Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

25|$|Defamation is the {{communication}} {{of a statement}} that makes a claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may give an individual, business, product, group, government or nation a negative image.

25|$|Christianity {{arose in}} the Greco-Roman world {{of the first and}} second century CE, synthesizing Greek and Jewish {{philosophy}} of the Second Temple period. Per religious syncretism early Christianity shared common philosophical and religious ideas with other religions of the time, including the ideas of personified aspects of God and of the salvation figures—featured in mystery religions—who were often (but <b>not</b> <b>always)</b> <b>a</b> dying-and-rising god.|$|E
25|$|Balance {{refers to}} the {{relative}} volume {{of each of the}} instruments. Because chamber music is a conversation, sometimes one instrument must stand out, sometimes another. It is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> simple matter for members of an ensemble to determine the proper balance while playing; frequently, they require an outside listener, or a recording of their rehearsal, to tell them that the relations between the instruments are correct.|$|E
25|$|Traditional hand {{harvesting}} {{of whole}} bunches has been increasingly {{challenged by the}} harvesting machine for dry white wines, an economic choice but <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> qualitative one. The fragility of the grape requires either a rapid transfer to the Winery, or protection from oxidation. When the transport time between vine and winery is long, the harvest can be refrigerated and kept away from oxygen using nitrogen or dry ice.|$|E

25|$|The {{conservation}} of large chromosomal segments makes comparison between species worthwhile. Chromosome banding {{has been a}} reliable indicator of chromosome homology overall, i.e. that the chromosome identified {{on the basis of}} banding actually carries the same genes. This relationship may fail for phylogenetically distant species or species that have experienced extremely rapid chromosome evolution. Banding is still morphological and is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> foolproof indicator of DNA content.|$|E
25|$|While {{he was a}} mercurial {{and often}} restless leader, and <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> wise king, he was {{considered}} one of the greatest military commanders of his time. In his Life of Pyrrhus, Plutarch records that Hannibal ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen, though in the life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus, Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after Alexander the Great. This latter account is also given by Appian.|$|E
25|$|Because {{hardened}} metal {{is usually}} more brittle than softer metal, through-hardening (that is, hardening the metal uniformly throughout the piece) is <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> suitable choice for uses where the metal part {{is subject to}} sliding contact with hard or abrasive materials. In such circumstances, case-hardening can provide a part that will not fracture (because of the soft core that can absorb stresses without cracking) but also provides adequate wear resistance on the surface.|$|E
