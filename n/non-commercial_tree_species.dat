In this {{study the effects of}} silvicultural treatment on the growth rates of commercial (dipterocarps and non-dipterocarps) as well as non- commercial tree species in a tropical forest in West Kalimantan were examined and were compared to a control treatment. Silvicultural treatment applied was liberation of future crop trees from lianas and neighbouring competing trees. Treatments were applied to six plots of 80 m x 80 m each. The plots comprised 64 quadrats of 10 m x 10 m to allow better control of measurements. The treatment and control plots were established 6 years after logging. Effects were measured 2, 4 and 7 years after treatment application. In all obser vation periods, the growth rates increased with silvicultural treatment. Overall, commercial dipterocarps, commercial non-dipterocarps and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>tree</b> <b>species</b> groups differed in response to silvicultural treatment. The growth rates of commercial tree species in plots that received silvicultural treatment were 62 – 97 % higher than in the control plots. For <b>non-commercial</b> <b>tree</b> <b>species,</b> the increase of growth rates was 20 – 58 %, compared to the control plots. These results indicate that the application of silvicultural treatments after logging could help improve the growth of the residual stands. These provide quantitative information that silvicultural treatments in logged-over forest should be considered as a viable management option and may guide the choice of cutting cycle...|$|E

Although these fungi have been relatively well studied on economically important crops, hardly anything is known regarding their taxonomy or ecology on native or <b>non-commercial</b> <b>tree</b> <b>species.</b> The aim of this study was to compare the diversity and distribution of the Botryosphaeriaceae on Terminalia catappa, a tropical tree of Asian origin planted as an ornamental in Cameroon, Madagascar and South Africa. A total of 83 trees were sampled, yielding 79 Botryosphaeriaceae isolates. Isolates were initially grouped based on morphology of cultures and conidia. Representatives of the different morphological groups were then further characterised using sequence data for the ITS, tef 1 -alpha, rpb 2, BOTF 15 and beta-tubulin gene regions. Five species of the Botryosphaeriaceae were identified, including Neofusicoccum parvum, N. batangarum sp. nov., Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae, L. theobromae and L. mahajangana sp. nov. Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae and L. theobromae, were the most commonly isolated species (62 %), and were found at all the sites. Neofusicoccum parvum and N. batangarum were found in South Africa and Cameroon, respectively, whereas L. mahajangana was found only in Madagascar. Greenhouse inoculation trials performed on young T. catappa trees showed variation among isolates tested, with L. pseudotheobromae being the most pathogenic. The Botryosphaeriaceae infecting T. catappa appear to be dominated by generalist species that also occur on various other hosts in tropical and sub-tropical climates.
