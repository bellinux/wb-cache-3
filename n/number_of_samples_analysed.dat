As a requirement of the regulatory framework for wastewater reuse, periodic water quality monitoring has been implemented to demonstrate microbial compliance for the intended end-use. For this study, we originally planned to analyse the compliance of the 92 water recycling schemes in the database over a 7 year period (2003 – 2009); however, {{it was necessary to}} exclude 21 schemes because they either lacked sufficient data or their recording standards were too inconsistent for the analysis.

40|$|Single cell gel {{electrophoresis}} (the comet assay), continues to gain popularity {{as a means}} of assessing DNA damage. However, the assay’s low sample throughput and laborious sample workup procedure are limiting factors to its application. “Scoring”, or individually determining DNA damage levels in 50 cells per treatment, is time-consuming, but with the advent of high-throughput scoring, the limitation is now the ability to process significant numbers of comet slides. We have developed a novel method by which multiple slides may be manipulated, and undergo electrophoresis, in batches of 25 rather than individually and, importantly, retains the use of standard microscope comet slides, which are the assay convention. This decreases assay time by 60 %, and benefits from an electrophoresis tank with a substantially smaller footprint, and more uniform orientation of gels during electrophoresis. Our high-throughput variant of the comet assay greatly increases the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> <b>analysed,</b> decreases assay time, number of individual slide manipulations, reagent requirements and risk of damage to slides.

40|$|Summary. The {{changes in}} {{concentration}} of oestrone, oestradiol (- 17 =a and- 17 =b, oestrone sulphate and the oestradiol sulphates have been measured in allantoic and amniotic fluids and in maternal peripheral plasma throughout gestation. Oestrone sulphate {{was the major}} oestrone present {{in all of the}} fluids. It was measurable in allantoic fluid before Day 52 and reached a peak concentration of 475 ng/ml around Day 133. A lower peak occurred in the amniotic fluid around Day 110. The changes in oestradiol sulphates in allantoic fluid were similar to those of oestrone sulphate but at a much lower level. Considerable fluctuation was observed in the oestradiol sulphate concentrations in amniotic fluid. The ratio of oestradiol- 17 =a sulphate to oestradiol- 17 =b sulphate was considerably higher in amniotic fluid than in allantoic fluid. Consistent changes in the levels of oestrone and the oestradiols were found in amniotic fluid but not in allantoic fluid {{during the second half of}} pregnancy.

Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences (663 bp of the control region) did not show any differences between Brazilian populations but could detect differences between Brazilian and Caribbean (Belize) populations. The samples from Pernambuco differed significantly from the other Brazilian populations in allozyme frequencies (11 loci; FST = 0. 167; p < 0. 05), but this may have resulted from the small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> <b>analysed</b> for that population.

40|$|In {{analyzing}} systems which {{depend on}} uncertain parameters, one technique is to partition the uncertain parameter domain into a failure set and its complement, and judge {{the quality of}} the system by estimating the probability of failure.

40|$|Pancreas disease {{caused by}} salmonid alphavirus in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) leads to high {{mortality}} rates post infection and histopathological lesions in several organs. As protection against pancreas disease, Novartis developed a prophylactic DNA plasmid-based vaccine {{to be administered}} to salmon as naked plasmid in a single intramuscular injection. In order to assess {{the legal status of}} the fish vaccinated with this new vaccine with regard to the legislation on genetically modified organisms, the European Commission suggested that the company carry out a scientific study on the integration/non-integration of the plasmid DNA into the fish genome. Subsequently, the European Commission requested EFSA to give scientific advice on the study design and the conclusions drawn by the company. PCR based analysis of genomic DNA from muscle samples, taken from at or around the injection site 436 days post vaccination, led the company to conclude that integration of plasmid DNA into the fish genome is extremely unlikely. After an assessment of the study, EFSA considers that the study presented by Novartis Animal Health on the integration/non-integration of DNA plasmid-based vaccine into the salmon genomic DNA provides insufficient information on the potential integration of plasmid DNA fragments into the fish genome due to a limited coverage of the plasmid DNA by the detection method provided, the limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> <b>analysed</b> and an insufficient limit of detection and method validation. Therefore, EFSA is of the opinion that the results from the integration/non-integration study submitted by Novartis Animal Health are not sufficient to support the conclusion of non-integration of plasmid DNA into the fish genome drawn by the company...|$|E
40|$|On January 1 st, 2006, the Swedish {{legislation}} on obtaining DNA reference samples from Suspects and {{the recording of}} DNA profiles in databases was changed. As a result the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> <b>analysed</b> at the Swedish National Laboratory of Forensic Science (SKL) increased from about 4500 in 2005 to more than 25, 000 in 2006. To meet this challenge, SKL launched a flew analysis system to create an unbroken chain, from sampling to incorporation of a profile in the national DNA database and subsequent automatic generation of digitally signed hit reports. The system integrates logistics, digital data transfer, new functions in LIMS (ForumDNA Version 4, Ida Infront AB) and laboratory automation. Buccal swab samples are secured on a FTA (R) card attached to an identity form, which is barcoded with a unique sample ID. After sampling, the police officer sends a digital request to SKL. The sample is automatically registered in LIMS and processed on delivery. The resulting DNA profiles are automatically classified according to quality using a custom-made expert system. Building the evaluation around mathematical rules makes it reproducible, standardised and minimises manual work and clerk errors. All samples are run in duplicate and the two profiles are compared within LIMS before incorporation in the database. In {{the first year of}} operation, the median time for completion of an analysis was 3 days, measured from delivery of the sample to incorporation of the profile in the national DNA database.

The technique {{has been used}} for nearly two decades, but initial development has concentrated on qualitative description of images. More recently, increasing effort has been put into quantifying the geometry and topology of macropores likely to contribute to preferential now in soils. Here we describe a novel technique for tracing connected macropores in the CT scans. After object extraction, three-dimensional mathematical morphological filters are applied to quantify the reconstructed structure. These filters consist of sequences of so-called erosions and/or dilations of a 32 -face structuring element to describe object distances and volumes of influence. The tracing and quantification methodologies were tested on a set of undisturbed soil cores collected in a Swiss pre-alpine meadow, where a new earthworm species (Aporrectodea nocturna) was accidentally introduced. Given the reduced <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> <b>analysed</b> in this study, the results presented only illustrate the potential of the method to reconstruct and quantify macropores. Our results suggest that the introduction of the new species induced very limited chance to the soil structured for example, no difference in total macropore length or mean diameter was observed. However. in the zone colonised by, the new species. individual macropores tended to have a longer average length. be more vertical and be further apart at some depth. Overall, the approach proved well suited to the analysis of the three-dimensional architecture of macropores.

40|$|The {{cochineal}} insect Dactylopius opuntiae {{has been}} an extremely successful biocontrol agent of the cactus weed Opuntia ficus-indica. Its resounding success has allowed {{us to take a}} closer look at how the relationships between biocontrol agents and their host plants are maintained. The prickly pear, O. ficus-indica, is the sole source of food for the cochineal insect and provides it with refuge and shelter. Wind, sun and particularly rain leave the cochineal insects vulnerable to predators as their protective waxy coating is eroded by the elements. The behaviour of the insects to settle on the sheltered side of cactus cladodes is not unexpected when one takes the stresses into account. One curious fact that has arisen from this is that the insects that do settle on the sheltered side of the cladode are larger and more fecund than those that settle on the exposed surface of the cladode. The nutritional quality of the plant was investigated as a possible explanation for the disparity in size. Phloem sap was collected from the severed stylets of cochineal insects and analysed for polyphenols (which inhibit growth) and amino acids (responsible for growth). The indication from the polyphenol analysis was that it was not responsible for inhibiting growth in cochineal insects. Amino acid analysis from two different cladodes gave conflicting results and no definite conclusions could be drawn from these. Increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> <b>analysed</b> will give us a better idea of any trends that could possibly exist.

40|$|International audienceCommission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC {{requires}} confirmatory {{analysis of}} B-group compounds when detected at levels above the permitted limit. In contrast to banned substances, for B-group substances {{the use of}} mass spectrometric techniques is not obligatory and several techniques including LC-UV on two different LC-columns and (single column) HPLC-fluorescence (LC-Flu) are considered to deliver sufficient prove for {{the identification of the}} detected substance. The analysis of sodium salicylate in animal drinking water collected at poultry farms is presented here as an example to show that even in a simple matrix like animal drinking water, fluorescence detection in some cases may provide insufficient specificity. Of 50 samples analysed by LC-Flu 18 tested positive for sodium salicylate. However, only in one sample the presence of the analyte was confirmed with mass spectrometric detection, the others were blank. Consequently, the LC-Flu results obtained were false-non-compliant for sodium salicylate. A second case concerning the analysis of avermectins in milk by HLPC-fluorescence is briefly described. For a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> <b>analysed</b> in the framework of a proficiency test, false non-compliant results for emamectin were reported, due to a background interference sometimes present which practically coeluted with the analyte. The observed retention time difference (1 %) was well below the criterion (2. 5 %) specified in CD 2002 / 657 /EC. Considering the impact of positive findings on individual farmers as well as on trade, product image and food safety perception by the consumer it is concluded that also for B-group substances false-non-compliant results should be avoided whenever possible. This is especially important when the obtained results are treated as and are expected to have the same repercussions as in case of banned A-group substances. In these circumstances only results obtained by mass spectrometry should be considered for confirmatory purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the relative amounts of the B and C components of neomycin sulphate by thin-layer chromatography using silica gel plates from Whatman as the stationary phase is described. The mobile phase consisted of methanol- 20 % (m/v) sodium chloride solution (15 : 85). Fluorescence detection was performed after derivatization with 4 -chloro- 7 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole. The influence of different parameters on the separation was investigated. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> commercial <b>samples</b> was <b>analysed</b> using this method {{and the results were}} compared with results obtained with ion-exchange chromatography and ninhydrin colorimetric detection, which is the official method prescribed by the European Pharmacopoeia. The described method is much easier to perform than the official method. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The geochemical {{properties}} of urban soils {{from more than}} 300 cities in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and America were evaluated. [...] In each settlement samples were collected uniformly throughout the territory, covering residential, industrial, recreational and other urban areas. The sampling was carried out directly from the soil surface and specifically traversed pits, ditches and wells from the upper soil horizon. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> in each locality ranged from 30 to 1000. The published data and the materials kindly provided by a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> geochemists were also incorporated into the research. Considering the great importance of the defined contents, quantitative and quantitative emission spectral, gravimetric, X-ray fluorescence, and partly neutron activation analyses were carried out in parallel approximately in the samples. In a volume of 3-5% <b>of</b> the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples,</b> <b>sampling</b> and <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> the inner and external controls were conducted. Calculation of random errors and systematic errors allowed to consider the sampling and analytical laboratory work as good.|$|R
40|$|During 1995 a total <b>of</b> 44 <b>samples</b> {{taken from}} 16 {{different}} species of fin-fish were collected from five Irish fishing ports and analysed for total mercury content in the edible tissue, {{in accordance with the}} European Commission's Decision of 19 May 1993. The concentration of mercury ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 28 with a mean of 0. 09 µg. g- 1 wet weight. These levels are low and are well within the maximum limits set by the EC for mercury in fisheries products. This survey confirms previous studies that show Irish seafoods are effectively free from mercury contamination. In addition a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> were also <b>analysed</b> for cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, chromium and chlorinated hydrocarbons. Although there are no EU guidelines or standards for these additional contaminants, the levels are well below the strictest standards or guidance values applied by Contractin...|$|R
