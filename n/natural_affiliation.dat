50|$|The {{definition}} of the national unity of German was a major difficulty for the Frankfurt National Assembly. Schleswig's <b>natural</b> <b>affiliation</b> was a smaller problem. The biggest problem was that large portions {{of the two most}} powerful states in the German Confederacy, Prussia and especially Austria, had large possessions outside the confederation with non-German populations. Incorporating such areas into a German nation-state did not only raise questions regarding the national identity of their inhabitants, but also regarding power politics between the German states. On the other hand, Bohemia and Moravia were to remain within the confederation, in spite of large non-German populations and Czech efforts to the opposite. Similarly, the delegates decided to incorporate the Prussian Province of Posen, against the wishes of the Polish population.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The only {{national}} drug abuse prevention delivery system {{that supports the}} rapid diffusion of new prevention strategies and includes uniform training and credentialing of instructors who are monitored for quality implementation of prevention programming is the Drug Abuse Resistance Education network (D. A. R. E.) linking community law enforcement to schools. Analysis of the organizational structure and function of D. A. R. E. provides {{an understanding of the}} essential parameters of this successful delivery system {{that can be used in}} the development of other types of national infrastructures for community-based prevention services. Information regarding organizational structure and function around funding issues, training, quality control and community relationships was gathered through telephone surveys with 50 state D. A. R. E. coordinators (including two major cities), focus groups with local D. A. R. E. officers and mentors, and interviews with national D. A. R. E. office staff. Results The surveys helped identify several strengths inherent in the D. A. R. E. program necessary for building a prevention infrastructure, including a well-defined organizational focus (D. A. R. E. America), uniform training and means for rapid dissemination (through its organized training structure), continuing education mechanisms (through the state and national conference and website), mechanisms for program monitoring and fidelity of implementation (formal and informal), branding and, for several states, predictable and consistent financing. Weaknesses of the program as currently structured include unstable funding and the failure to incorporate components for the continual upgrading of curricula reflecting research evidence and "principles of prevention". Conclusion The D. A. R. E. organization and service delivery network provides a framework for the rapid dissemination of evidence-based prevention strategies. The major strength of D. A. R. E. is its <b>natural</b> <b>affiliation</b> to local law enforcement agencies through state coordinators. Through these affiliations, it has been possible for D. A. R. E. to become established nationally within a few years and internationally within a decade. Understanding how this structure developed and currently functions provides insights into how other such delivery systems could be developed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Crystal {{engineering}} {{underlies the}} essence of <b>natural</b> <b>affiliation</b> between the molecule {{on the one side}} and the crystal as a supramolecular assembly on the other. Molecular recognition is the fundamental cause for this efficient transformation and if we consider the crystal as a supramolecular entity then {{it is not at all}} difficult to conceive crystallization as an outstanding example of molecular recognition. In general, organic compounds often facilitate closed packed crystal structures as described by A. I. Kitaigorodskii in the form of the close packing principle but based on chemical features, there is still a small window to understand, to rationalize and to fashion new crystal structures. Extending the chemical viewpoint as first proposed by J. M. Robertson, the supramolecular synthon model as a descriptor of collective crystal structures has been invoked that enables one to trail the molecular behaviour from an entropy dominated situation in solution to an enthalpy driven progression in the solid state. After 20 years, the concept of the supramolecular synthon has stood the test of time because of its simplicity and effectiveness towards the implementation in complex crystal structures and has led the scientific community to further handle complex and interesting ideas in structural chemistry and supramolecular synthesis. The complexity of dynamic and progressive behavior of molecules during crystallization may be understood by the analogous argument of protein folding; both these complex phenomena decode the emergence of multiple metastable forms before the final structures are attained. These intermediate kinetically driven species may be high energy polymorphs and pseudopolymorphs of the compound in question or semicompact random globules for proteins. Understanding the role of these species in their respective processes is of critical importance in elucidating mechanisms. As an alternative approach, crystal structure prediction (CSP) is also of fundamental importance in the context of understanding the crystallization process. All energy based computational methods of CSP address this problem by scanning the multi-dimensional energy hypersurface. This is performed by computing lattice energy changes with respect to parameters like unit cell dimensions, space group symmetry and the positional coordinates of atoms in the asymmetric unit. Further, the computational prediction of the crystal structure of an organic compound results in several choices, and it is possible that a collection of some of these when taken together forms a pattern that mimics the course of the crystallization process very much in the manner that structure correlation mimics covalent bond breaking and making. With all these developments, one is truly at the stage today when any experimental or computed crystal structure is just that, a crystal structure of the molecule in question and it is part of a complex and dynamic structural space which may include a part of the supramolecular reaction trajectory for crystallization itself. Accordingly, this thesis emphasizes the importance of kinetic events during crystallization and proposes some strategies to access the inaccessible domains of this structural space of a given compound. I have exploited the supramolecular synthon model to understand the kinetics of the crystallization process and have further extended this understanding towards the isolation of stoichiometric ternary solids. The synthon model also helps one to provide a logical step to explore these remote domains of the complex hyperenergy surface that have collectively been termed as the crystal structure landscape of the compound in question. The precise descriptions of the chapters are mentioned below. Chapter 2 describes fluorosubstitution as a unique chemical probe to explore the high energy crystal structures of benzoic acid in ambient conditions. This landscape exploration of benzoic acid is based on the robust (kinetically favoured) supramolecular homosynthon as well as consistent fluorosubstitution in native compound. This analysis is also supported by synthon based crystal structure prediction which is one of the best ways of monitoring high energy virtual crystal structures. Chapter 3 extends the idea of landscape exploration towards multicomponent systems. The incorporation of an additional compound during crystallization facilitates even complex kinetic environments but using fluorosubstitution as a chemical probe, it again helps to analyse the high energy virtual domains of the given multicomponent system. Similar to chapter 2, the landscape exploration of multicomponent system is also based on the robust (kinetically favoured) supramolecular heterosynthon as well as consistent fluorosubstitution in the native multicomponent system. Chapter 4 emphasizes the importance of synthon modularity as a chemical probe to traverse in the crystal structure landscape of the given multicomponent system. Here, I have quantified the role of the definitive synthon, by using the supramolecular synthon based fragment approach (SBFA), in the emergence of polymorphism in cocrystals. In latter part of this chapter, I utilized this collective kinetic information in order to realize the combinatorial nature of the crystallization process and showed the complex combinatorial synthesis of ternary solids which itself is considered to be an arduous exercise. Chapter 5 discusses the importance of kinetic information which were fetched from the corresponding multicomponent landscapes and were further utilized for combinatorial synthesis of ternary solids. Although the combinatorial idea is well established in solution, this chapter highlights the first experimental evidence of this idea in the solid state and shows preferred amplification of certain supramolecular synthons from corresponding libraries in the supersaturated crystallizing medium. Chapter 6 extends the combinatorial idea of crystallization even further by using highly flexible organic compounds that collectively provide larger structural space during crystallization. Using the delicate kinetic information about the molecular and supramolecular features, this chapter describes the preferential selection of molecular conformation and supramolecular synthons from the supersaturated solution during the moleculeâ†’crystal pathway. In summary, the idea of the crystal structure landscape provides an extended interpretation about some of the complex ideas namely, crystal energy landscape and polymorphism in modern crystal engineering. The crystallization of an organic compound often depends upon intrinsic chemical features and accordingly one selects optimized crystallization routes in the corresponding landscape through decisive experimental conditions. As a final note, the idea of the crystal structure landscape enables one to (at least qualitatively) understand the importance of crystallization kinetics which is understandably a difficult task...|$|E
