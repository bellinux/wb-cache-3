5|$|In February 1975, {{during the}} midst of Tet New Year celebrations, a <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> deserter {{surrendered}} himself to the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters. Through extensive interrogations, the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldier revealed the whereabouts of <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> units; the 10th Infantry Division had encircled Duc Lap, while the 320A Infantry Division had arrived in Ea H’leo and were gearing up for an assault on Thuan Man, and an unknown unit was heading towards Ban Me Thuot. In late February, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> artillery shells began to rain down on Pleiku, which convinced General Phu that the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> would attack Pleiku instead of Ban Me Thuot. South Vietnamese military intelligence and information received from the American Embassy in Saigon showed the presence of {{about two or three}} <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> combat divisions positioned about 20kilometres away from Kontum and Pleiku. Indeed, the movements around Pleiku and Kontum during the month of February were designed by the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Tay Nguyen Front to fool South Vietnamese military commanders in the Central Highlands.|$|E
5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> field {{commanders in}} the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders concluded that the South Vietnamese army in the Central Highlands could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South Vietnamese units were not tied up elsewhere, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E
5|$|For <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> field {{commanders of}} the Tay Nguyen Front, the {{withdrawal}} of South Vietnamese military forces from II Corps Tactical Zone came as a surprise, {{but it was not}} totally unexpected. What surprised the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> the most was the speed of the withdrawal. Indeed, {{it was not until the}} evening of March 15, when the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron reached Cheo Reo, that the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> began to receive information of Saigon’s decision to abandon the Central Highlands. At 8pm on March 16, the Tay Nguyen Front Command issued the first orders to pursue the South Vietnamese. The <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment, part of the 320A Infantry Division, was the first unit to be mobilised to intercept the South Vietnamese column south of Cheo Reo district. Subsequently, the entire <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 320A Infantry Division was sent to destroy the South Vietnamese column along Route 7, with the 2nd Tank Battalion of the 273rd Armoured Regiment, the 675th Regiment, and the 593rd Anti-Aircraft Regiment in support. By the early hours of March 17, tanks from the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron and the 6th Ranger Battalion clashed with the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment at Tuna Pass, about 4kilometres away from the district of Cheo Reo.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to halt the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> assault, Luat ordered two squadrons of M-113 {{armoured}} personnel carriers to confront the enemy at Nga Sau, but {{they were forced to}} turn back by tanks from the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 3rd Tank Battalion, 273rd Armoured Regiment. At around 5:30pm, a South Vietnamese ranger battalion was forced to abandon the nearby installation at Dac Lac after continuous assaults from the 95B Regiment. In the northeast, the South Vietnamese 9th Ranger Battalion held off the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 95B Regiment until they abandoned their positions on the next day. In the western outskirts of Ban Me Thuot, eight A-37 Dragonfly bombers from the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division inflicted light casualties on the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 24th Regiment, but failed to stop their enemies’ momentum. In the southwest, Quang tried to retake Mai Hac De by mobilising his reserve units with tactical air support. Meanwhile, in the south-eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 149th Regiment defeated the South Vietnamese 53rd Infantry Regiment, after they sustained heavy casualties from repeated air attacks from A-37 bombers.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January, La Thanh Ton, an NVA {{lieutenant}} {{from the}} 325th Division, defected {{and laid out}} the plans for an entire series of <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> attacks. Hills 881 South, 861, and the main base itself would be simultaneously attacked that same evening. At 00:30 on 21 January, Hill 861 was attacked by approximately 300 <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> troops. The Marines, however, were prepared. The <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> infantry, though bracketed by artillery fire, still managed to penetrate {{the perimeter of the}} defenses and were only driven back after severe close-quarters combat.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bombing}} of the Presidential Palace, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> General Văn Tiến Dũng and his field commanders had been {{discussing}} the possibility of deploying units of the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF), to attack high-value South Vietnamese targets in support of <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> ground troops. Use of the Soviet MiG-17 fighter was considered, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> pilots already had significant combat experience with the type. However, moving MiGs from their bases in North Vietnam was problematic; South Vietnamese defenses were falling much faster than anticipated, there was simply little time in which to deploy the MiGs in support of <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> units encircling Saigon. As the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> had captured a large number of U.S.-made aircraft from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force at Pleiku and Da Nang Air Bases, it was decided to use captured aircraft instead.|$|E

50|$|During the Third International Vietnamese Youth Conference in 2003 in San Diego, {{there were}} initial talks for {{creating}} a network of Vietnamese Student Associations in North America modeled after the Federal Vietnamese Students Association of Australia.

5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, the rules of {{engagement}} prevented U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> air bases, and that allowed <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> MiG fighters up against a decoy target, and shoot them down in the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the right time to launch a decoy operation.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{soldiers}} at outpost number 3 called on supporting artillery units at Khâm Đức to fire directly {{at their own}} position {{in an attempt to}} hold off the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese,</b> but they too were defeated a few moments later. Before sunrise, all seven outposts were firmly in <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> hands, so U.S. and allied soldiers were placed in a perilous position. The <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> had occupied all the high ground, from which they could fire down on any support aircraft that tried to resupply the camp or to evacuate people from it. By sunrise, the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> moved closer to the Special Forces Camp under the cover of the early morning fog. About one hour before the fog was lifted, an additional 24 B-52 bombers flew in and dropped several hundred tons of bombs on suspected <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> positions south of Khâm Đức. At 08:20, General Burl W. McLaughlin – commander of the 834th Air Division – was ordered by the U.S. 7th Air Force to make an all-out effort to evacuate the besieged Special Forces Camp at Khâm Đức. By 09:35, the B-52 strikes had clearly failed to stop the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> advance, when the camp's south-eastern perimeter was subjected to a massive ground assault.|$|E
5|$|While the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was {{transporting}} the 23rd Infantry Division to the battlefield, their airbase at Cu Hanh {{was subjected}} to artillery bombardment from the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 968th Infantry Division. The <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Central Highlands Front had anticipated the South Vietnamese military's movements, so they built up their forces in and around Ban Me Thuot {{to prepare for a}} South Vietnamese counter-attack. On March 13, the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 24th and 28th Regiments received two companies of armoured vehicles and one artillery battalion, which had begun raining artillery shells on Phuoc An. At 7:07am on March 14, even before the ARVN 44th and 45th Infantry Regiments began their combat operations, the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 24th Regiment opened fire and attacked the South Vietnamese, with support from the 273rd Armoured Regiment.|$|E

5|$|A second regimental-sized {{attack against}} 3 RAR at Balmoral was {{launched}} by the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> at 02:30 on 28 May, with a two-battalion assault preceded by 60mm and 80mm mortar fire from the south. Meanwhile, FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect fire from 02:45. Similar to the attack two nights before, it began with another feint from the south as the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> sappers blew up the wire in front of A Company, but was successfully broken up before it reached the wire by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small-arms fire from their M60 machine-guns, L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 assault rifles. The main assault began at 03:10 from the north-east, with the brunt again being borne by Phillips' D Company. The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine-guns, while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires, with the combined effect of this firepower stopping the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> on the wire before they could penetrate the position. Although the assault was well co-ordinated, the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> had lost the element of surprise, with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders. The assault was subsequently called off after 30 minutes, while at 03:40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated. Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light-fire teams and C-47 Spooky gunships engaged the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese,</b> directed by forward air control aircraft. From 05:00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> attempts to clear their dead and wounded, and they finally withdrew by 05:30.|$|E

5|$|At 2am on March 10, 1975, the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> army {{began their}} assault on South Vietnamese forces at Ban Me Thuot. The <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 198th Special Forces Regiment spearheaded the attack by hitting the Hoa Binh Airfield, the {{district}} of Mai Hac De, and {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment. The initial <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> attack, which was marked by heavy artillery bombardment and actions initiated by the 198th Special Forces Regiment, had shocked ARVN Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang, both subordinates of Major General Pham Van Phu. Despite the strength of the initial assault, Quang believed the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> only wanted to cause disruption and would withdraw their forces by daybreak. By 3:30am, the 4th Battalion, 198th Special Forces Regiment, had successfully secured Phan Chu Trinh Road and the southern part of Hoa Binh airport, and they waited there for the regular infantry and tank units to arrive.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Political Bureau paid {{close attention to the}} military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order to win the war. Originally the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the camp, three <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> PT-76 tanks rolled through the barbed-wire barrier in front of Company 102 and 103. From point blank, <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, an adviser to the Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun. To save it, Lindewald directed artillery strikes on the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> troops moving up towards his outpost, but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> overran the outpost. At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven other Americans, three South Vietnamese special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.|$|E

5|$|By 04:00 A Company {{was still}} heavily engaged and the Australians called in {{helicopter}} light-fire teams and C-47 Spooky gunships, which dropped flares continuously from 04:30 {{to illuminate the}} battlefield. By 05:00 the main attack was halted and the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> began withdrawing, just as the Australians were beginning to run low on ammunition. During the lull A Company was resupplied by APC, while the Australians pushed an RCL team forward to provide additional support. At 05:15 the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> attacked again, targeting the boundary between A and C Companies on {{the northern edge of}} the perimeter, only to be repulsed by mortar fire. Later a two-battalion attack on A, B and C Companies was also turned back. The Australians then counter-attacked with elements of A Company supported by APCs, regaining the lost 3 Platoon section post. Finally, after a six-hour battle the <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> broke contact at 06:30 and withdrew with their dead and wounded, fighting a series of rearguard actions to prevent follow-up. The Australians also began collecting their casualties for evacuation, while another resupply was completed with APCs. 1 RAR subsequently commenced a clearance of the area, with the four Australian rifle companies patrolling to a depth of , killing one <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> soldier and capturing another. Five Australians had been killed and 19 wounded, while two US artillerymen were also wounded during the fighting. Only 34 <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> bodies were counted on the perimeter at dawn, however intelligence later indicated that fewer than 100 of the 790 attacking troops had survived unwounded.
