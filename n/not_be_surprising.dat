25|$|Since G protein–coupled receptors {{are known}} to {{activate}} Signal transduction in cells, it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> to find MC1R involved in development. As one example at the cellular level, preventing signalling by MC1R stopped erythropoiesis from proceeding from the polychromatic cell stage (poly-E in the figure) to the orthochromatic cell stage (ortho-E in the diagram). The same report showed that neutralizing antibodies to MC1R prevented phosphorylation of STAT5 by erythropoietin, and that MC2R and MC5R were also involved, as shown in their model.|$|E
25|$|On 12 December 1961, the Iraqi {{government}} enacted Law No. 80, which expropriated 99.5 {{per cent}} of the IPC group’s concession areas without compensation and put an immediate stop on oil exploration. One major difference between these negotiations and those of 1952, was the stance of the Iraqi government. Whereas it had been more willing to accommodate the IPC in 1952, the government's positions under Qasim were largely non-negotiable. However this should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> because {{it was expected that}} Qasim would take advantage of growing Arab nationalism and a sense amongst many ordinary Iraqis that they were being exploited by the west.|$|E

25|$|Two weirs {{impede the}} flow of the river at Durham, both {{originally}} created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes a salmon leap and fish counter, monitoring sea trout and salmon, and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994, it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> that a family of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds).|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} extramarital sex has been {{examined}} {{frequently in the}} United States. Many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the United States have relied on convenience samples. A convenience sample means surveys are given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g., volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers). Convenience samples do not accurately reflect {{the population of the}} United States as a whole, which can cause serious biases in survey results. It should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising,</b> therefore, that surveys of extramarital sex in the United States have produced widely differing results. These studies report that about 12–26% of married women and 15–43% of married men engage in extramarital sex.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} {{document}} from 1503 {{referring to the}} building as both a Sala da Água (English: Water-room) and {{a place where the}} town representatives gathered to discuss and sign contracts, therefore, it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> if this supposed double-function turns out to be correct. Its construction date also becomes more clear in face of this facts, art-historian Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida noted that by its medallions, the diamond-shaped openings and the layout of windows we can date the upper level {{by the end of the}} 13th century or beginning of the 14th century, in which its already archaic Romanesque architectural style can be explained with the need of a compromise with the pre-existent cistern.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, this {{organization}} of power based upon personal relationships peculiar to the feudal system ensured that, {{after he became}} king of Scotland in 1124, {{the only thing that}} kept David from pursuing a policy of vigorous expansion was his friendship with Henry. To be sure, it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> to learn that David harboured territorial ambitions– such desires were cultivated by the prevailing culture of the Normans, the greatest warriors of the age, and applauded if they ended in conquest– nor should it be any surprise that he soon sought to express them upon Henry’s death. That he should seek to place those ambitions upon a solid basis of propriety would have been even less remarkable, had a suitable excuse to attack not been conveniently at hand.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Pan American (Pan Am) games, the players came from the AAU teams. The players for the 1955 team were drawn {{primarily}} from Hanes Hosiery Mills, Wayland College Flying Queens, the Dons, and Dowells Dolls. These four teams played each other in a tournament to help select the players for the Pan Am team. Hanes Hosiery came in first ahead of Wayland Baptist. This result would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising,</b> as these were the two dominant teams of the era. Hanes Hosiery won the AAU national championship in 1951, 1952, and 1953, beating Wayland two of those three years, and Wayland would go on to win the national championship the net four years 1954–1957. Not surprisingly, the twelve player Pan American team was dominated by these two teams, with six Wayland Baptist players and three from Hanes Hosiery. While Wayland provided the largest number of players, Hanes provided the captain, Lurlyne Greer Mealhouse, who would score over 18 points per game, more than twice the second highest scorer, and still the third highest scoring average in Pan American history. Greer was considered to be the best AAU player of her era.|$|E

The deal was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston was mixed: some fans were embittered {{at the loss of}} Ruth; others conceded that the slugger had become difficult to deal with. The New York Times suggested presciently, [...] "The short right field wall at the Polo Grounds should prove an easy target for Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising</b> if Ruth surpassed his home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer."

500|$|The press {{coverage}} surrounding the evacuation was later cited {{as an example}} of [...] "disaster pornography", in academic analyses concerned with the portrayal of child victims of violence and disaster in ways that reaffirm those victims' remoteness from and subjectivity to western (here, Northwestern European) agency. In a similar vein, Dominic Strinati has presented the press interest in Operation Irma as evidence of a popular appetite for news stories that resemble the structure and tone of fictional narratives on war: [...] "War films work most effectively... by stripping back the too easily confusing contextual details of a conflict and focusing instead on the 'existential' problem of the protagonist's experience – the problem of being human in dehumanising circumstances... News reporting – in this case from the Balkans – then has to compete even at the level of basic comprehension with this already established way of understanding things... It may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprising,</b> therefore, {{that one of the most}} memorable news 'stories' to come out of Bosnia was that of Irma, a rescued child." [...] The operation has also been portrayed as representative of a trend whereby public reaction to media coverage of disasters leads and shapes official state response, even precipitating the creation of policy where none has existed before. Erica Burman, developing this theme, has argued that Irma Hadžimuratović became an [...] "emotional focus" [...] for a British public dismayed by its government's ambiguous and cautious attitude to the conflict in Bosnia: ...|$|E

2500|$|It is not {{uncommon}} in Portugal that a married woman has two given names and six surnames, two from her mother's family, two from her father's family, and the last two coming from her husband.
