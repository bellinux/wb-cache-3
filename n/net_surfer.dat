World Wide Web {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} applications on the Internet. <b>Net</b> <b>surfers</b> can browse the Web pages by tracing the links embedded in the hypertexts. However, one will be stuck when there are no hyperlinks or the hyperlinks are broken. This paper proposes a new paradigm for Web system called WebGrid, which consists of a dynamic collection of Web servers that work cooperatively. WebGrid synchronizes the Web contents that are usually stored in the underlying database systems in order to provide a uniform view of all resources. <b>Net</b> <b>surfers</b> can retrieve all resources in the WebGrid through one local Web server. The paper addresses WebGrid architecture and some related concepts. Key issues such as the WebGrid topology, the resource synchronization mechanism and strategy, as well as the Web site customization are also discussed in the paper. ...|$|R

40|$|Word {{of mouth}} is an age old concept. Through the {{proliferation}} of online chat rooms, online review sites, and online ratings, information technology (IT) has vastly magnified {{the potential impact of}} this ancient social force. A person’s opinion no longer impacts just their friends and neighbors; through the use of the Internet, people can now share their opinions and experiences with the world. A recent Forrester study, for example, concluded that approximately 50 % of young <b>Net</b> <b>surfers</b> rely on online recommendations to purchase CDs, movies, Videos/DVDs, and games (Forrester Research, 2000). To effectively respond to this new reality, firms need to better understand the emerging relationship between online word of mouth and traditional customer conversion mechanisms, such as offline word of mouth and advertising. A number of important, and currently unanswered, research questions thus emerge: Is participation in online word of mouth a complement or a substitute to participation in traditional word of mouth? To what degree does online word of mouth represent offline word of mouth opinions? Does online word of mouth act as a complement or as a substitute to more traditional sources of information?

They {{can also be used to}} guide the design of more effective online forums. To shed some light on these questions we conducted a survey where a nationally representative sampl...|$|R

The decision-makers {{have to take}} this concern into account but they need to know the fallouts of nature for their municipalities, their citizens and the tourists. It was the purpose of our research programs, which were funded by the French region Centre-Val de Loire. How urban nature is perceived by users? What kind of nature is more appreciated? How explain the increasing interest for urban nature? What users research in green spaces? The study was conducted in six green spaces, which belong to different categories (forest and semi-natural, ornamental and allotment gardens) and are located in the six main cities of the region Centre-Val de Loire. 321 users were interviewed from a semi-supervised manner. To complete this study, 12 green spaces managers (elected representatives, heads and technicians) were questioned on the representation of nature by urban-dwellers. To put the results into perspective, we also analyzed tourists’ point of view in the Center Parcs site, which is located in the same region and can be assimilated to urban space, with its cottages, facilities and shops. Here, the study considered an innovative method, basing on 2. 118 comments posted by customers on a sharing website (TripAdvisor). The first conclusion is that nature is unanimously appreciated and sought-after, according to the accounts of green spaces users as well as <b>Net</b> <b>surfers.</b> But the green spaces managers moderate this idea. City-dwellers complain to them about nature: it has also disservices (pollen, weeds).

40|$|Nowadays, in a gym context we {{may find}} three people among ten who declare protein {{supplements}} consumption. Health, physical fitness, self esteem, performance and muscle hypertrophy are usually the main reasons inducing such kind of consumption. It well documented that particularly active individuals use supplements to build muscle, gain strength or prevent future diseases and illnesses. Furthermore, scientific researchers have shown that in general people have different opinions {{about the use of}} supplements and the appropriate food to eat. As reported by Bianco and colleagues in 2011, proteins are the most widely ingested supplements in people attending commercial gyms and supplement users also ate higher protein content foods in respect to those who did not supplement. It is clear that there is an increased interest in what is considered “proper” nutrition and what is the best nutritional strategy to optimize exercise training workouts. Dietary behaviour is in fact a complex phenomenon; food-based approaches are regarded as the long-term strategy for improving nutrition. These require significant efforts and appropriate planning in order to include certain specific macronutrients or supplements in everyday’s diet. Dieting or unhealthy eating practices, (such as eating foods deemed as “bad” by the dieter), in one way or another, may be associated with long-term weight gain. Previous studies have shown discrepant rates of supplement intake amongst subjects that exercise in gyms. These different findings might be explained by different gyms and people enrolled. Probably an under or over-reported use of such supplements, or an incorrect knowledge of what is considered a supplement may lead to such results. As mentioned before, proteins are the most widely consumed supplement in commercial gyms, although association of protein supplements and food consumption is a poorly researched field. It is to date unclear whether those more inclined to supplement also have healthier dietary patterns. As shown by Pechey and colleagues in 2010, socioeconomic status is another factor influencing the quality of food intake, highlighting that low socioeconomic status people usually purchase a greater proportion of unhealthy foods and beverages. Conversely, high socioeconomic status people purchase greater proportions of fibres, proteins and total sugars, and smaller proportions of sodium.

40|$|Wireless {{technologies}} are continuously evolving. Second generation cellular networks have gained worldwide acceptance. Wireless LANs are commonly deployed in corporations or university campuses, and their diffusion in public hotspots is growing. Third generation cellular systems {{are yet to}} affirm everywhere; still, there is an impressive amount of research ongoing for deploying beyond 3 G systems. These new wireless technologies combine the characteristics of WLAN based and cellular networks to provide increased bandwidth. The common direction where all the efforts in wireless {{technologies are}} headed is towards an IP-based communication. Telephony services have been the killer application for cellular systems; their evolution to packet-switched networks is a natural path. Effective IP telephony signaling protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the H 323 protocol are needed to establish IP-based telephony sessions. However, IP telephony is just one service example of IP-based communication. IP-based multimedia sessions are expected to become popular and offer {{a wider range of}} communication capabilities than pure telephony. In order to conjoin the advances of the future wireless technologies with the potential of IP-based multimedia communication, the next step would be to obtain ubiquitous communication capabilities. According to this vision, people must be able to communicate also when no support from an infrastructured network is available, needed or desired. In order to achieve ubiquitous communication, end devices must integrate all the capabilities necessary for IP-based distributed and decentralized communication. Such capabilities are currently missing. For example, {{it is not possible to}} utilize native IP telephony signaling protocols in a totally decentralized way. This dissertation presents a solution for deploying the SIP protocol in a decentralized fashion without support of infrastructure servers. The proposed solution is mainly designed to fit the needs of decentralized mobile environments, and can be applied to small scale ad-hoc networks or also bigger networks with hundreds of nodes. A framework allowing discovery of SIP users in ad-hoc networks and the establishment of SIP sessions among them, in a fully distributed and secure way, is described and evaluated. Security support allows ad-hoc users to authenticate the sender of a message, and to verify the integrity of a received message. The distributed session management framework has been extended in order to achieve interoperability with the Internet, and the native Internet applications. With limited extensions to the SIP protocol, we have designed and experimentally validated a SIP gateway allowing SIP signaling between ad-hoc networks with private addressing space and native SIP applications in the Internet. The design is completed by an application level relay that permits instant messaging sessions to be established in heterogeneous environments. The resulting framework constitutes a flexible and effective approach for the pervasive deployment of real time applications. The invention of the phone has radically changed the way people communicate, as it allowed persons to get in contact instantly no matter of their location. However, phone communication has been confined for decades to a fixed location, be it one's own house or a phone boot. The widespread affirmation of cellular technologies has had for fixed telephony a similar impact that the invention of the phone has had on communications years before. With mobile phones, people are enabled to talk with each other anytime and anywhere. Internet has also revolutionized the way people communicate. E-mails have soon become one of the Internet killer applications. Later on, instant messaging, popularly known as chatting, has gained huge consensus among <b>net</b> <b>surfers.</b> Only recently, the use of the Internet for voice communication is becoming mainstream, and the so called Voice over IP (VoIP) applications (Skype is probably the most famous for the masses) are becoming common use. Despite its popularity, Internet still suffers from the inherent limitations that affected early telephony: it is fixed. The usage of Internet on the move still does not constitute the easiest and most satisfactory user experience, due to capabilities and limitations of the access technology, terminals, services and applications. Efforts for mobilizing the Internet are ongoing both in the industrial and in the academic worlds, but several bricks are needed to build the wall of mobile Internet. This dissertation provides one of these bricks, describing a solution that allows the deployment of multimedia applications (chat, VoIP, gaming) in mobile environments. In other words, this dissertation gives solutions for facilitating ubiquitous Internet-based communication, anytime and anywhere. The vision that we want to become true is that Internet must become mobile in the same way as fixed telephony has become mobile thanks to the cellular technology. More than this, we do not want that users are limited by the presence of an infrastructure to communicate with each other. In order to achieve this, we present solutions to deploy Internet-based services and applications in environments where no support from servers is available. In other words, we enable direct device-to-device, user-to-user Internet communication. Our contribution is mainly focused on the steps needed to establish the communication, the so called session establishment or signaling phase. We have validated our signaling framework by building a chat application that utilizes its features and works in server-less environments. The custom server-less solution does not prohibit to connect at the same time with the Internet, so that one can engage in a chess game using direct communication with a person in the proximity while having a chat in progress with a friend using standard Internet services. The challenge that we had to face is that Internet services and applications are usually built implying support from a centralized server. In order to deploy direct user-to-user Internet services, while maintaining interoperability with mainstream services, we had to enhance native Internet services to work without infrastructure support, without sacrificing interoperability with standard Internet applications. To conclude, we have placed our brick on the still yet to be completed wall of mobile Internet. Our hope is that one day, thanks also to this brick, everybody will be able to enjoy Internet-based applications as easily as now it is possible to use mobile telephony services...|$|R
