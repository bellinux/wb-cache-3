60|$|As {{the troops}} marched {{on to the}} quay they were formed up in parties {{by the side of}} the ships which were to convey them. Very {{different}} was the demeanour of the men of the different <b>nationalities.</b> The <b>Libyans</b> were stern and silent, they were part of the contingent which their state was bound to furnish to Carthage, and went unwillingly, cursing in their hearts the power which tore them from their homes to fight in a war in which they had neither concern nor interest.|$|R
50|$|The Carthaginian {{army was}} made up of many <b>nationalities.</b> The <b>Libyans</b> {{supplied}} both heavy and light infantry and formed the most disciplined units of the army. The heavy infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasses. The light Libyan infantry carried javelins and a small shield, same as Iberian light infantry. The Iberian infantry wore purple bordered white tunics and leather headgear. The Heavy infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields and short thrusting swords. Campanian, Sicel, Sardinian and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear, but often were equipped by Carthage. Sicels and other Sicilians were equipped like Greek Hoplites.|$|R

40|$|A {{retrospective}} study conducted in North East of Libya to evaluate treatment outcome of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients and {{factors associated with}} unsuccessful outcome and treatment default has been developed. Three hundred and twenty seven patients were notified in Kuwaifia chest hospital, Benghazi and Shahat chest hospital, Shahat, during 2007 - 2008. Using the World Health Organization criteria, treatment completion and cure rate was 1. 2 % and 57. 5 %, respectively. Treatment failure occurred in 7 (2. 1 %) cases. Ninety (27. 5 %) patients defaulted treatment, 11 (3. 4 %) died and 26 (8 %) transferred out. Over all, successful and unsuccessful treatment outcome was 58. 7 % and 41. 3 %, respectively. <b>Libyan</b> <b>nationality</b> was the only predictor of successful treatment outcome while <b>Libyan</b> <b>nationality</b> and diabetes mellitus had negative association with treatment default. Improving clinical and laboratory infrastructure in peripheral areas, educating defaulters about benefits of completing therapy and stratifying foreigners as high risk groups could improve success rate. Measures {{should be taken to}} improve professional commitment and expertise of health care professionals...|$|R
50|$|Refugees of the 2011 Libyan {{civil war}} are the people, {{predominantly}} of <b>Libyan</b> <b>nationality,</b> who fled or were expelled {{from their homes}} during the 2011 Libyan civil war, from within the borders of Libya to the neighbouring states of Tunisia, Egypt and Chad, as well as to European countries, across the Mediterranean, as Boat people. The majority of Libyan refugees are Arabs and Berbers, though many of other ethnicities, temporarily living in Libya, originated from sub-Saharan Africa, were also among the first refugee waves to exit the country. The total Libyan refugee numbers are estimated at near one million as of June 2011. About half of them had returned to Libyan territory during summer 2011, though large refugee camps on Tunisian and Chad border kept being overpopulated.|$|R
