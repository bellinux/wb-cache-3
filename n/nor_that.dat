5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E

5|$|Kitsune are {{believed}} to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of yōkai, or spiritual entity, and the word kitsune is often translated as fox spirit. However, {{this does not mean}} that kitsune are ghosts, <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word spirit is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.|$|E
5|$|Yates has {{cautioned that}} P. {{gracilis}} {{may be a}} metataxon, which {{means that there is}} neither evidence that the material assigned to it is monophyletic (belongs to one species), <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> it is paraphyletic (belongs to several species). This is the case because the holotype of P.(Sellosaurus) gracilis has no skull, and the other specimens consist of skulls and material that overlaps too little with the holotype to make it certain that it belongs to the same taxon. It is therefore possible that the known material contains more species belonging to Plateosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Research has disproved {{some common}} misconceptions about the brain. These include both {{ancient and modern}} myths. It is not true that neurons are not {{replaced}} {{after the age of}} two; <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> only ten per cent of the brain is used. Popular culture has also oversimplified the lateralisation of the brain, suggesting that functions are completely specific {{to one side of the}} brain or the other. Akio Mori coined the term game brain for the unreliably supported theory that spending long periods playing video games harmed the brain's pre-frontal region and the expression of emotion and creativity.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the very}} beginning, Danes have argued about the precise place of {{photography}} in society. In 1839, Crown Prince Frederik deposited Falbe's daguerreotypes with Ørsted, {{the secretary of}} the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, despite the fact that Daguerre, the inventor, was an artist. In 1842, the artist Johan Frederik Møller was refused a grant from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts for studying photography in France {{on the grounds that it}} was not an art. Photographers came within neither the scope of the Academy of Sciences <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> of the Academy of Fine Arts but were regarded as manual workers.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between May and July 1108, Henry {{addressed}} a writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading. The royal document commanded the sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> he summon them on dates {{other than those}} normal for such courts. From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual times and then fining {{those who did not}} attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of procedure {{that could be used in}} what type of case.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} again appealed, {{this time to}} the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lord Templeman, Lord Goff, Lord Jauncey, Lord Lowry and Lord Woolf. The {{judgment}} was given by Lord Goff on 9 December 1993, and reinstated the decision of Kennedy J in the High Court of Justice; unlike the Court of Appeal decision, it directly {{addressed the issue of}} Rylands v Fletcher. Goff first addressed the Court of Appeal's use of Ballard v Tomlinson, stating that the decision there as based on the facts of the case, and did not establish either a rule that there was a right to clear water, <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> there was strict liability attached to that right.|$|E

5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn is on the left, with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E
5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training <b>nor</b> <b>that</b> the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E
