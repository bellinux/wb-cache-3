25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather <b>no</b> <b>thanks</b> to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

Amazing {{designers}} and musicians. Acid house was born. Very colourful and progressive. Now, no one's got anything to say. 'Write a song? <b>No</b> <b>thanks,</b> I'll say it on Twitter'. It's a sad state when more people retweet than buy records." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{co-operation}} between monarch and Parliament {{following the}} Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, {{it was the}} previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides {{for the rest of}} the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies. [...] "I will not thank where I feel <b>no</b> <b>thanks</b> due", he had remarked in his closing speech. [...] "...I am not of such a stock as to praise fools... You see how many things you did not well... I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come".|$|E

500|$|As Lee {{continued}} his offensive at Gaines's Mill to the east, McClellan played a passive role, taking no initiative {{and waiting for}} events to unfold. He kept two thirds of his army out of action, fooled again by Magruder's theatrical diversionary tactics. That night, he decided to withdraw his army to a safer base, well below Richmond, on {{a portion of the}} James River that was under control of the Union Navy. In doing so, he may have unwittingly saved his army. Lee had assumed that the Union army would withdraw to the east toward its existing supply base and McClellan's move to the south delayed Lee's response for at least 24 hours. But McClellan was also tacitly acknowledging that he would {{no longer be able to}} invest Richmond, the object of his campaign; the heavy siege artillery required would be almost impossible to transport without the railroad connections available from his original supply base on the York River. In a telegram to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, reporting on these events, McClellan blamed the Lincoln administration for his reversals. [...] "If I save this army now, I tell you plainly I owe <b>no</b> <b>thanks</b> to you or to any other persons in Washington. You have done your best to sacrifice this army." [...] Fortunately for McClellan, Lincoln never saw that inflammatory statement (at least at that time) because it was censored by the War Department telegrapher.|$|E

2500|$|An anecdote {{circulated}} about Gen. Taylor commanding, [...] "A {{little more}} of the grape, Capt. Bragg," [...] which caused him to redouble his efforts and save the day; the stories are probably apocryphal. Nevertheless, Bragg returned to the United States as a popular hero. A northwestern outpost, Fort Bragg, California, was named in his honor. The citizens of Warrenton presented him with a ceremonial sword. Congressman David Outlaw wrote about the honor: [...] "Col. Bragg having, <b>no</b> <b>thanks</b> to them, won for himself a brilliant reputation, is now {{the object of the}} most fulsome adulation. Those who formerly sneered at the Braggs as plebeians, as unfit associates for them, they are glad to honor. With what scorn must Col. Bragg, in his secret heart regard them." [...] Bragg traveled to New York, Washington, Mobile, and New Orleans, and in each place he was honored.|$|E
2500|$|The {{night of}} June 27, McClellan ordered his entire army to {{withdraw}} to a secure base at Harrison's Landing on the James River. His actions have puzzled military historians ever since. The Union army {{was in a}} good position, having withstood strong Confederate attacks while only deploying one of its five corps in battle. Porter had performed well against heavy odds. Furthermore, McClellan was aware that the War Department had created a new Army of Virginia and ordered it {{to be sent to}} the Peninsula to reinforce him. But Lee had unnerved him, and he surrendered the initiative. He sent a telegram to the Secretary of War that included the statement: [...] "If I save this Army now I tell you plainly that I owe <b>no</b> <b>thanks</b> to you or any other persons in Washingtonyou have done your best to sacrifice this Army." [...] (The military telegraph department chose to omit this sentence from the copy given to the Secretary.) ...|$|E

But if it's purely to satisfy the media's obsession with celebrity, then <b>no</b> <b>thanks.</b> I don't want to play that game." [...] The focus of one interview with NME in July 2005 was largely {{to do with his}} dislike of being interviewed. In it he implied that the media placed deliberate emphasis on conflicts between bands {{and did not want to}} be drawn into such publicity, saying that [...] "public feuding between bands is completely pointless." [...] Okereke has also said, [...] "people think that I hate being approached but that's not true" [...] in NME on 15 September 2005. In 2005 Okereke appeared on the front cover of Australian queer zine They Shoot Homos Don't They? ...|$|E

2500|$|Specifically, {{it was the}} Burmese commanders' {{ability to}} lead a {{multi-ethnic}} army which consisted of regiments from {{various parts of the}} empire that made the invasion even possible. (Upper Burma, the home of Konbaung Dynasty, alone could not have launched an offensive war against a more populous Siam, without its policy of having the conquered lands contribute to its next war effort.) In this war, the Burmese command was able to inspire (or push) their troops. Historian Harvey writes: [...] "When roused, the men fought with spirit, vying among themselves as to who should first mount the wall; although he wonders why: [...] "They died like flies from preventable disease, and suffered ghastly wounds for which they received <b>no</b> <b>thanks</b> from the King, as the loss of a limb, even in honourable service, disqualified a man from entering the palace: His Majesty's sight must not be sullied by reality." [...] Equally important, the Burmese commanders were able to motivate their Siamese levies, which by the battle of Ayutthaya made up a significant minority of the Burmese army. The Siamese participation in the Burmese army highlights the fact that the war was between the rulers, not between nations.|$|E
