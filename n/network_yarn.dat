40|$|Indigenous {{culture and}} {{challenges}} {{were brought to}} the forefront of students’ minds when a guest speaker visited The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Sydney Campus. Mr Warren Roberts, Indigenous Officer for the Student Representative Council at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), came to talk to the students on the Darlinghurst site about his program, the Youth Awareness Raising <b>Network</b> (<b>YARN)</b> group. Mr Roberts said he started the group at UNSW bring the different cultures together. “The aim of YARN is for students to get together and raise awareness of indigenous matters - encouraging them to think and ask questions about Aboriginal culture. ” He spoke to students about the possibility of launching the project at Notre Dame where they would liaise with him on gaining information and organising guest speakers for the campus. Manager of the Student Life Office, Ms Bronwen Jones, said this is a great opportunity for Notre Dame students to get involved with the Aboriginal community. “We were very privileged to hear Mr Roberts speak about the YARN program and it will be very exciting if the students get it off the ground here. ” Media contact: Moira Saunders 02 8204 440...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} value {{electronic}} governance initiatives which {{take the form}} of an online community. Theory relevant to community informatics and online communities is reviewed. The case study for the Young Australian Rural <b>Network</b> (<b>YARN)</b> is then presented to draw out some of the benefits, challenges and learning that can be experienced in operationalising online initiatives. YARN (www. yarn. gov. au) is an initiative of the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry – Australia (AFFA). It is an interactive online community for young people working in rural industries. It provides a ‘vehicle ’ for young people to communicate directly with AFFA and {{to keep in touch with}} each other, collaborate, share ideas and strengthen networks. The establishment of YARN was supported by research undertaken during 2001 which confirmed that the Internet represented a powerful communication channel for reaching young people. In June 2002 AFFA recruited a person with the primary responsibility of overseeing the establishment and ongoing development of an online community where ‘ownership ’ would be shared between AFFA and young people in rural industries. AFFA clearly understood that functionality could be created but that an online community would not exist unless its members were actively involved and interacting with each other. Through YARN the Federal Government has established a practical mechanism for achieving many of the promises of electronic governance...|$|E
40|$|An Elman {{network model}} was trained using Fletcher-Reeves Update {{training}} algorithm, {{and used to}} predict the tensile strength of cotton yarns. The cotton yarn samples (consisting of rotor and ring spun yarns) were collected from four textile factories in Kenya. The inputs of the network were the HVI characteristics of the cotton lint used to spin the yarns together with the fineness (Tex) and Twist per Inch (TPI) of the yarn samples. The output of the <b>network</b> was <b>yarn</b> tensile strength. The Elman <b>network</b> predicted the <b>yarn</b> tensile strength with a mean squared error (mse) of 0. 0156 and a correlation coefficient between the network outputs and the targeted values (R-value) of 0. 974...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new {{theoretical}} model for predicting the electro-mechanical properties of knitting sensor is presented, which {{is focused on}} the relationship between the equivalent resistance and length resistance variation of loop segments under strip biaxial elongation. A resistance <b>network</b> based on <b>yarn</b> length resistance reveals how equivalent resistance to change with the increment of its numbers of course and wale. Besides, analytical equations are derived to calculate length of loop segments under relaxed state and strip biaxial elongation, respectively. It {{is the first time that}} the equivalent resistance calculating theory of knitting sensor under strip biaxial elongation has been established. By comparing the calculated results with the experiment data, it is found that fabric deformation related to the length resistance is the key factor affecting the equivalent resistance of knitting sensor...|$|R
40|$|Textiles {{provide an}} ideal {{structure}} for embedding sensors for medical devices. Skin temperature measurement {{is one area}} in which a sensor textile could be particularly beneficial; pathological skin is normally very sensitive, making the comfort of anything placed on that skin paramount. Skin temperature is an important parameter to measure {{for a number of}} medical applications, including for the early detection of diabetic foot ulcer formation. To this end an electronic temperature-sensor yarn was developed by embedding a commercially available thermistor chip into the fibres of a yarn, which can be used to produce a textile or a garment. As part of this process a resin was used to encapsulate the thermistor. This protects the thermistor from mechanical and chemical stresses, and also allows the sensing yarn to be washed. Building off preliminary work, the behaviour and performance of an encapsulated thermistor has been characterised to determine the effect of encapsulation on the step response time and absolute temperature measurements. Over the temperature range of interest only a minimal effect was observed, with step response times varying between 0. 01 – 0. 35 s. A general solution is presented for the heat transfer coefficient compared to size of the micro-pod formed by the encapsulation of the thermistor. Finally, a prototype temperature-sensing sock was produced using a <b>network</b> of sensing <b>yarns</b> as a demonstrator of a system that could warn of impending ulcer formation in diabetic patients...|$|R
40|$|Continuous nanofibers (NFs) {{are among}} the most {{promising}} types of advanced nanomaterials due to their unique mechanical and functional properties, extreme surface to mass ratio, and ultrahigh strength/toughness coupled with extreme flexibility. Continuous nanofiber <b>networks</b> (NFNs) and <b>yarns</b> are being developed for applications in advanced composites, filtration, tissue engineering, electronic and optical devices, and other fields. Mechanical behavior of NFNs is complex and not yet sufficiently understood, despite its critical importance for most applications. Existing models of NFNs often lack consideration of structural details, complex contact conditions, and non-linear mechanical properties of NFs. The objective of this dissertation was to perform comprehensive analysis of mechanical behavior of NFNs and yarns based on novel numerical models with explicit nanofiber and contact representation. ^ Three-dimensional geometric models of NFNs were generated by mimicking nanomanufacturing process resulting in networks with random or preferred nanofiber orientation. NFs were represented as beams with non-linear elastic-plastic properties obtained from experiments. Different contact conditions such as friction and bonding between nanofibers were realized. The developed models were used to simulate large deformations of NFNs under various loadings through failure. Mechanisms of non-linear deformation and failure, such as nanofiber plastic deformation, nanofiber reorientation under loading, and nanofiber and contact breaks accumulation were extracted and analyzed. A comprehensive analysis of the effects of input parameters on NFNs stiffness, strength and toughness was performed. Variations of nanofiber diameter, density, orientation distribution, and nanofiber contact strength and friction were simulated and analyzed {{for the first time and}} the relative importance of these network parameters was evaluated and compared. Effects of nanofiber diameter, mechanical properties, contact friction, and the pitch angle in nanofiber yarns were also studied. Significant enhancement of yarn properties over individual NF properties was predicted and the mechanisms of such enhancement were explained. ^ The results provide better understanding of the mechanics of NFNs and yarns and can be used for design and optimization of novel nanofilamentary materials for applications. ...|$|R
