25|$|For foreign train-makers, {{technology}} transfer {{is an important}} part of gaining market access in China. Bombardier, the first foreign train-maker to form a joint venture in China, has been sharing technology for the manufacture of railway passenger cars and rolling stock since 1998. Zhang Jianwei, President and Chief Country Representative of Bombardier China, stated that in a 2009 interview, “Whatever technology Bombardier has, whatever the China market needs, there is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> Bombardier transfers advanced and mature technology to China, which we do not treat as an experimental market.” Unlike other series which have imported prototypes, all CRH1 trains have been assembled at Bombardier’s joint-venture with CSR, Bombardier Sifang in Qingdao.|$|E
25|$|Result: Kinetic {{immediately}} left Tussauds, but initially {{suffered a}} lack of organization, with Haya not setting a specific list of who should buy what, which nearly resulted in the team buying two three-piece suits for Tussauds' Justin Bieber waxwork. However, the team generally negotiated well, with James in particular being a stand-out. One item which caused the team trouble was a Dashiki, which they spent the day fruitlessly searching for, with Harry H. being mistakenly told it was an Arabic garment instead of an African one. Despite being initially more organized, Atomic's sub-team, Zara and Hayley, wasted time travelling to and from Croydon {{in order to obtain}} a pocketwatch which they paid wildly over the odds for, under the mistaken belief that they were required to purchase one made of gold. On top of that, Harry M. led the team on a wild chase to buy the suit, continually asking adult tailors even after repeatedly being told that they would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a children's tailor for a suit in Bieber's dimensions. Lizzie also made a serious mistake by deciding not to negotiate any discount on a set of shoes {{near the end of the}} day, resulting in a massive fine, with Lord Sugar noting that they would have actually received less of a fine by just not buying the shoes. Kinetic spent £969.10, while Atomic spent £1,480.87.|$|E

"You do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{permission}} from anyone to be a journalist," [...] explains the Periodical Publishers Association; [...] "however, {{it is sometimes}} useful {{to be able to}} identify yourself as a journalist when needed." [...] To this end, journalistic agencies issue press cards to their reporters, editorialists, writers, and photographers. [...] These do not have the legal merits of government-issued cards, and they will not replace event-specific passes; the card only serves as proof of its bearer's status as a legitimate newsperson according to the issuing organization. [...] As such, card-carriers may be better able to obtain interviews, acquire information from law-enforcement, or gain access to exclusive venues.|$|E

[...] Over one year the case had been transferred to three separate prosecutors, earning it [...] "vagabond status" [...] in the U.S. Attorneys' office. On the one-year anniversary of Wone's death, Katherine Wone held a press conference to appeal for public assistance in finding the killer, her first public comment on the case. During the press conference, Holder publicly pleaded with the three residents to provide additional information, saying [...] "You <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> yourself, 'Have I provided police with all the information I know?'" [...] Interested parties, such as the OCA, used the first anniversary of Wone's death to criticize what they deemed police inaction in the investigation. In contrast to the first anniversary of Wone's murder, there was no press conference on the second anniversary, and neither the Wone family nor police made any statements to the press.|$|E
500|$|The doctors alerted Brent {{police and}} social services, {{and she was}} placed under police {{protection}}, with a 72-hour protection order preventing her from leaving hospital. Kouao told the doctors that she had scabies, and that the injuries were self-inflicted. Many doctors and nurses suspected that the injuries were non-accidental. However, Ruby Schwartz, the consultant paediatrician and named child protection doctor at the hospital, diagnosed scabies and {{decided that it was}} scratching that caused the injuries. She made the diagnosis without speaking to Climbié alone. Schwartz later admitted that she made a mistake. Another doctor, one of Schwartz' juniors, misleadingly wrote to social services saying there was no child protection issue. When Michelle Hine, a child protection officer at Brent council, received a report notifying her of Climbié's injuries, she planned to open an investigation into the case. However, the next day she heard of Schwartz' diagnosis and downgraded Climbié's level of care, trusting Schwartz' judgement. She later expressed regret over her actions. Schwartz said in the inquiry that she expected social services to follow up the case. Neil Garnham QC, counsel to the inquiry following Climbié's death, later said to her, [...] "there is a terrible danger here—is there not, doctor—of social services {{on the one hand and}} you on the other each expecting the other to do the investigation, with the result that nobody does". The police officer allocated to Climbié's case for the Brent Child Protection team, Rachel Dewar, decided to lift the police protection, allowing Climbié to return home, when told by a social worker that she had scabies. Under the Children Act 1989, Dewar was obliged to see Climbié and tell her she was under police protection, but she did not do this. She also failed to see Kouao or Manning. At the time of the decision, Dewar was attending a seminar on child protection. Garnham later said, [...] "we will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why it was thought more important for her to attend a seminar to learn how to deal with child protection cases than deal with the real child protection case for which she was responsible at the time". Kouao took Climbié home on 15 July 1999.|$|E

Questioner wants to find a plurality ball as soon as possible or state there is no, by asking triplets (or k-sets, in general), while Adversary partition the triplets into color classes as an answer for the queries and wants to postpone the possibility of determining a plurality ball (or stating there is no).
