Time-resolved terahertz photoconductivity measurements using a tunable mid-infrared pump probed these samples at photon energies between 0. 35 eV to 1. 55 eV, approximately one half to three times the Fermi energy of the samples. Although interband optical transitions in graphene are blocked for pump photon energies less than twice the Fermi energy, we observe <b>negative</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> at all pump photon energies investigated, indicating that interband excitation is not required to observe this effect.

The monochromator excitation in the photon energy range 0. 65 - 1. 77 eV was complemented by a laser diode high-intensity excitation at selected photon energies. A single sample characterized by multiple unusual features like <b>negative</b> differential <b>photoconductivity</b> and anomalous depression of electron mobility was chosen for the detailed study involving measurements at both the steady and dynamic regimes. We revealed that the Hall mobility and photoconductivity can be both enhanced and suppressed by an additional illumination at certain photon energies. The anomalous mobility decrease was explained by an excitation of the inhomogeneously distributed deep level at the energy Ev+ 1. 0 eV enhancing thus potential non-uniformities. The appearance of <b>negative</b> differential <b>photoconductivity</b> was interpreted by an intensified electron occupancy of that level by a direct valence band-to-level excitation. Modified Shockley-Read-Hall theory was used for fitting experimental results by a model comprising five deep levels.

40|$|A simple {{kinetic model}} {{concerning}} photocurrent in epitaxially grown GaN is presented. Utilizing a minimal set of rate equations and kinetic parameters, it is shown {{that in the}} presence of hole centers with small probabilities of electron-hole recombinations, the time dependence of photocurrent is ruled by competition between capture of conduction band electrons by deep electron traps and electron-hole recombinations. If the probability of electron capture exceeds that of recombination, the decay of current after excitation is turned off shows the usual persistent photocurrent trend. If, on the contrary, the probability of recombination is larger than that of electron capture, a slow photocurrent quenching, past a maximum, can be observed.

30|$|The tendencies {{observed}} {{in this research}} {{can be explained by}} taking into account possible influence of the traps. The results reported in [49] should be mentioned as well. <b>Negative</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> was also observed for InAs nanowires [49]. Origin of the <b>negative</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> was attributed to the depletion of conduction channels by light-assisted hot-electron trapping [49]. Photoconductivity lowering was excitation wavelength dependent. Photocurrent decreased more when excitation wavelength was shorter (higher photon energy) [49]. In our case, we can suppose that at high excitation energies trapping of the hot charge carriers in DLC matrix or at the Ag nanoparticle/DLC interface takes place. Thus, photoexcitation of the plasmonic charge carriers competes with the trapping process. It results in suppression of the bleaching in DLC:Ag transient spectra excited by higher energy photons as well as decreased photocurrent and photovoltage. Energy of the hot charge carriers excited by longer wavelength photons is below trap-related states. In such a case, photoexcited plasmonic charge carriers avoid trapping. It results in the increased sample’s photocurrent and photovoltage at higher excitation wavelengths. This fact correlates with the TAS measurements when in TAS spectra of DLC:Ag films excited at higher wavelengths of 627 and 736  nm strong negative signal was observed, too.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{generation}} of photo-induced electromotive force (EMF) {{on the surface of}} c-axis oriented InN epitaxial films grown on sapphire substrates. It has been found that under the illumination of above band gap light, EMFs of different magnitudes and polarities are developed on different parts of the surface of these layers. The effect {{is not the same as}} the surface photovoltaic or Dember potential effects, both of which result in the development of EMF across the layer thickness, not between different contacts on the surface. These layers are also found to show <b>negative</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> effect. Interplay between surface photo-EMF and <b>negative</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> result in a unique scenario, where the magnitude as well as the sign of the photo-induced change in conductivity become bias dependent. A theoretical model is developed, where both the effects are attributed to the 2 D electron gas (2 DEG) channel formed just below the film surface as a result of the transfer of electrons from certain donor-like-surfacestates, which are likely to be resulting due to the adsorption of certain groups/adatoms on the film surface. In the model, the photo-EMF effect is explained in terms of a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of these groups/adatoms over the surface resulting in a lateral non-uniformity in the depth distribution of the potential profile confining the 2 DEG.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the low 2 ̆ 010 {{temperature}} coplanar photoconductivity under pulsed and continuous illumination of n 2 ̆ 010 InSb/GaAs heterostructures grown by metalorganic magnetron sputtering. The large lattice mismatch and the large difference in band gaps give rise respectively to a highly defective region at the interface and a high built 2 ̆ 010 in field. The effect of these factors on the photoconductivity is then {{a function of the}} InSb film thickness. For photon energies above the InSb band gap, up to about 0. 4 eV, we observe positive photoconductivity due to an increase in the electron density coupled with trapping of the excess minority carriers. As the film thickness is decreased from 2 to 0. 2 3 ̆bcm, the photoconductivity gain per absorbed photon decreases and the decay time increases, indicating the presence of trapping or recombination centers near the interface. Illumination with photons of energy greater than 0. 4 eV leads to the coexistence of a positive photoconductivity and a very slow transient <b>negative</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> which gives rise to high gains at low modulation frequencies. The <b>negative</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> increases with increasing photon energy and decreasing film thickness.
