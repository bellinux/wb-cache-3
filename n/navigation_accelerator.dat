40|$|As CMOS {{technology}} has developed considerably {{in the last}} few decades, many SoCs have been implemented across different application areas due to reduced area and power consumption. Digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms are frequently employed in these systems to achieve more accurate operation or faster computation. However, CMOS technology scaling started to slow down recently and relatively large systems consume too much power to rely only on the scaling effect while system power budget such as battery capacity improves slowly. In addition, there exist increasing needs for miniaturized computing systems including sensor nodes that can accomplish similar operations with significantly smaller power budget. Voltage scaling {{is one of the most}} promising power saving techniques due to quadratic switching power reduction effect, making it necessary feature for even high-end processors. However, in order to achieve maximum possible energy efficiency, systems should operate in near or sub-threshold regimes where leakage takes significant portion of power. In this dissertation, a few key energy-aware design approaches are described. Considering prominent leakage and larger PVT variability in low operating voltages, multi-level energy saving techniques to be described are applied to key building blocks in DSP applications: architecture study, algorithm-architecture co-optimization, and robust yet low-power memory design. Finally, described approaches are applied to design examples including a visual <b>navigation</b> <b>accelerator,</b> ultra-low power biomedical SoC and face detection/recognition processor, resulting in 2 ~ 100 times power savings than state-of-the-art...|$|E
40|$|As {{the number}} of online {{shopping}} increases, the demand of building user-friendly websites for customers is vital for companies. In this thesis project the author intended to figure out some solutions regarding problems of popular B 2 C online shopping websites. Choosing the website of Vancl as the main object to research on the e-business websites {{in the field of}} interaction design. Good user interfaces of online shopping provide multiple choosing methods, such as in the form of search engine, <b>navigation,</b> keyboard <b>accelerators,</b> and direct manipulation controls, each with the parallel capability to look for and buy the items. This enables users of different skill sets and attitudes to command the system according to their abilities, inclinations and backgrounds. More consideration should be focus on novice users especially the help function should be really helpful when the users need it. Visibility is a general user interface design principle which should be related to usersâ€™ daily life which means it is better to bear similarity to interactions with the objects in the physical world. For the new users the direct manipulation controls are easy to learn and use so the visual manipulation and visual feedback of the website is crucial to success for the online shopping websites. In the market of B 2 C the brand value should be stand out for sustainable development. Whatever functional updating or non-functional updating all the solutions are up to meet the requirements from different users. The less distance from the mental model of users the more satisfaction will be achieved in the products...|$|R
