40|$|AbstractThe {{bending stress}} in the root fillets of gear teeth having convex, circular-arc {{profiles}} has been calculated using a new analytic model for variable surface pressure distribution. The gear tooth is modeled as a wedge with the load applied at the apex.

5000|$|Although gears can be {{made with}} any pitch, for {{convenience}} and interchangeability standard pitches are frequently used. Pitch is a property associated with linear dimensions and so differs whether the standard values are in the Imperial (inch) or Metric systems. Using inch measurements, standard <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch</b> values with units of [...] "per inch" [...] are chosen; the <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch</b> is the number of teeth on a gear of one inch pitch diameter. Common standard values for spur gears are 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 72, 80, 96, 100, 120, and 200.

40|$|Design {{guidelines}} {{have been}} established to prevent catastrophic rim fracture failure modes when considering gear tooth bending fatigue. Analysis was performed using the finite element method with principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Crack propagation paths were predicted {{for a variety of}} gear tooth and rim configurations. The effects of rim and web thicknesses, initial crack locations, and gear tooth geometry factors such as <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch,</b> number of teeth, pitch radius, and tooth pressure angle were considered. Design maps of tooth/rim fracture modes including effects of gear geometry, applied load, crack size, and material properties were developed. The occurrence of rim fractures significantly increased as the backup ratio (rim thickness divided by tooth height) decreased. The occurrence of rim fractures also increased as the initial crack location was moved down the root of the tooth. Increased rim and web compliance increased the occurrence of rim fractures. For gears with constant pitch radii, coarser-pitch teeth increased the occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures. Also, 25 deg pressure angle teeth had an increased occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures when compared to 20 deg pressure angle teeth. For gears with constant number of teeth or gears with constant <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch,</b> varying size had little or no effect on crack propagation paths...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{standard}} gear mesh is treated {{with the objective of}} minimizing the gear size for a given ratio, pinion torque, and allowable tooth strength. Scoring, pitting fatigue, bending fatigue, and the kinematic limits of contact ratio and interference are considered. A design space is defined {{in terms of the number}} of teeth on the pinion and the <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch.</b> This space is then combined with the objective function of minimum center distance to obtain an optimal design region. This region defines the number of pinion teeth for the most compact design. The number is a function of the gear ratio only. A design example illustrating this procedure is also given...|$|R
40|$|A {{development}} program {{to establish the}} feasibility and applicability of high energy rate forging procedures to tool steel spur gears was performed. Included {{in the study were}} relatively standard forging procedures as well as a thermo-mechanical process termed ausforming. The subject gear configuration utilized was essentially a standard spur gear having 28 teeth, a pitch diameter of 3. 5 inches and a <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch</b> of 8. Initially it had been planned to use a high contact ratio gear design, however, a comprehensive evaluation indicated that severe forging problems would be encountered {{as a result of the}} extremely small teeth required by this type of design. The forging studies were successful in achieving gear blanks having integrally formed teeth using both standard and thermo-mechanical forging procedures...|$|R
50|$|Standard profile angles are {{established}} {{in connection with}} standard proportions of gear teeth and standard gear cutting tools. Involute gears operate together correctly after a change of center distance, and gears designed for a different center distance can be generated correctly by standard tools. A change of center distance is accomplished by changes in operating values for pitch diameter, circular <b>pitch,</b> <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch,</b> pressure angle, and tooth thicknesses or backlash. The same involute gear may be used under conditions that change its operating pitch diameter and pressure angle. Unless {{there is a good}} reason for doing otherwise, it is practical to consider that the pitch and the profile angle of a single gear correspond to the pitch and the profile angle of the hob or cutter used to generate its teeth.|$|R
40|$|SPUROPT, a {{computer}} program developed for optimizing spur gear designs, was updated by installing a new subroutine that uses AGMA 908 -B 89 standards to calculate the J-factor for determining tooth-bending stress. The updated SPUROPT program was then used to optimize a spur gear set for either maximum fatigue life, minimum dynamic load, or minimum weight. All calculations were made with constraints on as many as 13 parameters by using three design variables: the number of teeth, <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch,</b> and tooth-face width. Results depended largelv on c,) 'wtra-nt values. When the timiting bending stress was set at a high value, the optimal solution was the highest allowable number of teeth. When the allowable bending stress was lowered, the optimal solution moved toward the fewest number of teeth permitted. Final results were also affected {{by the amount of}} transmission error. A lower error permitted a higher num-ber of teeth...|$|R
50|$|When gear {{dimensions}} {{are in the}} metric system the pitch specification is generally in terms of module or modulus, which is effectively a length measurement across the pitch diameter. The term module is understood to mean the pitch diameter in millimeters divided {{by the number of}} teeth. When the module is based upon inch measurements, it is known as the English module to avoid confusion with the metric module. Module is a direct dimension, unlike <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch,</b> which is an inverse dimension ("threads per inch"). Thus, if the pitch diameter of a gear is 40 mm and the number of teeth 20, the module is 2, which means that there are 2 mm of pitch diameter for each tooth. The preferred standard module values are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40 and 50.|$|R
40|$|Effective gear designs balance strength, durability, reliability, size, weight, and cost. However, {{unexpected}} gear failures {{may occur}} even with adequate gear tooth design. To design an extremely safe system, the designer must ask {{and address the}} question "What happens when a failure occurs?" With regard to gear-tooth bending fatigue, tooth or rim fractures may occur. For aircraft, a crack that propagated through a rim would be catastrophic, leading to the disengagement of a rotor or propeller, the loss of an aircraft, and possible fatalities. This failure mode should be avoided. However, a crack that propagated through a tooth {{might or might not}} be catastrophic, depending on the design and operating conditions. Also, early warning of this failure mode might be possible because of advances in modern diagnostic systems. An analysis was performed at the NASA Glenn Research Center to develop design guidelines to prevent catastrophic rim fracture failure modes in the event of gear-tooth bending fatigue. The finite element method was used with principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Crack propagation paths were predicted for a variety of gear tooth and rim configurations. The effects of rim and web thicknesses, initial crack locations, and gear-tooth geometry factors such as <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch,</b> number of teeth, pitch radius, and tooth pressure angle were considered. Design maps of tooth and rim fracture modes, including the effects of gear geometry, applied load, crack size, and material properties were developed. The occurrence of rim fractures significantly increased as the backup ratio (rim thickness divided by tooth height) decreased. The occurrence of rim fractures also increased as the initial crack location was moved down the root of the tooth. Increased rim and web compliance increased the occurrence of rim fractures. For gears with constant-pitch radii, coarser-pitch teeth increased the occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures. Also, 25 degree pressure angle teeth increased the occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures in comparison to 20 pressure angle teeth. For gears with a constant number of teeth or for gears with constant <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch,</b> varying size had little or no effect on crack propagation paths...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study has been}} completed to determine the feasibility of using high-pressure angle gears in aeronautic and space applications. Tests were conducted in the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) Spur Gear Test Facility at speeds up to 10, 000 rpm and 73 N*m (648 in. *lb) for 3. 18, 2. 12, and 1. 59 module gears (8, 12, and 16 <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch</b> gears), all designed {{to operate in the}} same test facility. The 3. 18 module (8 -diametral pitch), 28 tooth, 20 deg pressure angle gears are the GRC baseline test specimen. Also, 2. 12 module (12 -diametral pitch), 42 tooth, 25 deg pressure angle gears were tested. Finally 1. 59 module (16 -diametral pitch), 56 tooth, 35 deg pressure angle gears were tested. The high-pressure angle gears were the most efficient when operated in the high-speed aerospace mode (10, 000 rpm, lubricated with a synthetic turbine engine oil), and produced the lowest wear rates when tested with a perfluoroether-based grease. The grease tests were conducted at 150 rpm and 71 N*m (630 in. *lb) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} simulation is presented which {{shows how the}} gear contact ratio affects the dynamic load on a spur gear transmission. The contact ratio can {{be affected by the}} tooth addendum, the pressure angle, the tooth size (<b>diametral</b> <b>pitch),</b> and the center distance. The analysis presented was performed using the NASA gear dynamics code, DANST. In the analysis, the contact ratio was varied over the range 1. 20 to 2. 40 by changing the length of the tooth addendum. In order to simplify the analysis, other parameters related to contact ratio were held constant. The contact ratio was found to have a significant influence on gear dynamics. Over a wide range of operating speeds, a contact ratio close to 2. 0 minimized dynamic load. For low contact ratio gears (contact ratio less than 2. 0), increasing the contact ratio reduced the gear dynamic load. For high contact ratio gears (contact ratio = or greater than 2. 0), the selection of contact ratio should take into consideration the intended operating speeds. In general, high contact ratio gears minimized dynamic load better than low contact ratio gears...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of formal}} {{numerical}} optimization methods {{for the design}} of gears is investigated. To achieve this, computer codes were developed for the analysis of spur gears and spiral bevel gears. These codes calculate the life, dynamic load, bending strength, surface durability, gear weight and size, and various geometric parameters. It is necessary to calculate all such important responses because they all represent competing requirements in the design process. The codes developed here were written in subroutine form and coupled to the COPES/ADS general purpose optimization program. This code allows the user to define the optimization problem at the time of program execution. Typical design variables include face width, number of teeth and <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch.</b> The user is free to choose any calculated response as the design objective to minimize or maximize and may impose lower and upper bounds on any calculated responses. Typical examples include life maximization with limits on dynamic load, stress, weight, etc. or minimization of weight subject to limits on life, dynamic load, etc. The research codes were written in modular form for easy expansion and so that they could be combined to create a multiple reduction optimization capability in future...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Thesis is to design a simple system for cutting {{rudimentary}} Spur Gears on a Laser Cutter, using only a few basic parameters of the gears. The Laser Cutter could quickly and accurately cut {{the outline of a}} gear from wood or plastic; the low durability of the material would not matter, as long as the gear is being used for a mockup or simple test. But, the gears would still need to mesh correctly, and the Laser Cutter would {{need to be able to}} cut many complimentary sets of gears for the prototype of a typical design project. To this end, we created an Excel spreadsheet which, when given the Number of Teeth, Pressure Angle, and <b>Diametral</b> <b>Pitch</b> of the desired gear, produces a suitable business graphic of that gear. That graphic can then be printed to a plot file which the Laser Cutter can use to cut out the gear. The process involved several complications, both to model the spur gears parametrically as a spreadsheet graphic and to convert the graphic into laser cutter instructions of the appropriate scale and resolution. Once resolved, however, the process provides a convenient an...|$|R
40|$|A design {{procedure}} for sizing standard involute spur gearsets is presented. The procedure {{is applied to}} find the optimal design for two examples - an external gear mesh with a ratio of 5 : 1 and an internal gear mesh with a ratio of 5 : 1. In the procedure, the gear mesh is designed to minimize the center distance for a given gear ratio, pressure angle, pinion torque, and allowable tooth strengths. From the methodology presented, a design space may be formulated for either external gear contact or for internal contact. The design space includes kinematics considerations of involute interference, tip fouling, and contact ratio. Also included are design constraints based on bending fatigue in the pinion fillet and Hertzian contact pressure in the full load region and at the gear tip where scoring is possible. This design space is two dimensional, giving the gear mesh center distance {{as a function of}} <b>diametral</b> <b>pitch</b> and the number of pinion teeth. The constraint equations were identified for kinematic interference, fillet bending fatigue, pitting fatigue, and scoring pressure, which define the optimal design space for a given gear design. The locus of equal size optimum designs was identified as the straight line through the origin which has the least slope in the design region...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{study on the}} effect of hob offset on the dynamic tooth strength of spur gears. The study was limited to equal and opposite offset val-ues applied to the pinion and gear to maintain the stan-dard operating center distance. The analysis presented in this paper was performed using {{a new version of the}} NASA gear dynamics code DANST. The operating speed of the transmission has a signifi-cant influence on the amount of hob offset required to equalize the dynamic stresses in the pinion and gear. In the transmission studied, at low speeds, the optimum hob offset value was found to fluctuate. At higher speeds, the optimum value was constrained by the minimum allowed thickness at the tip of the pinion tooth. For gears that must operate over a range of speeds, an average offset value may be used. Spur gears designed with the proce-dure presented here can have significant improvements in load capacity.

The operating speed of the transmission influences the amount of hob offset required to equalize the dynamic stresses in the pinion and gear. The optimum hob offset for the pinion was found to vary within a small range as the speed changes. The optimum value is generally greater than the optimum value found by static procedures.
