50|$|Formica exsecta (the <b>narrow-headed</b> <b>ant</b> or excised wood ant) is {{a species}} of ant found from Western Europe to Asia.|$|E
50|$|The Lizard {{contains}} {{some of the}} most specialised flora of any area in Britain, including many Red Data Book plant species. Of particular note is the Cornish heath, Erica vagans, that occurs in abundance here, but which is found nowhere else in Britain. It {{is also one of the}} few places where the rare formicine ant, Formica exsecta, (the <b>narrow-headed</b> <b>ant),</b> can be found.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} home to a {{sizeable}} population of amphibians and reptiles, as well as a host of beetles, butterflies and other insects. A common sight are great anthills, the nests of wood ants, of which there are several species in the region. The Wasgau and the area of the Hermersberger Hof are two of the few places in Germany where colonies of <b>narrow-headed</b> <b>ant</b> have survived. And the highly endangered great and spotted antlions may often be seen in the sands of the bunter sandstone (Rehberg beds). Their larvae build funnel traps in the sand and feed on ants and other animals that fall into it using their pincer-like mandibles.|$|E
50|$|F. exsecta is a eusocial species, {{displaying}} a dominance hierarchy among its individual colony members. Amongst the <b>narrow-headed</b> <b>ant</b> species, {{the two different}} types of colony structure are: monogyny, one queen per colony, and polygyny, more than one queen per colony. Most commonly, one of these two different types is prevalent within a population. These two types of colonies differ not only in the queen’s mating system, but also in the organization of types of offspring and its hierarchy system. For a polygynous colony to thrive, it must adjust its sex allocation practices contingent on the abundance of resources. Colonies produce a greater percentage of male offspring when restraint on resource availability exists, as well as when the colony has a larger number of queens. The opposite scenario is also found to be true. More female offspring are produced when an abundance of resources exists, as well as when the colony has a smaller number of queens. On average, a colony’s sex ratio is estimated to be 5.8% female, or one female for every 17.2 male offspring. This heavily male offspring-based sex ratio displays an obvious deviation from Fisher’s theory of 1:1 sex ratio.|$|E
50|$|The Lizard {{contains}} {{some of the}} most specialised flora of any area in Britain, including many Red Data Book plant species. Of particular note is the Cornish heath, Erica vagans, that occurs in abundance here, but which is found nowhere else in Britain. There are more than 600 species of flowering plants on the Lizard, nearly a quarter of all UK species. The reason for this richness is partly because of the many different and unusual Lizard rocks on the Lizard Peninsula. But above all, it is a coming together of multiple factors: a very mild maritime climate, but one prone to gales and salt winds; waterlogged and boggy soils, but ones that often parch and dry out in the summer; soils of greatly contrasting fertility and pH; and lastly man's influence. Any single factor taken on its own would influence the flora; taken together, they combine, overlap and interact. Contrasting plant communities grow side-by-side in a mosaic that changes within a few metres but also changes markedly over time with the cycle of heath fires. It's not so much that conditions are ideal for growth, but {{that there is such a}} variety of different, difficult conditions. Each habitat, with its own combination of factors, attracts its own specialist plants. It is also one of the few places where the rare formicine ant, Formica exsecta, (the <b>narrow-headed</b> <b>ant),</b> can be found.|$|E
