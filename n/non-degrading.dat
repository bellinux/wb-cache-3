In the present study we asked whether <b>non-degraded</b> distractors may facilitate responses to degraded targets (corners or line segments missing). We presented targets at fixation and accompanied by identical, category-congruent, or category-incongruent distractors. Participants responded to two object categories (musical instruments and tools) consisting of four line drawings. Corners-missing targets in particular were associated with greater interference from distractors than <b>non-degraded</b> targets. This interference was modulated when distractor locations were endogenously or exogenously cued.

50|$|Dynamic {{generators}} {{can provide}} power {{at more than}} 4 times the conversion efficiency of RTGs. NASA and DOE have been developing a next-generation radioisotope-fueled power source called the Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG) that uses free-piston Stirling engines coupled to linear alternators to convert heat to electricity. SRG prototypes demonstrated an average efficiency of 23%. Greater efficiency {{can be achieved by}} increasing the temperature ratio between the hot and cold ends of the generator. The use of non-contacting moving parts, <b>non-degrading</b> flexural bearings, and a lubrication-free and hermetically sealed environment have, in test units, demonstrated no appreciable degradation over years of operation. Experimental results demonstrate that an SRG could continue running for decades without maintenance. Vibration can be eliminated as a concern by implementation of dynamic balancing or use of dual-opposed piston movement. Potential applications of a Stirling radioisotope power system include exploration and science missions to deep-space, Mars, and the Moon.|$|E

We postulated that corners are non- accidental features and therefore crucial components in the processing of distractors (Kritikos and Pavlis 2007, Experimental Brain Research 183 159 ^ 170). We presented <b>non-degraded</b> or degraded (line segments or corners removed) distractors (line drawings of tools or musical instruments) simultaneously with a target, either at fixation or peripherally. <b>Non-degraded</b> as well as degraded distractors caused higher levels of interference (increased reaction times and {{a greater number of}} errors), particularly when presented at fixation, while <b>non-degraded</b> distractors caused greater interference than degraded. Contrary to expectation, however, {{there was no difference in}} the level of interference caused by lines-missing and corners-missing distractors, either at fixation or at periphery. Thus, we conclude that, where response to a complex object is required, both lines and corners are equally important components in the visual processing of distractor stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Those {{exposed to}} more {{degrading}} sexual references in popular music {{are more likely}} to initiate intercourse at a younger age. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform a content analysis of contemporary popular music with particular attention paid to the prevalence of degrading and <b>non-degrading</b> sexual references. We also aimed to determine if sexual references of each subtype were associated with other song characteristics and/or content. Methods. We used Billboard magazine to identify the top popular songs in 2005. Two independent coders each analyzed all of these songs (n 5279) for degrading and <b>non-degrading</b> sexual references. As measured with Cohen's kappa scores, inter-rater agreement on degrading vs. <b>non-degrading</b> sex was substantial. Mentions of substance use, violence, and weapon carrying were also coded. Results. Of the 279 songs identified, 103 (36. 9 %) contained references to sexual activity. Songs with references to degrading sex were more common than songs with references to <b>non-degrading</b> sex (67 [65. 0 %] vs. 36 [35. 0 %], p < 0. 001). Songs with degrading sex were most commonly Rap (64. 2 %), whereas songs with <b>non-degrading</b> sex were most likely Country (44. 5 %) or Rhythm & Blues/Hip-Hop (27. 8 %). Compared with songs that had no mention of sexual activity, songs with degrading sex were more likely to contain references to substance use, violence, and weapon carrying. Songs with <b>non-degrading</b> sex were no more likely to mention these other risk behaviors. Conclusions. References to sexual activity are common in popular music, and degrading sexual references are more prevalent than <b>non-degrading</b> references. References to degrading sex also frequently appear with references to other risky behaviors. © 2008 Association of Schools of Public Health...|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} indicates that short-term exposure to nonviolent sexual media stimuli can produce cognitive changes in men which, in turn, can affect their behavior toward women. This study explored differences among these behavioral effects based upon sexual degradation in film content and male viewers ’ gender schematicity, {{as an extension of}} the study of cognitive effects reported in Jansma, Linz, Mulac, and Imrich (1997). Seventy-one men viewed one of three films: (a) sexually-explicit and degrading to women, (b) sexually-explicit but <b>non-degrading,</b> or (c) non-sexual. The men then interacted with women in problem-solving dyads that were recorded on videotape. Men who viewed either sexually-explicit film displayed more dominance and anxiety than did the men who viewed the non-sexual film. This was true, however, for only the two-thirds who were non sex-typed (BSRI, Bem, 1974). Sex-typed men’s behavior was consistent across sexual versus non-sexual film conditions. In addition, men who viewed the degrading sexual film displayed less anxiety, but more dominance, than men who watched the <b>non-degrading</b> sexual film. Women’s behavior failed to distinguish which of the three films their partners had viewed, but was positively correlated with most of their partner’s discriminating behavior.

40|$|Osteoclastic bone {{resorption}} {{depends on}} the activity of various proteolytic enzymes, in particular those belonging {{to the group of}} cysteine proteinases. Biochemical studies have shown that cystatins, naturally occurring inhibitors of these enzymes, inhibit bone matrix degradation. Since the mechanism by which cystatins exert this inhibitory effect is not completely resolved yet, we studied the effect of cystatins on bone resorption microscopically and by Ca-release measurements. Calvarial bone explants were cultured in {{the presence or absence of}} family 2 cystatins and processed for light and electron microscopic analysis, and the culture media were analyzed for calcium release. Both egg white cystatin and human cystatin C decreased calcium release into the medium significantly. Microscopic analyses of the bone explants demonstrated that in the presence of either inhibitor, a high percentage of osteoclasts was associated with demineralized <b>non-degraded</b> bone matrix. Following a 24 -h incubation in the presence of cystatin C, 41 % of the cells were adjacent to areas of demineralized <b>non-degraded</b> bone matrix, whereas in controls, this was only 6 %.

The patients were randomised to receive either PH-NDP-PH or NDP-PH-NDP. Parameters reflecting protein metabolism were assessed in the plasma, urine, and stomal effluent on days 1, 6, 12, and 18, three hours after stopping the nutrition (t 0), and one hour after restarting it (t 1). Comparisons of t 1 and t 0 values showed that 13 amino acids (including the eight essential amino acids) increased significantly with the protein hydrolysate diet, but only two increased with the <b>non-degraded</b> protein diet. Similarly, with protein hydrolysate, insulin-aemia at t 1 was significantly higher than at t 0 and correlated with plasma leucine, phenylalanine, alanine, and lysine concentrations. In addition, significant improvements in plasma albumin, transferrin, and retinol binding protein concentrations were seen with protein hydrolysate, together with a significant decrease in the plasma phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio and urinary 3 -methylhistidine excretion.

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. Many samples submitted for DNA analysis from crime scenes are often degraded or contain DNA mixtures from two or more individuals. Degradation of DNA in these samples presents a challenge as larger molecular weight STR markers are inefficiently amplified, if they are amplified at all, potentially resulting in a significant loss of information. Furthermore, deducing individual donors from DNA mixtures is difficult in the best of times. However, when {{one or more of the}} contributors to the mixture exhibit degradation, analysis of the mixtures becomes even more challenging. Recent advancements in the amplification of mini-STRs has led to an increased ability to gain information from degraded or inhibited samples that may otherwise be lost using traditional STR amplification. The commercially available Mini Filer™ kit was developed using the eight largest loci from the AmpFℓSTR® ldentifiler® kit plus the Amelogenin locus by redesigning the primers such that shorter PCR products are produced, relative to previous STR kits. Due to this redesign, the MiniFiler™ kit was shown to increase the likelihood of obtaining information otherwise lost in these eight loci. The goal of this research is to compare the genotyping success obtained using mini- and traditional-STR amplification in both degraded and <b>non-degraded</b> single-source samples and mixtures. The objectives include 1) comparing peak height ratios of heterozygous markers and drop-out rates of the single source samples between the kits 2) observing whether these ratios are maintained in mixtures and 3) to examine if the DNA within the mixtures amplify independently. DNA from one male and one female were degraded using DNAse 1. Both the male and female samples were run as single-source samples in both the degraded and <b>non-degraded</b> conditions in quadruplicate using both kits with targets ranging from 0. 125 - 2 ng. Mixtures ofthe two samples containing either degraded or <b>non-degraded</b> DNA were run using both kits with varying female to male ratios. Finally, mixtures using the same female to male were run using the degraded female sample and the <b>non-degraded</b> male sample. All mixture samples were also run in quadruplicate. Results showed that the mini-STR amplification did not outperform traditional-STR amplification in <b>non-degraded</b> DNA samples. As a result, it is recommended that traditional PCR methods be used with <b>non-degraded</b> samples. In contrast, mini-STR amplifications did prove to be successful in recovery of allelic dropout in degraded samples. Therefore, for exhaustive biological evidence, a priori knowledge of sample conditions would be beneficial as only samples that are expected to contain degraded DNA should be amplified with mini-STRs. If the quantity and quality of DNA is deemed sufficient, then it is recommended that traditionai-STR methods be utilized and mini-STR amplification follow...|$|R
