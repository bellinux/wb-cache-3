25|$|One {{story of}} solar eclipse danger was {{illustrated}} by the case of Mr. Tomososki, who damaged his eyesight when viewing a 1962 eclipse, leaving him with a pea-sized blind spot {{for the rest of}} his life. During the 2017 eclipse he warned the country to not make the mistake he did. While some can recover, the danger of an eclipse comes in part because the excitement can override the instinct to <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the sun.|$|E
25|$|As far as Lange is concerned, he was {{the biggest}} murderer I have ever known. To {{write a book about}} him would {{definitely}} not be enough. As he is dead, it is no use talking about him. I would, however, mention {{that he was one of}} the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much that he could <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool or anywhere else.|$|E
25|$|Parthian art was Iranian art {{made during}} the Parthian Empire from 247 BC to 224 AD, based in the Near East. It has a mixture of Persian and Hellenistic influences. For some time after {{the period of the}} Parthian Empire, art in its styles {{continued}} for some time. A typical feature of Parthian art is the frontality of the people shown. Even in narrative representations, the actors do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the object of their action, but at the viewer. These are features that anticipate the art of medieval Europe and Byzantium.|$|E

In the winter season of 2008/2009 the ICC trialled a referral system where Hawk-Eye was used for referring decisions to the third umpire if a team disagreed with an LBW decision. The third umpire was able to look at what the ball actually did up to the point when it hit the batsman, but could <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the predicted flight of the ball after it hit the batsman.|$|E

Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, and then immediately demands that he wants to look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind in the here and now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E
25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E

25|$|Paifu and José {{decide to}} go to the house of a human rumored to be a murderer. Paifu notices what appears to be an orange spirit out in the sea and {{mistakes}} it for their friend. They arrive at the light source only to find that it was a torch on a raft belonging to the world-renowned sumo wrestler Maruyama, whom they feared. In spite of becoming acquainted, Maruyama teases Paifu and picks up two sticks producing a cross gesture to scare him off believing he, like some vampires in stories, fear a cross. On the contrary, this action forces Paifu to transform into a rampaging were-koala. His rage is halted by José, who shape-shifts into a round object to revert him back to normal. José tells Maruyama that Paifu can <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a cross figure for more than three seconds before transforming. When asked by Maruyama about Paifu's father, Paifu replies that he was shot to death in a human city when he shape-shifted into a were-koala. After getting to know a little about Maruyama's past, it turns out that he is not as frightening as rumored to be.|$|E
25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the criticism of ?, Minister of Culture and Tourism Jero Wacik expressed that the film would be best titled Bhinneka Tunggal Ika ("Unity in Diversity", the Indonesian national motto), and that its depiction of inter-ethnic and interfaith tolerance reflected Indonesia's [...] "national character". Yenny Wahid, a religious activist and daughter of former president and noted pluralist Abdurrahman Wahid, said that ? had [...] "succeeded in conveying the ideas of pluralism in Indonesia", and that critics should <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it in fragments. Although initially tweeting that the protests were free promotion, Bramantyo later entered discussions with the MUI and agreed to cut some scenes to avoid protests.

When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles does <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it and simply asks Jim to fax it to everyone on the distribution list. Jim {{does not know what}} the distribution list is either, but rather than asking Charles, he simply faxes the rundown to his father.|$|E

500|$|Heffron also {{clashed with}} the Federal Government's {{imposition}} of National Emergency Services procedures, most notably over the imposition of brownouts {{for the city of}} Sydney. In the Legislative Assembly in November 1942, Heffron denounced the advisers of the Federal Government who continued to maintain the brown-out as an essential defence measure: [...] "The only conclusion I can come to, is that the brown-out was born of a form of panic when Japan entered the war and it has continued because of a few brass hats will <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the facts and the evidence of the fighting men, but persist in sticking to their first conclusion. The position, therefore, is ludicrous." [...] Heffron later affirmed that the brown-out was completely unnecessary as a black-out, with short notice given, was a more effective and safer defensive measure.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, some {{misunderstanding}} {{brought an}} end to his formerly close friendship with the King. Seydlitz's health had been declining for years and he suffered from recurrent bouts of syphilis; in 1772, after an attack of apoplexy, he completed a couple of stays at the spa at Carlsbad to take the mineral waters. While these helped somewhat, his other activities continued without moderation, and to his detriment. A subordinate brought him two healthy Circassian beauties, whose company he enjoyed but who undoubtedly stressed his tenuous health. In August 1773, in his last illness, Frederick and Seydlitz met again at Seydlitz's home at Minkovsky near Ohlau (now Oława, Poland). The King sat beside his sickbed, horrified at Seydlitz's condition, and even persuaded him to take some of his medications, but Seydlitz would <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him; the illness had already deformed his face. [...] Eventually paralyzed, whether from another stroke or the underlying tertiary syphilis, Seydlitz died at Ohlau in Silesia in November 1773.|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Margaret Busby, who {{saw this}} book [...] "not so much an ending as a beginning", called Song [...] "the {{culmination}} of a unique autobiographical achievement, a glorious celebration of indomitable spirit". [...] Like other reviewers, Busby considered Song a series of [...] "beautifully crafted vignettes" [...] and found the book concise and readable. [...] Scholar John McWhorter did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Angelou's use of vignettes as positively, and stated that all of her books were short, divided into [...] "ever shorter" [...] chapters as her series progressed, and [...] "sometimes seem written for children rather than adults". [...] McWhorter recognized, however, that Angelou's precise prose and [...] "striking and even jarring simplicity" [...] was due to Angelou's purposes of depicting African-American culture in a positive way. [...] Busby also recognized Angelou's ability to find inspirational lessons from adversity, both nationally and personally, although the emphasis in this book was on the personal, especially her dilemmas as a mother and as a lover.|$|E
