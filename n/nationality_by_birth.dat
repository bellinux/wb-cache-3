The confiscation of Christian schools and the imposition of an Arab-Islamic emphasis in language and history teaching were accompanied by harassment of Christian children and the introduction of hijab dress laws. A Coptic child was flogged for failing to recite a Koranic verse. In contrast with the extensive media broadcasting of the Muslim Friday prayers, the radio ceased coverage of the Christian Sunday service. As the civil war raged throughout the 1990s, the government focused its religious fervour on the south. Although experiencing discrimination, the Copts and other long-established Christian groups in the north had fewer restrictions than other types of Christians in the south.|$|E

50|$|The government's {{orientation}} toward this {{rule is that}} those dual citizens whose foreign <b>nationality</b> came <b>by</b> <b>birth</b> in states attributing their jus soli citizenship to them were exempt from the requirement, because this law did not repeal the still effective article 7 of law 555 of 1912.

It requires the possibility of naturalisation, and provides that the period of residence required for eligibility cannot be more than ten years lawful and habitual residence.

As such, in 2004 {{she was the first}} recipient of the Holberg Prize, the humanities equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Kristeva presents herself as a European citizen of French <b>nationality,</b> Bulgarian <b>by</b> <b>birth</b> and American <b>by</b> adop-tion, having taught at U. S. universities since the mid-seventies. Her cosmopolitan self-identification mirrors the history of postwar Europe. She moved to Paris from Bulgaria at the age of eighteen with a background in Russian literature and German philosophy. Over the course of her career she developed a unique and profound way of think-ing by connecting linguistics, literature, philosophy, and psychoanaly-sis. In each of these fields, she has questioned established assumptions while grounding contemporary theories within the broader context of the Western cultural heritage. As the eminent French literary critic Roland Barthes wrote of her in 1970, “she changes the order of things...|$|R

40|$|An {{independent}} global citizenship {{without a}} local component {{and in the}} absence of the much-feared global government creates two concerns. One, an individual may imperil the rights of others, without a structure that can impose sanctions for the heinous conduct. Two, an individual 2 ̆ 7 s rights may be imperiled, and there may be no entity to provide protection. This essay proposes a model of a formal global citizenship that will alleviate these concerns and prove both practically and theoretically feasible. The model flows from the concept of dual or multiple nationality and offers global citizenship only as an elective nationality. Such citizenship would co-exist with the <b>nationality</b> acquired <b>by</b> <b>birth</b> or naturalization, thereby guaranteeing that at least one nation-state always has the ultimate responsibility for the individual. At the same time, by providing for careful considerations on who may acquire global citizenship, the value and meaning inherent in citizenship can be preserved and enhanced. Indeed, the idea of a global citizenship that is a formalized development emerging from the human rights tradition can be a foundation for the attainment of full personhood by those marginalized or disempowered within their own or foreign national borders [...] the poor, racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous populations, and women who at present lack equal status in any local or global community...|$|R

However, Japan's Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that denying nationality to children born out of wedlock to foreign mothers is unconstitutional.|$|E
