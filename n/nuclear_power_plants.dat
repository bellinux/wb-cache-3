5|$|In 1950, General Nichols became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense. He was {{appointed}} chief {{of research and}} development when it was reorganized in 1952. In 1953, he became the general manager of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he promoted the construction of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> He {{played a key role in}} the proceedings brought against J.

5|$|Electricity power {{stations}} are often {{located on the}} coast or beside an estuary so that the sea {{can be used as}} a heat sink. A colder heat sink enables more efficient power generation, which is important for expensive <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in particular.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium's large {{neutron capture}} {{cross-section}} {{makes it a}} good material for neutron absorption in control rods in <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> {{but at the same}} time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent corrosion-resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|The main use {{of uranium}} in the {{civilian}} sector is to fuel <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 20terajoules of energy (2joules), assuming complete fission; {{as much energy as}} 1500 tonnes of coal.|$|E

5|$|Boron carbide's {{ability to}} absorb {{neutrons}} without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets.

50|$|The Siberian <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plant</b> (Sibirskaya <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plant)</b> {{was built}} in the city of Seversk (then known as Tomsk-7), Tomsk Oblast.

5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} {{is working on a}} new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E

The facility receives nuclear waste from Taipower's current three <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> However, due to the strong resistance from local community in the island, the nuclear waste has to be stored at the power plant facilities themselves.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{opposed the}} use of {{mandatory}} limits on greenhouse gas emissions to deal with global warming. He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but {{that he did not}} know how much of it could be linked to human activity. He was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), building more <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> and reducing the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The {{theoretical}} {{maximum energy}} dissipation from Gulf Stream by turbines {{is in the}} range of 20-60GW. One idea, which would supply the equivalent power of several <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> would deploy a field of underwater turbines placed 300 meters (980ft) under the center of the core of the Gulf Stream. Ocean thermal energy could also be harnessed to produce electricity using the temperature difference between cold deep water and warm surface water.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} refuel their <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> the {{carriers}} each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This {{is also the}} most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels' equipment up to the standards of the newest ships. The ship is placed in dry dock, and essential maintenance is carried out including painting of the hull below the waterline and replacement of electrical and mechanical components such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships' constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted to the standards of the newer ships, which can include major upgrades to the flight deck, aircraft catapults and combat systems as well as other upgrades such as improved radar systems, although precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS Theodore Roosevelt took four years to complete (2009–2013) and cost about US$2.6 billion. Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E

The <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> stations of Brunsbüttel and Krümmel have been shut down permanently in response to a governmental order in summer 2011 after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.|$|R
5|$|In 1977-78, the West Australian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Charles Court, announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth. 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> would be needed {{by the end of the}} century to meet rapidly growing power demand, but all of this never eventuated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E
