25|$|As to the {{toxicity}} of philodendrons in cats, {{the evidence is}} conflicting. In one study, 72 cases of cat poisonings were examined, of which 37 resulted {{in the death of}} the cat. The symptoms of the poisoned cats included excitability, spasms, seizures, renal failure, and encephalitis. However, in another study, three cats were tube fed Philodendron cordatum and showed no signs of acute poisoning. In this study, two adult cats and one kitten were fed a pur√©ed leaf and water mixture, observed afterward, then euthanized, and finally a necropsy was performed. Dosages of 2.8, 5.6, and 9.1 g/kg were used, with the highest dose administered being considerably more than any house cat could consume. The cats showed none of the symptoms found in past epidemiological studies and appeared normal. Necropsies showed <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> suggest toxicity. The past epidemiological studies have been suggested to be wrong, since sick cats may be inclined to eat plants to alleviate their illnesses. If this were the case, then such studies would be incorrectly attributing the sickness of the cats to the philodendrons. The forced feeding study may have failed to show signs of philodendron toxicity because the tube feeding bypassed the mouth and hence minimized the typical signs of irritation.|$|E
500|$|Josef Woodard, {{writing for}} the Los Angeles Times, {{suggests}} that he has [...] "long [...] considered a lighter-weight participant among 20th-century composers," [...] while classic music broadcaster Norman Gilliland describes him as a [...] "major" [...] composer of the 20th century. Although describing him as a important and highly popular composer and a [...] "man of pronounced gifts", Harold C. Schonberg argued in 1978 that Khachaturian [...] "frankly composed popular music" [...] and that after being exposed to his work it becomes evident that it is mostly [...] "formula writing." [...] While praising his work as exotic and colorful, he downgraded Khachaturian to a [...] "bureaucratic composer, turning out well-crafted pieces of no particular personality, and certainly <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> rock the boat." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1797, however, when [...] "notoriously scurrilous journalist" [...] James T. Callender {{published}} A History of the United States for the Year 1796, it contained accusations of James Reynolds being an agent of Hamilton, using documents from the confrontation of December 15, 1792. On July 5, 1797, Hamilton wrote to Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable asking them to confirm that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> damage the perception of his integrity while Secretary of Treasury. All complied with Hamilton's request but Monroe, and after several rounds of argument, the two almost resorted to a duel. When Hamilton did not obtain an explicit response from Monroe, he published a 100-page booklet, later usually {{referred to as the}} Reynolds Pamphlet, in order to preserve his public reputation, and discussed the affair in exquisite detail. His wife Elizabeth eventually forgave him, but not Monroe. Though he faced ridicule from the Democratic-Republican faction, he maintained his availability for public service.|$|E

500|$|When Wray was {{transferred}} to nearby Berbice {{at the end of}} his term, the mission was without a pastor for three years. John Smith, his replacement sent to the colony by the LMS, was equally welcomed by the slaves. Writing to the LMS, Smith said that the clergy was explicitly ordered to say <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> cause slaves' disenchantment with their masters or dissatisfaction with their status. Many in the colony resented the presence of the preachers, whom they believed were spies to the abolitionist movement in London. They feared that the religious teachings and the liberal attitudes promoted would eventually cause slaves to rebel. Colonists interrupted services, threw stones at the churches, barred ministers' access to certain plantations, refusing permission to build chapels on plantation land; slaves were stopped from attending services at every turn. Smith received a hostile reception from the Governor John Murray and from most colonists. They saw his chapel services as a threat to plantation output, and feared greater unrest. Smith reported to the LMS the Governor had told him that [...] "planters will not allow their negroes to be taught to read, on pain of banishment from the colony." ...|$|E
500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that {{what he had to say}} was the truth and that it was a matter of life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff {{refused to}} {{speculate}} whether Mehserle would {{be charged with}} first or second-degree murder, saying [...] "What I feel the evidence indicates is an unlawful killing done by an intentional act and from the evidence we have there's <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> mitigate that to something lower than a murder." [...] Orloff noted Mehserle's refusal to explain himself {{as a reason for}} charging him with murder, rather than manslaughter. Orloff said he would fight any motion to change venue for the trial.|$|E

Signs throughout the park instructed that only children were permitted to wear shorts, because the Humphreys thought that proper dress would promote a family-friendly atmosphere. At one point the park advertised that it would [...] "present <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> demoralize or depress," [...] and that visitors would [...] "never be exposed to undesirable people." [...] In August 1910, the park was the site of an exhibition flight by aviator Glenn Curtiss from Euclid Beach to Cedar Point and back.|$|E
2500|$|Navy Lieutenant Charles F. Fischer, who {{had visited}} Goddard in Roswell earlier and gained his confidence, {{believed}} Goddard was doing valuable work {{and was able}} to convince the Bureau of Aeronautics in September 1941 that Goddard could build the JATO unit the Navy desired. While still in Roswell, and before the Navy contract took effect, Goddard began in September to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a PBY seaplane. By May 1942 he had a unit that could meet the Navy's requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway. In February he received part of a PBY with bullet holes apparently acquired in the Pearl Harbor attack. Goddard wrote to Guggenheim that [...] "I can think of <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> give me greater satisfaction than to have it contribute to the inevitable retaliation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Adams {{was finally}} found {{innocent}} {{after years of}} being processed by the legal system, {{the judge in the}} habeas corpus hearing officially stated that, [...] "much could be said about those videotape interviews, but <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have any bearing on the matter before this court." [...] Regardless, The Thin Blue Line, as Morris's film would be called, was popularly accepted as the main force behind getting its subject, Randall Adams, out of prison. As Morris said of the film, [...] "The Thin Blue Line is two movies grafted together. On one simple level is the question, Did he do it, or didn't he? And on another level, The Thin Blue Line, properly considered, is an essay on false history. A whole group of people, literally everyone, believed a version of the world that was entirely wrong, and my accidental investigation of the story provided a different version of what happened." ...|$|E

2500|$|Design of {{the theatre}} {{was given to}} C. J. Phipps. The {{builders}} were Patman and Fotheringham. Plans were drawn up and executed with speed and efficiency. Nonetheless, the advertised opening date {{had to be put}} back several times while the innovative electrical work was completed. The Savoy finally opened on 10 October 1881. Carte had at one time intended to call it the Beaufort Theatre, but he announced in a letter to The Daily Telegraph in 1881, [...] "On the Savoy Manor there was formerly a theatre. I have used the ancient name as an appropriate title for the present one." [...] The exterior of the building was made from red brick and Portland stone. The interior decoration, by Collinson and Locke, was [...] "in the manner of the Italian Renaissance", with white, pale yellow and gold predominating, including a gold satin curtain (instead of the usual printed act-drop), red boxes and dark blue seats. There were none of the cherubs, deities and mythical creatures familiar from the d√©cor of rival theatres. Carte wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> appear too garish or gaudy to his target, middle-class audience.|$|E
