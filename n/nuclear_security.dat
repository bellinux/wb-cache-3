5|$|Feyenoord opened April away in Almelo against Heracles Almelo on Wednesday 2 April, a {{game that}} was moved due to the 2014 <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Security</b> Summit. The home team opened the score early; Feyenoord took the lead later {{in the first half}} with goals by Te Vrede and Vilhena. The game ended in a 2–1 win, Feyenoord's fourth consecutive, and {{solidified}} the second place with a four-point lead and four games to play. Feyenoord won their fifth consecutive game on 6 April at home against RKC Waalwijk with 2–0. Pellè scored both goals in his return from a four-game suspension.

Under this plan, LLNL would be a center of excellence for nuclear design and engineering, a center of excellence for high explosive research and development, and a science magnet in high-energy-density (i.e., laser) physics. In addition, most of its special nuclear material would be removed and consolidated at a more central, yet-to-be-named site.|$|E

25|$|With no {{new designs}} of nuclear weapons, the warheads in the U.S. {{stockpile}} {{must continue to}} function far past their original expected lifetimes. As components and materials age, problems can arise. Stockpile Life Extension Programs can extend system lifetimes, but they also can introduce performance uncertainties and require maintenance of outdated technologies and materials. Because there is concern that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain high confidence in the current warheads for the long term, the Department of Energy/National <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Security</b> Administration initiated the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) Program. RRW designs could reduce uncertainties, ease maintenance demands, and enhance safety and security. In March 2007, the LLNL design was chosen for the Reliable Replacement Warhead. Since that time, Congress has not allocated funding for any further development of the RRW.|$|E
