40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{area of concern}} addressed by this research {{is the development of}} an Automated <b>Tactical</b> <b>Operations</b> <b>Command.</b> Control, Communications, and Intelligence Planning Tool (ATOC 3 IPT) to aid commanders and their staffs in the decision-making process. The tool is based on Hyper-NPSNET, an application which integrates a single level hypermedia overlay into a 3 D virtual world with at most a single instance of each type of multimedia information available at each 3 D location. However, <b>Tactical</b> <b>Operations</b> Centers (TOCOs) require multiple overlays, each with possibly multiple instances of each type of multimedia information available at each location. Also Hyper-NPSNET is a single user system whereas the TOCs require a multiple user system with restricted access. Tactical information display and query retrieval requirement of the command and control organizations were studied. A database structure and control hierarchy, were designed. An appropriate graphical user interface (GUI) was developed. The hypersystem used in Hyper-NPSNET was extended to include multiple, permission-protected overlays with multiple instances of each type of multimedia information available at each location. The resulting ATOC 3 IPT is a battlefield planning tool which incorporates today's technology. New hypermedia information display, editing, manipulating users, and retrieval methodologies not available in Hyper-NPSNET are included. ATOC 3 IPT is designed to be used by multiple users and with multiple instances of multimedia information types, whereas in Hyper-NPSNET a single user can work with one single-level overlay. This tool assists the commander in the decision-making process, and provides an excellent training tool for staff officers[URL] Lieutenant, Turkish Arm...|$|R
