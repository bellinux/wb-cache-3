5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Smithers {{had been}} a saving woman, and, on her death, it was found that, after paying all debts, there {{remained}} a sum of £600 for the two girls to live on, and nothing else; for their mother's fortune died with her. Now, it will be obvious that the interest arising from six hundred pounds {{is not sufficient to}} support two young people, and therefore Augusta was forced to live upon the principal. From an early age, however, she (Augusta) had shown a strong literary tendency, and shortly after her mother's death she published her first book at her own expense. It was a dead failure and cost her fifty-two pounds, the balance between the profit and loss account. After awhile, however, she recovered from this blow, and wrote [...] "Jemima's Vow," [...] which was taken up by Meeson's; and, strange as it may seem, proved the success of the year. Of the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> into which she entered with Meeson's, the reader is already acquainted, and he will not therefore {{be surprised to learn that}} under its cruel provisions Augusta, notwithstanding her name and fame, was absolutely prohibited from reaping the fruits of her success. She could only publish with Meesons's, and at the fixed pay of seven per cent on the advertised price of her work. Now, something over three years had elapsed since the death of Mrs. Smithers, and it will therefore be obvious that there was not much remaining of the six hundred pounds which she had left behind her. The two girls had, indeed, lived economically enough in a couple of small rooms in a back street; but their expenses had been enormously increased by the serious illness, from a pulmonary complaint, of the little girl Jeannie, now a child between twelve and thirteen years of age. On that morning, Augusta had seen the doctor and been crushed into the dust by the expression of his conviction, that, unless her little sister was moved to a warmer climate, for a period of at least a year, she would not live through the winter, and might die at any moment.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} a {{contract}} is one of utmost good faith does not mean, however, that it {{gives rise to a}} general fiduciary relationship. The relationship between insured and insurer is not akin to the relationship between, say, guardian and ward, principal and agent, or trustee and beneficiary. In these latter instances, the inherent character of the relationship is such that the law has traditionally imported general fiduciary obligations. The insurer-insured relationship is contractual; the parties are parties to an arms-length agreement. The principle of uberrima fides does not affect the arms-length <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement,</b> and cannot be used to find a general fiduciary relationship. The insurance contract, as noted above, imposes certain specific obligations on its parties. These obligations, however, do not import general fiduciary duties into each and every insurance relationship. Before such fiduciary obligations can be imported there must be specific circumstances in the relationship that call for their imposition.|$|E

By the 1830s, with pressure in the U.S. mounting to annex the region outright, the company undertook a deliberate policy to exterminate all fur-bearing animals from the Oregon Country, in order to both maximize its remaining profit and to delay the arrival of U.S. mountain men and settlers. The policy of discouraging settlement was undercut to some degree by the actions of John McLoughlin, Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, who regularly provided relief and welcome to U.S. immigrants who had arrived at the post over the Oregon Trail.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{examines}} the EU's foreign policy approach to its Eastern Partnership. With Ukraine as the case, it examines <b>the</b> new <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Association <b>Agreement</b> offered to Ukraine, {{as a response}} to its expectations to further integration into the EU's structures. Through <b>the</b> analytical framework <b>of</b> Transformative Power Europe, the study gives an assessment of why Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych rejected to sign <b>the</b> Association <b>Agreement</b> at <b>the</b> Vilnius Summit. The thesis reveals <b>the</b> Association <b>Agreement</b> as being a decisive shift in the EU's foreign policy, as it exerts conditionality through an economic integration and political approximation – but with limited assistance and informational campaigning. The study indicates that <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demands embodied in <b>the</b> Association <b>Agreement,</b> constitutes substantial misfit between the EU's conditions for signing <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> and <b>the</b> actual conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. Furthermore it makes a strong connection of a link between <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> external push, evident in vague formulated roadmaps that hardly were suitable in practice, and the Ukrainian government's lack <b>of</b> compliance with <b>the</b> political costly reforms. As <b>the</b> very <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Association <b>Agreement</b> was <b>of</b> a technical <b>nature,</b> it did not consider geo-political induced circumstances, which would require a fast change of procedure. As Russia suddenly enters the scene, the EU maintained its technical approach, until after was too late. At that point, EU recognizes <b>the</b> geo-strategic importance <b>of</b> Ukraine, and consequently alters its strategy. <b>The</b> very <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Association <b>Agreement</b> had certain underlying premises, that Ukraine did not fulfil, and thus needed external pressure to comply. But as the EU exerted only limited pressure within a non geo-strategic framework, Ukraine turned to the geo-strategic motivated Russia...|$|R

At that time, <b>the</b> twinning <b>agreements</b> had a strong cultural and political character while decentralized cooperation had <b>the</b> overarching aim <b>of</b> maintaining peace in the postwar period. However, from the 1970s, the interdependence created by globalization in different fields combined with <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> cooperation (from an assistance-driven to a developmental approach) to elevate <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreements</b> to another level. At that point, local governments, as they acquired greater autonomy, recognized <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> international issues in their day-to-day processes and saw decentralized cooperation as a means of overcoming their regional limitations, whether economic, technological, social, or others.

There seems no place in America these days for Frank Meyer fusionism, or even Ronald Reagan’s big-tent Republicanism.” Gottfried’s paleocons reject “True Man” as understood by St. Augustine and most libertarians reject religion, which is {{the life of the}} Western state, Bottum argued, and both libertarians and traditionalists elements of the Meyer fusion today tend to dismiss the need for an aggressive foreign policy. Bottum instead offered a new “tension” between religion and the Enlightenment, a new fusionism of religious traditionalists and secular “foreign policy neoconservatives” as they have been gathered at The Weekly Standard magazine, where he was an editor. He was sensitive that this might be viewed as a “fairly cynical bargain” manipulated by the neoconservatives but insisted it resulted from “mutual persuasion” in debate with the social conservatives. The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> is unclear except in a presumed joint opposition to abortion. Yet, even Bottom conceded that when the religious faction questioned the legitimacy of the Court in its failure to end abortion, the neoconservatives attacked it ruthlessly for questioning the government’s legitimacy. While Bottum argued the coalition survived the controversy, it is unclear whether the two can manage the legitimacy question since it is primary for the neoconservatives and only at best secondary for the religious traditionalists.|$|E

This agreement is similar to a contract of donation and to a contract of aid granting by the structural funds. Therefore, it is helpful, to compare it to these agreement.

40|$|Rights {{management}} for digital library programs {{is affected by}} high transaction costs and this calls for new schemes of collective management. Voluntary Stakeholders Agreements (VSA) is proposed as a solution. However, {{there is a need}} to reshape <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> defining <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> such <b>agreements.</b> In <b>the</b> past, the scope was set by limiting <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> uses licensed in <b>the</b> collective <b>agreement,</b> while other uses, pertaining <b>the</b> primary exploitation <b>of</b> works, remain in <b>the</b> sphere <b>of</b> direct management by the rightholder.

A key distinction is <b>the</b> commercial status <b>of</b> a work, if it is in-print or out-of-print.
