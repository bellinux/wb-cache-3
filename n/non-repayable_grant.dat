50|$|Based on {{actions taken}} in the 2007 Budget, {{significant}} improvements to the student aid program saw Newfoundland and Labrador at the national forefront in reducing provincial student loan debt. The budget provided for a $14.4 million investment to help current and former students reduce their debt-load. Interest charged on student loans was reduced from prime plus 2.5 per cent to prime, {{at a cost of}} $3.7 million annually. An up-front, needs-based grant program was introduced, providing financial assistance of approximately $10.7 million annually. The grant split the maximum weekly allowance of $140 into a $70 a week repayable loan and a $70 a week <b>non-repayable</b> <b>grant.</b> This provides the same level of funding, yet reduces the amount of money students with the highest need will borrow.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer {{empirical}} evidence on the impact generated by investment subsidies awarded to industrial firms on employment, sales, investments and labor productivity. The analysis is based on unique firm-level administrative data provided by the Italian National Statistical Agency on the universe of both treated- and non-treated applicant firms. For employment and sales outcomes such data derive directly from the National Social Security Agency of Italy and from the Internal Revenue Service Agency. The paper focuses on a decade (2000 - 2009) of subsidies awarded by a large-scale national Italian programme co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund and by the universe of smaller regional programmes available to all SMEs in the Northwestern Italian region (Piedmont). The analysis produces differential impacts based on different levels of the economic value of the incentives, different types of incentives (distinguishing between <b>non-repayable</b> <b>grants,</b> ?soft-loans? and ?interest rate grants?), different sizes and geographic location of the assisted firms. For the large scale national programme, the analysis exploit the existence of a natural experiment in the form of the existence of viable applicant firms that were denied the subsidy due to an exogenous, budget induced, cut-off point in the programme rankings of each wave of regional calls for applications. Impact estimates are then retrieved with a discontinuity designed within a difference in difference scheme that ensures exact matching of crucial firm characteristics. For the regional programmes, the analysis is implemented with a conditional difference in difference model that pre-processes the data based on a propensity score estimate to ensure common support between treated and non-treated firms. The results of our analysis show that: -Large <b>non-repayable</b> <b>grants,</b> particularly when given to large firms (and in underdeveloped regions), represent an ineffective way to stimulate additional private investment and to improve the performance of the subsidized firms; -Small grants given to small firms (not in the context of severely distressed socio-economic areas) have small impacts, but when all the dimensions are taken into account, they are more cost-effective; - <b>Non-repayable</b> <b>grants</b> are outperformed by repayable soft loans and interest rate subsidies as most effective tools for assistance; -For SMEs, soft-loans and interest rate grants are the most cost-effective form of support...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the federal students ’ financial assistance scheme (BAfoeG) on enrolment rates by exploiting exogenous variation introduced through a discrete shift in repayment regulations. Supported students had to repay the full loan after graduation from their future earnings until 1990. Thereafter, only 50 percent of the loan has become due, the other half of student aid has been offered as a <b>non-repayable</b> <b>grant.</b> Using data from the German Socio Economic Panel, we test whether this substantial reduction of the net present costs to study has increased enrolment into higher education. Our results from simple difference-in-difference estimates and discrete-choice models suggest that the student aid is ineffective in raising enrolment rates. Our findings may have important implications for the current debate on the reform of financing higher education in Germany and elsewhere.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} called 'Problems and {{perspectives}} of development aid: donors and developing countries' are main questions of development aid in general. Basic ideas of the whole concept are defined in the first chapter. The history of development aid and international theories' perspectives of development aid are mentioned here. The second chapter consists of classifications and characteristics of developing countries together with their capacities for integration. The donors are presented in the third chapter. The {{main part of the}} thesis is the fourth chapter in which the problems of development aid are analysed on the grounds of contemporary field literature. At the beginning of the fourth chapter the qualitative problems of development aid are analysed together with the donors' motivations for its distribution. The best possible form of development aid is discussed later on - whether it is better to provide developing countries with loans or <b>non-repayable</b> <b>grants.</b> Moreover, the coordination problems within the development aid are discussed as well as possible alternatives to development aid - such as trade. The thesis pays also attention to negative consequences of development aid. Possible solutions to the problems mentioned are sketched within each sub-chapter...|$|R

40|$|A {{sustainable}} future is only possible {{if we can}} limit global warming to 2 °C. To still achieve this goal, an estimated $ 1, 000 billion need to be invested annually in developing climate-friendly renewable energy production. Due to the subsidies provided for fossil fuels, targeted support measures are needed to make renewable energy investments attractive to investors. Financing such support measures {{is one of the}} main responsibilities of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) within the framework of the UNFCCC. The Copenhagen Accord at the COP 15 designated the GCF to obtain the “significant ” amount of the promised “new and additional ” $ 100 billion p. a. committed by developed countries by 2020. However, assuming that the GCF manages to obtain a sum close to the promised $ 100 bn, two questions remain: Firstly, what is the likelihood of receiving $ 100 billion each year in form of <b>non-repayable</b> <b>grants</b> (and not largely in form of loans as a recent OECD report assumed 1). And secondly, will $ 100 billion be sufficient to make annual investments of $ 1, 000 billion dollars profitable or will funding of at least 300 billion dollars be required? Previous experience with financing commitments from tax or semi-public funds- such as revenues from emissions trading- indicate that the sums which will actually be disbursed will regularly fall short of the ones promised. For example, the current amount of grants provided to the GCF stand at $ 10 billion in total...|$|R

40|$|The {{decline of}} public {{transport}} in Western Australia is observed in four separate historical studies which narrate {{the political and}} administrative history of each major urban transport mode. Perth's suburban railway system is examined {{as part of the}} State's widespread rail network, including the extravagantly-equipped short-lived suburban railway in Kalgoorlie. Political interference in early railway operations is studied in detail to determine why Perth's rail-based public transport systems were so poorly developed and then neglected or abandoned for much of the twentieth century. The llnique events in Kalgoorlie {{at the turn of the}} century are presented as potent reasons for the early closure of Perth's urban tramway system and the fact that no purpose-built suburban railways were constructed in Perth until 1993. The road funding arrangements of the late nineteenth century are considered next, in order to demonstrate the very early basis for the present lavish <b>non-repayable</b> <b>grants</b> of money for road construction and maintenance by all three layers of government. The development of private and government bus networks is detailed last, with particular attention paid to the failure of private urban bus operators in the 1950 s and the subsequent formation of a government owned and operated urban bus monopoly. The capital structure and accounting practices of public transport modes are analysed to provide a critique of popular myths concerning the merits of each. In order to obtain an impression of the changing political view of different transport modes, the attitude of politicians to public transport and the private motor car over the last one hundred and twenty years is captured in summary narrations of some of the more important parliamentary transport debates. Two possible explanations of public transport decline are discussed in conclusion; one relying a neoclassical economic theory of marginal pricing, and the other on an observation on the fate of large capital investments in the modern party-based democratic system of government...|$|R
