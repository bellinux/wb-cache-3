40|$|ABSTRACT. The Cluster Mission Planning System (CMPS) is an {{off-line}} {{software system}} that allows the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) mission <b>operational</b> <b>staff</b> to carry out advanced planning of the 4 spacecraft Cluster mission. Initially, the CMPS supports the ESOC <b>operational</b> <b>staff</b> {{in the process of}} schedule construction based on inputs from the Principal Investigators (PIs) via the Joint Science Operations Centre (JSOC) and also the <b>operational</b> <b>staff.</b> This allows resource conflicts to be identified and corrected. In checking for schedule conflicts, the CMPS has to take into account constraints imposed by the Cluster orbits (e. g. eclipses, distance from the Earth), the on-board systems (e. g. data storage, power availability) and the on-ground systems (e. g. ground station visibility, availability). The final output of the CMPS is the generation of machine and man readable schedules to command the four spacecraft and the two ESA ground stations. 1. MISSION DESCRIPTION Cluster forms part of the Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme and is intended to investigate the small scale and/or transitory phenomena that govern and modulate the transfer of particles and energy between the solar and terrestrial environments. Specific regions of interest include th...|$|R
