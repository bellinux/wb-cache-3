Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E

40|$|Negotiation is an {{important}} mechanism for resolving conflicts between people. Many tasks in day-to-day life involve interactions among several people.

Therefore, training people <b>in</b> <b>negotiation</b> is beneficial, yet difficult. In this paper an innovative general purpose tool for negotiation training is proposed and demonstrated experimentally.

Henry's plans to reward the four with bishoprics in late 1170 probably precipitated the final crisis that led to Becket's murder.|$|E
