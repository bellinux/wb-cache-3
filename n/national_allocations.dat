He rebelled against the Government on the Maastricht Treaty and several fishing motions that he regarded as damaging to Lowestoft. The European Common Fisheries Policy he argued resulted in unfair <b>national</b> <b>allocations</b> of fish stocks and the discard policy of throwing dead fish back into the sea was preposterous, damaging the fishing industry in the longer term. Although some in the Conservative Party tried to select a different candidate after his selection in 1985, {{at the time the}} local Conservative Associations had total power of selection and retained Porter. He regularly campaigned for Britain to leave the European Common Fisheries Policy, preferring a system of local control with a yearly 'Sabbath' (ban of fishing) rotating through each sea area around the United Kingdom waters.|$|E

5000|$|Under {{the socialist}} government, {{physical}} planning became {{a tool for}} maintaining the system of repression and meeting {{the demands of the}} communist regime. Urban planning was a ‘top down’ process, almost completely administered by the national government according to national economic goals and objectives [...] which rigidly determined the amount of services needed in each neighbourhood. Local municipalities lost autonomy, had no budgets apart from <b>national</b> <b>allocations,</b> [...] and were restricted to simply placing the national projects in their area. [...] The physical and spatial planning and investment under central government focused mainly on construction of grand schemes, (often energy and mineral resources, chemical manufacturing and heavy industries) and not on, small scale ‘consumer’ needs, or protecting the local environment. During the first years of communism in Czechoslovakia, virtually all property was nationalized and the state took control of all maintenance.|$|E
40|$|Research PaperNew Zealand’s $ 25 M (USD) {{domestic}} tuna fishery comprises a troll fishery for albacore, a longline fishery {{for southern}} bluefin, Pacific bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin, and albacore tunas, {{and a small}} purse seine fishery for skipjack tuna. New Zealand vessels also fish for tuna in high seas areas and, through arrangements with other governments, in the fishery management zones of some Pacific Island Nations. Unlike other major New Zealand domestic fisheries, tuna fisheries have been open access. New Zealand domestic tuna fisheries are constrained by the availability of tuna in New Zealand fisheries waters and the longline fishery in particular has been characterised by overcapacity and poor economic returns. Following a recent review of management options, the New Zealand Government decided to manage its tuna fisheries using Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs). ITQ management will initially apply to all major tuna fisheries within New Zealand fisheries waters and, where a national allocation is agreed through the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organization, for tuna species taken by New Zealand fishers outside New Zealand fisheries waters. Total allowable commercial catches (TACCs) will reflect agreed <b>national</b> <b>allocations.</b> Where <b>national</b> <b>allocations</b> have not been set, TACCs will be set {{so as not to}} constrain fishing unduly, while ensuring sustainability of the stocks. Voluntary rationalization of the tuna fishing fleet commenced soon after the announcement of ITQ management. As expected, the initial allocation of ITQs has proved contentious with different fishers promoting the use of different catch history years as a basis for quota allocation...|$|E

40|$|Implementation of an EU-wide {{emissions}} trading system {{by means of}} <b>National</b> <b>Allocation</b> Plans {{is at the core}} of European environmental policy agenda. Member States are faced with the problem of allocating their national emission budgets under the EU Burden Sharing Agreement between energy-intensive sectors that are eligible for international {{emissions trading}} and the remaining segments of their economies that will be subject to complementary domestic emission regulation. The country-specific segmentation of national emission budgets between trading sectors and non-trading sectors will determine the cost efficiency of the EU emissions trading system and the gains for each Member State vis-?-vis domestic abatement policies. We present an interactive simulation model where users can specify the design of <b>National</b> <b>Allocation</b> Plans for each EU Member State and then evaluate the induced economic effects. Our numerical framework is based on marginal abatement cost curves for (emissions) trading and non-trading sectors of the EU- 15 economies.

40|$|Brexit {{has become}} a reality, and {{not only at the}} {{negotiation}} table in Brussels. In the fishing industry, Brexit has created uncertainty over access to fishing grounds and <b>national</b> <b>allocations</b> of EU Total Allowable Catches (TACs) by fish species. This uncertainty is already affecting investment decisions. Each EU Member State has its own Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which is a sea area defined in International Law that extends up to 200 nautical miles from the coast of the EU Member State. Within the EU, Member States have equal access to EU fishing grounds. Dutch fisheries are highly dependent on the UK EEZ, where (pelagic) trawlers in particular, targeting herring and mackerel, are highly active (Figure 1). The other types of trawlers (so called bottom trawlers) target species like plaice, sole and common shrimp. They fish mainly in the North Sea, partly in the UK EEZ although less so than the pelagic trawlers...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) -based {{decentralized}} allocation enforcement system, developed {{with an emphasis}} on a consistent data model and easy integration into existing scheduling, and workload management software at six independent high-performance computing centers forming a Grid known as SweGrid. The Swedish <b>National</b> <b>Allocations</b> Committee (SNAC) allocates resource quotas at these centers to research projects requiring substantial computer time. Our system, the SweGrid Accounting System (SGAS), addresses the need for soft real-time allocation enforcement on SweGrid for cross-domain job submission. The SGAS framework is based on state-of-the-art Web and Grid services technologies. The openness and ubiquity of Web services combined with the fine-grained resource control and cross-organizational security models of Grid services proved to be a perfect match for the SweGrid needs. Extensibility and customizability of policy implementations for the three different parties the system serves (the user, the resource manager, and the allocation authority) are key design goals. Another goal is end-to-end security and single sign-on, to allow resources—selected based on client policies—to act on behalf of the user when negotiating contracts with the bank in an environment where the six centers would continue to use their existing accounting policies and tools. We conclude this paper by showing the feasibility of SGAS, which is currently being deployed at the production sites, using simulations of reservation streams. The reservation streams are shaped using soft computing and policy-based algorithms...|$|E

40|$|The {{upcoming}} European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) {{is one of}} {{the more}} controversial climate policy instruments. Predictions about its likely impact and its performance can at present only be made to a certain degree. As long as the <b>National</b> <b>Allocations</b> Plans are not finally settled the overall supply of allowances is not determined. In this paper, we will identify key features and key impacts of the EU ETS by scanning the range of likely allocation plans using the simulation model DART. The analysis of the simulation results highlights a number of interesting details in terms of allowance trade flows between Member States, of allowance prices, and in terms of the role of the accession countries in the ETS. An important finding about the impact of the new ETS with respect to achieving emission reductions more efficiently, i. e. at lower cost, is that savings can only be realized if the cap on emissions is distributed between the ETS sector and the rest of the economy in such a way that the different abatement costs are taken into account. This would imply a relatively small allocation of emissions to the ETS sector. The second important result concerns the role of the accession countries. Even if they do not supply their hot-air in the ETS market, they contribute substantially to the cost savings of the ETS by offering low cost abatement options.

40|$|This paper extends a {{model by}} Ehrhart et al (2008) which {{examines}} duopoly under the EU Emission Trading Scheme, analyzing {{the effect of}} emissions permit price changes on firm profits. While their model assumes no initial allocation of permits to firms, the extension presented here incorporates heterogeneity in <b>national</b> <b>allocation</b> plans of pollution permits into the analysis. We find that, unlike Ehrhart et al, there are certain circumstances where a permit price increase will unambiguously lead to a rise in profit due to the initial allocation of permits. Because <b>national</b> <b>allocation</b> plans differ across member nations in the EU, these differing allocations {{have the potential to}} advantage some firms in the EU if they receive more permits than other firms. In addition, while Ehrhart et al (2008) state that at some point there may be an incentive to lobby for a lower allocation of permits, in this extension we find that while that incentive may exist, there also may be an incentive to lobby for mor...|$|R
