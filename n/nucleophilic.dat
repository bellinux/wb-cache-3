5|$|In 1957, Ronald Breslow {{proposed}} that a relatively stable <b>nucleophilic</b> carbene, a thiazol-2-ylidene derivative, {{was involved in}} the catalytic cycle of vitamin B1 (thiamine) that yields furoin from furfural.|$|E
5|$|Reaction of imidazol-2-ylidenes with 1-bromohexane gave 90% of the 2-substituted adduct, {{with only}} 10% of the {{corresponding}} alkene, indicating that these molecules are also reasonably <b>nucleophilic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is a {{substituted}} cathinone. It is synthesized in two chemical steps {{starting from}} 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position {{adjacent to the}} ketone is first brominated followed by <b>nucleophilic</b> displacement of the resulting alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis using a residue as a nucleophile. The {{reactivity of}} the <b>nucleophilic</b> residue is increased by the functional {{groups of the}} other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to phosphonium ylides {{used in the}} Wittig reaction, phosphonate-stabilized carbanions are more <b>nucleophilic</b> but less basic. Likewise, phosphonate-stabilized carbanions can be alkylated. Unlike phosphonium ylides, the dialkylphosphate salt byproduct is easily removed by aqueous extraction.|$|E
5|$|Most serpins are {{protease}} inhibitors, targeting extracellular, chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. These proteases {{possess a}} <b>nucleophilic</b> serine residue in a catalytic triad in their active site. Examples include thrombin, trypsin, and human neutrophil elastase. Serpins act as irreversible, suicide inhibitors by trapping an intermediate of the protease's catalytic mechanism.|$|E
5|$|NHCs {{are often}} {{strongly}} basic (the pKa {{value of the}} conjugate acid of an imidazol-2-ylidene was measured at ca. 24) and react with oxygen. Clearly these reactions are performed using air-free techniques, avoiding compounds of even moderate acidity. Although imidazolium salts are stable to <b>nucleophilic</b> addition, other non-aromatic salts are not (i.e. formamidinium salts).|$|E
5|$|Organobromides are {{typically}} produced by additive or substitutive bromination of other organic precursors. Bromine {{itself can be}} used, but due to its toxicity and volatility safer brominating reagents are normally used, such as N-bromosuccinimide. The principal reactions for organobromides include dehydrobromination, Grignard reactions, reductive coupling, and <b>nucleophilic</b> substitution.|$|E
5|$|Since {{no natural}} amino acids are {{strongly}} <b>nucleophilic,</b> the base in a catalytic triad polarises and deprotonates the nucleophile {{to increase its}} reactivity. Additionally, it protonates the first product to aid leaving group departure.|$|E
5|$|The {{side-chain}} of the <b>nucleophilic</b> residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The lone pair {{of electrons}} {{present on the}} oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently <b>nucleophilic</b> functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S−) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine, however due to steric hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.|$|E
5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include <b>nucleophilic</b> addition, amide bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, amide bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E
5|$|In {{a similar}} reaction, pentaisopropylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 can be {{synthesised}} from pentamethylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 in 80% yield. These reactions {{demonstrate that the}} acidity of the methyl hydrogens in a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complex can be considerably increased {{by the presence of}} the metal centre. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds with potassium hydroxide deprotonating a methyl group and the resulting carbanion undergoing <b>nucleophilic</b> substitution with methyl iodide to form a new carbon–carbon bond.|$|E
5|$|The Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons {{reaction}} {{begins with}} the deprotonation of the phosphonate to give the phosphonate carbanion 1. <b>Nucleophilic</b> addition of the carbanion onto the aldehyde 2 (or ketone) producing 3a or 3b is the rate-limiting step. If R2 = H, then intermediates 3a and 4a and intermediates 3b and 4b can interconvert with each other. The final elimination of 4a and 4b yield (E)-alkene 5 and (Z)-alkene 6.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism for the}} Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction consists of <b>nucleophilic</b> addition of the ylide to the carbonyl or imine group. A negative charge is transferred to the heteroatom and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring. In the related Wittig reaction, {{the formation of the}} much stronger phosphorus-oxygen double bond prevents oxirane formation and instead, olefination takes place through a 4-membered cyclic intermediate.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aziridines from imines {{is another important}} application of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to amine transfer from oxaziridines. Though less widely applied, the reaction has a similar substrate scope and functional group tolerance to the carbonyl equivalent. The examples shown below are representative; in the latter, an aziridine forms in situ and is opened via <b>nucleophilic</b> attack to form the corresponding amine.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the <b>nucleophilic</b> atom causes minor {{differences}} in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original <b>nucleophilic</b> attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E
5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following reaction mechanism {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in reactions of the Weinreb–Nahm amide. Their suggestion was that the tetrahedral intermediate (A below) formed {{as a result of}} <b>nucleophilic</b> acyl substitution by the organometallic reagent is stabilized by chelation from the methoxy group as shown. This intermediate is stable only at low temperatures, requiring a low-temperature quench.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering from poor yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble stems from {{the need for a}} <b>nucleophilic</b> sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate <b>nucleophilic</b> conjugate addition of the enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization {{and in the next}} step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{that contain}} a {{catalytic}} triad {{use it for}} one of two reaction types: either to split a substrate (hydrolases) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate (transferases). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the active site of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. binding site and oxyanion hole) to achieve <b>nucleophilic</b> catalysis. These triad residues act together to make the nucleophile member highly reactive, generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue {{of the active}} site triad performs a <b>nucleophilic</b> attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E
5|$|Some enzymes do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing <b>nucleophilic</b> species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|E
5|$|The Weinreb–Nahm ketone {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction used in organic chemistry to make carbon–carbon bonds. It {{was discovered in}} 1981 by Steven M. Weinreb and Steven Nahm as a method to synthesize ketones. The original reaction involved two subsequent <b>nucleophilic</b> acyl substitutions: the conversion of an acid chloride with N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine, to form a Weinreb–Nahm amide, and subsequent treatment of this species with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or organolithium reagent. Nahm and Weinreb also reported the synthesis of aldehydes by reduction of the amide with an excess of lithium aluminum hydride (see amide reduction).|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} was first {{applied to the}} hydrolysis reaction catalysed by chymotrypsin. Often, the detection of an intermediate is a vital piece of evidence in investigations of what mechanism an enzyme follows. For example, in the ping–pong mechanisms that are shown above, rapid kinetic measurements can follow the release of product P and measure {{the formation of the}} modified enzyme intermediate E*. In the case of chymotrypsin, this intermediate is formed by an attack on the substrate by the <b>nucleophilic</b> serine in the active site and the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
5|$|This unusual triad occurs only in one {{superfamily}} of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise {{the middle}} serine. The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the <b>nucleophilic</b> serine to activate it (one {{with the side}} chain hydroxyl {{and the other with}} the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual cis orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and cis-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a <b>nucleophilic</b> residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E
5|$|Many {{covalent}} binary nitrides are known. Examples include cyanogen ((CN)2), triphosphorus pentanitride (P3N5), disulfur dinitride (S2N2), and tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). The essentially covalent {{silicon nitride}} (Si3N4) and germanium nitride (Ge3N4) are also known: silicon nitride in particular {{would make a}} promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it. In particular, the group 13 nitrides, most of which are promising semiconductors, are isoelectronic with graphite, diamond, and silicon carbide and have similar structures: their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended. In particular, since the B–N unit is isoelectronic to C–C, and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen, much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron–nitrogen chemistry, such as in borazine ("inorganic benzene"). Nevertheless, the analogy is not exact due to the ease of <b>nucleophilic</b> attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons, which is not possible in a wholly carbon-containing ring.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the <b>nucleophilic</b> adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. <b>Nucleophilic</b> substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of proteolysis by the β subunits of the 20S core particle {{is through a}} threonine-dependent <b>nucleophilic</b> attack. This mechanism may depend on an associated water molecule for deprotonation of the reactive threonine hydroxyl. Degradation occurs within the central chamber formed by the association of the two β rings and normally does not release partially degraded products, instead reducing the substrate to short polypeptides typically 7–9 residues long, though they can range from 4 to 25 residues, depending on the organism and substrate. The biochemical mechanism that determines product length is not fully characterized. Although the three catalytic β subunits have a common mechanism, they have slightly different substrate specificities, which are considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH)-like. These variations in specificity {{are the result of}} interatomic contacts with local residues near the active sites of each subunit. Each catalytic β subunit also possesses a conserved lysine residue required for proteolysis.|$|E
25|$|In {{organometallic}} chemistry the <b>nucleophilic</b> abstraction reaction {{occurs with}} a <b>nucleophilic</b> substitution mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Neutral alanes are not <b>nucleophilic</b> {{enough to}} deliver organic groups to electrophilic substrates. However, upon {{activation}} by a nucleophile, the resulting aluminates are highly <b>nucleophilic</b> {{and add to}} electrophiles with retention of configuration at the migration carbon. Thus, stereospecific hydroalumination followed by <b>nucleophilic</b> attack provides a method for the stereospecific synthesis of olefins from alkynes.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium, {{like its}} {{congener}} boron, is less electronegative than carbon (Al, 1.61; C, 2.55); thus, aluminium-bound carbons in organoalanes possess partial negative charge and are <b>nucleophilic</b> as a result. Generally, however, organoalanes are not <b>nucleophilic</b> enough to transfer an organic group {{on their own}} (the exception being when carbonyl and enone acceptors are used, due to the high oxophilicity of aluminium). In most cases, <b>nucleophilic</b> activation of organoalanes is necessary for group transfer to take place. Like organoboranes, organoalanes possess an empty p orbital on the aluminium center that can receive electron density from an added nucleophile. The resulting negatively charged aluminate is much more <b>nucleophilic</b> than the neutral alane.|$|E
25|$|By {{the base}} {{intramolecular}} <b>nucleophilic</b> substitution of a halohydrin.|$|E
25|$|Transition-metal-mediated reductive desulfonylations {{rely on the}} {{generation}} of an intermediate π-allyl complex, which undergoes <b>nucleophilic</b> attack by hydride or another nucleophile to afford reduced products. <b>Nucleophilic</b> attack generally occurs at the less substituted position of the π-allyl moiety, although site selectivity depends strongly on the substrate and reaction conditions. Palladium(0) complexes are {{the most commonly used}} precatalysts.|$|E
25|$|In another {{application}} DOM {{is applied}} in placing a bulky tert-butyl group in an ortho position (scheme 4). The lithiation is a <b>nucleophilic</b> aromatic substitution {{and the subsequent}} reaction to the sulfoxide an electrophilic aromatic substitution. In the final step tert-butyllithium acts as a nucleophile in another <b>nucleophilic</b> aromatic substitution through an anionic intermediate.|$|E
