On 18 October 2001, the fleet support service {{notified}} the DCN that Triomphant {{was about to}} take the first period of Unavailability for Maintenance and Repairs (IPER or Indisponibilité pour Entretien et Réparations). The 150 million Euro contract was granted to DCN, with the IPER starting at Ile Longue on 2 April 2002, scheduled for 29 months in all. In this, the boat's first major refit, the missiles and the fuel elements of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>boiler</b> were disembarked. In August 2004 L'Humanité ran a piece with the headline [...] "Pas si Triomphant que ça" [...] reporting that Le Triomphant had suffered a nuclear leak from one of her nuclear warheads by the end of 1997 and from her reactor in 2004, though the FOST downplayed the incidents and stated no radiation had been released since the reactor had been nonoperational at the time. Le Triomphant carried out a test flight of a M45 strategic missile on 1 February 2005 in the Atlantic.|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamics}} {{analysis of}} a <b>nuclear</b> <b>boiler</b> based on a steam-generating, pressure-tube, heavy-water-moderated design is presented. In effect the plant {{is very similar to}} a La Mont recirculating cycle. A detailed mathematid model to represent plant dynamics (linearized, full power) is discussed with special reference to the boiling channel, steam drum, and recirculating loop. A simplified model is derived for analogue computer studies. Dynamic performance is discussed in terms o f (1) boiler only (no reactivity feedbacks) : influence of pressure feedbacks, steam drum design, subcooling, recirculating delay; (2) complete plant (including reactor) : as above but including influence of void coefficient. The two most important results are: (1) the strong dependence of plant behaviour/stability on the degree of float allowed to pressure; (2) the possibility of designing an inherently stable and self-regulating plant with a small positive void coefficient. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the complete dynamic analysis under the heads: (1) optimal plant design; (2) control system design; (3) development of analytical/computing methods; (4) research into two-phase physics...|$|E

40|$|This study {{introduces}} Net Export (NX) {{models to}} examine the determinants of the trade flows between Australia and eight selected trading partner (TP) countries (China, France, Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States of America) in four selected Trade Deficit (TD) categories (Pharmaceutical Products; <b>Nuclear</b> Reactors, <b>Boilers,</b> Machinery and Mechanical Appliances; Electrical Machinery and Equipment; Sound Recorders and Producers, and Vehicles Other Than Railway or Tramway Rolling-Stock). A total of 29 NX models are estimated, {{which are based on}} both the monetary and Quantity (QTY) values. Findings in this study suggest that macroeconomic variables such as money supply, interest rates and savings rates have no-significant effect in the determination of the NX levels in the selected categories. This highlights that monetary policy cannot influence the NX levels in the selected TD categories in Australia. This study also identifies some policy implications which arise from this paper...|$|R
30|$|Nanofluid is a {{suspension}} containing a certain quantity of nanoscaled solid particles {{in a conventional}} cooling liquid, such as water and ethylene glycol [1]. Nanofluid shows considerably better heat transfer performance than single-phase mediums due to particle’s Brownian motion and interaction [2, 3]. Furthermore, because of the ultra-small particle size, nanofluid is also remarkably better than normal multi-phase fluid to eliminate erosion and clogging problems in micro channels [4, 5]. Recently, nanofluid is increasingly used in natural convection applications for wide areas [6], such as electronic cooling, heat exchangers, <b>boilers,</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactor systems and energy storage devices [7].|$|R

The Czech Republic government liberalized almost all the prices, privatized most of the economy, decentralized the wage setting, and opened {{the country to the}} foreign trade with nearly balanced budget. In general, the transition impact on economic performance in the Czech Republic was positive. In the empirical work, the regression analysis of Czech foreign trade during 1993 to 2008 shows that the exports and imports depending on GD; FD; LW; UR; ER; EC; LR and IR Simultaneously. This model of Czech foreign trade was able to explain 96. 3 percent of the variation in Czech exports and 97. 5 percent of imports, which is a strong result. In addition, the two significant variables, which have a big relationship with exports and imports, are labor wages and gross domestic product. In addition, the first and the more important sector for the Czech foreign trade share during 1999 to 2008 is Machinery and transport equipment.

Finally, this study also finds that inconclusive evidence exists that capacity utilization increases the X supply, while some evidence exists that the X supply has considerably increased in most of the categories since the introduction of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) in Australi...|$|R
30|$|Two-phase (gas–liquid) flow in {{vertical}} pipes {{has been}} one of the interests of industrial applications such as power plants, <b>nuclear</b> reactors, <b>boilers,</b> gas well exploration and so on. One of the problems usually encountered in the gas well exploration industries is liquid loading: a condition where the gas velocity is not high enough to carry all the liquid generated in the gas wells. During normal operation, flow in the gas wells shows characteristics of annular flow regime. However, as the gas wells mature, the gas velocities reduce (below a critical value) and gradually lead to the onset of liquid loading (film reversal). At this point, flow in the gas well presents features of churn flow. Thus, during the film reversal point, the liquid film tends to increase in thickness and part of it starts to flow downwards. This paper first summarizes the available mechanistic and numerical models related to liquid loading and then reviews the application of CFD techniques to liquid loading modeling in vertical pipes. Most of the methodologies discussed here focus on annular and churn flow due to the limited information on the application of CFD techniques to liquid loading modeling and the onset of film reversal occurs during the transition from annular flow to churn flow which can lead to liquid loading as observed experimentally by many researchers. It was concluded from the available literature related to liquid loading that a detailed understanding of the fluid flow behavior during liquid loading is not yet fully available and prediction methods of this phenomenon are still rather incipient. Directions for good CFD modeling of these important phenomena are presented in the present paper.|$|R
40|$|Chloride stress {{corrosion}} cracking (CSCC) of AISI 304 austenitic stainless steel {{are the most important}} corrosion processes that affect the performance of this stainless steel. SCC occurs when susceptible material under the stress is exposed to a specific environment such as corrosive environment.

The purpose of this project is to study the effect of chloride {{stress corrosion}} cracking in austenitic stainless steel based on the sensitization treatment of the specimens and different concentration mixtures of sulphuric acid and sodium chloride. Method use in this study was weight loss method. From the measurement and experiment result, it shows that mass loss for specimens with sensitization treatments is higher than mass loss for specimens without sensitization treatment. The experimental result also indicates that SCC occurs only at certain concentration mixtures of sulphuric acid and sodium chloride. This was confirmed by using scanning electron microscope and digital weighing balance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand and develop procedures for the use of the AISC 2005 Specification's Direct Analysis Method for the analysis and design of heavy-industry industrial structures, to layout a systematic approach for the engineer to analyze and design using this method, and to determine if there will be any consequences to the practicing engineer in using this method. The relevant 13 th Edition AISC stability analysis methods (Effective Length,First-Order, and Direct Analysis Methods) were researched in the 2005 Specification aswell as in available technical literature, and then were critically evaluated by their applicability and limitations. This study will help serve as a guide for the systematic approach for the practicing engineer to apply this method to analyze and design such complex steel frame structures using the computer-aided software called GTSTRUDL. To accomplish this purpose, two analytical models were studied using the Direct Analysis Method. The first model was a simple industrial structure and the second model was a more complex <b>nuclear</b> power plant <b>boiler</b> building. M. S.
