Certain wavelengths in the visible and <b>near-visible</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{are known to have}} discrete effects on plant growth and development, and the effects of red, far-red, blue, and ultraviolet light have been well described. In this report, an effect of green light on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) rosette architecture is demonstrated using a narrow-bandwidth light-emitting diode-based lighting system. When green light was added to a background of constant red and blue light, plants exhibited elongation of petioles and upward leaf reorientation, symptoms consistent with those observed in a shaded light environment. The same green light-induced phenotypes were also observed in phytochrome (phy) and cryptochrome (cry) mutant backgrounds. To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the green light-induced response, the accumulation of shade-induced transcripts was measured in response to enriched green light environments. Transcripts that have been demonstrated to increase in abundance under far-red-induced shade avoidance conditions either decrease or exhibit no change when green light is added. However, normal far-red light-associated transcript accumulation patterns are observed in cryptochrome mutants grown with supplemental green light, indicating that the green-absorbing form of cryptochrome is the photoreceptor active in limiting the green light induction of shade-associated transcripts. These results indicate that shade symptoms can be induced by the addition of green light and that cryptochrome receptors and an unknown light sensor participate in acclimation to the enriched green environment...|$|E
40|$|With {{the success}} of the Hubble Space Telescope, it has become {{apparent}} that new frontiers of science and discovery are made every time an improvement in imaging resolution is made. For the HST working primarily in the visible and <b>near-visible</b> <b>spectrum,</b> this meant designing, building and launching a primary mirror approximately three meters in diameter. Conventional thinking tells us that accomplishing a comparable improvement in resolution at longer wavelengths for Earth and Space Science applications requires a corresponding increase {{in the size of the}} primary mirror. For wavelengths in the sub-millimeter range, a very large telescope with an effective aperture in excess of one kilometer in diameter would be needed to obtain high quality angular resolution. Realistically a single aperture this large is practically impossible. Fortunately such large apertures can be constructed synthetically. Possibly as few as three 3 - 4 meter diameter mirrors flying in precision formation could be used to collect light at these longer wavelengths permitting not only very large virtual aperture science to be carried out, but high-resolution interferometry as well. To ensure the longest possible mission duration, a system of tethered spacecraft will be needed to mitigate the need for a great deal of propellant. A spin-stabilized, tethered formation will likely meet these requirements. Several configurations have been proposed which possibly meet the needs of the Space Science community. This paper discusses two of them, weighing the relative pros and cons of each concept. The ultimate goal being to settle on a configuration which combines the best features of structure, tethers and formation flying to meet the ambitious requirements necessary to make future large synthetic aperture and interferometric science missions successful...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{demonstrate}} novel methods to overcome optical scattering {{in order to}} resolve information about hidden scenes, in particular for biomedical applications. Imaging through scattering media {{has long been a}} challenge, as scattering corrupts scenes in a non-invertible way. The use of <b>near-visible</b> optical <b>spectrum</b> for biomedical purposes has many advantages, such as optical contrast, optical resolution and nonionizing radiation. Particularly, it has important applications in biomedical imaging, such as sub-dermal imaging for diagnostics, screening and monitoring conditions. We demonstrate methods to overcome and use scattering in order to recover scene parameters. In particular we demonstrate a method for locating and classifying fluorescent markers hidden behind turbid layers using ultrafast time-resolved measurements with a sparse-based optimization framework. This novel method has applications in remote sensing and in-vivo fluorescence lifetime imaging. Another method is demonstrated to resolve blood flow speed within skin tissue. This method is based on a computational photography technique and coherent illumination. This method can be applied in diagnosis and monitoring of burns, wounds, prostheses and cosmetics. A particularly important application of this technology is analysis of diabetic ulcers, which is the main cause for non-traumatic amputations in India. The suggested prototype is suitable for assisting clinicians in assessing the wound healing process. The methods developed in this thesis using ultrafast time-resolved measurements, sparsity-based optimization and computational photography can spur research and applications in biomedical imaging, skin conditions diagnosis and more general modalities of imaging through scattering media. by Guy Satat.

40|$|The {{development}} of a highly integrated optical biosensor is expected to significantly impact on the performances and on the throughput of biochemical assays, with applications {{in the field of}} pharmaceutical research, point-of-care diagnostic, food-borne pathogens screening and safety. This dissertation studies the {{development of}} a label-free on-chip biosensor for the selective detection of Aflatoxin-M 1 from milk content. We detail the design and the realization of two types of multiplexed sensors. They are based on the silicon photonics technology and operates in liquid ambient at wavelengths in the <b>near-visible</b> and near-infrared <b>spectra.</b> Most of this work is focused on the first type of sensor,which is based on a whispering-gallery-mode resonator. In particular, we analyze microdisk, microring and wedge resonator structures, studying the sensitivity and the quality factor of each. The appeal of these structure is given by the low detection limit that can be achieved in a footprint of few tens of microns per side. The second sensor type is based on a spectrally resolved asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In this case, the high level of folding permitted by the use of high refractive-index-contrast materials enables the fabrication of sensitive interferometers in a reasonable footprint. The experimental characterization of the bulk refractometric sensing of the devices is performed in continuous flow, using a dedicated microfluidic flow-cell in PDMS. This characterization assesses the high resolution of both device types, which are able to resolve variations in the refractive index of the liquids with a limit of detection down to 10 ^- 6 refractive index units (RIU). The selective superficial sensing is also evaluated, implementing a biorecognition functional layer with DNA-aptamers. The assay of buffered solutions containing Aflatoxin-M 1 molecules confirms that the devices under test are suitable biosensors, with specific detection limits down to about 100 pg/ml for the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and slightly larger for the microring resonator. A procedure for the regeneration of the sensor has been optimized, enabling reproducible sensing up to nine times. The detection of the receptor-ligand binding in real-time enabled the study of the kinetics of the binding reaction, and we measured {{for the first time the}} kinetic rate constants of the antiaflatoxin aptamers of our sensors...|$|R
