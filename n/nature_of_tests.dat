30|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that tests are not innocent, neutral, value-free instruments designed to objectively reflect the knowledge, skill, or ability in the test taker (McNamara and Roever 2006). Shohamy (2001, 2014) has warned against surrendering {{to the power of}} tests because of their psychometric, mathematical guise. In fact, it was this recognition of the powerful, political <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> that led Messick (1996) to propose his of-cited unified validity framework, according to which social values and consequences are to be counted as validity evidence or lack thereof, provided that there is substantial evidence linking the consequences to the test. Messick furnished scholars with a theoretical aid to study the relationships between tests and their social and educational impacts. However, the relationship has increasingly proved to be complex, messy, and multifaceted (Alderson and Hamp-Lyons 1996; Wall and Alderson 1993; Watanabe 2004).|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the absence}} of data {{concerning}} the understanding and experience of families in which one or more members have undergone predictive genetic testing, a pilot study using a qualitative methodology was conducted with members of families at risk for the late-onset genetic disease, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Semistructured interviews were conducted to elicit illness representations, with responses tape-recorded and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Several themes emerged. The most striking was that when genetic testing indicated an extremely low risk of developing the disease, there was a desire to continue regular bowel screening, even though it was experienced as extremely aversive. Possible explanations draw upon both other themes of the interviews, and psychological models.

40|$|The way categories, labels, and {{taxonomies}} {{are used}} depends upon national ideologies and nationally specific conceptions {{of citizenship and}} normality. Ethnicity, differences, disability and deviance are social constructions. Underachievement or overachievement in social (cognitive) performance or overrepresentation in special educational placements of certain groups of students is as much the product of categorisation or definitional processes {{as it is the}} workings of institutional procedures, patterns, and intransigence. In particular (Vocational), schools’ inability to accommodate difference and diversity causes exclusion and alienation. Globalisation and hegemonic neo-liberal ideology make it difficult to create a genuinely inclusive society, to produce complete citizens, and to promote equity. This study analyses the placement of ethnic minority students in special education programmes. It begins with a review of empirical reports that problematise the phenomenon of overrepresentation of students with immigrant background in special schools for intellectually disabled students. The analysis that follows is conducted through the prism of a number of perspectives, including sociocultural/historical theory, the inclusive education movement, multicultural education, and critical pedagogical theories. While {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that such overrepresentation is nationwide, the phenomenon can be identified in large cities where there are concentrations of immigrants. Analysis demonstrates that the problem is related to, among other factors, unreliable assessment procedures and criteria for referral and placement; lack of culturally sensitive diagnostic tools; the static <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> including embedded cultural bias; sociocultural problems, family factors, and language problems; lack of parental participation in decision-making; power differentials between parents and school authorities; institutional intransigence and prejudices; and large resource inequalities that run along lines of race and class.

40|$|Semiconductor {{manufacturers}} {{must ensure}} that chips conform to their specifications before they are shipped to customers. This is achieved by testing various parameters of a chip {{to determine whether it}} is defective or not. Separating defective chips from fault-free ones is relatively straightforward for functional or other Boolean tests that produce a go/no-go type of result. However, making this distinction is extremely challenging for parametric tests. Owing to continuous distributions of parameters, any pass/fail threshold results in yield loss and/or test escapes. The continuous advances in process technology, increased process variations and inaccurate fault models all make this even worse. The pass/fail thresholds for such tests are usually set using prior experience or by a combination of visual inspection and engineering judgment. Many chips have parameters that exceed certain thresholds but pass Boolean tests. Owing to the imperfect <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests,</b> to determine whether these chips (called "outliers") are indeed defective is nontrivial. To avoid wasted investment in packaging or further testing it is important to screen defective chips early in a test flow. Moreover, if seemingly strange behavior of outlier chips can be explained with the help of certain process parameters or by correlating additional test data, such chips can be retained in the test flow before they are proved to be fatally flawed. In this research, we investigate several methods to identify true outliers (defective chips, or chips that lead to functional failure) from apparent outliers (seemingly defective, but fault-free chips). The outlier identification methods in this research primarily rely on wafer-level spatial correlation, but also use additional test parameters. These methods are evaluated and validated using industrial test data. The potential of these methods to reduce burn-in is discussed...|$|E

Immersion suits are certified to both national and international standards; some of which require the thermal protective properties to be tested using humans or thermal manikins. The ethical <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> with humans has been questioned [1] due to the physically grueling <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> these <b>tests,</b> thus testing with manikins may be preferential.

40|$|In 2010, I was {{seconded}} from {{my classroom}} teaching position {{to work as}} a facilitator in the implementation of the newly-established National Standards. In this role, I ran in-depth Literacy and Assessment workshops in schools. I found that despite the national effort to close the gap between achievers and non- achievers, schools are still faced with the issue of most Samoan students not doing well as they should be, especially in the area of literacy. Assessment procedures from which such data is derived are widely researched in New Zealand and abroad. In spite of the numerous studies conducted on literacy assessment, none has ever been done to critically analyse the linguistic nature of these literacy assessment tools; yet these tools and their implementation may well contribute to the phenomenon of underachievement among Samoan students in New Zealand. Thus the aim of this inquiry was to open up the practice of standardised reading tests to examination. This thesis examines unacknowledged issues {{in the design of the}} standardised reading tests by which students are assessed in multicultural contexts. A Samoan critical approach was adopted specifically for this research: ‘Tofā'a'anolasi’, which draws on Foucault’s analytical tool box to counter-read tests texts and practices, including the way achievement data is managed and applied. Tofā'a'anolasi is based on my interpretation of Foucault’s ideas about power, knowledge and language in society, and how these ideas are useful in educational research undertaken from a Samoan perspective. This research framework is used to examine assumptions within and about assessment practice, particularly as it pertains to Samoan students in New Zealand. This thesis shows how the normalising hegemonic nature of assessment has profoundly disadvantaged Samoan students. This study includes critical discourse analysis of selected standardised reading testing tools in New Zealand primary schools. For this work, two reading test papers routinely used throughout New Zealand to assess the reading knowledge and skills of Year 7 and 8 students were analysed and critiqued. I also gathered stories from teachers as assessment administrators and Samoan students as assessment takers. Through focus group conversations, these assessment participants shared their own understandings and critiques of assessments. Moreover, I communicated with three key informants, who are also experts in the area of New Zealand primary school literacy assessments about the two standardised tests examined in thesis. Their stories are included in this research thesis. The analysis of the findings reveals serious mismatches between the language, culture, knowledge, experience and interests most of the Samoan students bring into the testing context, and those expected to succeed in the standardised tests. These discrepancies cause students confusion and dismay. The analysis also reveals the predominantly male oriented <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> contents and administration. In this thesis, I argue that the male orientation of tests affects some Samoan students in two ways. First, the assumption of male superiority (and female inferiority) is in direct contrast with the Samoan culture of ‘feagaiga’, or the sacred covenant and deep respect Samoan brothers hold for their sisters. Second, the male and female themed <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> contents rely on a male/female binary within tests which tends to exclude third gender, for instance, the Samoan fa'afafine. In this thesis, the three emerging themes of linguistic bias, cultural bias and gender bias are presented with examples from the tests examined. The review of the literature reveals that standardised assessment is a governmental practice; its processes are constructed within historical and cultural notions of what is normal and what is not. This categorisation bolsters the unquestioned power of assessment to regulate its subjects as governable individuals. The power of assessment causes particular behaviours, such as teachers teaching the content knowledge to suit the purposes of the state for the students to learn. The contribution of this study lies in highlighting issues that are taken for granted in the design and practice of standardised reading tests in New Zealand primary schools. These issues include sometimes the inescapable biases in the standardised reading test papers, in terms of how their language, content and presentations of gender and ethnicity work against a marginalised student population such as Samoans living in New Zealand...|$|E
