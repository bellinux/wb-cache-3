5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they <b>need.</b> <b>Their</b> small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E
5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they <b>need</b> <b>their</b> own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals <b>need</b> <b>their</b> patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, the Center for Naval Analyses {{released}} a report on U.S. small arms in combat. The CNA conducted surveys on 2,608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 12 months. Only troops who fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate. 341 troops were armed with M249 SAWs, making up 13 percent of the survey. 71 percent of M249 users (242 troops) {{reported that they were}} satisfied with the weapon. 40 percent of users preferred feeding the SAW with the soft 100-round pouch, while 21 percent chose the soft and hard 200-round pouches each. 60 percent (205 troops) were satisfied with handling qualities, such as handguards, size, and weight - of those dissatisfied, just under half thought that it was too heavy. M249 users had the lowest levels of satisfaction with weapon maintainability at 70 percent (239 troops), most due to the difficulty in removing and receiving small components and poor corrosion resistance. The SAW had the highest levels of stoppages at 30 percent (102 troops), and 41 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had a large impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. 65 percent (222 troops) did not <b>need</b> <b>their</b> machine guns repaired while in theater. 65 percent (222 troops) were confident in the M249's reliability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 64 percent (218 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance. 60 percent of M249 users offered recommendations for improvements. 17 percent of requests were for making the weapon lighter, and another 17 percent were for more durable belt links and drums, as well as other modifications, such as a collapsible stock.|$|E
25|$|Kleptogamy {{is a good}} {{strategy}} in many ways. First, the sneakers do not <b>need</b> <b>their</b> own territories, indicating {{that they do not}} need to spend energy in protecting territories, as most other males do. Most male gobies <b>need</b> <b>their</b> own territories, since females do not choose to mate with a male that does not own his own territory. Secondly, the sneakers do not provide parental care to their eggs. The paired males provide parental care instead of the sneakers. Therefore, the sneakers can save energy, and they can put more effort into finding new targets for cheating.|$|E

25|$|The {{school year}} starts {{after the summer break}} (different {{from state to}} state, usually end/mid of August) and is divided into two terms. There are {{typically}} 12 weeks of holidays in addition to public holidays. Exact dates differ between states, but there are generally six weeks of summer and two weeks of Christmas holiday. The other holiday periods occur in spring (during the period around Easter Sunday) and autumn (during the former harvest, where farmers used to <b>need</b> <b>their</b> children for field work). Schools can also schedule two or three special days off per term.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{school fees}} for grades 1 to 10 were officially {{abolished}} but hidden costs remained. Other costs include loss of children's wages or unpaid labour for agriculture, tending livestock or housework. Whether children work depends on relative household wealth. Labour-intensive assets such as farms can hire labour if they generate sufficient profit but poorer households may <b>need</b> <b>their</b> children {{to help with}} these assets. This can relate to family size, with larger families sending their younger children to school because older children can help their parents. Attendance is reduced when children have to travel long distances to school since this increases personal risk and transport costs. There are also cultural attitudes against educating girls since education will only benefit her husband's household.|$|E
25|$|The army is decimated, {{leaving a}} {{demoralized}} Connacht planning {{to return to}} Gower. However, he is prevented by Damas and Myrdred, who suggests they find Mazzarin. Legend claims Bahl'al killed Mazzarin centuries ago, but Myrdred believes him to be still living. The trio {{set out to find}} him, accompanied by Ravanna, a Myrmidon warrior. Entering his crypt, Mazzarin is initially uninterested in helping them. However, impressed by Connacht, he transfers his knowledge of the Total Codex, a book that tells of future events, into Connacht's mind. In Llancarfan, Connacht speaks to the dwarven Smiths of Muirthemne about creating a magical device that could imprison infinite enemies. Forgemaster Traval says they can make it, but they <b>need</b> <b>their</b> tome of building from Myrgard, which is currently under siege by Ghôls. Connacht leads an army to lift the siege, annihilating the Ghôls. The Dwarves form an alliance with humanity, and give Connacht the tome. In Llancarfan, the Smiths build Connacht a Tain; a small magical device containing a pocket universe of limitless capacity, capable of sweeping an infinite number of enemies inside it. With the Tain in hand, Connacht and a small contingent of men head to the Dire Marsh, and wipe out the Myrkirida.|$|E

500|$|In May 2014, Night Dive Studios, a {{publisher}} of classic PC titles, filed trademarks for [...] "No One Lives Forever", [...] "The Operative", [...] "A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way", and [...] "Contract J.A.C.K.", Night Dive {{had also been}} able to acquire the source code for the games, which {{would enable them to}} remaster them for modern computer systems. However, Night Dive had yet to comment on the situation regarding who owned the rights to the game. At this point, the rights to the series was unclear, as the property may have been owned solely or in part by 20th Century Fox (which owned Fox Interactive {{at the time of the}} game's release), Activision (which acquired and merged with Vivendi Games, which in turn was the parent to Sierra Entertainment, the publisher of No One Lives Forever 2, and had acquired Fox Interactive in 2003), and Warner Bros. (which acquired Monolith Productions). Warner Bros. did file opposition to Night Dive's trademark, leading Night Dive to try to seek a license arrangement. However, Warner Bros. represented were concerned that if either Fox or Activision had a part of the owernship, that they would also <b>need</b> <b>their</b> approval. Night Dive attempted to work with Fox and Activision to search their archives, but as these transitions pre-dated computerized records, neither company wanted to do so. Night Dive's efforts were further stalled when they were told by Warner Bros. that they had no interest in partnering or licensing the IP, leading Night Dive to abandon their efforts to acquire the rights.|$|E

500|$|Most {{people who}} {{move across the}} border are women and girls. [...] The {{migration}} of Haitian women to the Dominican Republic is intrinsically linked to the “feminization of migrations” which is in turn part of the “new Haitian immigration,” brought about by changes in labor markets {{as well as by}} the fragile situation of women and their families in Haiti. Women migrants are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking, violence and illicit smuggling. [...] When attempting to cross the border, Haitian women are at risk of being robbed, assaulted, raped and murdered, at the hands of smugglers, delinquents and traffickers, both Dominican and Haitian. Given this threat of violence, women turn to alternative, unofficial routes and dependence upon hired buscones (informal scouts), cousins and other distant family to accompany them across the border. These hired smugglers who have promised to help them, often through force and coercion, trick them instead into forced domestic labor in private homes in Santo Domingo, the capital of Dominican Republic. [...] Hired buscones also sell women and children into the sex slave trade within the Dominican Republic (brothels and other venues) or into sexual slavery as an export. Often, mothers <b>need</b> <b>their</b> young children to help provide for the family, which puts the children in vulnerable positions and allows them to fall prey to predators and traffickers. The number of children smuggled into the Dominican Republic is not known, but a UNICEF estimate placed the number at 2,000 in 2009 alone. [...] Haitian officials report that there are three main fates met by children trafficked out of Haiti: domestic work, prostitution, and organ harvesting.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season, Bertuzzi {{appeared in}} his first NHL All-Star Game. He was joined by fellow Canucks Markus Näslund, defenceman Ed Jovanovski and head coach Marc Crawford, helping the Western Conference to a 6–5 shootout win against the East. He played on a line with Näslund and Peter Forsberg. Later in the season, he notched his third career hat trick on March 17, 2003, scoring three goals against Ron Tugnutt {{in a game against}} the Dallas Stars. He finished the season with career-highs of 46 goals (third in the league), 51 assists and 97 points (fifth in the league). His 25 power play goals led the league and tied Pavel Bure for the Canucks single-season record. Linemates Näslund and Morrison also recorded personal bests with 104 and 71 points, respectively. Meanwhile, the Canucks emerged as a top team in the West. Losing the Northwest Division title to the Avalanche by one point in the regular season, they finished as the fourth seed in their conference. After going down three-games-to-one in the opening round against the St. Louis Blues, Vancouver won three straight games to advance to the second round. Facing the Minnesota Wild, the Canucks gave up their own three-games-to-one series lead and were eliminated in seven games. During the series, Bertuzzi had reportedly walked by the Xcel Energy Center box office and told Wild fans they would not <b>need</b> <b>their</b> Game 6 tickets because Minnesota would be eliminated by then. In another on-ice incident, he skated by the opposing bench during Game 7 when the Canucks were winning 2–0, telling Wild players to [...] "get [...] golf clubs." [...] Despite his successful regular season, Bertuzzi struggled to score in the playoffs, recording 6 points in 14 games. In the off-season, Bertuzzi was named with Näslund to the NHL First All-Star Team.|$|E
