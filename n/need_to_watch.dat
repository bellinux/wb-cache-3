5|$|The {{character}} of Samson, the diminutive co-manager of the carnival, sets up each {{season with a}} monologue, giving glimpses of the show's complex story and good-versus-evil mythology. By telling the story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, Carnivàle is a demanding show {{with a lot of}} subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> episodes of Carnivàle in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little or too much story information. Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s. Carnivàle received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including fifteen Emmy nominations with five wins.|$|E
500|$|The character's {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed. Upon DeGarmo joining the show, Luke Kerr of Zap2It was not receptive of the character's concept. He compared her to Snooki {{of the reality}} television series Jersey Shore {{and said that the}} show has fallen under Jersey Shores [...] "drunken spell". He wrote: [...] "Regardless of who portrayed the character—because I have absolutely nothing against DeGarmo—why does Y need yet another big name stunt cast?" [...] Additionally, he said: [...] "every time I read something about the new character I find myself asking myself why, just why?" [...] DeGarmo said: [...] "Angelina nor I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> ‘Jersey Shore’ for pointers. But we are fans. Definitely Snooki is someone we look up to." ...|$|E
500|$|Christensen {{believed}} that Odinism was the ideal {{tool for the}} advancement of Aryan racial consciousness, expressing her opinion that the Jewish-controlled establishment would not permit her to do it a more explicit way, stating that [...] "You cannot repeat the mistake that Hitler made ... Everybody knows that the Jews rule the whole damned world, so you cannot fight their combined power. You <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> your step." [...] A number of The Odinists readers wrote letters to the magazine expressing disapproval of what they perceived as the editors' support of Nazism, to which Christensen publicly responded that such accusations were [...] "the cheapest of all shots that can be aimed against anyone who finds something positive to say about... National Socialism... or who merely desires some degree of objectivity in dealing with this grossly maligned movement." ...|$|E

500|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{said they}} wanted the general {{audience}} to like the film {{as much as the}} fans, by stripping away [...] "Treknobabble", making it action-packed and giving it the simple title of Star Trek to indicate to newcomers they would not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> any of the other films. Abrams saw humor and sex appeal as two integral and popular elements of the show that needed to be maintained. Orci stated being realistic and being serious were not the same thing. Abrams, Burk, Lindelof, Orci and Kurtzman were fans of The Wrath of Khan, and also cited The Next Generation episode [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] as an influence. Abrams' wife Katie was regularly consulted on the script, as were Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof's wives, to make the female characters as strong as possible. Katie Abrams' approval of the strong female characters was partly why Abrams signed on to direct.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} what {{video game}} review score aggregator Metacritic described as [...] "universal acclaim", with a 92% rating based on 19 reviews. Eurogamer and TouchArcade awarded the game perfect scores, {{with the latter}} calling Threes [...] "about as close as it gets to a perfect mobile game". It was an honorable mention in the 2014 Independent Games Festival's Excellence in Design category. The game {{reached the top of}} the Apple App Store paid app sales chart shortly after its release. Re/code reported that it [...] "dominated" [...] the chart in the following weeks and became one of the 25 highest grossing apps on the App Store. It later won a 2014 Apple Design Award and was named Apple's best iPhone game of 2014. Reviewers found the game [...] "charming" [...] and [...] "addictive". They compared the game with the luck of Drop7, the challenge of Stickets, and the [...] "match-by-combining" [...] mechanics in Triple Town. Reviewers also praised the simplicity of the tutorial and noted how their attention on combining large number tiles contrasted with their <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the board's movements as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News praised Kim Possible as [...] "an {{entertaining}} {{show that}} should indeed appeal to tweens, younger kids {{and even their}} parents" [...] that [...] "plays with the superhero format {{in a way that}} doesn't take itself too seriously but doesn't play down to the viewers." [...] Tracy McLoone of PopMatters reviewed, [...] "Kim Possible includes adult-friendly humor, in the event that parents feel the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> tv (sic) with their kids. But nobody in or watching the series will ever be offended or over-stimulated, or even surprised." [...] While accepting main character Kim as a positive role model and acknowledging that the series sometimes teaches [...] "good lessons", Besty Wallace of Common Sense Media expressed concern about the show's emphasis on action and violence, explaining, [...] "lessons may get muddled and nearly lost as the heroes shimmy up rope ladders dangling from helicopters and dodge spinning tops of doom. As long as you're not expecting too {{much in the way of}} educational value, you'll probably have plenty of fun with this one." [...] Writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller opined, [...] "Ultimately, Kim Possible was just a solid show. It didn't skimp on plot or dialogue in favor of Wile E. Coyote explosions, and its tongue-in-cheek humor allowed it to be self-aware and hip at the same time." [...] Conversely, Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls author Lyn Mikel Brown was less receptive towards Kim herself, criticizing the show for promoting the beautiful and thin heroine as [...] "your basic average girl" [...] and apparent reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the fact that her [...] "biggest threat" [...] is Bonnie as opposed to evil. According to Brown, [...] "Being the kind of girl who's accepted or befriended by boys underscores a girl's power and sets her against other girls." ...|$|E

He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope.
