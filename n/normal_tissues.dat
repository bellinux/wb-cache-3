Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

40|$|PURPOSE: Radiotherapy {{is a very}} {{effective}} adjuvant treatment for rectal cancer with little side effects. Its killing effect on tumor cells {{seems to be more}} profound than the effect on <b>normal</b> <b>tissue.</b> The molecular events caused by irradiation are mainly analyzed in in vitro and animal models; investigations on human material are rare. In the current study, we analyzed the effects of irradiation on gene expression in <b>normal</b> and tumor <b>tissue</b> of rectal cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: <b>Normal</b> and carcinoma <b>tissue</b> of patients from a randomized clinical trial of the benefits of preoperative radiotherapy were analyzed using the Affymetrix Human Cancer Gene Chip. Preoperative radiotherapy was given within 5 days prior to surgery. Results for <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> and tumor were compared to investigate the radiation-related differences between normal and tumor cells. We clustered the differentially expressed genes based on their functional annotation. Results were compared with immunohistochemical and literature data. RESULTS: The majority of the investigated cancer-related genes remained unchanged by irradiation (92 % in tumor tissue and 93 % in <b>normal</b> <b>tissue).</b> The differentially expressed genes varied between tumor and <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> except for maspin and IL- 8. Both in tumor and <b>normal</b> <b>tissue,</b> differentially expressed genes were present related to cell signaling and cycle control, apoptosis and cell survival and tissue response and repair. However, the spectrum of affected genes was totally different. CONCLUSION: Pre-existing differences in gene expression between <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> and tumor tissue might explain the differences in their responses to radiation. This change in response may explain the clinical beneficial effect of radiotherapy on tumor cells (low local recurrence rate) and the less severe effects on <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> (minor side effects) ...|$|R

25|$|Blood {{vessels in}} tumors are very {{different}} from those seen in <b>normal</b> <b>tissues.</b> As a tumor grows, tumor cells furthest away from the blood vessels become low in oxygen (hypoxic). To counteract this they then signal for new blood vessels to grow. The newly formed tumor vasculature is poorly formed and does not deliver an adequate blood supply to all areas of the tumor. This leads to issues with drug delivery because many drugs will be delivered to the tumor by the circulatory system.|$|E

25|$|Intensity-modulated {{radiation}} therapy (IMRT) is an advanced type of high-precision radiation {{that is the}} next generation of 3DCRT. IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes, for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel. Computer-controlled x-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor. The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform optimization and treatment simulation (Treatment Planning). The radiation dose is consistent with the 3-D shape of the tumor by controlling, or modulating, the radiation beam’s intensity. The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> is decreased or avoided completely. This results in better tumor targeting, lessened side effects, and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.|$|E

25|$|HMGA2 protein {{specifically}} targets the {{promoter of}} ERCC1, thus reducing expression of this DNA repair gene. ERCC1 protein expression was deficient in 100% of 47 evaluated colon cancers (though {{the extent to}} which HGMA2 was involved is not known). A 2012 study showed that in <b>normal</b> <b>tissues,</b> HGMA1 and HMGA2 genes are targeted (and thus strongly reduced in expression) by miR-15, miR-16, miR-26a, miR-196a2 and Let-7a. However, each of these HMGA-targeting miRNAs are drastically reduced in almost all human pituitary adenomas studied, when compared with the normal pituitary gland. Consistent with the down-regulation of these HMGA-targeting miRNAs, an increase in the HMGA1 and HMGA2-specific mRNAs was observed. Three of these microRNAs (miR-16, miR-196a and Let-7a) have methylated promoters and therefore low expression in colon cancer. For two of these, miR-15 and miR-16, the coding regions are epigenetically silenced in cancer due to histone deacetylase activity. When these microRNAs are expressed at a low level, then HMGA1 and HMGA2 proteins are expressed at a high level. HMGA1 and HMGA2 target (reduce expression of) BRCA1 and ERCC1 DNA repair genes. Thus DNA repair can be reduced, likely contributing to cancer progression.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in <b>normal</b> <b>tissues</b> and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E

Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT), a spatially fractionated photon radiotherapy is currently tested at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) to improve <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> protection. MRT utilizes an array of microscopically thin and nearly parallel X-ray beams that are generated by a synchrotron. At the ion microprobe SNAKE in Munich focused proton microbeams (“proton microchannels”) are studied to improve <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> protection. Here, we comparatively investigate microbeam/microchannel irradiations with sub-millimetre X-ray versus proton beams to minimize the risk of <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> damage in a human skin model, in vitro. Skin tissues were irradiated with a mean dose of 2  Gy over the irradiated area either with parallel synchrotron-generated X-ray beams at the ESRF or with 20  MeV protons at SNAKE using four different irradiation modes: homogeneous field, parallel lines and microchannel applications using two different channel sizes. <b>Normal</b> <b>tissue</b> viability as determined in an MTT test was significantly higher after proton or X-ray microchannel irradiation compared to a homogeneous field irradiation. In line with these findings genetic damage, as determined by the measurement of micronuclei in keratinocytes, was significantly reduced after proton or X-ray microchannel compared to a homogeneous field irradiation. Our data show that skin irradiation using either X-ray or proton microchannels maintain a higher cell viability and DNA integrity compared to a homogeneous irradiation, and thus might improve <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> protection after radiation therapy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{tests are}} {{available}} to predict breast cancer recurrence and to guide clinical decision making. These predictors provide recurrence risk scores along {{with a measure of}} uncertainty, usually a confidence interval. The confidence interval conveys random error and not systematic bias. Standard tumor sampling methods make this problematic, as it is common to have a substantial proportion (typically 30 - 50 %) of a tumor sample comprised of histologically benign tissue. This "normal" tissue could represent a source of non-random error or systematic bias in genomic classification. Methods To assess the performance characteristics of genomic classification to systematic error from normal contamination, we collected 55 tumor samples and paired tumor-adjacent <b>normal</b> <b>tissue.</b> Using genomic signatures from the tumor and paired normal, we evaluated how increasing normal contamination altered recurrence risk scores for various genomic predictors. Results Simulations of <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> contamination caused misclassification of tumors in all predictors evaluated, but different breast cancer predictors showed different types of vulnerability to <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> bias. While two predictors had unpredictable direction of bias (either higher or lower risk of relapse resulted from normal contamination), one signature showed predictable direction of <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> effects. Due to this predictable direction of effect, this signature (the PAM 50) was adjusted for <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> contamination and these corrections improved sensitivity and negative predictive value. For all three assays quality control standards and/or appropriate bias adjustment strategies can be used to improve assay reliability. Conclusions <b>Normal</b> <b>tissue</b> sampled concurrently with tumor is an important source of bias in breast genomic predictors. All genomic predictors show some sensitivity to <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> contamination and ideal strategies for mitigating this bias vary depending upon the particular genes and computational methods used in the predictor. </p...|$|R

One day after i. p. injection of hematoporphyrin derivative (15 mg/kg), chambers {{were exposed to}} red light (632 +/- 2 nm, eight light dose values, 0 to 270 J/cm 2). After an initial blanching (ischemia) of the tumor accompanied by apparent vasoconstriction, reperfusion was observed with a slowing down of the tumor circulation, vasodilatation, and eventually a complete stasis, together with diffuse hemorrhages and subsequent necrosis. Besides, in large <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> vessels, platelet aggregates were observed, but no hemorrhage. Tumor regrowth occurred unless the tumor circulation and the adjacent <b>normal</b> <b>tissue</b> circulation were both destroyed. Tumor cell viability after treatment was assessed by transplanting the tumor from the chamber into the flank of the same animal. Even after a combined porphyrin and light dose 4 times the lethal dose for all tissues in the chamber, five of five transplanted tumors did regrow. This leads to the conclusion that, in our model system, tumor cell death after photoradiation occurs secondary to destruction of the microcirculation.
