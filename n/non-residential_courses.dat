50|$|The college {{opened on}} 25 January 1874. It was {{also known as}} Scholae Cancellarii. The {{building}} it occupied on Drury Lane, which was originally the county infirmary, closed in 1995 after having its permit as a college recognised for ordination training withdrawn by the Church of England owing to reduced numbers of residential ordination candidates nationally, with an increasing number training on part-time <b>non-residential</b> <b>courses.</b> The college had wanted to remain open, developing itself as a research institution, possibly affiliated to a nearby university. The buildings are now owned by the Lincoln Theological Institute for the Study of Religion and Society (a registered charity), based at the University of Manchester, established in 1997 by Martyn Percy.|$|E
50|$|Malham Tarn is a glacial lake {{near the}} village of Malham in the Yorkshire Dales, England. The lake is one of only eight upland {{alkaline}} lakes in Europe. At an altitude of 377 m above sea level it is the highest marl lake in the United Kingdom. Its geology, flora and fauna have led to it being listed under a number of conservation designations. The site is currently owned by the National Trust, who lease part of the site to the Field Studies Council who offer residential and <b>non-residential</b> field <b>courses</b> there. The site was the inspiration for Charles Kingsley's 1863 novel, The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby.|$|R

40|$|The basic {{questions}} {{addressed by the}} thesis {{are concerned with the}} nature of the ordained ministry of the Church of England as it approaches the twenty first century and what educational provisions are required to prepare and sustain that ministry. Following an introduction, which outlines in detail the methodology of the thesis and the specific terms of reference for the study, the various strands which suggest the constants of ministerial being and function are traced from the New Testament evidence through Church History. The exploration identifies the influences which shaped the ordained ministry and provided it with variable roles and identity within its changing historical context. The specific terms of its being and the functions of oversight, pastoralia and teaching were retained as traditional constants within ministerial formation. The New Testament evidence gives attention to the relationship between discipleship and the Rabbinical teaching tradition as the basis for Apostolic ministry. The emerging structure of ministerial forms is identified by comparing the earliest with the latest of the New Testament documents. The investigation into Church History isolates three periods which are considered to be germane to the study. The first is the rise of Christianity within the multi-racial, cultural and religious Roman world. The second period looks at the medieval Church in England and how it educationally managed its resources in terms of its personnel and parochial provision. Thirdly, the study looks at the Victorian Church {{as an example of how}} ministerial change was organised and as the Church which left the present Church of England its immediate legacy. The thesis then examines the current provision of theological preparation for the ordained ministry which is offered in the residential theological colleges and <b>non-residential</b> training <b>courses.</b> A critique of this provision is offered along with an analysis of the educational features which can be found within it. The investigation continues with an examination of post-ordination training and continuing ministerial education. In the concluding chapter, a summary is provided about the main findings of the thesis and the principles of educational reform are identified. This leads to the construction of a new pattern of educational training for and within ministry based upon a continuum principle and one that is related closely to the changing parochial context...|$|R
40|$|Background: Safe Male Circumcision (SMC) is {{a proven}} {{approach}} for partial protection of men from acquisition of HIV infection. Several sub-Saharan African countries have a target to circumcise 80 % of males aged 15 to 49. The use of {{devices such as}} PrePex would aid scaling up of SMC. Since most health workers would have no prior experience with use of devices, skills training is needed. This paper explores a skills transfer model at an urban site in Uganda. Objective: To assess the practicability and feasibility of rapid short duration training for safe PrePex device use. Methods: A prospective study, conducted over 8 weeks (August–October 2012) at International Hospital Kampala, an urban Kampala hospital, examining the performance of various health worker cadres after training {{in the use of}} a non-surgical device (PrePex). The prospective study obtained approval from the Makerere School of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology. If eligible, and after the subject signed the informed consent form, they were enrolled into the study. Results: Ten health workers were successfully trained in use of PrePex during a 3 day <b>non-residential</b> on-the-job training <b>course.</b> After the first three days of training, the trained health workers performed 561 placements and 529 device removals successfully. Over all adverse events (AE) rates were below # 2 %; however, there were some differences in AE rates across the cadres trained but not significant (p. 0. 25 for moderate AEs) ...|$|R
