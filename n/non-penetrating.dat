5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, <b>non-penetrating</b> head injury, {{intoxication}} or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E

40|$|Triticale is the {{intergeneric}} hybrid between {{wheat and}} rye. With {{the expansion of}} the triticale growing area, powdery mildew has emerged and become a significant disease on this new host. Recent research demonstrated that this new' powdery mildew on triticale has emerged through a host range expansion of powdery mildew of wheat. Moreover, isolates sampled from triticale still infect their previous host, wheat, but isolates sampled from wheat hardly infect triticale. Race-specific and adult-plant resistance have been identified in triticale cultivars. The main objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the cellular basis of powdery mildew resistance in triticale. Commonalities with resistance responses in other cereals such as wheat, barley and oat are discussed. A detailed comparative histological study of various resistance responses during cross-inoculation of either virulent or avirulent wheat and triticale isolates on both hosts was carried out. The present data provide evidence that for incompatible interactions, the formation of <b>non-penetrated</b> papillae is the predominant resistance response, while the hypersensitive response (HR) acts as a second line of defence, to cut the fungus off from nutrients, if penetration resistance fails. It is not clear yet what causes the slower growth and reduced colony size of triticale isolates when inoculated on wheat. Possibly, post-penetration resistance mechanisms, other than HR, are switched on during these (semi-) compatible interactions. Molecular studies on gene expression and gene function of defence-related genes might reveal further insights into the genetic basis of these resistance responses...|$|R
40|$|To {{protect against}} loss of photo-assimilate-rich phloem sap, plants have evolved several {{mechanisms}} to plug phloem sieve tubes {{in response to}} damage. In many Fabaceae, each sieve element contains a discrete proteinaceous body called a forisome, which, in response to damage, rapidly transforms from a condensed configuration that does not impede the flow of sap to a dispersed configuration that plugs the sieve element. Aphids and other specialized phloem sap feeders can ingest phloem sap from a single sieve element for hours or days, and to do this, they {{must be able to}} suppress or reverse phloem plugging. A recent study provided in vitro evidence that aphid saliva can reverse forisome plugs. The present study tested this hypothesis in vivo by inducing forisome plugs which triggered aphids to switch behaviour from phloem sap ingestion to salivation into the sieve element. After salivating into the sieve element for various periods of time, the aphids were instantaneously cryofixed (freeze fixed) in situ on their leaf. The state of the forisome was then determined in the penetrated sieve element and in nearby <b>non-penetrated</b> sieve elements which served as controls for sieve elements not subjected to direct aphid salivation. Forisomes were almost always in close contact with the stylet tips and thus came into direct contact with the saliva. Nonetheless, forisome plugs in the penetrated sieve element did not revert back to a non-plugging state any faster than those in neighbouring sieve elements that were not subjected to direct aphid salivation. © The Author 2013.

It is {{therefore}} not openly accessible, {{though it may be}} available by request. If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. One of the most difficult tasks that a forensic pathologist or anthropologist is asked to accomplish is the determination of the postmortem interval (PMI) (Megyesi et al 2005; Ubelaker 1996). When soft tissue is still present, this interval is largely based on the extent of decomposition. Many factors, however, may alter the rate at which decomposition occurs including the temperature, humidity, insect activity, carnivore and rodent activity, and the depositional environment (Mann et al 1990; Sledzik 1997). In a 1990 study Mann et al determined that trauma was also a factor in decomposition, rating it a 4 out of a scale of 5 in importance. The results of the Mann et al (1990) study have been widely accepted by the field and today trauma is considered a major variable affecting the rate of decomposition in textbooks and other edited volumes (Byers 2011; Komar and Buikstra 2008; Sledzik 1997). In 2006, a study by J. A. Kelly, in South Africa, challenged the notion that trauma affects the rate of decomposition. In her dissertation, Kelly (2006) found that {{there was no significant difference}} in the rate of decomposition between traumatic groups and non-traumatic groups. In 2010, this research was further followed up by a team in the United Kingdom, specifically analyzing the effects of penetrative trauma on decomposition (Cross and Simmons 2010). Like the South African study, the authors discovered that there were no significant differences between a traumatic group and a non-trauma control (Cross and Simmons 2010; Kelly 2006). However, serious questions can be raised about these studies including the method of euthanasia, and the number of experimental subjects used (Cross and Simmons 2010; Kelly 2006). This present study utilized eight porcine carcasses to determine the effects of trauma on the rate and pattern of decomposition in the New England area. Three of the subjects were lacerated with a 15 cm long incision penetrating in the thoracic cavity and three other subjects where lacerated with a 15 cm long incision in the thoracic area but the incision did not penetrate into the cavity. A seventh set of remains was utilized as a control with an eighth used to verify the results. The subjects were placed on a surface depositional environment at the Boston University Research Facility in Holliston, MA from June to August 2011. Because factors such as temperature are so variable and can affect the temporal rate of decomposition, this study utilized the accumulated degree day (ADD) published in Megyesi et al (2005) as a measure of time. In addition, qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses were conducted, relying predominantly on the total body score (TBS) developed by Megyesi et al (2005). This system assesses a score, based on a stage of decomposition, for three specific regions of the body: head and neck, trunk, and limbs (Megyesi et al 2005). The sum of these scores is the total body score for a particular time. The present study assessed the TBS of all eight subjects and compared them on a temporal, ADD, and accumulated humidity day (AHD) bases. Following the experiment, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine if there was a statistical difference between the three subject groups. The results of this analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between the penetrated group, <b>non-penetrated</b> group, and control group. Trauma had no significant value in the rate of decomposition. A difference, however, was seen in the pattern of decomposition, with decomposition beginning at the wound site in traumatic groups and the facial region for the non-trauma group...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} {{but not impossible}} to design rigorous research trials for acupuncture. Due to acupuncture's invasive nature, {{one of the major}} challenges in efficacy research is in the design of an appropriate placebo control group. For efficacy studies to determine whether acupuncture has specific effects, [...] "sham" [...] forms of acupuncture where the patient, practitioner, and analyst are blinded seem the most acceptable approach. [...] Sham acupuncture uses <b>non-penetrating</b> needles or needling at non-acupuncture points, e.g. inserting needles on meridians not related to the specific condition being studied, or in places not associated with meridians. [...] The under-performance of acupuncture in such trials may indicate that therapeutic effects are due entirely to non-specific effects, or that the sham treatments are not inert, or that systematic protocols yield less than optimal treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) {{surgery is}} a similar, but modified, procedure, in which instead of {{puncturing}} the scleral bed and trabecular meshwork under a scleral flap, a second deep scleral flap is created, excised, with further procedures of deroofing the Schlemm's canal, upon which, percolation of liquid {{from the inner}} eye is achieved and thus alleviating intraocular pressure, without penetrating the eye. NPDS is demonstrated to have significantly fewer side effects than trabeculectomy. [...] However, NPDS is performed manually and requires higher level of skills that may be assisted with instruments.

Ab externo trabeculectomy (AET) involves cutting from outside the eye inward to reach Schlemm's canal, the trabecular meshwork, and the anterior chamber.
