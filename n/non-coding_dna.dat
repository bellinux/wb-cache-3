5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA</b> have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E

Both methods were used to estimate the degree of sequential dependence (or persistence) among nucleotides. We found that these three types of DNA can be discriminated by both methods, although rescaled range analysis performs slightly better than detrended fluctuation analysis. On average, <b>non-coding,</b> non-regulatory <b>DNA</b> has the highest degree of sequential persistence. Coding DNA could be characterised as being anti-persistent, which is in line with earlier findings of latent periodicity. Regulatory regions are shown to possess intermediate sequential dependency. Together with other available methods, rescaled range and detrended fluctuation analysis {{on the basis of a}} combined purine/pyrimidine and weak/strong classification of the nucleotides are useful tools for refined structural and functional segmentation of DNA.

40|$|The melting of {{the coding}} and non-coding classes of natural DNA {{sequences}} was investigated using a program, MELTSIM, which simulates DNA melting based upon an empirically parameterized nearest neighbor thermodynamic model. We calculated T-m results of 8144 natural sequences from 28 eukaryotic organisms of varying F-GC (mole fraction of G and C) and of 3775 coding and 3297 non-coding sequences derived from those natural sequences. These data {{demonstrated that the}} T. vs. F-GC relationships in coding and <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNAs</b> are both linear but have {{a statistically significant difference}} (6. 6 %) in their slopes. These relationships are significantly different from the T-m vs. F-GC relationship embodied in the classical Marmur-Schildkraut-Doty (MSD) equation for the intact long natural sequences. By analyzing the simulation results from various base shufflings of the original DNAs and the average nearest neighbor frequencies of those natural sequences across the F-GC range, we showed that these differences in the T-m vs. F-GC relationships are largely a direct result of systematic F-GC-dependent biases in nearest neighbor frequencies for those two different DNA classes. Those differences in the T. vs. F-GC relationships and biases in nearest neighbor frequencies also appear between the sequences from multicellular and unicellular organisms in the same coding or non-coding classes, albeit of smaller but significant magnitudes.

Thus, the assumptions used to align protein sequences and DNA coding regions are inherently different from those that hold for TFBS sequences. Although it is meaningful to align DNA coding regions for homologous sequences using mutation operators, alignment of binding site sequences for the same transcription factor cannot rely on evolutionary related mutation operations. Similarly, the evolutionary operator of point mutations {{can be used to}} define an edit distance for coding sequences, but this has little meaning for TFBS sequences because any sequence variation has to maintain a certain level of specificity for the binding site to function. This becomes specifically important when trying to align known TFBS sequences to build supervised models to predict unknown locations of the same TFBS.

40|$|Tinkering with {{pre-existing}} genes {{has long}} been known as a major way to create new genes. Recently, however, motherless protein-coding genes have been found to have emerged de novo from ancestral <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNAs.</b> How these genes originated is not well addressed to date. Here we identified 24 hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes with precise origination timing in vertebrate phylogeny. Strand-specific RNA–Seq analyses were performed in five rhesus macaque tissues (liver, prefrontal cortex, skeletal muscle, adipose, and testis), which were then integrated with public transcriptome data from human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque. On the basis of comparing the RNA expression profiles in the three species, we found that most of the hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes encoded polyadenylated non-coding RNAs in rhesus macaque or chimpanzee with a similar transcript structure and correlated tissue expression profile. According to the rule of parsimony, the majority of these hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes appear to have acquired a regulated transcript structure and expression profile before acquiring coding potential. Interestingly, although the expression profile was largely correlated, the coding genes in human often showed higher transcriptional abundance than their non-coding counterparts in rhesus macaque. The major findings we report in this manuscript are robust and insensitive to the parameters used in the identification and analysis of de novo genes.

2500|$|New microRNAs {{are created}} in {{multiple}} ways. Novel microRNAs can originate from the random formation of hairpins in [...] "non-coding" [...] sections of DNA (i.e. introns or intergene regions), {{but also by}} the duplication and modification of existing microRNAs. microRNAs can also form from inverted duplications of protein-coding sequences, which allows {{for the creation of a}} foldback hairpin structure. The rate of evolution (i.e. nucleotide substitution) in recently originated microRNAs is comparable to that elsewhere in the <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA,</b> implying evolution by neutral drift; however, older microRNAs have a much lower rate of change (often less than one substitution per hundred million years), suggesting that once a microRNA gains a function, it undergoes purifying selection. Individual regions within an miRNA gene face different evolutionary pressures, where regions that are vital for processing and function have higher levels of conservation. At this point, a microRNA is rarely lost from an animal's genome, although newer microRNAs (thus presumably non-functional) are frequently lost. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the net flux of miRNA genes has been predicted to be between 1.2 and 3.3 genes per million years. This makes them a valuable phylogenetic marker, and they are being looked upon as a possible solution to outstanding phylogenetic problems such as the relationships of arthropods. On the other hand, in multiple cases microRNAs correlate poorly with phylogeny, and it is possible that their phylogenetic concordance largely reflects a limited sampling of microRNAs.|$|E

2500|$|The genome {{sizes of}} {{thousands}} of eukaryotes have been analyzed over the past 50 years, and these data are available in online databases for animals, plants, and fungi (see external links). Nuclear genome size is typically measured in eukaryotes using either densitometric measurements of Feulgen-stained nuclei (previously using specialized densitometers, now more commonly using computerized image analysis) or flow cytometry. In prokaryotes, pulsed field gel electrophoresis and complete genome sequencing are the predominant methods of genome size determination. Nuclear genome sizes are well known to vary enormously among eukaryotic species. In animals they range more than 3,300-fold, and in land plants they differ {{by a factor of}} about 1,000. Protist genomes have been reported to vary more than 300,000-fold in size, but the high end of this range (Amoeba) has been called into question. In eukaryotes, but not prokaryotes, variation in genome size is not proportional to the number of genes, an observation that was deemed wholly counterintuitive before the discovery of <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA</b> and which became known as the C-value paradox as a result. However, although {{there is no longer any}} paradoxical aspect to the discrepancy between genome size and gene number, this term remains in common usage. For reasons of conceptual clarification, the various puzzles that remain with regard to genome size variation instead have been suggested by one author to more accurately comprise a puzzle or an enigma (the C-value enigma). Genome size correlates with a range of features at the cell and organism levels, including cell size, cell division rate, and, depending on the taxon, body size, metabolic rate, developmental rate, organ complexity, geographical distribution, or extinction risk (for recent reviews, see Bennett and Leitch 2005; Gregory 2005). Based on completely sequenced genome data currently (as of April 2009) available, log-transformed gene number forms a linear correlation with log-transformed genome size in bacteria, archea, viruses, and organelles combined whereas a nonlinear (semi-natural log) correlation in eukaryotes (Hou and Lin 2009 [...] ). The nonlinear correlation for eukaryotes, although claim of its existence contrasts the previous view that no correlation exists for this group of organisms, reflects disproportionately fast increasing noncoding DNA in increasingly large eukaryotic genomes. Although sequenced genome data are practically biased toward small genomes, which may compromise the accuracy of the empirically derived correlation, and the ultimate proof of the correlation remains to be obtained by sequencing some of the largest eukaryotic genomes, current data do not seem to rule out a correlation.|$|E
50|$|Estimates of {{the amount}} of {{adaptive}} evolution in <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA</b> are generally very low, although fewer studies have been done on <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA.</b> As with the coding DNA however, the methods currently used are relatively weak. Ponting and Lunter (2006) speculate that underestimates may be even more severe in <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA,</b> because <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA</b> may undergo periods of functionality (and adaptive evolution), followed by periods of neutrality. If this is true, current methods for detecting adaptive evolution are inadequate to account for such patterns. Additionally, even if low estimates {{of the amount}} of adaptive evolution are correct, this can still equate to a large amount of adaptively evolving <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA,</b> since <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA</b> makes up approximately 98% of the DNA in the human genome. For example, Ponting and Lunter (2006) detect a modest 0.03% of <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA</b> showing evidence of adaptive evolution, but this still equates to approximately 1 Mb of adaptively evolving DNA. Where there is evidence of adaptive evolution (which implies functionality) in <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA,</b> these regions are generally thought {{to be involved in the}} regulation of protein coding sequences.As with humans, fewer studies have searched for adaptive evolution in non-coding regions of other organisms. However, where research has been done on Drosophila, there appears to be large amounts of adaptively evolving <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA.</b> Andolfatto (2005) estimated that adaptive evolution has occurred in 60% of untranslated mature portions of mRNAs, and in 20% of intronic and intergenic regions. If this is true, this would imply that much <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA</b> could be of more functional importance than coding DNA, dramatically altering the consensus view. However, this would still leave unanswered what function all this <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA</b> performs, as the regulatory activity observed thus far is in just a tiny proportion of the total amount of <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNA.</b> Ultimately, significantly more evidence needs to be gathered to substantiate this viewpoint.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>non-coding</b> <b>DNAs</b> that control transcription is ever noticeable, but the characterization {{and analysis of}} the evolution of such DNAs presents challenges not found in the analysis of coding sequences. In this study of the cis-regulatory elements of the pair rule segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) I report the DNA sequences of ftz's zebra element (promoter) and a region containing the proximal enhancer from a total of 45 fly lines belonging to several populations of the species Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. mauritiana, D. yakuba, D. teissieri, D. orena and D. erecta. Both elements evolve at slower rate than ftz synonymous sites, thus reflecting their functional importance. The promoter evolves more slowly than the average for ftz's coding sequence while, on average, the enhancer evolves more rapidly, suggesting more functional constraint and effective purifying selection on the former. Comparative analysis of the number and nature of base substitutions failed to detect significant evidence for positive/adaptive selection in transcription-factor-binding sites. These seem to evolve at similar rates to regions not known to bind transcription factors. Although this result reflects the evolutionary flexibility of the transcription factor binding sites, it also suggests a complex and still not completely understood nature of even the characterized cis-regulatory sequences. The latter seem to contain more functional parts than those currently identified, some of which probably transcription factor binding. This study illustrates ways in which functional assignments of sequences within cis-acting sequences can be used in the search for adaptive evolution, but also highlights difficulties in how such functional assignment and analysis can be carried out...|$|R
