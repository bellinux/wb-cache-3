To analyse the nature of the magnetic compass of mammals, we tested rodents, Ansell's mole-rats, using their tendency to build their nests {{in the southern part of}} the arena as a criterion whether or not they could orient. In contrast to birds, their orientation was not disrupted when a broad-band field of 0. 1 – 10  MHz of 85  nT or a 1. 315  MHz field of 480  nT was added to the static geomagnetic field of 46   000  <b>nT.</b> <b>Even</b> increasing the intensity of the 1. 315  MHz field (Zeeman frequency in the local geomagnetic field) to 4800  nT, more than a tenth of the static field, the mole-rats remained unaffected and continued to build their nests in the south.

Flare-induced increases in NT are dominated by low-loss F 2 ionization produced by 90 - 911 -A emission. The impulsive flare component is relatively intense in the 90 - 911 -A range, but is short lived and weak for flares {{near the edge of}} the visible solar disk and for certain slow flares. The impulsive flare component produces the rapid rise, the sharp maxima in growth rate, and the first maximum in SITECs. The slow flare components are strong in the 1 - 90 -A range but relatively weak in the 90 - 911 -A range and accumulatively contribute to the second maximum in type 1 and 3 events, except during storms when F 2 loss rates are abnormally high in type 2 events...|$|E

The correlation of negative Dst maximum with Bz(CP) was higher (+ 0. 59) as compared to that of Dst with Bz alone (+ 0. 28). When the product of Bz with the solar wind speed V (at the hour of negative Bz maximum) was considered, the correlation of negative Dst maximum with VBz was + 0. 59 and with VBz(CP), 0. 71.

Maximum negative Dst (or Dst*) did not occur at the same hour as maximum FD. The time evolutions of Dst and FD were very different. The correlations were almost zero.

Initially, the companies agreed that IBM would take over maintenance of OS/2 1.0 and development of OS/2 2.0, while Microsoft would continue development of OS/2 3.0. In the end, Microsoft decided to recast NT OS/2 3.0 as Windows NT, leaving all future OS/2 development to IBM. From a business perspective, it was logical to concentrate on a consumer line of operating systems based on DOS and Windows, and to prepare a new high-end system {{in such a way}} as to keep good compatibility with existing Windows applications. While waiting for this new high-end system to develop, Microsoft would still receive licensing money from Xenix and OS/2 sales. Windows NT's OS/2 heritage can be seen in its initial support for the HPFS filesystem, text mode OS/2 1.x applications, and OS/2 LAN Manager network support.

40|$|Neurotrophins control {{neuronal}} {{survival in}} a target-derived manner {{during the period}} of naturally occurring cell death in development. The specificity of this mechanism has been attributed to a restricted spatio-temporal expression of neurotrophin ligands in target tissues, as well as a selective expression of their cognate tyrosine kinase (Trk) receptors in different neuronal subpopulations. However, several in vitro and in vivo studies of null mutant mice have suggested that neurotrophin 3 (NT 3) also signals through the non-preferred TrkB receptor. In this study, we have directly addressed the in vivo preference of NT 3 to signal through TrkB or TrkC, by crossing the NT 3 knock-in mice (BDNFNT 3 /NT 3 mice) with the TrkB- or TrkC-null mutant mice. We find that TrkB is dispensable, whereas TrkC is required for the neuronal rescue by the NT 3 allele in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor- and NT 3 -dependent cochleovestibular system. Our results show that NT 3 maintains survival of cells as well as target innervation only through interactions with TrkC in vivo. TrkB and TrkC receptors are thus not functionally redundant for <b>NT</b> 3, <b>even</b> when coexpressed in neurons of the cochleovestibular system...|$|R
40|$|Anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) {{magnetic}} sensors {{are often}} {{chosen as the}} magnetic transducer for magnetic field sensing in applications with low to moderate magnetic field resolution because of the relative low mass of the sensor and their ease of use. They measure magnetic fields {{in the order of}} the Earth magnetic field (with typical sensitivities of 1 ‰/G or 10 − 2 ‰/μT), have typical minimum detectable fields in order of <b>nT</b> and <b>even</b> 0. 1 <b>nT</b> but they are seriously limited by the thermal drifts due to the variation of the resistivity with temperature (∼ 2. 5 ‰/°C) and the variation of the magnetoresistive effect with temperature (which affects both the sensitivity of the sensors: ∼ 2. 7 ‰/°C, and the offset: ± 0. 5 ‰/°C). Therefore, for lower magnetic fields, fluxgate vector sensors are generally preferred. In the present work these limitations of AMR sensors are outlined and studied. Three methods based on lock-in amplifiers are proposed as low noise techniques. Their performance has been simulated, experimentally tested and comparatively discussed. The developed model has been also used to derive a technique for temperature compensation of AMR response.

40|$|Natural {{antisense}} transcripts (NATs) {{have been}} shown to play important roles in post-transcriptional regulation through the RNA interference pathway. We have combined pyrophosphate-based high-throughput sequencing and computational analysis to identify and analyze, in genome scale, cis-NAT and trans-NAT small RNAs that are derived under normal conditions and in response to drought and salt stresses in the staple plant Oryza sativa. Computationally, we identified 344 cis-NATs and 7142 trans-NATs that are formed by protein-coding genes. From the deep sequencing data, we found 108 cis-NATs and 7141 trans-NATs that gave rise to small RNAs from their overlapping regions. Consistent with early findings, the majority of these 108 cis-NATs seem to be associated with specific conditions or developmental stages. Our analyses also revealed several interesting results. The overlapping regions of the cis-NATs and trans-NATs appear to be more enriched with small RNA loci than non-overlapping regions. The small RNAs generated from cis-NATs and trans-NATs have a length bias of 21 <b>nt,</b> <b>even</b> though their lengths spread over a large range. Furthermore, > 40 % of the small RNAs from cis-NATs and trans-NATs carry an A as their 5 ′-terminal nucleotides. A substantial portion of the transcripts are involved in both cis-NATs and trans-NATs, and many trans-NATs can form many-to-many relationships, indicating that NATs may form complex regulatory networks in O. sativa. This study is the first genome-wide investigation of NAT-derived small RNAs in O. sativa. It reveals the importance of NATs in biogenesis of small RNAs and broadens our understanding of the roles of NAT-derived small RNAs in gene regulation, particularly in response to environmental stimuli...|$|E

40|$|Although no-till (NT) is now {{practiced in}} many {{countries}} of the world, for most smallholders, the crop residues are of such a value that they cannot be left on the soil surfaces to promote soil protection, thus potentially limiting NT benefits and adoption. In this study our main objective was to evaluate runoff, soil, and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses from traditional small-scale maize (Zea mays) field under conventional tillage (T) and NT, with crop residues cover of less than 10 % during the rainy season, in South Africa. Six runoff plots of 22. 5 m(2) (2. 25 x 10 m) under NT and T since 2002 were considered. At each plot, soil bulk density (rho(b)) and SOC content of the 0 - 0. 02 m layer were estimated at nine pits. Top-soil SOC stocks were 26 % higher under NT than under T (P = 0. 001). The NT reduced soil losses by 68 % (96. 8 vs. 301. 5 g m(- 2) yr(- 1), P = 0. 001) and SOC losses by 52 % (7. 7 vs. 16. 2 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1), P = 0. 001), and differences in runoff were not significant. Dissolved organic carbon accounted for about 10 % of total SOC losses and showed significantly higher concentrations under T than NT (1. 49 versus 0. 86 mg C m(- 2) yr(- 1)). The less erosion in NT compared to T was explained by a greater occurrence under NT of indurated crusts, less prone to soil losses.

In this study, we show that the exportin- 5 orthologues from different species such as human, fruit fly and yeast exhibit diverged functions. We found that Msn 5 p, a yeast exportin- 5 orthologue, binds double-stranded RNAs and that it prefers a shorter 22 nt, double-stranded RNA to 80 <b>nt</b> pre-miRNA, <b>even</b> though both of these RNAs share a similar terminal structure.

The knockdown of Drosophila exportin- 5 in cultured cells decreased the amounts of tRNA as well as miRNA, whereas the knock down of human exportin- 5 in cultured cells affected only miRNA but not tRNA levels. These results indicate that double-stranded RNA binding ability is an inherited functio-nal characteristic of the exportin- 5 orthologues and that Drosophila exportin- 5 functions as an exporter of tRNAs as well as pre-miRNAs in the fruit fly that lacks the orthologous gene for exportin-t...|$|R

40|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{repair of}} the most abundant endogenous premutagenic lesion in DNA, 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxoG), is initiated by the bifunctional DNA glycosylase OGG 1. By using purified human proteins, we have reconstituted repair of 8 -oxoG lesions in DNA in vitro on a plasmid DNA substrate containing a single 8 -oxoG residue. It is shown that efficient and complete repair requires only hOGG 1, the AP endonuclease HAP 1, DNA polymerase (Pol) beta and DNA ligase I. After glycosylase base removal, repair occurred through the AP lyase step of hOGG 1 followed by removal of the 3 '-terminal sugar phosphate by the 3 '-diesterase activity of HAP 1. Addition of PCNA had a slight stimulatory effect on repair. Fen 1 or high concentrations of Pol beta were required to induce strand displacement DNA synthesis at incised 8 -oxoG {{in the absence of}} DNA ligase. Fen 1 induced Pol beta strand displacement DNA synthesis at HAP 1 -cleaved AP sites differently from that at gaps introduced by hOGG 1 /HAP 1 at 8 -oxoG sites.

Thirty two non-carious human third molars were selected and had its oclusal enamel removed to produce flat dentin surface which was prepared using sandpapers (SiC) of granulation 600 through a politriz {{with the intention of}} standardize the smear layer. After that the teeth were divided in 8 groups: G 1 (XP) - XP Bond; G 2 (XPH) â 10 % sodium hypochlorite + XP Bond; G 3 (XPO) - potassium oxalate + XP Bond; G 4 (XPHO) â 10 % sodium hypochlorite + potassium oxalate + XP Bond; G 5 (PB) - Prime & Bond NT; G 6 (PBH) â 10 % sodium hypochlorite + Prime & Bond NT; G 7 (PBO) â potassium oxalate + Prime & Bond NT, e G 8 (PBHO) â 10 % sodium hypochlorite + potassium oxalate + Prime & Bond NT. After the treatments had been performed, crowns with resin composite Esthet X (Dentsply), color A- 2 were built. These crowns were done through increments of 2 mm of thickness, with photo polymerization of 20 s for increment, until reaching 6 mm of height. The samples then had been parted for the attainment of beams with transversal section of 0. 8 mm, to be performed under ÂTBS. The mechanical assay was carried through a machine of universal assay.

To elucidate the regulation of AMP hydrolysis during ischemia, data from 31 P NMR spectroscopy and biochemical analyses were integrated via a mathematical model. Since 5 NT is downregulated during severe underperfusion (5 % flow), we tested 5 NT regulation during less severe underperfusion (10 % flow) and then made the perfusate hypoxic {{to see if the}} greater stress reactivated 5 NT. 31 P NMR spectra and coronary venous effluents were obtained from Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts subjected to two 30 -min periods of underperfusion (10 % flow); the second period with or without additional hypoxia (30 % O 2). Data were analyzed with a mathematical model describing the kinetics of myocardial energetics and metabolism. A single 30 -min period of 10 % flow causes downregulation of AMP hydrolysis and the data from the second period of underperfusion are best described by lower 5 <b>NT</b> activity, <b>even</b> in the presence of extra hypoxia. Thirty percent less purines appear in the venous effluent than predicted by the phosphoenergetics (PCr and ATP) when IMP is not allowed to accumulate by the model, however the model indicates that a constant accumulation of IMP via AMP deaminase could explain the discrepancy between expected and measured purines in the venous effluent. While AMP hydrolysis to adenosine is prominent in early ischemia and acts to preserve cellular energy potential, during a second ischemic period, nucleotides are conserved by the stable inhibition of AMP hydrolysis. Furthermore, during 10 % flow conditions, nucleotides are conserved, possibly via an IMP-accumulatory pathwa...|$|R

The domain {{controller}} that holds the PDC Emulator role is crucial in a mixed environment where Windows NT 4.0 BDCs are still present. This is because the PDC Emulator role emulates the functions of a Windows <b>NT</b> 4.0 PDC. <b>Even</b> if all Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers have been migrated to Windows 2000 or later, the domain controller that holds the PDC Emulator role still does a lot. The PDC Emulator is the domain source for time synchronization for all other domain controllers; in a multi-domain forest, the PDC Emulator in each domain synchronizes to the forest root PDC Emulator. All other domain member computers synchronize to their respective domain controllers. It is critically important that computer clocks are synchronized across the forest because excessive clock skew causes Kerberos authentication to fail. In addition, all password changes occur on the PDC Emulator and receive priority replication.|$|R
40|$|The book of Revelation {{includes}} more {{references to the}} Hebrew Scriptures than any other <b>NT</b> book. <b>Even</b> {{the sheer volume of}} scriptural references in the book of Revelation seems to suggest that the study of scriptural references is fundamental to understanding the book, as scholars have recognised for some time. Unlike the prophetic books, scholars have not given significant attention to the Psalms, although they do recognise the presence of many allusions to the Psalms. Through in-depth examination of the use of Psalms in Revelation this thesis demonstrates how significantly the Psalms influenced on the composition of the book of Revelation and offers a fresh insight of the structure and theology of the book. Part I (chapters 2 – 3) offers the background of this study. Chapter 2 discusses the use of Psalms in Second Temple Judaism, focusing on how the book of Psalms was employed in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the characteristics of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Psalms. Chapter 3 considers the significance of the Psalms for the early Christian communities. The Syriac version of the Psalms and the use of Psalms in the NT provide significant data/evidence for its use in early Christianity. Part II (chapters 4 – 7) examines all detectable cases of Psalms in Revelation. The cases are divided into four categories: strong allusion (chapter 4), probable allusion (chapter 5), possible allusion (chapter 6) and influence (chapter 7). In total, thirty-seven cases are considered: eight for strong allusion, seven for probable, nine for possible, and twelve for influence. As a conclusion of the study, Part III (chapter 8) presents the significance of the Psalms in the book of Revelation. The chapter sheds light on liturgical use of Psalms in the book of Revelation and in relevance with the Psalms some theological themes important for understanding the book will be set forth...|$|R
40|$|Isaiah, {{along with}} Psalms and Zechariah, {{is one of}} the most quoted OT books in the Fourth Gospel (FG). There are {{thorough}} studies regarding the citations from Psalms and Zechariah in the FG. However, a monograph-length study on the use of Isaiah in that book is still lacking. The present research aims to fill this gap. This study proposes not only to research into Isaianic citations in the FG (Is 40 : 3; Is 54 : 13; Is 53 : 1; Is 6 : 9 - 10), but also to complete a comparative study of their other occurrences in the NT. This is done by analysing eleven citations in total, of which nine are found in the FG and Synoptics, while the other two are found in Acts and in the Letter to the Romans (one citation in each). This comparative study leads to the conclusion that the same citation, even with the same Vorlage, can be used with two different meanings in two different places in the <b>NT.</b> Indeed, <b>even</b> where similar meanings are to be inferred, the exact uses of the citations have some nuances. Moreover, the deviations in the form of the citations should not be understood simply as due to defective memory: they may be explained by “application of exegetical techniques and devices” (Menken) or they may not. It seems rather that the Fourth Evangelist crafted them well, according to his genuine theological aims/agenda. In fact, he is much freer in the composition of his citations than the Synoptics. In common with the Synoptics, however, he mentions Isaiah in order to gain prophetic authority for some difficult claims and not merely to indicate the source of the citation. Finally, it is observed that all of the Isaianic quotations in the FG have one pattern in common: where the OT writer refers to the God of Israel, the Fourth Evangelist refers to Jesus Christ.

3000|$|The main {{driving engine}} of the IT {{revolution}} has been geometrical miniaturization of transistors. This has been accomplished with a striking development in microfabrication technology, referred to as [...] "Moore's law", i.e., the number of transistors on an integrated circuit (IC) doubles every 2 years, and industrial guidelines enable multiple devices to be integrated within a given chip area [1, 2]. For the past decade, however, {{the size of the}} microchips has remained roughly constant and we are approaching the atomic limit of a critical size. Clearly, this evolution cannot continue down this same path much longer. In reality, they are not likely to replace the ordinary transistors, but they may well provide the paradigm shift that will extend [...] "Moore's law". One-dimensional nanoscaled materials, nanowires (NWs), nanotubes (<b>NTs),</b> or <b>even</b> composite nanowires made up of different materials represent attractive building blocks for hierarchical assembly of functional nanoscale devices, which can exhibit a real device with diverse performances and simultaneously function as the [...] "wires", i.e., they can access and interconnect devices that could overcome fundamental limitations of conventional fabrication [3 – 7]. These unique properties and the intrinsically miniaturized dimensions of NWs' and NTs' building blocks may facilitate the continuation and extension of Moore's law and the evolutionary demand for even faster and smaller electronics in the future. So far, Ferry has developed so-called circuit cleverness by replacing field effect transistor (FET) of vertically oriented structures with parallel nanowires transistor [8]; it can be a great potential to create reconfigurable architectures in which the connections between different functional blocks are changed by switching {{just a few of the}} vertical transistors. Indeed, there has been considerable interest in multilayer electronics to offer a more efficient interconnection and processing of digital information. However, existing technologies for creating reconfigurable architectures are limited, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process [9, 10], ion etching [11, 12], lithography [13 – 16], fluidic [17], and Langmuir-Blodgett technique [18], which are difficult with high-precision and large-domain three-dimensional (3 D) manipulation of the nanowires for nanodevices fabrication with reconfigurable architectures. So, the developing new technique for achieving true 3 D-integrated circuits based on the conventional complementary semiconductor transistor technology is critical and remains a challenge.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{broadcasting}} {{is still}} the predominant mode of potassium (K) fertilizer application for soybeans in no-till (<b>NT)</b> systems <b>even</b> though K is relatively immobile and vertical soil K stratification is often evident in NT fields. Soybean yield in conservation tillage systems may be improved by banding K fertilizer below seeding depth. Certain soybean seed quality parameters may also be affected by K fertilizer management systems since K is so essential in plant enzymes. The objectives of this research were to investigate K nutrition, yield, and quality responses of soybeans resulting from alternate K fertilizer placements (band placement versus surface broadcasting, and applied directly before soybeans versus residual effects associated with application to previous corn) in various tillage (such as zone-till, fall disk, and NT) and row-width systems imposed after long-term NT. All 17 experimental site-years had a minimum 5 -yr NT history prior to treatment initiation. Soybean responses to K placement were generally unaffected by tillage and row width (from 18 to 76 cm) on medium- to high-exchangeable K soils. Trifoliate leaf K concentrations were increased by K application even on medium- to high-testing K soils. Yield responded positively to direct K fertilization most frequently on low K soils. Despite vertical soil K stratification, deep banded K increased yield, relative to broadcast K, only on low K soils and only when most soybean rows were {{in close proximity to}} fertilizer bands. On low-testing soils, leaf K concentrations and yield were over 10 % higher for NT soybeans planted over previous corn rows, compared to those between rows, even when corn received no K fertilizer. Soybean seed K concentrations increased up to 3 g kg− 1 after both direct and residual K applications. Potassium fertilization increased daidzein, genistein, and total isoflavone concentrations in soybean seeds. Seed isoflavone concentrations were positively correlated to yield, seed K and oil concentrations. There was no apparent yield or seed composition benefit from banded versus broadcast K application except on low K soils. Possible preceding corn row impacts on horizontal soil K distribution should be considered when narrow-row NT soybeans follow corn on soils with low to medium K concentrations. ...|$|R

40|$|SVlm 21 is a mutant of Sindbis virus {{which was}} {{isolated}} by serial passage of virus in mosquito cells maintained in low-methionine medium; it therefore has a low-methionine-resistant (LMR) phenotype. This phenotype requires mutations at nts 319 and 321; these mutations result in Arg to Leu and Ser to Cys changes at positions 87 and 88 respectively in the viral methyl transferase, nsP 1. To {{better understand the}} genesis of SVlm 21, we carried out serial passages of viruses having {{only one of these}} amino acid changes, but in mosquito cells maintained in normal methionine-medium. Whether the passage was begun with SV 319 or with SV 321, the dominant virus population which emerged always acquired the second SVlm 21 amino acid change. However, when the passage was begun with virus having neither the nt 319 or the <b>nt</b> 321 mutation, <b>even</b> after many passages neither of these mutations was seen in the passaged virus population. Virus with the LMR phenotype emerged earlier when the virus encoded a wild-type RDRP (passage 4) rather than the mutant RDRP encoded by SVpzf (passage 7). When the methionine concentration in the medium of mosquito cells was increased to 250 µM, more than 20 passages were required until the LMR phenotype predominated. Competition experiments were carried out to compare the relative fitness of SVlm 21, SVwt, SV 319 and SV 321 to each other. Our results indicated that SVlm 21 was dominant to SVwt, as well as to both SV 319 and SV 321. However, SV 319 and SV 321 were able to co-exist with SVwt implying that in these mixed infection the presence of SVwt inhibited the emergence of SVlm 21.

40|$|The NT/NN {{precursor}} molecule possesses four lysine-arginine dibasic residues which represent potential sites of cleavage by proteolytic maturation enzymes. The {{aim of the}} present study was to identify immunohistochemically the regional, cellular and subcellular localization of the various polypeptide intermediates resulting from the precursor's intraneuronal processing and to attempt to determine which enzymes are involved in this processing. We have used site specific antibodies directed against NT, against the exposed KLPLVL(K 6 L) and EKEEVI(E 6 I) sequences of the precursor as well as against the PC 1 and PC 2 maturation enzymes. E 6 I and K 6 L immunoreactivity was essentially confined to nerve cell bodies and terminals in areas displaying NT immunoreactivity. In the absence of colchicine pre-treatment, the NT and E 6 I immunostained perikarya remained sparse throughout, whereas those with K 6 L were virtually undetectable. By contrast, terminal immunostaining was intense for both NT and E 6 I in most regions examined, with K 6 L remaining consistently weaker except in the globus pallidus where both the E 6 I and the K 6 L immunoreactive arbors were more widespread than those of NT. In double labeling experiments, E 6 I and K 6 L antigens were found to be present in the same cells as <b>NT,</b> indicating that <b>even</b> if it is quantitatively different among brain regions, the basic pattern of NT/NN precursor processing remains qualitatively similar throughout the brain. At the subcellular level, a granular pattern of NT and E 6 I immunofluorescence was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the perikarya and proximal dendrites.
