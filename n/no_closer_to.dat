5|$|Following relegation in 1980, Bolton signed former Manchester United European Cup winning striker Brian Kidd from Everton for £150,000 as they {{prepared}} to challenge {{for a quick}} return to the First Division. Kidd scored a hat-trick in his third game for Bolton, a 4–0 win over Newcastle United in the league, {{but the rest of}} the season was a struggle as Bolton finished close to the relegation places. By the end of the 1981–82 season, Bolton were <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> promotion and had lost several key players including Peter Reid and Neil Whatmore. The following season Bolton were relegated to the Third Division after losing 4–1 at Charlton Athletic on the final day.|$|E

The visit of Arsenal on 12 October 1935 attracted a crowd 82,905 to Stamford Bridge, which remains a club record and the second highest ever attendance at an English league match. Crowds of almost 50,000 attended Gallacher and Jackson's home debuts. In 1939, with the club having come <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> on-field success, Knighton stepped down. He was succeeded by Scotsman and former Queens Park Rangers manager, Billy Birrell.|$|E

25|$|Scramble: {{also known}} as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the hole), and the {{procedure}} is repeated until the hole is finished. This system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity, as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies), allows teams of varying sizes, and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without a profoundly negative impact on team score.|$|E
25|$|While it had {{organized}} {{roughly half of}} the porters within the company, the union was seemingly <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> obtaining recognition {{than it had been}} in 1925. By 1928 BSCP leaders decided that the only way to force the issue was to strike the company. The leadership was, however, divided on what a strike could accomplish: some rank-and-file leaders wanted to use the strike as a show of strength and an organizing tool, while Randolph was more cautious, hoping to use the threat of a strike as the lever to get the federal National Mediation Board established pursuant to the Railway Labor Act to bring the Pullman Company to the table while mobilizing support from supporters outside the industry.|$|E
25|$|In Niger, {{fighting}} flared after a Ramadan truce in 2007, with land-mine {{attacks and}} incursions reaching {{areas in the}} south and center of the nation previously unaffected. The Nigerien government, rejecting any negotiations, pursued a crackdown on rebel forces and {{declared a state of emergency}} in the north which by December 2007 threatened to spark a humanitarian crisis. High-profile arrests of domestic and foreign media, the expulsion of European NGOs from the area, and the reported human rights practices of the Nigerien Armed Forces in the Agadez Region have led to criticism of the Nigerien government abroad, and continued fighting in the north. Despite government military victories in early 2008, and condemnation for a hostage seizure and land-mine attacks (for which the rebels deny responsibility), the MNJ appeared <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> either defeat or overthrow of the Nigerien government as the rainy season approached in August 2008.|$|E

25|$|The Union {{military}} command in the West, however, {{suffered from a}} lack of unified command, organized by November into three separate departments: the Department of Kansas, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter, the Department of the Missouri, under Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck, and the Department of the Ohio, under Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell (who had replaced Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman). By January 1862, this disunity of command was apparent because no strategy for operations in the Western theater could be agreed upon. Buell, under political pressure to invade and hold pro-Union East Tennessee, moved slowly in the direction of Nashville, but achieved nothing more substantial toward his goal than minor victories at Middle Creek (January 10, 1862) under Col. James A. Garfield and Mill Springs (January 19) under Brig. Gen. George Henry Thomas. (Mill Springs was a significant victory in a strategic sense because it broke the end of the Confederate Western defensive line and opened the Cumberland Gap to East Tennessee, but it got Buell <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Nashville.) In Halleck's department, Grant demonstrated up the Tennessee River by attacking the Confederate camp at Belmont to divert attention from Buell's intended advance, which did not occur. On February 1, 1862, after repeated requests by Grant, Halleck authorized Grant to move against Fort Henry on the Tennessee.|$|E

500|$|In 1862, Parsons had part of {{his family}} moved from their Wappocomo {{residence}} to Shull's Gap on the Lost River in Hardy County. Romney physician Dr.Lupton {{and his wife were}} also residing with Parsons' family at Shull's Gap. In March, Union Army forces were <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Romney than Green Spring, which allowed Parsons and his wife Susan Blue Parsons to return to their home at Wappocomo with their younger children. Parsons' eldest daughters Kate and Sallie stayed behind with his son Isaac Parsons, Jr., who had arrived from New Market, and a Mrs.Dawson and Dr.Lupton and his wife. On March 24, 1862, Parsons' eldest child and daughter Kate died. Despite recovering from illness, Lt.Blue carried the news of Kate's death and met Parsons halfway to Romney. Parsons instructed Lt.Blue to proceed on to Romney where he delivered the news to his wife Susan. The Parsons no longer felt safe in Romney, and returned to Shull's Gap. Parsons and Lt.Blue traveled to Harrisonburg, where they remained for a few days, and decided to return to Hampshire County. Lt.Blue traveled to his family's residence [...] north of Romney, and Parsons to his residence at Wappocomo plantation. Lt.Blue was subsequently captured by Union Army forces and held at the Wirgman Building, from which he later escaped.|$|E
500|$|Gibraltar {{lived in}} {{relative}} peace for over 200 {{years after the}} tenth siege, by which time the Reconquista was completed and Spain was unified under a single crown. The Rock's importance as a fortress diminished and its defences were neglected. The next siege came in 1704, during the War of the Spanish Succession. The Confederate nations (led by England and the Dutch Republic {{in opposition to the}} Bourbons of the Spanish and French thrones) were seeking to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean, largely to distract the attentions of the Franco-Spanish Bourbon dynasty from a land campaign in northern Europe. Gibraltar was chosen as the target after unsuccessful attempts on other ports. The Confederates attacked on 1 August 1704 and the Spanish governor Diego de Salinas surrendered after the eleventh siege, which only lasted three days. Within a few weeks, Spanish forces began assembling to the north of Gibraltar (now La Línea de la Concepción) for an attempt to re-take the fortress. After the twelfth siege, which comprised a six-month bombardment and blockade from the isthmus linking Gibraltar to the mainland, the garrison was <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> surrendering and the Franco-Spanish army abandoned the siege. The War of the Spanish Succession formally ended in 1713 with the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, under which Gibraltar was ceded to Great Britain. It was initially assumed that Britain would not permanently retain Gibraltar, and would eventually trade it for something else, but the strength of British public opinion made it politically impossible to use the territory as a bargaining chip. Spain, meanwhile, felt betrayed by the French, who had negotiated the Treaty of Utrecht unilaterally, and was determined to regain Gibraltar. The issue came to a head in 1727 when King Philip V of Spain claimed that the British had voided [...] of the treaty, under which Gibraltar had been ceded, due to failures to adhere to its conditions. Philip's forces began the thirteenth siege from the isthmus on 22 February, but after four months, the Spanish supply chain could not keep up with the demands of the siege and, lacking a navy, Spain was unable to prevent Britain from resupplying the garrison by sea.|$|E
