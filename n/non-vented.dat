We present a combination of microbial and biochemical data to assess trophodynamics between and within hydrothermally active and off-vent areas of the Bransfield Strait (1050 – 1647 [*]m depth). Microbial composition, biomass and fatty acid signatures varied widely between and within vent and <b>non-vent</b> sites and provided evidence of diverse metabolic activity. Several species showed diverse feeding strategies and occupied different trophic positions in vent and <b>non-vent</b> areas and stable isotope values of consumers were generally not consistent with feeding structure morphology. Niche area and the diversity of microbial fatty acids reflected trends in species diversity and was lowest at the most hydrothermally active site.

Samples of A. misera were collected around a shallow vent (24. 8341 ° N, 121. 96191 ° E), which included the east, south, southwest, and northwest sites. An absence of Anachis snails {{was found in the}} most acidic north site (pH 7. 19 – 7. 25). Based on the similarities of protein expression profiles, the Anachis snails were classified into two groups, i. e., V-South (pH 7. 78 – 7. 82) and V-Rest (pH 7. 31 – 7. 83). Comparing their shell traits to the <b>non-vent</b> Euplica sp. from Da-xi (DX) and Geng-fang (GF) (pH 8. 1 – 8. 2), a difference in shell shape (shell width : shell length) was found, with the populations having more globular shells than the <b>non-vent</b> ones. The means of shell width were significantly different among sites (p DX > V-South and V-Rest. The relationships of shell length to total weight were curvilinear for both Anachis and Euplica snails. The logarithmically transformed slopes differed significantly among sites, and the mean body weight of the GF population was greater than that of the others (p < 0. 01). Positive correlations between shell length and shell thickness of body whorl (T 1) and penultimate whorl (T 2) were only observed in <b>non-vent</b> GF and DX populations. Anachis snails from vent sites were thinner in T 1 and T 2 compared to the Euplica snails from <b>non-vent</b> sites (p < 0. 05). Within each vent group, shell thickness between T 1 and T 2 was insignificantly different. Between vent groups, T 1 and T 2 from V-Rest showed a decrease of 10. 6 and 10. 2 %, respectively, compared to V-South ones. The decrease of T 1 and T 2 between vent Anachis snails and <b>non-vent</b> Euplica snails was as great as 55. 6 and 29. 0 %, respectively. This was the first study to compare snail's morphological traits under varying shallow-vent stresses with populations previously classified by biochemical responses.

40|$|Red Snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, are {{the most}} {{economically}} important reef fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Population assessments {{that began in the}} mid- 1980 ?s found red snapper to be severely overfished and lead to extensive regulations and harvest restrictions. As a result of these regulations many fish that are captured must be released and are known as regulatory discards. Red snapper live deep in the water column and when captured and rapidly brought to the surface they often suffer pressure-related injuries collectively known as barotrauma. These injuries include a distended abdomen and stomach eversion from the buccal cavity. High mortality of discards due to barotrauma injuries impedes recovery of the fishery. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of two techniques designed to minimize barotrauma-related mortality: venting and rapid recompression. In laboratory experiments using hyperbaric chambers, I assessed sublethal effects of barotrauma and subsequent survival rates of red snapper after single and multiple simulated capture events from pressures corresponding to 30 and 60 m. I evaluated the use of rapid recompression and venting to increase survival and improve recovery indices, including the ability to evade a simulated predator. A condition index of impairment, the barotrauma reflex (BtR) score, was used to assess sublethal external barotrauma injuries, reflex responses, and behavioral responses. Greater capture depths resulted in higher BtR scores (more impairment). <b>Non-vented</b> fish had higher BtR scores than vented fish after both single and multiple decompression events. All fish in vented treatments from 30 and 60 m depths had 100 % survival after a single capture event. <b>Non-vented</b> fish had 67 % survival after decompression from 30 m and 17 % survival from 60 m. Behaviorally, <b>non-vented</b> fish showed greater difficulty achieving an upright orientation upon release and less ability to evade a simulated predator than vented fish. Rapid recompression also greatly improved survival compared to surface-released fish with 96 % of all rapidly recompressed fish surviving. These results clearly show that venting or rapid recompression can be effective tools for alleviating barotrauma symptoms, improving predator evasion after a catch-and-release event, and increasing survival. Fisheries managers should encourage the use of either of these two techniques to aid in the recovery of this important fishery...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate development of a low-cost liquid natural gas (LNG) vehicle fuel storage tank with low fuel boil-off, low tank pressure, and high safety margin. One of the largest contributors to the cost of converting a vehicle to LNG is the cost of the LNG fuel tank. To minimize heat leak from the surroundings into the low-temperature fuel, these tanks are designed as cryogenic dewars with double walls separated by an evacuated insulation space containing multi-layer insulation. The cost of these fuel tanks is driven by this double-walled construction, both in terms of materials and labor. The primary focus of the analysis was to try to devise a fuel tank concept that would allow for the elimination of the double-wall requirement. Results of this study have validated the benefit of vacuum/MLI insulation for LNG fuel tanks and the difficulty in identifying viable alternatives. The thickness of a non-vacuum insulation layer would have to be unreasonably large to achieve an acceptable <b>non-venting</b> hold time. Reasonable hold times could be achieved by using an auxiliary tank to accept boil-off vapor from a non-vacuum insulated primary tank, if the vapor in the auxiliary tank can be stored at high pressure. The primary focus of the analysis was to try to devise a fuel tank concept that allowed for the elimination of the double-wall requirement. Thermodynamic relations were developed for analyzing the fuel tank transient response to heat transfer, venting of vapor, and out-flow of either vapor or liquid. One of the major costs associated with conversion of a vehicle to LNG fuel is the cost of the LNG fuel tank. The cost of these tanks is driven by the cryogenic nature of the fuel and by the fundamental design requirements of long <b>non-venting</b> hold times and low storage pressure...|$|R

40|$|The Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) {{has three}} <b>non-vented</b> segment-to-segment case field joints. These joints use an {{interference}} fit J-joint that is bonded at assembly with a Pressure Sensitive Adhesive (PSA) inboard of redundant O-ring seals. Full-scale motor and sub-scale test article experience {{has shown that the}} ability to preclude gas leakage past the J-joint is a function of PSA type, joint moisture from pre-assembly humidity exposure, and the magnitude of joint displacement during motor operation. To more accurately determine the axial displacements at the J-joints, two thermally durable displacement gages (one mechanical and one electrical) were designed and developed. The mechanical displacement gage concept was generated first as a non-electrical, self-contained gage to capture the maximum magnitude of the J-joint motion. When it became feasible, the electrical displacement gage concept was generated second as a real-time linear displacement gage. Both of these gages were refined in development testing that included hot internal solid rocket motor environments and simulated vibration environments. As a result of this gage development effort, joint motions have been measured in static fired RSRM J-joints where intentional venting was produced (Flight Support Motor # 8, FSM- 8) and nominal <b>non-vented</b> behavior occurred (FSM- 9 and FSM- 10). This data gives new insight into the nominal characteristics of the three case J-joint positions (forward, center and aft) and characteristics of some case J-joints that became vented during motor operation.

To assess the distribution and abundance of coral between 2500 m and 3500 m depths, video footage from the ROV Isis taken during a cruise to the Axial Volcanic Ridge (AVR) of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at approx 45 ° 30 ? N was analysed. Abundances per 100 m were calculated and mapped using Arc GIS, with a maximum of 59 being observed. 20 putative species were identified. Scleractinia were absent from the observed area and the coral fauna was dominated by Octocorallia. The data were separated into four substratum types, sediment, sloped rock, flat rock and mixed substratum, with both abundance and community being compared. Sedimented and rocky areas had different coral communities with sediment having a higher occurrence of Pennatulidae and Chrysogorgidae than rock. Sloped rock had the highest abundance of corals. We suggest that this increase in abundance reflects higher food availability as well as the solid substratum on which coral larvae settle...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} were established during the 1988 and 1989 growing seasons, {{to determine the}} effect of mini-tunnel management systems on floral development and fruit set of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Two types of floral abnormalities reported to be caused by temperatures above 30 $ sp circ$C were observed, namely: style exsertion and splitting of the antheridial cone. Clear vented and white <b>non-vented</b> mini-tunnels reduced the incidence of both these abnormalities compared to the controls in 1988. As a consequence these two types of mini-tunnels also had the greatest percentage fruit set and total marketable yield of the first three clusters. In 1989, none of the mini-tunnels tested significantly increased percentage fruit set or marketable yield. The cultivar Springset produced ripe fruits an average of 4 days before Hope# 1 and 7 days before Celebrity in both 1988 and 1989...|$|E
40|$|The fourth {{phase is}} given of a {{continuing}} program to develop the means to stabilize and control aircraft without moving parts or a separate source of power. Previous phases have demonstrated the feasibility of (1) generating adequate control forces on a standard airfoil, (2) controlling those forces with a fluidic amplifier and (3) cascading <b>non-vented</b> fluidic amplifiers operating on ram air supply pressure. The foremost objectives of the fourth phase covered under Part I of this report were to demonstrate a complete force-control system in a wind tunnel environment and to measure its static and dynamic control characteristics. Secondary objectives, covered under Part II, were to evaluate alternate configurations for lift control. The results demonstrate an overall response time of 150 msec, confirming this technology as a viable means for implementing low-cost reliable flight control systems...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{campaign is}} undertaken {{in order to}} investigate the hydraulic features of a vertical drop shaft, also considering {{the influence of a}} venting system consisting of a coaxial vertical pipe, projecting within the drop shaft with different plunging rates. Three different flow regimes are observed: a “weir flow” for very low head values, where the flow profile is subject to the atmospheric pressure; a “full flow” for high head values, where water flows in a pressurized regime along the whole shaft; and a “transitional flow” for intermediate water head values. Weir flow and full flow can be experimentally investigated under steady-state conditions, whereas transitional flow is a pulsating condition, alternately switching from full flow to weir flow. Considering some significant geometric parameters, a head-discharge relation is sought both for the <b>non-vented</b> and for the vented configurations, by means of an energy balance equation, with specific assumptions about intake losses...|$|E
40|$|Airborne Systems North America (formally Irvin Aerospace Inc) has {{developed}} an Airbag Landing System for the Orion Crew Module of the Crew Exploration Vehicle. This work is {{in support of the}} NASA Langley Research Center Landing System Advanced Development Project. Orion is part of the Constellation Program to send human explorers back to the moon, and then onwards to Mars and other destinations in the Solar System. A component of the Vision for Space Exploration, Orion is being developed to also enable access to space following the retirement of the Space Shuttle in the next decade. This paper documents the development of a conceptual design, fabrication of prototype assemblies, component level testing and two generations of airbag landing system testing. The airbag system has been designed and analyzed using the transient dynamic finite element code LS-DYNA(RegisteredTradeMark). The landing system consists of six airbag assemblies; each assembly comprising a primary impact venting airbag and a <b>non-venting</b> anti-bottoming airbag. The anti-bottoming airbag provides ground clearance following the initial impact attenuation sequence. Incorporated into each primary impact airbag is an active vent that allows the entrapped gas to exit the control volume. The size of the vent is tailored to control the flow-rate of the exiting gas. An internal shaping structure is utilized to control the shape of the primary or main airbags prior to ground impact; this significantly improves stroke efficiency and performance...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen sulfide is {{generally}} accepted {{to be the}} energy source {{for the establishment of}} sulfur-oxidizing symbiotic communities. Here, we show that sulfur-storing symbioses not only consume but also produce large amounts of hydrogen sulfide. The prerequisite for this process appears to be the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic sulfide production is widespread among different thiotrophic symbioses from vent and <b>non-vent</b> sites (Riftia pachyptila, Calyptogena magnifica, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, Lucinoma aequizonata and Calyptogena elongata). The extent of H 2 S generation correlates positively with the amount of elemental sulfur stored in the symbiont-bearing tissues of the hosts. Sulfide production starts a few hours after anoxia sets in, with H 2 S initially accumulating in the circulatory system before it is excreted into the surrounding Summary environment. We propose that not sulfate but the elemental sulfur deposited in the symbionts serves as a terminal electron acceptor during anoxia and is reduced to sulfide. In anoxia-tolerant symbioses such as L. aequizonata, anaerobic sulfur respiration may be important for producing maintenance energy to help the species survive several months without oxygen. The increased levels of cysteine in the gills of L. aequizonata may be caused by a lack of reoxidation due to the absence of oxygen. Key words: anoxia, anaerobic sulphide production, chemoautotrophic symbioses, Lucinoma aequizonata, Riftia pachyptila, Calyptogena magnifica, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, hydrogen sulphide, elemental sulphur, cysteine, glutathione, thiosulphate, sulphur respiration...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} <b>non-venting</b> thermal control for spacesuits {{was built by}} {{integrating}} two previously developed technologies, namely NASA s Spacesuit Water Membrane Evaporator (SWME), and Creare s flexible version of the Lithium Chloride Absorber Radiator (LCAR). This SEAR system was tested in relevant thermal vacuum conditions. These tests show that a 1 m 2 radiator having about {{three times as much}} absorption media as in the test article would be required to support a 7 hour spacewalk. The serial flow arrangement of the LCAR of the flexible version proved to be inefficient for venting non-condensable gas (NCG). A different LCAR packaging arrangement was conceived wherein the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) housing would be made with a high-strength carbon fiber composite honeycomb, the cells of which would be filled with the chemical absorption media. This new packaging reduces the mass and volume impact of the SEAR on the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) compared to the flexible design. A 0. 2 sq m panel with flight-like honeycomb geometry is being constructed and will be tested in thermal and thermal vacuum conditions. Design analyses forecast improved system performance and improved NCG control. A flight-like regeneration system also is also being built and tested. Design analyses for the structurally integrated prototype as well as the earlier test data show that SEAR is not only practical for spacesuits but also has useful applications in spacecraft thermal control...|$|R
