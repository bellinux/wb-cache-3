25|$|German-American {{historian}} Konrad Jarausch {{has argued}} that Mussolini was responsible for an integrated suite of political innovations that made fascism a powerful force in Europe. First, he went beyond the vague promise of future <b>national</b> <b>renewal,</b> and proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country along fascist lines. Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy. He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element. He defined public roles for the main sectors {{of the business community}} rather than allowing it to operate backstage. Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality. As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media, including such new forms as motion pictures and radio. Fourth, he created a mass membership party, with free programs for young men, young women, and various other groups who could therefore be more readily mobilized and monitored. He shut down all alternative political formations and parties (but this step was not an innovation by any means). Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition.|$|E

500|$|The {{major theme}} running {{throughout}} McNeile's works is the First World War. Between 1915 and 1918 he had five collections {{of short stories}} published about the war, while his post-war fiction {{can be seen as}} an extension of those stories, as [...] "both treat the war as a trial with manhood at stake". His war stories were considered by contemporary audiences as anti-sentimental, realistic depictions of the trenches, and as a [...] "celebration of the qualities of the Old Contemptibles". McNeile's view, as expressed through his writing, was that war was a purposeful activity for the nation and for individuals, even if that purpose was later wasted: a [...] "valuable chance at <b>national</b> <b>renewal</b> that had been squandered". The positive effects of war on the individual were outlined by McNeile in The Making of an Officer, his series of articles in The Times, in which he wrote about [...] "the qualities of leadership and selflessness essential to 'inspire' subalterns", a theme he returned to in his war stories—particularly The Lieutenant and Others and Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E—and then afterwards in his fictional stories, notably the Bulldog Drummond works.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the moment}} of inertia {{following}} {{the resignation of the}} government of Adolphe Thiers, 24 May 1873, François Pie, bishop of Poitiers, expressed the national yearning for spiritual renewal— [...] "the hour of the Church has come"— that would be expressed through the [...] "Government of Moral Order" [...] of the Third Republic, which linked Catholic institutions with secular ones, in [...] "a project of religious and <b>national</b> <b>renewal,</b> the main features of which were the restoration of monarchy and the defense of Rome within a cultural framework of official piety," [...] of which Sacré-Cœur is the chief lasting, triumphalist monument.|$|E
2500|$|In Italy, such modernist {{influence}} was exemplified by Marinetti who advocated a palingenetic modernist society that condemned liberal-bourgeois values {{of tradition and}} psychology, while promoting a technological-martial religion of <b>national</b> <b>renewal</b> that emphasized militant nationalism. In Germany, it was exemplified by Jünger who was influenced by his observation of the technological warfare during World War I and claimed that a new social class had been created that he described as the [...] "warrior-worker". Jünger like Marinetti emphasized the revolutionary capacities of technology and emphasized an [...] "organic construction" [...] between human and machine as a liberating and regenerative force in that challenged liberal democracy, conceptions of individual autonomy, bourgeois nihilism and decadence. He conceived of a society based on a totalitarian concept of [...] "total mobilization" [...] of such disciplined warrior-workers.|$|E

2500|$|The Serbian Radical Party (SRS) {{was formed}} on 23 February 1991 by {{the merger of}} Vojislav Šešelj's Serbian Chetnik Movement (SČP) and the National Radical Party (NRS). The SČP had been formed in 1990, {{although}} it was denied official registration due to its overt identification with the historical Chetniks. Formation of the new party followed Šešelj's breakaway from the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) due to internal quarrels with Vuk Drašković; the SPO having been founded by the merger of Šešelj's former Serbian Freedom Movement and Drašković's faction from the Serbian <b>National</b> <b>Renewal.</b> Šešelj {{was chosen as the}} first president of the SRS while Tomislav Nikolić, a member of the NRS, became deputy president. Led by Milošević, the Socialist Party (SPS) contributed greatly to the rise of the SRS through its use of the media. With the SRS allowed to promulgate its ultranationalist views on state television, the SPS could present itself as a comparatively moderate, yet still patriotic party. Šešelj promoted popular notions of an [...] "international conspiracy against the Serbs," [...] the foremost of which involved Germany, the Vatican, the CIA, Italy, Turkey, as well as the centrist Serbian political parties. Such conspiracy theories were also promoted by Milošević-controlled media. In 1991, Šešelj became a Member of Parliament as an independent candidate, and created a belligerent image by engaging in physical fights with opponents of the government.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Ellwood also places Eliade's {{involvement}} with the Iron Guard in relation to scholar's conservatism, and connects this aspect of Eliade's life with both his nostalgia and his study of primal societies. According to Ellwood, the part of Eliade that felt attracted to the [...] "freedom of new beginnings suggested by primal myths" [...] is the same part that felt attracted to the Guard, with its almost mythological notion of a new beginning through a [...] "national resurrection". On a more basic level, Ellwood describes Eliade as an [...] "instinctively spiritual" [...] person who saw the Iron Guard as a spiritual movement. In Ellwood's view, Eliade was aware that the [...] "golden age" [...] of antiquity was no longer accessible to secular man, {{that it could be}} recalled but not re-established. Thus, a [...] "more accessible" [...] object for nostalgia was a [...] "secondary silver age within the last few hundred years"—the Kingdom of Romania's 19th century cultural renaissance. To the young Eliade, the Iron Guard seemed like a path for returning to the silver age of Romania's glory, being a movement [...] "dedicated to the cultural and <b>national</b> <b>renewal</b> of the Romanian people by appeal to their spiritual roots". Ellwood describes the young Eliade as someone [...] "capable of being fired up by mythological archetypes and with no awareness of the evil that was to be unleashed".|$|E
