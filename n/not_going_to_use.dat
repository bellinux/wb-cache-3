Chicago also allowed two 100-yard rushers in the same game {{for the first time}} since 1976 against the Denver Broncos, with Norris Weese (120 yards) and Ottis Anderson (116 yards) guiding the Broncos to 28–14 win. After the game, Marc Trestman stated, [...] "We are a team that was ready to play this game and we played a terrible football game for lack of a better word.

But after all superstars of Iranian cinema rejected to play the role, He asked Irene to play it. Although her performance was great (She had spent a while in a traditional Iranian household to watch the lifestyle of the so-called family). Some Shia mojtaheds such as Morteza Motahhari wrote bitter criticisms on the film in Kayhan newspaper. Some other critics defended the performance of Irene and she was nominated for Sepas award that year. But the film only remained on screens for three days and was renditioned.|$|E

5000|$|Generally, the {{training}} of yearlings consists of basic gentling on the ground; most {{are too young to}} be ridden or driven. Yearlings are often full of energy and quite unpredictable. Even though they are not fully mature, they are heavier and stronger than a human and require knowledgeable handling. Many colts who are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>used</b> as breeding stallions are gelded at this age—in part to improve their behavior.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E

50|$|The {{theoretically}} optimal page replacement algorithm (also {{known as}} OPT, clairvoyant replacement algorithm, or Bélády's optimal page replacement policy) is an algorithm that works as follows: when a page {{needs to be}} swapped in, the operating system swaps out the page whose next use will occur farthest in the future.

Though their {{internal}} silicon wafer was identical, the 6507 was cheaper than the 6502 because its package included fewer memory-address pins—13 instead of 16.

His tips were generous, and so long as he was punctual the waitress allowed nobody to use his chair. The noise of the traffic in the street was softened to a faint rumble, the electric light was cleverly shaded, and his big chair was easy. He got drowsy, but frowned when he began to nod. The trouble was, he was often dull when he ought to be keen. His doctor talked about the advantages of moderation, but when one got old one's pleasures were few and Cartwright liked a good meal. At the luncheon room they did one well, and he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> self-denial yet.|$|E

50|$|USDA Home Loans have Maximum Household Income Limits which vary by the County you {{purchase}} a home in.

For instance, Social Security Income from an elderly relative living in the home, would be considered when determining the maximum household income - even if that relative was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> apply {{to be on the}} mortgage loan.
