40|$|When a {{computer}} and {{a connection to the}} Internet allow almost anyone to claim to be a journalist, the question of who should be covered by media shield laws becomes especially difficult. Based on the premise {{that it is important to}} preserve the journalist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> and to accommodate the 2 ̆ 2 unmedia 2 ̆ 2 if that can be done without undermining journalism 2 ̆ 7 s values, this article suggests that the best way to limit the journalist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> is not to define 2 ̆ 2 who is a journalist? 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 what is news? 2 ̆ 2 Instead, the privilege should extend protection to anyone who is engaged in the work process of journalism.

In other words, people creating art should be permitted to copy anything and everything.

40|$|Current orthodoxy {{holds that}} the fifth {{amendment}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> against self-incrimination {{has its roots in}} the seventeenth-century triumph of enlightened English common law over the older tradition of continental common law and the English ecclesiastical courts which used this tradition to limit religious freedom. In this Article, Professor Helmholz presents and analyzes documentary evidence demonstrating the inaccuracy of this account. These documents reveal that the continental blend of Roman and canon law known as the ius commune had long recognized the privilege against selfincrimination, and that English ecclesiastical courts first considered arguments for the privilege based on this body of law. Thus, far from being the enemy of the privilege, the continental tradition paved the way for the efforts of the English common lawyers now credited with championing it In reaching this conclusion, Professor Helmholz details the rich texture of various arguments and counter-arguments within the ius commune concerning the application of the privilege in specific cases...|$|R
40|$|The United States Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s Fifth and Sixth Amendments {{protect the}} rights of {{criminal}} defendants and witnesses. The Fifth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> against self-incrimination protects witnesses from forced self-incrimination, and the Sixth Amendment provides criminal defendants with the right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses. These fundamental rights conflict when a prosecution witness invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege on cross-examination or when a defense witness invokes the privilege on direct-examination. A grant of either use or transactional immunity would remove the potential for self-incrimination, but courts are split on whether they possess the authority to grant such immunity to defense witnesses. This Note examines the judicial approaches to resolving the conflicts between the Fifth and Sixth Amendment, and it analyzes the factors that favor and those that oppose a grant of immunity to defense witnesses. This Note concludes that defense witnesses should be granted use immunity whenever their testimony might be exculpatory...|$|R

40|$|Weblogs have proliferated {{rapidly in}} recent years, {{attracting}} significant attention and generating important legal issues. Yet {{so far no}} coherent economic framework for addressing these issues exists. This Article begins to develop such a framework. It views blogs as the vanguard {{of what might be}} called 2 ̆ 2 amateur journalism. 2 ̆ 2 Because the Web and related technology have enabled low entry barriers, blogs can be an important source of specialized knowledge. However, bloggers do not work within a monitoring structure as in large news organizations, and individual blogs may be less accurate than conventional news sources. On the other hand, blogs as a whole are subject to strong self-correction mechanisms, including rapid feedback through comments on posts and by other blogs. Also, because most bloggers have low-powered incentives, regulation can easily deter them and thereby reduce the value of these self-correction and market mechanisms.

40|$|Discrimination {{against women}} in public sector organisations {{has been the}} focus of {{considerable}} research in recent years. While much of this literature acknowledges the structural basis of gender inequality, strategies for change are often focused on anti-discrimination policies, equal employment opportunities and diversity management. Discriminatory behaviour is often individualised in these interventions and the larger systems of dominance and subordination are ignored. The flipside of gender discrimination, we argue, is the privileging of men. The lack of critical interrogation of men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege</b> allows men to reinforce their dominance. In this paper we offer an account of gender inequalities and injustices in public sector institutions in terms of privilege. The paper draws on critical scholarship on men and masculinities and an emergent scholarship on men 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in the gender relations of workplaces and organisations, to offer both a general account of privilege and an application of this framework to the arena of public sector institutions and workplaces in general. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} a local park basketball culture and shows how discursive practices constituted masculine hierarchies and proliferated black masculinities. Through pickup basketball, several {{young black men}} took up various positions of power {{and were able to}} determine access to neighborhood parks and dictate the codes of behavior. Drawing on poststructural and social geography theories, we argue that male power became authorized through the community 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privileging</b> of basketball and led to the hierarchical distribution of black masculinities within park spaces. The young black men psychically and materially invested in black masculinities, which were aligned with the logics of 2 ̆ 2 heroic 2 ̆ 2 and responsible citizenship; these notions had prominence because of the strong (re) production of the 2 ̆ 2 Sport vs. Gangs 2 ̆ 2 discourse (Cole, 1996) in their neighborhoods.

40|$|As the United States {{has engaged}} in an {{unprecedented}} campaign of targeted killings against members of al-Qaeda and associated forces, various agencies within the government have engaged in increasingly pitched squabbling regarding their respective control over drone strikes in multiple foreign theaters.

In addition to the inherent policy questions in this turf battle, there are urgent elements of domestic and international law simmering beneath the surface. Some critics have suggested that CIA officers should not be involved in drone operations because CIA officers are non-uniformed individuals that do not meet the international law standards for privileged belligerency.

40|$|The {{history of}} American journalism {{is replete with}} anecdotes about news reporters {{enduring}} jail and other penalties to protect the identities of confidential sources of information. Since {{as early as the}} American Revolution journalists have often found themselves at odds with established authority. In the political cauldron of the late 1960 s and early 1970 s, U. S. government intrusion into the news gathering process was widespread. The notion the First Amendment protected journalists from revealing sources was invalidated by the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1972 decision in Branzburg v. Hayes. Many states throughout the nation reacted by codifying a reporter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>privilege.</b> Nevada did so in 1969, protecting members of the working media from having to divulge confidences to the government.
