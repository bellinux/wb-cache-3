5000|$|When a British embassy or {{consulate}} {{in a foreign}} country is required to provide a replacement passport to a Commonwealth citizen whose government is unrepresented in that country, it will issue a British passport with the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>holder</b> marked as [...] "Commonwealth citizen".|$|R
50|$|The Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2003 and Citizenship (Amendment) Ordinance 2005 make {{provision}} {{for an even}} newer form <b>of</b> Indian <b>nationality,</b> the <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> which are {{to be known as}} Overseas Citizens of India (OCI).

50|$|A {{passport}} is {{a travel}} document, usually issued by a country's government, that certifies the identity and <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> its <b>holder</b> {{primarily for the}} purpose of international travel. Standard passports may contain information such as the holder's name, place and date of birth, photograph, signature, and other identifying information. Many countries are moving towards including biometric information in a microchip embedded in the passport, making them machine-readable and difficult to counterfeit. As of December 2008, 60 countries were issuing biometric passports, and this number was 96 as at 5 April 2017. Previously issued passports usually remain valid until each expires.|$|R
50|$|After the 1959 Tibetan exodus, {{there are}} more than 150,000 Tibetans who live in India, many in {{settlements}} in Dharamsala and Mysore, and Nepal. These include people who have escaped over the Himalayas from Tibet, as well as their children and grandchildren. In India the overwhelming majority of Tibetans born in India are still stateless and carry a document called an Identity Card issued by the Indian government in lieu of a passport. This document states the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>holder</b> as Tibetan. It is a document that is frequently rejected as a valid travel document by many customs and immigrations departments. The Tibetan refugees also own a Green Book issued by the Tibetan Government in Exile for rights and duties towards this administration.|$|R
50|$|The UNLP {{is a valid}} travel document, {{which can}} be used like a {{national}} passport (in connection with travel on official missions only). However, UNLP holders often encounter immigration officials who are unfamiliar with the document and require them to show a national passport in addition. As with national passports, some countries/regions accept it for entry without the need for a visa (e.g., Kenya, United Kingdom, Schengen Area, Lebanon, etc.), while other countries may require a visa before it can be accepted for entry to the country (depending on the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the UNLP <b>holder).</b>|$|R
40|$|The key {{question}} of the presented thesis is what precisely economic nationalism means. The author uses the situation in Czechoslovakia between {{the two world wars}} as a background of her examination of both its dimensions, economic and nationalistic. She points out several problems arising from the use of the term. She also answers the question to what extent economic nationalism is economic and to what extent it is national. Following her empiric study of the effects of nationalism on economic relations, the author redefines the existing conception and suggests that emphasis be put on the terms economic emancipation and above all national economism. The latter expression describes non-standard economic relations - politically motivated creation of highly deformed market environments characterised by restricted entry opportunities, with the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>holders</b> being the principal disqualifying condition. economic interest, nationalism, economic relations, Czechoslovakia 1918 - 1948...|$|R
5000|$|Since 2008, {{long-term}} pass holders (such as foreigners studying {{or working}} in Singapore) are issued plastic cards similar in design to the NRIC, replacing the formerly issued green paper-laminated cards and stamp endorsement on travel documents. The Long Term Pass card is green in colour, {{uses the term}} [...] "Foreign Identification Number" [...] (FIN) instead of the NRIC number, as well as showing the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the pass <b>holder.</b> The card includes a date of expiry, conditional on the card holder holding a valid passport. Employment-related passes are issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), while other passes are issued by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).|$|R
50|$|British National (Overseas), {{commonly}} known as BN(O), {{is one of the}} major classes <b>of</b> British <b>nationality</b> under British <b>nationality</b> law. <b>Holders</b> <b>of</b> this <b>nationality</b> are British nationals and Commonwealth citizens, but not British citizens. The nationality itself does not grant right of abode anywhere in the world, including United Kingdom or Hong Kong, but most BN(O)s possess either right of abode or right to land in Hong Kong. BN(O)s are subject to British immigration controls and do not have the automatic right to live or work in the United Kingdom.|$|R

40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} {{the international}} legal regime which regulates the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> both a physical and a legal person. The authors discuss the juridical nature <b>of</b> <b>nationality,</b> <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a res and of humans, and reflect upon the recent sale by states <b>of</b> their <b>nationality</b> to non-citizens thereby shifting human nationality {{closer to the}} commodification <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> which ships are a traditional instance.

50|$|Article 4d {{provides}} that neither marriage nor {{dissolution of marriage}} shall automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> either spouse, nor shall a change <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> by one spouse during marriage automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> their spouse. Common practice among states {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century was that a woman was to have the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, and lose her previous nationality. Even after the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a married woman was no longer dependent on the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations. Article 4d addresses this situation.|$|R
