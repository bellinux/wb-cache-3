5|$|By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimated}} that 4,011 people had {{succumbed to the}} waterborne disease since the outbreak began in August 2008, and the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> recorded had reached 89,018. In Harare, the city council offered free graves to cholera victims. There had been signs that the disease is abating, with cholera infections down by about 50% to around 4,000 cases a week.|$|E
5|$|Coordination {{of rescue}} efforts August 29 and August 30 were made {{difficult}} by {{disruption of the}} communications infrastructure. Many telephones, including most cell phones, and Internet access were inoperable because of line breaks, destruction of base stations, or power failures, even though some base stations had their own back-up generators. In a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> reporters were asked to brief public officials on the conditions in areas where information was not reaching them any other way.|$|E
5|$|Globally about 106 {{million cases}} of {{chlamydia}} and 106 million cases of gonorrhea occurred in 2008. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of PID; however, is not clear. It {{is estimated to}} affect about 1.5 percent of young women yearly. In the United States PID is estimated to affect about one million people yearly. Rates are highest with teenagers and first time mothers. PID causes over 100,000 women to become infertile in the US each year.|$|E

5|$|In 1805, Captain Dixon {{lost all}} of his {{property}} and moved the family to Henderson, Kentucky. Archibald Dixon was educated by his mother and attended the common schools of Henderson. In 1822, he began to study law {{in the office of}} James Hillyer. He was admitted to the bar in 1824, and commenced practice in Henderson. He became well known as a skilled defense attorney and was employed in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> in Kentucky and Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccines}} are vaccines used {{to prevent}} poliomyelitis (polio). There are two types: one that uses inactivated poliovirus and is given by injection (IPV), and one that uses weakened poliovirus and is given by mouth (OPV). The World Health Organization recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio. The two vaccines have eliminated polio {{from most of the}} world, and reduced the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 37 in 2016.|$|E

40|$|Software {{testing is}} a process of ratifying the {{functionality}} of software. It is one of the crucial area which consumes more time and high cost. The time spent on testing is mainly concerned with testing large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> test <b>cases,</b> which are unreliable. Our goal is to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> test <b>cases</b> and to give reliable test cases. To extract reliable test <b>cases</b> from large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> test <b>cases,</b> clustering algorithm is used which is a data mining approach to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> test <b>cases...</b>|$|R

5|$|The exact <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of HIT in {{the general}} {{population}} is unknown. What is known is that women receiving heparin after a recent surgical procedure, particularly cardiothoracic surgery, have a higher risk, while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth. Some studies have shown that HIT is less common in those receiving low molecular weight heparin.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{measures}} {{are used in}} epidemiological studies: incidence and prevalence. Incidence {{is the number of}} new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while prevalence is the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of the disease in the population at any given time.|$|E
5|$|Bryce Hendrie, whose {{office was}} {{next door to}} Louis Champion's, had been {{appointed}} commanding officer of the Rhodesian contingent to attend the coronation of King George V on 22 June 1911. Before his departure to England, he offered Guest the management of his practice during his absence. Hendrie's brother was an estate agent and put all his property transfers through the firm, so Guest gained much valuable experience, especially in conveyancing, through a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> in the High Court, in the Magistrate's Court and in the Court of the Mining Commissioner.|$|E

5|$|Captain Waggett, the stuffy English {{commander}} of the local Home Guard, orders Odd to guard the cargo, but Macroon casually remarks that, by long-standing custom, a man cannot marry without hosting a party in which whisky must be served. Taking the hint, the sergeant allows himself to be overpowered, and the locals manage to offload a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> before the ship goes down. Campbell {{had been sent to}} his room by his mother for a prior transgression, but is persuaded to leave and assist with the salvage by MacCodrun. This proves fortunate, as Campbell rescues the Biffer when he is trapped in the sinking freighter. The whisky also fortifies the teetotal Campbell's courage enough so he can stand up to his mother regarding Catriona.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. Histoplasmosis is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. Given the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates {{who claimed to have}} been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E
5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> {{death has}} {{occurred}} within 24 {{hours of the}} onset of the infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{consists of}} discontinuing medications {{which may be}} contributing. In those who are agitated benzodiazepines may be used. If this is not sufficient, a serotonin antagonist such as cyproheptadine may be used. In those with a high body temperature active cooling measures may be needed. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of serotonin syndrome that occur each year is unclear. With appropriate treatment {{the risk of death}} is less than one percent. The high-profile case of Libby Zion, who is generally accepted to have died from serotonin syndrome, resulted in changes to graduate medical education in New York State.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} reason of the {{interference}} <b>of</b> natural <b>numbers</b> with {{the processing of}} fractions in adults. Mix et al. (1999) hypothesized that the Arabic digits making up a fraction can activate the natural number knowledge in children, as they are frequently used to express natural numbers. If this hypothesis is right in adults, natural number knowledge should interfere with the processing of probabilities with the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> favourable <b>cases</b> (for a given <b>number</b> <b>of</b> favourable <b>cases,</b> higher is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>cases</b> lower is the probability to have a favourable case), only when they are expressed by a fraction. Adults had to compare two probabilities, either with the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>cases</b> either with the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> favourable <b>cases.</b> Probabilities were presented symbolically (fraction) and analogically (subset {{of a set of}} items). In our sample, comparing probabilities with the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> favourable <b>cases</b> is more complex than comparing probabilities with the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>cases,</b> but whatever the way of representation. However, {{the difference between the two}} types of comparison is higher in the symbolic way than in the analogical ways. These results suggest that natural number/counting knowledge interferes with the processing of probabilities expressed symbolically and analogically. Consequently, the interference <b>of</b> natural <b>numbers</b> with the processing of fractions cannot only be explained b...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic {{estimation}} of the daily cumulative cases during infectious disease surveillance: application to dengue fever Pei-Hung Chuang 1, 2, Jen-Hsiang Chuang 1, 2, 4 and I-Feng Lin * 1, 3 Background: In infectious disease surveillance, when the laboratory confirmation <b>of</b> the <b>cases</b> is time-consuming, {{there is often a}} time lag between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> suspect <b>cases</b> and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> confirmed <b>cases.</b> This study proposes a dynamic statistical model to estimate the daily <b>number</b> <b>of</b> new <b>cases</b> and the daily cumulative <b>number</b> <b>of</b> infected <b>cases,</b> which was then applied to historic dengue fever data. Methods: The duration between the date of disease onset and date of laboratory confirmation was assumed to follow a gamma distribution or a nonparametric distribution. A conditional probability <b>of</b> a <b>case</b> being a real case among the unconfirmed cases on a given date was then calculated. This probability along with the observed confirmed cases was integrated to estimate the daily <b>number</b> <b>of</b> new <b>cases</b> and the cumulative <b>number</b> <b>of</b> infected <b>cases.</b> Results: The distribution of the onset-to-confirmation time for the positive cases was different from that <b>of</b> the negative <b>cases.</b> The daily new cases and cumulative epidemic curves estimated by the proposed method have a lowe...|$|R
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an unfair monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E

5|$|Since first {{coming to}} wide {{notice in the}} late 1990s, the Harry Potter book series by J. K. Rowling has engendered a number of legal disputes. Rowling, her various {{publishers}} and Time Warner, {{the owner of the}} rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyrights, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them. While these legal proceedings have countered a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> of outright piracy, other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised.|$|E
