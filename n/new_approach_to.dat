5|$|In the {{shortened}} 2011–12 NBA season, the Blazers {{got off to}} a 7–2 start. But {{the team}} quickly began to collapse, as starting point guard Raymond Felton, among others, struggled with McMillan's <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's performance, {{the rest of the team}} became more inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Such was the {{controversy}} surrounding this storyline that the University of Glamorgan uses the plot {{as part of their}} <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the study of British criminal law.

The storyline is also featured in GCSE Religious Studies textbooks.|$|E
5|$|The Nemesis of Faith is an epistolary {{philosophical}} {{novel by}} James Anthony Froude published in 1849. Partly autobiographical, the novel depicts {{the causes and}} consequences of a young priest's crisis of faith. Like many of his contemporaries, Froude came to question his Christian faith in light of early nineteenth century developments in history, theology, and science. Froude was particularly influenced by the Catholic teachings of the Oxford Movement and by the <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> religious scholarship developed by the German Higher Critics.|$|E

5|$|The {{business}} community's {{fascination with}} AI {{rose and fell}} in the 80s in the classic pattern of an economic bubble.

5|$|When {{access to}} digital {{computers}} became {{possible in the}} middle fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human thought.

5|$|After scoring 1,050runs (including six centuries) at {{an average}} of 75.00 in the 1940–41 season, Barnes played little cricket until 1945–46, when he scored centuries in five {{successive}} matches for New South Wales. He was picked for the 1945–46 Australian tour of New Zealand and played in the representative match that was later designated as the first Test match between the two countries: he made 54 as Australia won easily. The post-war period also saw a <b>new</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> batting on the part of Barnes. He discarded his aggressive and flamboyant shot-making and re-invented himself as a watchful, more defensive player, which made his scoring more prolific, although less crowd pleasing.|$|E

They recognized that, if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, {{it should not be}} attempted, and other options, such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation, had to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions.|$|E
