40|$|Law making {{becomes an}} {{increasingly}} important function of the higher courts in <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>matters.</b> This observation leads {{to the question of}} whether the law making function is nevertheless carried out in a “classical” legal-principled way or whether the courts increasingly employ a political-formative style. To answer this question, one should not only focus on the content of the courts’ reasoning but also on their procedural-institutional framework. From that perspective, the processing of so-called legislative facts is a key issue in determining the role of courts between legal reasoning and social engineering. The paper shows that Germany, England and the United States pursue different lines in processing legislative facts. Notwithstanding these differences, it seems to be the case that the increasing importance of law making will also change the institutional framework of appellate courts towards a quasi-legislative forum...|$|R

It will show that the discourse concerning this question is in a way a continuation of the dichotomy between power on the one hand and law on the other, that was typical of Enlightened Absolutism...|$|R
40|$|Professor Valcke {{argues that}} Quebec 2 ̆ 7 s <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> {{tradition}} has eroded {{due to the}} influence of the common law institutions {{of the rest of the}} Canadian federation. She begins by providing historical and philosophical background to the <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> tradition. Valcke then argues that the law and legal method used in contemporary Quebec barely resemble the 2 ̆ 2 pure 2 ̆ 2 <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> tradition. First, the constitutional powers of the federal legislature have been interpreted broadly to encroach upon matters that would otherwise fall within the jurisdiction of the provinces. Quebec has been disproportionately affected because its legal system was originally the most distinct within the federation. Second, federal control over aspects of the provincial court system, and the adjudication of <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> <b>matters</b> by judges with inadequate backgrounds in <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> and often little concern for the preservation of Quebec 2 ̆ 7 s distinct legal identity have further weakened Quebec 2 ̆ 7 s <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> tradition. Finally, Valcke argues that the trend toward including the reasons for judicial decisions in Quebec 2 ̆ 7 s court opinions - ironically in an attempt to rescue the civil legal tradition from an unhealthy literalism - has caused those opinions to approximate common law opinions. At the same time, Valcke believes that internal factors have also contributed to the erosion of Quebec 2 ̆ 7 s <b>civil</b> <b>law</b> tradition, and she defers any consideration of a remedy for Quebec 2 ̆ 7 s situation until after those other issues have been examined...|$|R
