5|$|After {{the brigade}} had been disbanded in June 1948, its battalions were reformed, by {{renumbering}} {{those in the}} 2nd Parachute Brigade. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion became the 2nd Parachute Battalion, the 4th/6th Parachute Battalion the 1st Parachute Battalion, and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion the 3rd Parachute Battalion. Finally, in July 1948, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade Group, taking its one and six <b>numbers</b> <b>from</b> the two wartime divisions.|$|E
5|$|Among the 15 known {{isotopes}} of mendelevium (mass <b>numbers</b> <b>from</b> 245 to 260), {{the most}} studied is 256Md, which mainly decays through the electron capture (α-radiation is ≈10%) with the half-life of 77 minutes. Another alpha emitter, 258Md, has a half-life of 53 days. Both these isotopes are produced from rare einsteinium (253Es and 255Es respectively), that therefore limits their availability.|$|E
5|$|Among the 16 known {{isotopes}} of einsteinium {{with mass}} <b>numbers</b> <b>from</b> 241 to 257 the most affordable is 253Es. It is an α-emitter with a half-life of 20.47 days, a relatively weak γ-emission and small spontaneous fission rate {{as compared with}} the isotopes of californium. Prolonged neutron irradiation also produces a long-lived isotope 254Es (t1/2 = 275.5 days).|$|E

5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore <b>numbers</b> <b>from</b> 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E

5|$|Molybdenum-98 is {{the most}} {{abundant}} isotope, comprising 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a half-life of about 1019y and undergoes double beta decay into ruthenium-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass <b>numbers</b> <b>from</b> 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150ns. All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of niobium, technetium, and ruthenium.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{isotopes}} of americium {{are known}} with mass <b>numbers</b> <b>from</b> 232 to 248. The most important are 241Am and 243Am, which are alpha-emitters and also emit soft, but intense γ-rays; {{both of them}} can be obtained in an isotopically pure form. Chemical properties of americium were first studied with 241Am, but later shifted to 243Am, which is almost 20 times less radioactive. The disadvantage of 243Am is production of the short-lived daughter isotope 239Np, which has to be considered in the data analysis.|$|E
