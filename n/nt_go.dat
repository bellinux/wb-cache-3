40|$|Radix polygalae, {{the dried}} roots of Polygala tenuifolia and P. sibirica, {{is one of}} the most {{well-known}} traditional Chinese medicinal plants. Radix polygalae contains various saponins, xanthones, and oligosaccharide esters and these compounds are responsible for several pharmacological properties. To provide basic breeding information, enhance molecular biological analysis, and determine secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways of P. tenuifolia, we applied Illumina sequencing technology and de novo assembly. We also applied this technique to gain an overview of P. tenuifolia transcriptome from samples with different years. Using Illumina sequencing, approximately 67. 2 % of unique sequences were annotated by basic local alignment search tool similarity searches against public sequence databases. We classified the annotated unigenes by using Nr, <b>Nt,</b> <b>GO,</b> COG, and KEGG databases compared with NCBI. We also obtained many candidates CYP 450 s and UGTs by the analysis of genes in the secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways, including putative terpenoid backbone and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. With this transcriptome sequencing, future genetic and genomics studies related to the molecular mechanisms associated with the chemical composition of P. tenuifolia may be improved. Genes involved in the enrichment of secondary metabolite biosynthesis-related pathways could enhance the potential applications of P. tenuifolia in pharmaceutical industries...|$|E

Thirdly, from the geotail current we could track how the magnetic curvature db/ds changes during the substorm development, which is a condition for ballooning instability, Wong et al. (2001). Fourthly we could use the critical current parameter I_c to estimate the conditions when current-driven instabilities may be triggered. Finally, the pressure gradient current I_ps in the model is an estimate of the earthward pressure gradient dp/dx, which is also related to conditions for ballooning instability.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{invariance}} principle {{to solve the}} incidental parameter problem. We seek group actions that preserve the structural parameter and yield a maximal invariant in the parameter space with fixed dimension. M-estimation from {{the likelihood of the}} maximal invariant statistic yields the maximum invariant likelihood estimator (MILE). We apply our method to (i) a stationary autoregressive model with fixed effects; (ii) an agent-specific monotonic transformation model; (iii) an instrumental variable (IV) model; and (iv) a dynamic panel data model with fixed effects. In the first two examples, there exist group actions that completely discard the incidental parameters. In a stationary autoregressive model with fixed effects, MILE coincides with existing conditional and integrated likelihood methods. The invariance principle also gives a new perspective to the marginal likelihood approach. In an agent-specific monotonic transformation model, our approach yields an estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal when errors are Gaussian. In an instrumental variable (IV) model, this paper unifies asymptotic results under strong instruments (SIV) and many weak instruments (MWIV) frameworks. We obtain consistency, asymptotic normality, and optimality results for the limited information maximum likelihood estimator directly from the invariant likelihood. Our approach is parallel to M-estimation in problems in which the number of parameters does not change with the sample size. In a dynamic panel data model with N individuals and T time periods, MILE is consistent as long as <b>NT</b> <b>goes</b> to infinity. We obtain a large N, fixed T bound; this bound coincides with Hahn and Kuersteiner's (2002) bound when T goes to infinity. MILE reaches (i) our bound when N is large and T is fixed; and (ii) Hahn and Kuersteiner's (2002) bound when both N and T are large. ...|$|R
40|$|During several years, the CERN PRINT service {{consisted}} {{of a wide variety}} of printing server platforms handling more than 1300 network printers. Whereas a single UNIX printer server mainly served the 5000 UNIX clients, printing services for the 3500 Windows 9 x and 1500 Windows <b>NT</b> PCs <b>went</b> mostly through Novell and NT servers. At the end of 1997, the CERN Printing Project was launched to define a single server model for all clients. Linux PCs running the RFC 1179 (lpd daemon) protocol were adopted as a common solution as queue servers for all CERN network printers. A CERN Printing Package has been designed to integrate the PC-Windows based printing clients into this lpr based environment. This software package is built around a central database, holding the configuration data (printer name, driver, settings, [...] .) of all corporate network printers. This paper will give an overview of the new architecture including the Linux server environment, the UNIX clients and the CERN Printing. Additionally Java and Perl print clients have been developed in order to provide a GUI for Unix systems and to support other operating systems such as VMS...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dipsacus asperoides is a {{traditional}} Chinese medicinal crop. The root is generally used as a medicine and is frequently prescribed by Chinese doctors {{for the treatment of}} back pain, limb paralysis, flutter trauma, tendon injuries and fractures. With the rapid development of bioinformatics, research has been focused on this species at the gene or molecular level. For purpose of fleshing out genome information about Dipsacus asperoides, in this paper we conducted transcriptome analysis of this species. Principal Findings: To date, many genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins in D. asperoides have not been elucidated. Illumina paired-end sequencing was employed to probe Dipsacus asperoides’s various enzymes associated with the relevant mesostate. A total of 30, 832, 805 clean reads and de novo spliced 43, 243 unigenes were obtained. Of all unigenes, only 8. 27 % (3578) were successfully annotated in total of seven public databases: Nr, <b>Nt,</b> Swiss-Prot, <b>GO,</b> KOG, KEGG and Pfam, which might be attributed to the poor studies on D. asperoides. The candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis were identified and experimentally verified by reverse transcription qPCR, encompassing nine cytochrome P 450 s and seventeen UDP - glucosyltransferases. Specifically, unearthly putative genes involved in the glycosylation of hederagenin were acquired. Simultaneously, 4490 SSRs from 43, 243 examined sequences were determined via bioinformatics analysis. Conclusion: This study represents the first report {{on the use of the}} Illumina sequence platform on this crop at the transcriptome level. Our findings of candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in Dipsacus saponin VI biosynthesis provide novel information in efforts to further understand the triterpenoid metabolic pathway on this species. The initial genetics resources in this study will contribute significantly to the genetic breeding program of Dipsacus asperoides, and are beneficial for clinical diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{materials}} {{constitute a}} field of research covered by continuous and large interest. Their broad use in various areas and their potential adaption in novel and promising applications motivates the search for new materials and investigation on their fundamental properties. Magnetic samples are in fact candidates for applications in various fields. Especially their potential adaption in high density magnetic storage media increased {{in the recent years}} the interest in investigating different types and shapes of magnetic materials. Potential carriers of information could be for instance domain walls or magnetic skyrmions. A fundamental knowledge about the stability, the size and the controllability is needed before any kind of magnetic material can be implemented into a device. The motivation of this thesis is to give a contribution {{to the understanding of the}} growing, interesting and versatile field of magnetic materials by using dynamic cantilever magnetometry (DCM), which is sensitive, non-invasive and compatible to a broad range of samples with different properties. Using DCM we provide both complimentary and new information about the properties of novel or well-known magnetic materials, taking advantage of the high sensitivity of nanomechanical resonators. In fact, we demonstrate the use of DCM, in combination with numerical simulations, to study the process of magnetic reversal of short ferromagnetic (FM) nanotubes (NTs). This reversal is driven by the nucleation of vortices at the end of the tubes and shows a strong aspect-ratio dependence. For instance, short FM <b>NTs</b> <b>go</b> through a vortex state and tubes above a certain length through a mixed state composed of a vortex at each end of the tube and an axial domain in the center. Apart from the aspect ratio, we find that the shape of the ends and impurities have a significant influence on the starting of the reversal process and how it evolves. A precise knowledge of the magnetic reversal is important, since a reliable process is needed for applications like magnetic storage. We further investigate the stability of the skyrmion lattice phase of two different materials carrying the two different types of skyrmions. We measure MnSi nanowires (NWs) hosting Bloch-type skyrmions and a GaV 4 S 8 single crystal carrying Néel skyrmions. During the studies of MnSi NWs we observe an unexpectedly stable skyrmion phase, extending from 29 K down to at least 0. 4 K. The stability of the skyrmion lattice is strongly dependent on the applied magnetic field direction. An extended skyrmion lattice is present only if the long axis of the NW is parallel to the magnetic field. This stabilization occurs despite of the fact that the dimensions of the NW are too large to spatially confine the skyrmion lattice. In fact, an important difference between a NW and a single-crystal bulk sample is that a NW has an especially large surface-to-volume ratio for surfaces perpendicular to the long axis of the wire. The demagnetization influence of theses surfaces may produce an effective magnetic anisotropy which suppresses the conical phase, and therefore, in combination with a parallel applied magnetic field, stabilize and extend the skyrmion lattice. The investigation of a single-crystal of GaV 4 S 8 also results in a surprising stability of the skyrmion lattice phase. In this case, we study the occurrence of the skyrmion phase depending on the orientation of the applied magnetic field. We find the skyrmion lattice still formed with a misalignment of 77 : 1 ˚ ± 2 : 3 ̊ between the [111] crystal axis, which is the axis along which the skyrmions form in this material, and the applied magnetic field direction. The stability of the skyrmion phase is correlated with the strength of the uniaxial anisotropy present in this material. Since the observed stability is higher than what the theoretical model predicts, for the moment we cannot conclude on the strength of the anisotropy, but the findings could help to refine the model, so that it may include all relevant interactions and fit the experimental observations. ...|$|R
40|$|Neurotensin (NT), a {{gastrointestinal}} hormone, binds its receptor [neurotensin receptor (NTR) ] {{to regulate}} the growth of normal and neoplastic intestinal cells; molecular mechanisms remain largely undefined. Glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3) regulates diverse cellular processes, including cell growth and apoptosis. Here, we show that NT induces the phosphorylation of GSK- 3 A/B in the human colon cancer cell line HT 29, HCT 116, or SW 480, which possesses highaffinity NTR. The effect of NT was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), but not by inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signalregulated kinase (MEK 1) or phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase, suggesting a predominant role for PKC in GSK- 3 b phosphorylation by <b>NT.</b> Pretreatment with <b>Gö</b> 6976 (which inhibits PKCa and PKCb 1) or downregulation of endogenous PKCa or PKCb 1 blocked NT-mediated GSK- 3 b (but not GSK- 3 a) phosphorylation. Moreover, a selective PKCb inhibitor, LY 379196, reduced NTmediated GSK- 3 b (but not GSK- 3 a) phosphorylation, suggesting a role for PKCb 1 in the NT-mediated phosphorylation of GSK- 3 b and an undefined kinase in the NT-mediated phosphorylation of GSK- 3 a. Treatment with NT or the GSK- 3 inhibitor SB 216763 increased the expression of cyclin D 1, a downstream effector protein of GSK- 3 and a critical protein for the proliferation of various cells. Our results indicate that NT uses PKC-dependent pathways to modulate GSK- 3, which {{may play a role}} in the NT regulation of intestinal cell growth...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology (NT) {{is about}} {{analysis}} and engineering of structures with size between 0. 1 and 100 nanometres (1 nm = 10 - 9 m). At this scale, new effects occur and {{the boundaries between}} physics, chemistry and biology vanish. NT is predicted to lead to stronger but lighter materials, markedly smaller computers with immensely increased power, large and small autonomous robots, tools for manipulation of single molecules, targeted intervention within cells, connections between electronics and neurones, and more. In recent years military research and development (R&D) of NT has been expanded markedly, with the USA far in the lead. US work spans the full range from electronics via materials to biology. While {{much of this is}} still at the fundamental level, efforts are being made to bring applications to the armed forces soon. One quarter to one third of the Federal funding for <b>NT</b> <b>goes</b> to military R&D, and the USA outspends {{the rest of the world}} by a factor 4 to 10. NT applications will likely pervade all areas of the military. Very small electronics and computers will be used everywhere, e. g. in glasses, uniforms, munitions. Large-scale battle-management and strategy-planning systems will apply human-like reasoning at increasing levels of autonomy, integrating sensors, communication devices and displays into an ubiquitous network. Stronger but light-weight materials, more efficient energy storage and propulsion will allow faster and more agile vehicles in all media. NT-based materials and explosives can bring faster and more precise projectiles. Small arms, munitions and anti-personnel missiles without any metal can become possible. Systems worn by soldiers could monitor the body status and react to injury. Systems implanted into the body could monitor the biochemistry and release drugs, or make contacts to nerves and the brain to reduce the reaction time, later possibly to communicate complex information. Autonomous land vehicles, ships and aircraft would become possible mainly through strongly increased computing power. By using NT to miniaturise sensors, actuators and propulsion, autonomous systems (robots) could also become very small, principally down to below a millimetre - fully artificial or hybrid on the basis of e. g. insects or rats. Satellites and their launchers could become small and cheap, to be used in swarms for earth surveillance, or for anti-satellite attack. Whereas no marked change is expected concerning nuclear weapons, NT may lead to various new types of chemical and biological weapons that target specific organs or act selectively on a certain genetic or protein pattern. On the other hand, NT will allow cheap sensors for chemical or biological warfare agents as well as materials for decontamination. Most of these applications are ten or more years away. Using criteria of preventive arms control, potential military NT applications are evaluated. New conventional, chemical and biological weapons would jeopardise existing arms-control treaties. Armed autonomous systems would endanger the law of warfare. Military stability could decrease with small distributed battlefield sensors and in particular with armed autonomous systems. Arms racing and proliferation have to be feared with all applications. Strong dangers to humans would ensue from armed mini-/ micro-robots and new chemical/ biological weapons used by terrorists. Negative effects on human integrity and human rights could follow indirectly if body manipulation were applied in the military before a thorough societal debate on benefits, risks and regulation. " (excerpt) "Die Nanotechnologie (NT) befasst sich mit der Untersuchung und Gestaltung von Strukturen, die sich in Größen zwischen 0, 1 and 100 Nanometer (1 nm = 10 - 9 m) bewegen. Bei dieser Größenordnung treten neue Effekte auf, und die Grenzen zwischen Physik, Chemie und Biologie verschwinden. Die Experten sagen voraus, dass NT festere und gleichzeitig leichtere Materialien, erheblich kleinere Computer mit unermesslich gesteigerter Leistung, große und kleine autonome Roboter, Werkzeuge für die Handhabung einzelner Moleküle, gezielte Eingriffe in Zellen, Verbindungen zwischen Elektronik und Neuronen und anderes mehr hervorbringen wird. In den letzten Jahren ist die militärische Forschung und Entwicklung (FuE) im Bereich der NT erheblich ausgeweitet worden. Im weltweiten Vergleich liegen die USA deutlich in Führung. Dort wird die gesamte Bandbreite von Elektronik über Materialien bis hin zur Biologie bearbeitet. Auch wenn vieles davon noch Grundlagenforschung ist, gibt es dort doch heute schon Vorbereitungen, den Streitkräften bald Anwendungsmöglichkeiten zur Verfügung zu stellen. Ein Viertel bis ein Drittel der Regierungsausgaben für NT auf Bundesebene steht für militärische FuE zur Verfügung, und die USA geben 4 bis 10 mal so viel dafür aus wie der Rest der Welt. NT-Anwendungen werden alle Bereiche des Militärs durchdringen. Hierzu zählt der umfassende Einsatz sehr kleiner Elektronik und Computer, z. B. in Brillen, Uniformen, Munition. Komplexe Schlachtführungs- und Strategieplanungssysteme werden zunehmend autonom funktionieren und menschenähnliche Überlegungen anstellen, wobei sie Sensoren, Kommunikationsgeräte und Anzeigeeinheiten zu einem allgegenwärtigen Netzwerk verbinden. Festere und dabei leichtere Materialien, effizientere Energiespeicher und Antriebe ermöglichen den Bau schnellerer und beweglicherer Land-, Wasser-, Luft- und Raumfahrzeuge. Des weiteren können NT-basierte Materialien und Sprengstoffe zur Herstellung schnellerer und genauerer Geschosse verwendet werden. Denkbar sind metallfreie Kleinwaffen, Munition und Antipersonen-Flugkörper. Zwar ist bei Kernwaffen keine große Veränderung zu erwarten, NT kann aber zu verschiedenen neuen Arten von chemischen und biologischen Waffen führen, die auf spezifische Organe zielen oder selektiv auf eine bestimmte Eiweißstruktur oder auf ein genetisches Muster hin aktiv werden. Andererseits wird NT billige Sensoren für chemische oder biologische Waffen sowie Materialien zur Entgiftung zur Verfügung stellen. Mit den meisten dieser Anwendungen ist erst in einem Zeitraum von zehn oder mehr Jahren zu rechnen. Mögliche militärische NT-Anwendungen müssen unter den Kriterien der Präventiven Rüstungskontrolle bewertet werden. " (Textauszug...|$|R
