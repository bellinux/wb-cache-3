25|$|The Taming of the Shrew in {{performance}} {{has had an}} uneven history. Popular in Shakespeare's day, the play fell out of favour during the seventeenth century, when it was replaced on the stage by John Lacy's Sauny the Scott. The original Shakespearean text was <b>not</b> <b>performed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> during the eighteenth century, with David Garrick's adaptation Catharine and Petruchio dominating the stage. After over two hundred years without a performance, the play returned to the British stage in 1844, the last Shakespeare play restored to the repertory. However, {{it was only in}} the 1890s that the dominance of Catharine and Petruchio began to wain, and productions of The Shrew become more regular. Moving into the twentieth century, the play's popularity increased considerably, and it became one of Shakespeare's most frequently staged plays, with productions taking place all over the world. This trend has continued into the twenty-first century, with the play as popular now as it was when first written.|$|E

2500|$|King Lear was {{politically}} controversial {{during the period}} of George III's madness, and as a result was <b>not</b> <b>performed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in the two professional theatres of London from 1811 to 1820: but was then the subject of major productions in both, within three months of his death. The 19th century saw the gradual reintroduction of Shakespeare's text to displace Tate's version. Like Garrick before him, John Philip Kemble had introduced more of Shakespeare's text, while still preserving the three main elements of Tate's version: the love story, the omission of the Fool, and the happy ending. Edmund Kean played King Lear with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. At last in 1838 William Macready at Covent Garden performed Shakespeare's version, freed from Tate's adaptions. The restored character of the Fool was played by an actress, Priscilla Horton, as, {{in the words of one}} spectator, [...] "a fragile, hectic, beautiful-faced, half-idiot-looking boy." [...] And Helen Faucit's final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images. John Forster, writing in the Examiner on 14 February 1838, expressed the hope that [...] "Mr Macready's success has banished that disgrace [...] from the stage for ever." [...] But even this version was not close to Shakespeare's: the 19th-century actor-managers heavily cut Shakespeare's scripts: ending scenes on big [...] "curtain effects" [...] and reducing or eliminating supporting roles to give greater prominence to the star. One of Macready's innovations – the use of Stonehenge-like structures on stage to indicate an ancient setting – proved enduring on stage into the 20th century, and can be seen in the 1983 television version starring Laurence Olivier.|$|E

60|$|Mary Erskine {{was about}} twelve {{years older than}} Mary Bell, so that when Mary Bell began to go to school, which was {{when she was about}} five years old, Mary Erskine was about seventeen. Mrs. Bell had proposed, when Mary Erskine first came to her house, that she would go to school and learn to read and write; but Mary had been very much disinclined to do so. In {{connection}} with the amiableness and gentleness of her character and her natural good sense, she {{had a great deal of}} pride and independence of spirit; and she was very unwilling to go to school--being, as she was, almost in her teens--and begin there to learn her letters with the little children. Mrs. Bell ought to have required her to go, notwithstanding her reluctance, or else to have made some other proper arrangement for teaching her to read and write. Mrs. Bell was aware of this in fact, and frequently resolved that she would do so. But she postponed the performance of her resolution from month to month and year to year, and finally it was <b>not</b> <b>performed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Mary Erskine was so very useful at home, that a convenient time for sparing her never came. And then besides she was so kind, and so tractable, and so intent upon complying with all Mrs. Bell's wishes, in every respect, that Mrs. Bell was extremely averse to require any thing of her, which would mortify her, or give her pain.|$|E

Work began on Turbo that summer and finished late in the year. During this time, singer Rob Halford struggled with increasing substance abuse and violent feuds with his romantic partner. After the latter committed suicide in front of Halford, he resolved to get clean and so checked into rehab where he spent a month during December 1985-January 1986. He made an energetic recovery and his live performances during the subsequent tour were described as some of his strongest ever.|$|R

40|$|Research {{performed}} {{in cooperation with}} the Federal Highway Admuzistration The use of weathering steel in steel bridge strudures provides potential advantages in terms of improved durability and lower maintenance costs. However, among TxDOT personnel there are disparate opinions about how well the material paforms. Some contend that it performs well in most environments, and others contend that it does <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> but there is little scientific basis for either opinion. The purpose of this research was to examine, quantifl, and publicize the performance of weathering steel as used in TxDOT bridge structures. A thorough analysis of weathering steel's performance in various locations was performed. In areas where it performs well, it will be promoted as an economical means of construction. In areas where it does not do so, it may be prohibited. In areas that are questionable, the engineer will have performance information {{that can be used to}} make the appropriate determination.

Thalberg left Paris on 18 April 1838, travelling to Vienna, the very day that Liszt gave there a charity concert {{for the benefit of}} the victims of a flood in Hungary. Thalberg invited Liszt for dinner, and the two great pianists dined together on the 28th with Prince Moritz Dietrichstein, who told Liszt, that he was delighted to have [...] "Castor and Pollux" [...] together in his home.

25|$|All robots {{contain some}} level of {{computer}} programming code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor (or it may <b>not</b> <b>perform</b> <b>at</b> <b>all).</b> There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with remote control programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid {{is a form of}} programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions.|$|R

50|$|DHS {{partnered with}} the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University {{to create the}} EDM Assessment. The {{assessment}} itself consists of 71 questions about specific practices. Questions in the EDM Assessment are drawn from the Cyber Resilience Review {{as well as the}} CERT Resilience Management Model. In addition, the authors used concepts from the Information Technology Infrastructure Library and National Institute of Standards and Technology materials. Each question in the EDM Assessment is scored in one of three ways, yes, no, or incomplete. A “yes” means that the practice is fully performed as described in the assessment. “No” means that the practice is <b>not</b> <b>performed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in the organization. An “incomplete” means that the practice is partially performed. For example, if the question asks “Does the organization have a documented procedure for entering into formal agreements with third parties?”, an answer of “incomplete” could mean that the written procedure is incomplete or being written.|$|E
