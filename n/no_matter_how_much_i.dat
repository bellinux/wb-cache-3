Even if you were to send me another dollar, I should still keep the first one, so that no matter how many you sent, the recollection of one first friendship would not be contaminated with mercenary considerations. When I say dollar, darling, of course an express order, or a postal note, or even stamps would be all the same.

I don't think he's failing, but then there's a loss of memory, and an almost childish {{obsession}} {{in regard to the}} marriage he has set his heart on. Then his passion for Jack seems greater as he learns little by little that Jack is not all he might be. Wilson, I give you my word; I believe if dad ever really sees Jack as I see him or you see him, then something dreadful will happen. In spite of everything dad still believes in Jack. It's beautiful and terrible. That's one reason why I've wanted to help Jack. Well, it's not to be. Every day, every hour, Jack Belllounds grows farther from me. He and his father will try to persuade me to consent to this marriage. They may even try to force me. But in that way I'll be as hard and as cold as Old White Slides. No! Never! For the rest, I'll do my duty to dad. I'll stick to him. I could not engage myself to you, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>I</b> love you. And that's more every minute!... So don't mention taking me to your home--don't ask me again. Please, Wilson; your asking shook my very soul! Oh, how sweet that would be--your wife!... But if dad turns me away--I don't think he would. Yet he's so strange and like iron for all concerning Jack. If ever he turned me out I'd have no home. I'm a waif, you know. Then--then, Wilson ... Oh, it's horrible to be in the position I'm in. I won't say any more. You'll understand, dear.|$|E
6000|$|There came a {{time when}} Ajor could no longer walk, {{and then it was}} that I picked her up in my arms and carried her. She begged me to leave her, saying that after I found an exit, I could come back and get her; but she knew, and she knew that I knew, that if ever I did leave her, I could never find her again. Yet she insisted. Barely had I {{sufficient}} strength to take a score of steps at a time; then I would have to sink down and rest for five to ten minutes. I don't know what force urged me on and kept me going {{in the face of an}} absolute conviction that my efforts were utterly futile. I counted us already as good as dead; but still I dragged myself along until the time came that I could no longer rise, but could only crawl along a few inches at a time, dragging Ajor beside me. Her sweet voice, now almost inaudible from weakness, implored me to abandon her and save myself--she seemed to think only of me. Of course I couldn't have left her there alone, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>I</b> might have desired to do so; but the fact of the matter was that I didn't desire to leave her. What I said to her then came very simply and naturally to my lips. It couldn't very well have been otherwise, I imagine, for with death so close, I doubt if people are much inclined to heroics. [...] "I would rather not get out at all, Ajor," [...] I said to her, [...] "than to get out without you." [...] We were resting against a rocky wall, and Ajor was leaning against me, her head on my breast. I could feel her press closer to me, and one hand stroked my arm in a weak caress; but she didn't say anything, nor were words necessary.|$|E

5000|$|When I Was Growing Up is an autobiographical poem {{written by}} revolutionary feminist activist, Nellie Wong in 1973, {{describing}} her struggle to identify as an Asian-American girl {{growing up in}} the United States. Wong reflects on the universal representations of Western ideals of beauty advertised in American popular culture; from which, Wong expresses her desire to be white, to be normal. She states [...] "...to become/a woman, a desirable woman, I began to wear/imaginary pale skin." [...] The lack of and negative stereotypical representations of Asian-American women in Western popular culture denied Nellie Wong the agency to privilege her intersectional identity. The result of this patriarchal tool made Wong shameful of her Chinese heritage: [...] "when I was growing up, I felt/dirty.

However, this which to a human artist would be dissonant and even tasteless, we see here divinely practiced in this virginal canvass with such grace and beauty, that <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>I</b> wished to exaggerate, I could never say as much as it by itself conveys to the onlooker’s eyes. More than human was the hand…etc. The four species or ways of painting are: in oil, in tempera, in gouache and in fresco…And after explaining each with its difficulty, and total lack of precedent for a single surface to the point that before Guadalupe no one could have imagined it, he says: “to me, its so efficacious, that it persuades me of its miraculous character.” ...|$|E
50|$|In Moore's own words: The whole gig {{was a bit}} of a blur (as live {{performances}} often are). The adrenaline, the nerves, the concentration all played their part to produce a misty memory of the event.However, I think it is right to say, everyone felt there was something fundamentally not right in what was happening. For my part, I felt that the whole show felt a little pub rock and amateurish, I didn't think that my contribution was actually enhancing the band.In many ways it was an important bad gig. I think that, had the gig gone well, we may have struggled on with that lineup when, in hindsight, it was so obviously wrong.The following weeks produced a sense of unrest within the band and a feeling that things were unspoken and resentments and frustrations were being suppressed just below the surface. I remember the last rehearsal I had with the group, in a railway arch midway between Elephant and Castle and Blackfriars Bridge, where things seemed strained and un-natural.I think I realised at that point, that the band didn't really need a keyboard player. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>I</b> liked and respected Steve's dream, and passion and energy, I didn't seem to fit in.|$|E

In the film, Director Annalise Ophelian aims to humanize the conversation around Gender variance by featuring people who don’t identify with the gender they were born with, rather than psychologist and psychiatrists leading the conversation. In the film, Adela Vázquez discusses the complexities of gender dysphoria along with the pressure of needing to pass.“I think ‘passing’ is a word to discriminate us immensely. Not everybody can pass. And passing is something that the doctors will tell you to do, you try to pass. Well, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>I</b> pass, I will never be a biological woman. How about empowering me as the transgender woman that I am?” -- Adela VazquezSexile/Sexilio (Comic): - Sexile/Sexilio is a bilingual graphic novel by Jaime Cortez published in 2004 that illustrates the life of Adela Vázquez. Jaime Cortez uses comics to illustrates various moments of Adela Vázquez’s life: her birth, Cuban school life, sexual explorations, Mariel Boat migration, and many others. Sexilio came out of collaboration with Gay Men's Health Crisis. Gay Men’s Health Crisis has been an advocate and leading contributor to HIV/AIDS prevention.

5000|$|On 24 October 1944, Oldendorf was the {{commander}} of Task Group 77.2 at the Battle of Surigao Strait. Oldendorf who was aboard hisflagship USS Louisville which led {{the defeat of the}} Japanese Southern Force. He deployed his powerful force of battleships and cruisers in a classic battle line formation across the Surigao Strait, crossing the T of his opponent. The Japanese battleships Fuso and Yamashiro were sunk, and Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura was killed. Oldendorf's action prevented the Japanese from bringing their battle fleet into Surigao Strait and attacking the beachheads on Leyte Island. He later explained his tactics to the New York Times: [...] "My theory was that of the old-time gambler: Never give a sucker a chance." [...] For this action, Oldendorf was awarded the Navy Cross. [...] In 1959 Admiral Oldendorf provided commentary on his planning for the battle: ...Admiral Kinkaid's order to prepare for night action came as no surprise. ...It was obvious that the objective of the Japanese Forces was the destruction of our transports and that my mission was to protect them at all costs. In order to accomplish my mission, the force under my command must be interposed to between the enemy and the transports. I realized that I must not lose sight of my mission <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>I</b> might be tempted to engage in a gunnery duel with him. I selected the position of the battle line off Hingatungan Point because it gave me the maximum sea room available and restricted the enemy's movements. This position also permitted me to cover the eastern entrance to the Gulf should the Central Force under Admiral Kurita arrive ahead of the Southern Force. I selected the battle plan from the General Tactical Instructions and modified it to meet the conditions existing, i.e., lack of sea room to maneuver and possible enemy action. ...I thought that quite possibly he planned to slip some of his light forces into the Gulf by passing them to the eastward of Hibuson Island after the battle line was engaged. For that reason I stationed the preponderance of my light forces on the left flank. One duty which was never delegated to my staff was the drafting of battle plans. US Naval Institute ProceedingsApril 1959 On 15 December 1944, Oldendorf was promoted to vice admiral and made commander of Battleship Squadron 1. He commanded battleships in the landings at Lingayen. On 6 January 1945 Oldendorf, together with his guest British admiral Bruce Fraser, survived a destructive kamikaze strike on the bridge of USS New Mexico. He was wounded breaking his collar bone at Ulithi on 11 March 1945, when his barge hit a buoy. He was wounded, breaking several ribs, during the Battle of Okinawa while aboard the [...] on 12 August 1945.
