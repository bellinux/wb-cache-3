AIM: To assess the effects of acute gastric ischaemia on the {{different regions of the}} stomach. METHOD: Fifteen <b>New</b> <b>Zeland</b> rabbits were divided into three groups: group 1, animals were observed during 3 h; group 2, during 6 h; group 3, during 12 h. Rabbit stomachs were subjected to devascularization of the greater and lesser curvatures. After predetermined time, the stomachs were removed for macro and microscopic studies. RESULTS: Haemorrhagic necrosis was more marked in the gastric fundus and body. In contrast, the antropylorus remained preserved in 80 % of the animals. Necrosis of the gastric body and fundus mucosa were observed in all animals after 6 h and 12 h of ischaemia.

The avocado fruit is mainly sold fresh on the market, which however trades also a relevant quantity of second-grade fruits with a relatively high oil content. Traditionally, this oil is extracted from dried fruits by means of organic solvents, but a mechanical method is also used in general in locations where drying systems and/or solvent extraction units cannot be installed. These traditional processes yield a grade of oil that needs subsequent refining and is mainly used in the cosmetic industry.

Study Design: screw root form implants with 3. 75 mm in diameter by 8 mm in length presenting four surfaces (n= 8 each) : alumina-blasted/acid-etched (AB/AE), bioresorbable ceramic blasted (TCP), TCP + acid etching, and AB/AE + TCP were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The implants were placed at the distal femur of 8 <b>New</b> <b>Zeland</b> rabbits, remaining for 2 weeks in vivo. After sacrifice, the implants were nondecalcified processed to 30 micro m thickness slides for histomorphology and bone-to-implant contact (BIC) determination. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA at 95 % level of significance considering implant surface as the independent variable and BIC as the dependent variable. Results: SEM and AFM showed that all surfaces presented rough textures and that calciu-hosohate particles were observed at the TCP group surface. Histologic evaluation showed intimate interaction between newly formed woven bone and all implant surfaces, demonstrating that all surfaces were biocompatible and osseoconductive. Significant differences in BIC were observed between the AB/AE and the AB/AE + TCP, and intermediate values observed for the TCP and TCP + Acid surfaces.

In this chapter I will review several different resilience assessment systems that either measure resilience performance (past incident and the urban system’s reaction in that) or resilience as competence (city’s perceived capability to adapt, recover and benefit of shocks). The methods analyzed are Rockefeller Foundations 100 resilient cities measurement framework, UN Habitat disaster measurement system, <b>New</b> <b>Zeland</b> based method, the system produced by the Strategy Alliance and the method developed in the Global X Network. None of these approaches are ‘good’ or ‘bad’ but they have been developed for a specific purpose, they have different objectives, principles, methods and data used. The analysis framework consisted of five systems theoretical dimensions: structure, interaction, coordination, renewal and resources. The analysis revealed that the approaches can be divided into three clusters; firstly survey based method that collect perceptions, second existing statistical data based methods and third multimethod approaches. One of the main conclusions was that none of these methods paid any or thorough attention on interaction between urban system components. Even if the methods try to assess resilience, the main source of adaptation—interaction dynamics—is not covered. But even if the existing resilience measurement methods have weaknesses, I think that the comparison presented in this chapter provides resilience developers a conceptual framework for assessment criteria for deciding which method they should use...|$|R

Material and Method: This experimental study was carried out on 24 <b>New</b> <b>Zeland</b> rabbits of both sexes. Effects of two different suture materials and two different surgical techniques on late recovery period were compared in the developing rabbit trachea. Results: Average tracheal area were calculated as 19. 69 ± 2. 18 mm 2 in the 1 st group, 15. 33 ± 2. 69 mm 2 in the 2 nd group, 16. 95 ± 2. 93 mm 2 in the 3 rd group and 9. 01 ± 2. 64 mm 2 in the 4 th group. A statistically significant difference was found (p< 0. 05).

The hot water humidifiers (HWH) heat the water, thus allowing the water vapor to heat and humidify the medical gases. In the common HWH there is a contact between the medical gases and the sterile water, thus increasing the risk of patient’s colonization and infection. Recently to avoid the condensation in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, new heated ventilator circuits have been developed. In this in vitro study we evaluated the efficiency (absolute/relative humidity) of three HWH: (1) a common HWH without a heated ventilator circuit (MR 730, Fisher&Paykel, <b>New</b> <b>Zeland),</b> (2) the same HWH with a heated ventilator circuit (Mallinckrodt Dar, Italy) and (3) a new HWH (DAR HC 2000, Mallinkckrodt Dar, Italy) with a heated ventilator circuit in which the water vapor reaches the medical gases through a gorotex membrane, avoiding any direct contact between the water and gases. At a temperature of 35 °C and 37 °C the HWH and heated tube were evaluated. The absolute humidity (AH) and relative humidity (RH) were measured by a psychometric method.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{in-vitro}} and in-vivo correlation studies {{was used in}} pharmaceutical research because a simple in-vitro release study on a drug product will be insufficient to predict its therapeutic efficiency. Therefore, correlation between in-vitro release behavior of a drug and its in-vivo absorption in rabbits must be demonstrated experimentally to reproduce therapeutic response. Aim {{of the study was}} to study the in vitro and in vivo evaluation and correlation of timolol maleate ocular insert. Timolol maleate ocular inserts were prepared by solvent casting method using guar gum in different proportions (0. 25 % w/v, 0. 50 % w/v, 0. 75 % w/v, and 1. 0 % w/v). In vitro transcorneal permeation study was performed on goat cornea using modified Franz diffusion cell. The in vivo study was done using <b>New</b> <b>Zeland</b> albino rabbits and the in vitro invivo correlation (IVIVC) was determined by plotting a graph of in vivo drug release was plotted against in vitro release to determine the correlation. The cumulative % drug releases from the formulation ranged from 50. 22 ± 1. 41 to 97. 72 ± 0. 67 over a period of 24 h. In vivo release of the timolol maleate from the optimized ocular inserts F 2, through conjunctival cul-de-sac of rabbits was 76. 03 ± 1. 43 at the end of 24 h. A high value of correlation coefficient (r 2 = 0. 9965) suggested good correlation between the in vitro-in vivo data of the timolol maleate ocular insert...|$|R
40|$|Aim: In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} the effect of A 1 -adenosine agonists on the spontaneous motility (s. m.) of rabbit jejunum (RJ) and whether the A 1 adenosine acute withdrawal response {{is controlled by the}} opioid system as we have seen in guinea pig ileum (GPI). Methods: Segments of jejunum, removed from <b>New</b> <b>Zeland</b> white male rabbit weighing 2 - 2, 5 Kg, were placed in 10 ml tissue bath containing Tyrode solution and maintained at 37 °C.; s. m. was measured by an isotonic trasducer. Results: The selective A receptors agonist, N-cyclopenthyl adenosine (CPA; 3 - 15 x 10 - 9 M) caused a dose-related inhibition (30 - 100 %) of the s. m. amplitude, in some preparations associated with a relaxtion. The addition of the A 1 antgonist, 8 -cyclopenthyl- 1, 3 -dimethylxantine (CPT, 1, 2 x 10 - 6 M) 5 min, after the agonist, elicited in all preparations a withdrawal contracture that consisted in an increase of s. m. or of tone or both. Both the selective k-opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine(BNI, 3, 4 x 10 - 8 M) and the non selective naloxone (NL, 5, 4 x 10 - 7 M) increased the s. m. amplitude and the withdrawal response to the subsequent administration of CPT. Tetrodotoxin ((x 10 - 8 M) inhibited the contraction to CPT. Apamin (5 x 10 - 9 M) caused a rapid and persistent increase in s. m. amplitude, a reduction of the CPA inhibiting response and of the contraction obtained with CPT. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that following a brief exposure both the A! agonist the RJ exhibits a precipitated contracture as observed with opioids and that the A 1 receptor stimulation indirectely activates the opioid system which in turns inhibits the withdrawal response as observed in GPI...|$|R
