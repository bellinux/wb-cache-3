5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and <b>neuter</b> genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the <b>neuter</b> gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite <b>neuter</b> and plural forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The definite form of an adjective {{is identical to the}} indefinite plural form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the green chair"), det gröna huset ("the green house"), and de gröna stolarna ("the green chairs").|$|E
25|$|Third-declension {{adjectives}} {{are mostly}} declined like normal third-declension nouns, {{with a few}} exceptions. In the plural nominative <b>neuter,</b> for example, the ending is -ia (omnia (all, everything)), and for third-declension nouns, the plural nominative <b>neuter</b> ending is -a or -ia (capita (heads), animalia (animals)) They can have one, two or three forms for the masculine, feminine, and <b>neuter</b> nominative singular.|$|E
25|$|One {{study showed}} the {{incidence}} of hip dysplasia increased to 6.7% for dogs <b>neutered</b> before 5.5 months compared to 4.7% for dogs <b>neutered</b> after 5.5 months, although the cases associated with early age <b>neutering</b> seems to be of a less severe form. There was no association between age of <b>neutering</b> and arthritis or long-bone fractures. Another study showed no correlation between age of <b>neutering</b> and musculoskeletal problems. A study of large breed dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture associated early-age <b>neutering</b> {{with the development of}} an excessive tibial plateau angle.|$|R
50|$|In cats, <b>neutering</b> {{increases}} the risk of obesity, partly because the alteration in sex hormones after <b>neutering</b> lowers the basal metabolic rate, and partly because <b>neutered</b> cats have a reduced inclination to roam compared to non-neutered cats.|$|R
5000|$|By 2004, the FCCO had <b>neutered</b> 20,000 cats. In September 2011, the organization's 50,000th cat was <b>neutered,</b> a 5-month old {{grey and}} white kitten from Kelso, Washington named Oscar. In September 2014, FCCO <b>neutered</b> its 70,000th cat, {{a small black}} female cat from {{southeast}} Portland.|$|R
25|$|One {{generally}} sees adjectives {{in their}} <b>neuter</b> form when used pronominally for this reason. For words {{more commonly used}} in this way (rather than to describe a noun) one sees their <b>neuter</b> forms more often than their masculine or feminine. Normally the masculine form {{would be the most}} beneficial form of an adjective to learn first, given that the majority of nouns are masculine. In these cases, however, the most practical form to learn first would be the <b>neuter.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are two {{grammatical}} genders in Danish: {{common and}} <b>neuter.</b> All nouns are mostly arbitrarily divided into these two classes. The singular indefinite article (a/an in English) is en for common nouns and et for <b>neuter</b> nouns. They are often informally called n-words and t-words.|$|E

40|$|Acquired urinary {{incontinence}} is a significant, incurable problem, prevalent in <b>neutered</b> bitches but rarely seen in entire bitches or males. Decreased urethral closure pressure {{has been proposed}} as a causative factor for altered detrusor contractility in the <b>neutered</b> bitch. In post menopausal women, acquired {{urinary incontinence}} is associated with acquired urinary incontinence and changes in collagen deposition within the bladder wall. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine effects of <b>neutering</b> on smooth muscle in the canine urinary bladder. Tissue bath studies were used to assess contractile function and morphometric analysis to determine percentage of collagen in the bladder wall from male and female, <b>neutered</b> and entire canines. Maximal response to both carbachol and neurogenic stimulation was significantly lower in bladder strips from <b>neutered</b> animals of both sexes. Sensitivity to carbachol was also significantly reduced by <b>neutering</b> in both sexes. The percentage of collagen was significantly higher in the bladder wall from <b>neutered</b> vs. entire females, which were similar to that of both <b>neutered</b> and entire males. <b>Neutering</b> a canine decreases urinary bladder responsiveness to muscarinic stimulation in vitro, in both sexes, but only increases the percentage of collagen in the bladder wall in females. While increased percentage collagen may predispose bitches to acquired urinary incontinence, the sex difference in this parameter indicates that more than one mechanism underlies the changes in bladder responsiveness seen following <b>neutering.</b> This alternative effect of <b>neutering</b> may be in the muscarinic receptor effector pathway and act as a therapeutic target for acquired urinary incontinence treatment...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the case}} of pets, {{castration}} is usually called <b>neutering,</b> and is encouraged to prevent overpopulation of the community by unwanted animals, and to reduce certain diseases such as prostate disease and testicular cancer in male dogs (oophorectomy in female pets is often called spaying). Testicular cancer is rare in dogs, but prostate problems are somewhat common in unaltered male dogs when they get older. <b>Neutered</b> individuals have a much lower risk of developing prostate problems in comparison. Unaltered male cats {{are more likely to}} develop an obstruction in their urethra, preventing them from urinating to some degree; however, <b>neutering</b> does not seem to make much difference statistically because many <b>neutered</b> toms also have the problem.

5|$|Spaying or <b>neutering</b> {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found <b>neutered</b> male cats live {{twice as long as}} intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat <b>neutered</b> confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|R
50|$|Pediatric spaying (also {{known as}} “prepuberal” or “early” spaying) or <b>neutering</b> {{is defined as}} {{performing}} an ovariohysterectomy (spaying) or orchidectomy (castration or <b>neutering)</b> on a kitten or puppy {{between the ages of}} 6 and 14 weeks. Spaying and <b>neutering</b> are sterilization procedures which prevent the animals from reproducing. The procedures are also referred to as “gonadectomies” in the veterinary literature.|$|R
25|$|Note {{also that}} in Spanish the word became feminine, while in French, Portuguese and Italian it became {{masculine}} (in Romanian it remained <b>neuter,</b> lapte/lăpturi).

40|$|This student {{report is}} about <b>neutering</b> {{male and female}} cats and compares early age <b>neutering</b> to <b>neutering</b> at the {{traditional}} age of 6 months. The main focus in this report is early age <b>neutering,</b> which means that <b>neutering</b> is performed when the kittens are between 6 and 16 weeks of age. This technique {{has been used by}} shelters in the United States for a long time, to prevent the adopted cats from reproduce and contribute to the problem of overpopulation. Two different surgical methods are also addressed; the ventral midline incision and the lateral flank approach. Ovariohysterectomy and ovariectomy are also compared. I also address which drugs are preferable when kittens are <b>neutered</b> and some important guidelines where you have to be extra careful when dealing with kittens. These guidelines are the preanesthetic evaluation, calculating drug dosages and preventing hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and stress. The report also has a summary of the concerns regarding early age <b>neutering</b> such as anaesthetic risks, growth disorders and growth plate fractures, urologic diseases and immune system dysfunction, obesity, altered metabolism and behavioural changes. The sex hormones and how they change after <b>neutering</b> is also included. At the end of the report there is a compilation of a questionnaire that consists of eight questions that I sent out to various animal hospitals and veterinary clinics in Sweden...|$|R

25|$|In Lithuanian {{language}} adjectives {{have three}} declensions {{determined by the}} singular and plural nominative case inflections. Adjectives are matched with nouns in terms of numbers, genders, and cases. Unlike nouns, which have two genders – masculine and feminine, adjectives have three (except -is, -ė adjectives), but the <b>neuter</b> adjectives (the third example in the table) have only one form, are not inflected. The <b>neuter</b> gender is formed simply by eliminating the last consonant -s from the masculine gender forms.|$|E
