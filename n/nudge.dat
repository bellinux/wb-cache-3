40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Nudging</b> {{strategies}} have recently attracted attention from scholars {{and policy makers}} for their potential in influencing people's behaviors on large scales. But {{is the fact that}} <b>nudges</b> do not forbid any choice-options or significantly alter people's economic incentives sufficient to conclude that <b>nudges</b> should be implemented? While this is discussed amongst scholars from various disciplines the voices of consumers, the target-group of <b>nudges,</b> remain unheard. Since understanding their knowledge about <b>nudging</b> and their opinions on being <b>nudged</b> are crucial for the evaluation of the moral appropriateness of <b>nudging,</b> the current study examines consumers' knowledge of and attitudes toward <b>nudging</b> in general and the realm of health behavior. METHODS: In this qualitative investigation in-depth semi-structured interviews with UK consumers were conducted to examine consumers' attitudes to four domains of inquiry around which the scholarly discussions about <b>nudging</b> have revolved: consumers' approval of <b>nudging,</b> consumers' views on the origin of <b>nudges,</b> consumers' perceived effectiveness of <b>nudging,</b> and consumers' concerns about manipulative aspects of <b>nudging.</b> RESULTS: Interviews revealed that consumers are largely unfamiliar with the concept of <b>nudging</b> altogether. Once defined and explained to them most consumers approve of the concept, especially in the realm of health behavior, given particular conditions: 1. <b>Nudges</b> should be designed for benefiting individuals and society; 2. consumers comprehend the decision-making context and the reasoning behind the promotion of the targeted behavior. Interviews revealed very limited concerns with manipulative aspects of <b>nudges.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These findings call for better information-management to ensure consumers knowledge of <b>nudges</b> and awareness of their current implementation. Under that condition the findings encourage the implementation of <b>nudges</b> benefitting individuals and society in domains that consumers comprehend, such as health behaviors. Further research is required to clarify consumers' concerns and requirements for <b>nudges</b> in more complex domains such as financial decisions and retirement plans...|$|R
40|$|All {{over the}} world, governments are using <b>nudges</b> as {{regulatory}} tools. Is this ethical? Much {{of the answer}} depends on whether <b>nudges</b> promote or instead undermine welfare, autonomy, and dignity. Many <b>nudges,</b> and those that deserve support, promote {{some or all of}} those ideals, and undermine none of them. If welfare is our guide, much <b>nudging</b> is actually required on ethical grounds, even if it comes from government. If autonomy is our guide, much <b>nudging</b> is also required on ethical grounds, in part because some <b>nudges</b> actually promote autonomy, in part because some <b>nudges</b> enable people to devote their limited time and attention to their most important concerns. Finally, <b>nudges</b> should not, and need not, compromise individual dignity, which many <b>nudges</b> actually promote. There is, however, a genuine risk that some <b>nudges</b> might count as manipulation; an emphasis on welfare, autonomy, and dignity helps to show how to avoid that risk...|$|R
40|$|To {{overcome}} {{the problem that}} the horizontal resolution of global climate models may be too low to resolve features which are important at the regional or local scales, dynamical downscaling has been extensively used. However, dynamical downscaling results generally drift away from large-scale driving fields. The <b>nudging</b> technique {{can be used to}} balance the performance of dynamical downscaling at large and small scales, but the performances of the two <b>nudging</b> techniques (analysis <b>nudging</b> and spectral <b>nudging)</b> are debated. Moreover, dynamical downscaling is now performed at the convection-permitting scale to reduce the parameterization uncertainty and obtain the finer resolution. To compare the performances of the two <b>nudging</b> techniques in this study, three sensitivity experiments (with no <b>nudging,</b> analysis <b>nudging,</b> and spectral <b>nudging)</b> covering a period of two months with a grid spacing of 6 [*]km over continental China are conducted to downscale the 1 -degree National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) dataset with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Compared with observations, the results show that both of the <b>nudging</b> experiments decrease the bias of conventional meteorological elements near the surface and at different heights during the process of dynamical downscaling.

5|$|Hill {{had a bad}} {{start from}} pole position, {{allowing}} Schumacher to overtake him into turnone. Panis, who started from tenthposition in a Ligier, spun at the firstcorner after a <b>nudge</b> from Katayama, hitting {{the wall in the}} process and retiring from the race. Herbert, racing the spare Benetton chassis, dropped three places by the end of lapone, dropping behind Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars. Blundell also made a poor start, dropping to fourteenth position after his gearbox changed from first to third gear as he accelerated away from the grid. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the race order was Schumacher leading Hill, from Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger, Alesi, Herbert, Irvine, Katayama and Salo, with the two Tyrrell drivers switching places on the next lap. At the start of lapthree, Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher heading into turnfive, but Schumacher closed the door on Hill. Hill lost the advantage for a moment, with teammate Coulthard drawing alongside, but unable to get past with Hill on the inside line into turnsix. Henceforth, Schumacher and Hill began to gradually pull away from Coulthard, who realised that he could not match the pace of the leaders and settled into his own rhythm, albeit one that was still comfortably faster than the cars behind him. By lapfive, Herbert had dropped down to tenthposition, unhappy with the handling of the spare car and having been overtaken by Irvine, Salo and Katayama. On lapten, Schumacher lapped last-placed Diniz for the first time; the presence of slower cars a constant factor for the front-runners thereafter. On the same lap Frentzen retired from 12thposition with electrical failure. He was joined by Schiattarella two laps later after his Simtek car developed a steering problem. Irvine made a pit stop earlier than expected on lapfifteen, retiring from the race with a gearbox actuator problem. On the same lap, Katayama spun at the fourthcorner, stalled his car in the process and retired from the race. The two retirements meant Herbert moved back up to eighth position. Alesi was the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap17, rejoining the track in eleventh place. Barrichello, Irvine's teammate, retired a lap later, driving into the pit lane slowly with a gearbox problem. On the same lap, Verstappen retired his Simtek car with a clutch problem.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nudges</b> are {{interventions}} that aim to change people’s behaviour through changing {{the environment in}} which they choose rather than appealing to their reasoning. <b>Nudges</b> have been proposed as of possible use in relation to health-related behaviour. However, <b>nudges</b> have been criticized as ethically dubious because they bypass peoples reasoning and (anyway) are of little help in relation to affecting ill-health that results from social determinants, such as poverty. Reducing the rate of excess winter deaths (EWDs) is a public health priority; however, EWD seems clearly to be socially determined such that <b>nudges</b> arguably have little role. This article defends two claims: (i) <b>nudges</b> could have a place in tackling even the heavily socially determined problem of EWD. We draw on evidence from an empirical study, the Keeping Warm in Later Life Project (KWILLT), to argue that in some cases the risk of cold is within the person’s control to some extent such that environmental modifications to influence behaviour such as <b>nudges</b> are possible. (ii) Some uses of behavioural insights in the form of <b>nudges</b> are acceptable, including some in the area of EWD.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work is to gain a general insight into the key mechanisms involved in the impact of <b>nudging</b> on the large scales and the small scales of a regional climate simulation. A "Big Brother experiment" (BBE) approach is used where a "reference atmosphere" is known, unlike when regional climate models are used in practice. The main {{focus is on the}} sensitivity to <b>nudging</b> time, but the BBE approach allows to go beyond a pure sensitivity study by providing a reference which model outputs try to approach, defining an optimal <b>nudging</b> time. Elaborating upon previous idealized studies, this work introduces key novel points. The BBE approach to optimal <b>nudging</b> is used with a realistic model, here the weather research and forecasting model over the European and Mediterranean regions. A winter simulation (1 December 1989 - 28 February 1990) and a summer simulation (1 June 1999 - 31 August 1999) with a 50 km horizontal mesh grid have been performed with initial and boundary conditions provided by the ERA-interim reanalysis of the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecast to produce the "reference atmosphere". The impacts of spectral and indiscriminate <b>nudging</b> are compared all others things being equal and as a function of <b>nudging</b> time. The impact of other numerical parameters, specifically the domain size and update frequency of the large-scale driving fields, on the sensitivity of the optimal <b>nudging</b> time is investigated. The <b>nudged</b> simulations are also compared to non-nudged simulations. Similarity between the reference and the simulations is evaluated for the surface temperature, surface wind and for rainfall, key variables for climate variability analysis and impact studies. These variables are located in the planetary boundary layer, which is not subject to <b>nudging.</b> Regarding the determination of a possible optimal <b>nudging</b> time, the conclusion is not the same for indiscriminate <b>nudging</b> (IN) and spectral <b>nudging</b> and depends on the update frequency of the driving large-scale fields ta. For IN, the optimal <b>nudging</b> time is around t = 3 h for almost all cases. For spectral <b>nudging,</b> the best results are for the smallest value of t used for the simulations (t = 1 h) for frequent update of the driving large-scale fields (3 and 6 h). The optimal <b>nudging</b> time is 3 for 12 h interval between two consecutive driving large-scale fields due to time sampling errors. In terms of resemblance to the reference fields, the differences between the simulations performed with IN and spectral <b>nudging</b> are small. A possible reason for this very similar performance is that <b>nudging</b> is active only above the planetary boundary layer where small-scale features are less energetic. As expected from previous studies, the impact of <b>nudging</b> is weaker for a smaller domain size. However the optimal <b>nudging</b> time itself is not sensitive to domain size. The proposed strategy ensures a dynamical consistency between the driving field and the simulated small-scale field but it does not ensure the best "observed" fine scale field because of the possible impact of incorrect driving large-scale field. This type of downscaling provides an upper bound on the skill possible for recent historical past and twenty-first century projections. The optimal <b>nudging</b> strategy with respect to dynamic downscaling could add skill whenever the parent global model has some level of skill. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|A new <b>nudging</b> {{method for}} data assimilation, delay-coordinate <b>nudging,</b> is presented. Delay-coordinate <b>nudging</b> makes {{explicit}} use of present and past observations {{in the formulation}} of the forcing driving the model evolution at each time-step. Numerical experiments with a low order chaotic system show that the new method systematically outperforms standard <b>nudging</b> in different model and observational scenarios, also when using an un-optimized formulation of the delay-nudging coefficients. A connection between the optimal delay and the dominant Lyapunov exponent of the dynamics is found based on heuristic arguments and is confirmed by the numerical results, providing a guideline for the practical implementation of the algorithm. Delay-coordinate <b>nudging</b> preserves the easiness of implementation, the intuitive functioning and the reduced computational cost of the standard <b>nudging,</b> making it a potential alternative especially in the field of seasonal-to-decadal predictions with large Earth system models that limit the use of more sophisticated data assimilation procedures.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{examines}} the the challenges concerning {{the use of}} <b>nudging</b> as a public governing tool, {{in relation to the}} possible political legitimacy implications. The examination focus on challenges in relation to the use of specifically chosen <b>nudges,</b> as well as general challenges concerning <b>nudging.</b> The estimation of the challenges, is based upon a series of normative criteria for liberal democracy, including input- /output legitimacy, an expanded proportionality principle, as well as the manipulation present within the initiative. The general challenges are analysed through a Foucauldian perspective, wherein <b>nudging</b> is characterised as a neo-liberal governing tool. This pertain to illuminate new critical perspectives of the challenges concerning legitimacy. On the basis of these analysis, the thesis concludes that the challenges towards a political legitimate use of <b>nudging,</b> relate to non-transparency, manipulation, a lack of proportionality between the goals, means and results of <b>nudging</b> initiatives. Further challenges includes the normalisation, homogenisation and the imbalance between the interests of the many versus those of the individual. The thesis also concludes however, that several of the analysed <b>nudging</b> initiatives actually are legitimate within the, by the thesis defined, normative context, which also shows that the use of manipulation can be legitimized...|$|R
40|$|For open {{boundary}} conditions (OBCs) in regional models, a <b>nudging</b> term added to radiative and/or advective conditions during the wave or flow propagation {{outward from the}} model domain of interest is widely used, to prevent the predicted boundary values from evolving to become {{quite different from the}} external data, especially for a long-term integration. However, <b>nudging</b> time scales are basically unknown, leading to many empirical selections. In this paper, a method for objectively estimating <b>nudging</b> time scales during outward propagation is proposed, by using internal model dynamics near the boundary. We tested this method and other several commonly used OBCs for cases of both an idealized model domain and a realistic configuration, and model results demonstrated that the proposed method improves the model solutions. Many similarities are found between the <b>nudging</b> and mixing time scales, in magnitude, spatial and temporal variations, since the <b>nudging</b> mainly replaces the effect of the mixing terms in this study. However, the mixing time scale is not an intrinsic property of the <b>nudging</b> term because in other studies the <b>nudging</b> term might replace terms other than the mixing terms and, thus, should reflect other characteristic time scales.

25|$|Rocket League {{gameplay}} {{is largely}} {{the same as}} that of its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles a soccer game, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later. A player may also utilize boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can be used to <b>nudge</b> the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.|$|E

The pa-per focuses on the democratic compatibility as well as how ethically defensible the given types of <b>nudging</b> are.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} how the phenomenon <b>nudging</b> is implemented and applied in the society. The project {{has been carried out}} by mapping the phenomenon through the original definition by Thaler and Sunstein and by applying the theories of Foucault about power, control and discipline. In the analysis we applied these theories by questioning <b>nudging,</b> represented by our empirical data, which consists of an interview and an article. The interview, which we carried out ourselves, is a semi-structured interview with an informant which is a so-called choice architect who in his own company develops and implement <b>nudges.</b> The article “Nudge and the Manipulation of Choice” is basically a criticism of Thaler and Sunstein and their opponents.

As supplementary literature we have read a wide span of articles and books about <b>nudging</b> and the mechanisms behind.
