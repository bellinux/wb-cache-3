In this paper, we propose Elastic <b>Net</b> <b>procedure</b> for partially linear models and prove the group effect of its estimate. By a simulation study, we show that the strongly correlated variables problem can be better handled by the Elastic <b>Net</b> <b>procedure</b> than Lasso, ALasso and Ridge. Based on an empirical analysis, we can get that the Elastic <b>Net</b> <b>procedure</b> is particularly useful when the number of predictors $p$ is much bigger than the sample size $n$.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an apparatus to investigate the stress variables governing unsaturated soil behavior. This apparatus was devised to explore the range of negative pore-water pressures. Tests were performed by preventing deformation and water content change of an unsaturated sample and measuring changes in <b>normal</b> <b>net</b> stress and matric suction in response to a change in pore-air pressure. The condition of null deformation and null water content change was achieved by specially designing the cell and the air supply system. Vented flush diaphragm transducers and vented Imperial College tensiometers were used to measure directly <b>normal</b> <b>net</b> stress and matric suction, respectively. A preliminary test demonstrated that an interaction occurred between the soil and the flush measurement diaphragms. A specific procedure was then devised to account for the error due to this interaction. The results from the experimental tests support the assumption that the stress variables governing unsaturated soil behavior can be reduced to two stress state variables, e. g., net stress and matric suction...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of a permeability function, k(psi) (where psi = suction), of an unsaturated soil is often tedious and time-consuming. Thus, researchers have proposed various semiempirical predictive methods to determine k(psi) indirectly from a soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) or a particle-size distribution. Also, stress effects on k(psi) {{are generally not}} considered. To explore any stress effect on k(psi), a new 1 -m-high stress-controllable soil column is developed to measure stress-dependent SWCC (SDSWCC) and k(psi) of soils directly. The objectives of this paper are to investigate the effects of (1) two stress-state variables (matric suction and <b>net</b> <b>normal</b> stress) and (2) a drying-wetting cycle on both SDSWCC and k(psi) of a compacted decomposed silty clay. Each compacted soil column is subjected to an evaporation-ponding cycle under various vertical <b>net</b> <b>normal</b> stresses. The variations of pore-water pressure and volumetric water content (VWC, theta(w)) profiles with time are measured instantaneously. The k(psi) is hence determined by using the instantaneous profile method. At a given average vertical <b>net</b> <b>normal</b> stress, the measured k(psi) exhibits a remarkable hysteresis loop, whereas the k(theta(w)) seems to be less hysteretic. The effects of the vertical <b>net</b> <b>normal</b> stress {{appear to be more}} pronounced than that of the drying-wetting cycle on k(theta(w)). As average vertical <b>net</b> <b>normal</b> stress is increased from 4 to 78 kPa, the measured permeability decreases by up to two orders of magnitude at a given VWC.
