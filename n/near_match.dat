She was still holding a packet of cachous (breath freshening sweets) in her left hand when she was discovered, indicating {{that she had not}} had time to defend herself. A grocer, Matthew Packer, implied to private detectives employed by the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee that he had sold some grapes to Stride and the murderer; however, he had told police that he had shut his shop without seeing anything suspicious.

They described her stomach contents as [...] "cheese, potatoes and farinaceous powder [...] ". Nevertheless, Packer's story appeared in the press. Packer's description of the man did not match the statements by other witnesses who may have seen Stride with a man shortly before her murder, but all but two of the descriptions differed. Joseph Lawende passed through Mitre Square with two other men shortly before Eddowes was murdered there, and may have seen her with a man of about 30 years old, who was shabbily dressed, wore a peaked cap, and had a fair moustache. Chief Inspector Swanson noted that Lawende's description was a <b>near</b> <b>match</b> to another provided by one of the witnesses who may have seen Stride with her murderer.

40|$|Abstract. Finding a <b>match</b> (or <b>nearest</b> <b>match)</b> of an M item pattern {{against an}} N item text {{is a common}} {{computing}} task, useful in string matching and image matching. The best classical (i. e., non-quantum) string matching algorithms, which are Θ(N +M) time and query complexity, are improved in many cases in this paper using Grover’s quantum searching algorithm. Specifically, given quantum oracles that return the j th symbol in the text or pattern in constant time, we demonstrate a quantum string matching algorithm which returns a pattern match if it exists with query complexity O (√ N + M) and time complexity O (√ N log N + M log(MN)). Variations of this algorithm allow wildcard matches, can return the number of matches, can return the <b>nearest</b> <b>match</b> in case of no exact matches, {{as well as the}} first or last such match, and can return all <b>matches</b> or <b>near</b> <b>matches,</b> each with a slight change in complexity.

5000|$|AllMusic's Matt Collar rated Switch {{three stars}} out of five. He began the review negatively, with the claim [...] "For {{all intents and}} purposes, the death of Australian rock band INXS' lead singer, Michael Hutchence, in 1997 ended the band's career." [...] He argued that without Hutchence, there was little point in the band continuing, and criticised their use of Rockstar: INXS, arguing [...] "all the band was looking for was a {{relatively}} good-looking, relatively tuneful young man who could evince some cocksure rock smarminess." [...] Describing Hutchence as {{the best part of}} the old INXS, Collar argued that Switch could never equal its predecessors, but nonetheless noted some quality work—Fortune's lyrics on [...] "Devil's Party" [...] and [...] "Afterglow" [...] were approved of, though his vocals, Collar argued, could nowhere <b>near</b> <b>match</b> the original. Fortune's role as a [...] "Sex God" [...] was criticised, especially on [...] "the icky and somewhat offensive 'Hot Girls.'"

Similarly, the Kernel matching result reveals adopting either of the adaptation options also guarantee favorable effect on food security.

40|$|We {{argue that}} the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn were both formed with their {{rotation}} axes nearly perpendicular to their orbital planes, and that the large cur-rent tilt of the ringed planet was acquired in a post formation event.

Strong support for this model comes from i) a <b>near</b> <b>match</b> between the precession frequencies of Saturn’s pole and the orbital pole of Neptune and ii) the current directions that these poles point in space.

A static photomosaic is composed of small digital images or tiles, each having their own aesthetic value. If the tiles are prepared manually, the tile collections are typically small.

We investigate the use of colour adjustment and tile size variation techniques via genetic programming to improve the animated photomosaics. The results show that colour adjustment improved both visual quality and fitness. However, it can produce strange looking tiles. Tile size variation was able to focus on details in the target image but produced slightly worse fitness values than an equal-sized tiles approach. Combining these techniques revealed that, regardless of the size of tiles, colour adjustment was the dominant refinement. In conclusion, each of these techniques is able to produce an aesthetically different animation effect and presents a better mechanism for generatin...|$|E
40|$|The {{amphiphilic}} copolymers of the Pluronic {{family are}} known to be excellent dispersants for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in water, especially F 108 and F 127, which have rather long end-blocks of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). In this study, the structure of the CNT/polymer hybrid formed in water is evaluated by measurements of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast variation, as supported by cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) imaging. The homogeneous, stable, inklike dispersions exhibited very small isolated bundles of carbon nanotubes in cryo-TEM images. SANS experiments were conducted at different D(2) O/H(2) O content of the dispersing solvent. The data for both systems showed surprisingly minimal intensity values at 70 % D(2) O solvent composition, which is much higher than the expected value of 17 % D(2) O that is based on the scattering length density (SLD) of PEO. At this <b>near</b> <b>match</b> point, the data exhibited a q(- 1) power law relation of intensity to the scattering vector (q), indicating rodlike entities. Two models are evaluated, as extensions to Pederson's block copolymer micelles models. One is loosely adsorbed polymer chains on a rodlike CNT bundle. In the other, the hydrophobic block is considered to form a continuous hydrated shell on the CNT surface, whereas the hydrophilic blocks emanate into the solvent. Both models were found to fit the experimental data reasonably well.
