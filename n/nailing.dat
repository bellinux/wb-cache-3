5|$|McNamara showed {{early on}} {{that he was a}} clutch performer, <b>nailing</b> a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No. 17 Syracuse notched an 82-80 win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame in February. In a March game at Georgetown, McNamara missed a free-throw with 10 seconds left that allowed the Hoyas to force {{overtime}}. Until that point, McNamara had been a perfect 41-for-41 in conference play. However, McNamara made up for his miss, hitting two 3-pointers and adding another jumper in an 11-3 run to start overtime as Syracuse beat Mike Sweetney and the Georgetown Hoyas, 93-84. Ten of McNamara's 22 came in the extra frame.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhists in Saigon {{were aware}} that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and the doors were barricaded with furniture and reinforced by <b>nailing</b> wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps in Saigon that the raids were coming, allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E

The <b>nailed</b> joints with CN 75 <b>nails</b> had higher initial stiffness than the joints with CN 50 <b>nails,</b> provided the initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> joints connected with 3 or 5 <b>nails</b> was not always a simple product {{of the number of}} <b>nails</b> and the initial stiffness of <b>nailed</b> joints connected with a <b>nail,</b> and instead depended on the combination of wood species of the main member and <b>nail</b> dimensions.

5|$|The {{population}} initially {{opposed the}} Swedish reforms, {{as can be}} ascertained from church records and court transcripts. The Swedes did encounter civil revolts in many areas, including the Göinge district, in dense forest regions of northern Scania. The Swedish authorities resorted to extreme measures against the 17th-century rebels who were described as snapphanar, a term used for raiding enemy soldiers or bandits.. The punishments included the use of impalement breaking on the wheel, {{as well as the}} <b>nailing</b> of bodies to church doors.

5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and <b>nailing</b> the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E

40|$|Background: Proximal <b>nail</b> fold {{inflammation}} can {{be caused}} by many diseases and has not previously been recognized as a result of posterior embedding of the <b>nail.</b> We describe a new pattern of ingrowth that we have termed retronychia (‘‘retro’’—Latin for backwards; ‘‘onychia’’—Greek for <b>nail).</b> The term describes a combination of proximal <b>nail</b> plate ingrowth into the proximal <b>nail</b> fold which is associated with multiple generations of <b>nail</b> plate misaligned beneath the proximal <b>nail.</b> Objective: To describe a new pattern of <b>nail</b> ingrowth which causes a specific form of proximal <b>nail</b> fold paronychia. Methods: Collective cases were reported to a European <b>Nail</b> Society expert group. Results: Persistent proximal <b>nail</b> fold inflammation can result from an episode of trauma that disturbs longitudinal <b>nail</b> growth and results in reverse embedding of the <b>nail</b> plate. This can cause pain, inflammation, and granulation tissue formation, and is typically relieved by avulsion and antiinflammatory treatment. Limitations: We cannot demonstrate causality between the proposed precipitants and the clinical features. Conclusion: Retroncyhia represents proximal ingrowth of the <b>nail</b> that occurs when the <b>nail</b> embeds backwards into the proximal <b>nail</b> fold. <b>Nail</b> plate avulsion with supplementary medical management is curative.

40|$|The <b>nail</b> {{plate is}} the {{permanent}} {{product of the}} <b>nail</b> matrix. Its normal appearance and growth depend on the integrity of several components: the surrounding tissues or perionychium and the bony phalanx that are contributing to the <b>nail</b> apparatus or <b>nail</b> unit. The <b>nail</b> is inserted proximally in an invagination practically parallel to the upper surface of the skin and laterally in the lateral <b>nail</b> grooves. This pocket-like invagination has a roof, the proximal <b>nail</b> fold and a floor, the matrix from which the <b>nail</b> is derived. The germinal matrix forms {{the bulk of the}} <b>nail</b> plate. The proximal element forms the superficial third of the <b>nail</b> whereas the distal element provides its inferior two-thirds. The ventral surface of the proximal <b>nail</b> fold adheres closely to the <b>nail</b> for a short distance and forms a gradually desquamating tissue, the cuticle, made of the stratum corneum of both the dorsal and the ventral side of the proximal <b>nail</b> fold. The cuticle seals and therefore protects the ungual cul-de-sac. The <b>nail</b> plate is bordered by the proximal <b>nail</b> fold which is continuous with the similarly structured lateral <b>nail</b> fold on each side. The <b>nail</b> bed extends from the lunula to the hyponychium. It presents with parallel longitudinal rete ridges. This area, by contrast to the matrix has a firm attachment to the <b>nail</b> plate and <b>nail</b> avulsion produces a denudation of the <b>nail</b> bed. Colourless, but translucent, the highly vascular connective tissue containing glomus organs transmits a pink colour through the <b>nail.</b> Among its multiple functions, the <b>nail</b> provides counterpressure to the pulp that is essential to the tactile sensation involving the fingers and to the prevention of the hypertrophy of the distal wall tissue, produced after <b>nail</b> loss of the great toe <b>nail.</b> Journal ArticleFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
