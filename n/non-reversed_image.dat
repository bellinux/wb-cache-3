50|$|Another type of {{non-reversing}} mirror {{can be made}} {{by making}} the mirror concave (curved inwards like a bowl). At a certain distance from the mirror a <b>non-reversed</b> <b>image</b> will appear. The disadvantage of this is that it only works at a certain distance.|$|E
50|$|A {{non-reversing}} mirror (sometimes {{referred to}} as a flip mirror) is a mirror that presents its subject as it would be seen from the mirror. A non-reversing mirror can be made by connecting two regular mirrors at their edges at a 90 degree angle. If the join is positioned so that it is vertical, an observer looking into the angle will see a <b>non-reversed</b> <b>image.</b> This can be seen in public toilets when there are mirrors on two walls which are at right angles. Looking towards the corner, such an image is visible. The problem with this type of non-reversing mirror {{is that there is a}} big line down the middle interrupting the image. However, if first surface mirrors are used, and care is taken to set the angle to exactly 90 degrees, the join can be made invisible.|$|E
