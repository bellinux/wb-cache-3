5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities of emigration propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze of emigration, but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. <b>Newspaper</b> <b>advertising,</b> while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E

The timing of the release and the unrevealed funding for the distribution, estimated to have cost around $50 million, stimulated controversy and speculation about who distributed the film.

25|$|On Friday, November 20, United Press International's (UPI) {{wire service}} {{reported}} that book values for used Edsels had declined {{by as much}} as $400 based on condition and age immediately following the Ford press release. In some newspaper markets, dealers scrambled to renegotiate <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertising</b> contracts involving the 1960 Edsel models, while others dropped the name from their dealerships' advertising entirely. Ford issued a statement that it would distribute coupons to customers who purchased 1960 models (and carryover 1959 models) prior to the announcement, valued at $300 to $400 toward the purchase of new Ford products to offset the decreased values. The company also issued credits to dealers for stock unsold or received following the announcement.|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "Master Building" [...] is {{the name}} that {{appeared}} on official documents, the structure {{has long been known}} as Master Apartments or The Master. From 1939 onward <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertising</b> used both names constantly. One 1939 ad listed [...] "The Master. Choice 1, 2 room suites, serving pantries, full hotel service, all rooms outside; from $50 month unfurnished; few furnished, $65 month. Popular price restaurant. Home of Riverside Museum. Concerts, lectures, recitals free to residents." [...] The building continued to be called by both names after conversion to a housing cooperative in 1988. At that time it was described as having 335 apartments on 28 floors served by four elevators. Buyers were permitted to finance up to 90% of the purchase price and 28% of the monthly maintenance fee was tax deductible.|$|E
500|$|State governments {{retain the}} right to tax newspapers, just as they may tax other {{commercial}} products. Generally, however, taxes that focus exclusively on newspapers have been found unconstitutional. In Grosjean v. American Press Co. (1936), the Court invalidated a state tax on <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertising</b> revenues, holding {{that the role of}} the press in creating [...] "informed public opinion" [...] was vital. Similarly, some taxes that give preferential treatment to the press have been struck down. In Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland (1987), for instance, the Court invalidated an Arkansas law exempting [...] "religious, professional, trade and sports journals" [...] from taxation since the law amounted to the regulation of newspaper content. In Leathers v. Medlock (1991), the Supreme Court found that states may treat different types of the media differently, such as by taxing cable television, but not newspapers. The Court found that [...] "differential taxation of speakers, even members of the press, does not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing, particular ideas." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1940s <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertising</b> was {{supplemented}} by a poster campaign. Aimed at maintaining {{high levels of}} purchasing by women, the posters featured young ladies dressed to participate in various activities, including horse riding, swimming and hiking; the designs were the work of S. H. Benson, a London advertising agency whose clients included Bovril and Guinness. The Bulletin of the North Carolina State Board of Health hypothesised in 1916–17 that many provincial newspapers relied heavily on the revenues generated by advertisements from manufacturers of suspect remedies, and it speculated that editorial control had been applied to restrict extensive reporting of the Bile Beans court case. Similar suspicions had been raised almost ten years earlier by medical director Eric Pritchard {{who went on to}} highlight a clause showing <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertising</b> contracts could be revoked if the publication carried any material considered [...] "detrimental to the Company's interest".|$|E

2500|$|In early 2010, RT {{unveiled}} a highly controversial advertising campaign called [...] "Question More", {{which was created}} for the channel by Britain-based McCann Erickson.

[...] The ad was banned in American airports. Another showed a Western soldier [...] "merging" [...] into a Taliban fighter and asks: [...] "Is terror only inflicted by terrorists?" [...] One of RT's 2010 billboard advertisements won the British Awards for National <b>Newspaper</b> <b>Advertising</b> [...] "Ad of the Month".|$|E
2500|$|Invitations and <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertising</b> go out worldwide, {{and dozens}} of {{participants}} arrive in England with their aircraft.

During this time, predictable patriotic antagonisms quickly develop. Most of the contestants conform to national stereotypes, including the by-the-book, monocle-wearing Prussian officer Colonel Manfred von Holstein (Gert Fröbe); the impetuous Italian Count Emilio Ponticelli (Alberto Sordi), whose test flights wreck one aircraft after another; and the amorous Frenchman Pierre Dubois (Jean-Pierre Cassel). Yujiro Ishihara is the late-arriving Japanese naval officer Yamamoto, with a perfect (dubbed) Etonian accent.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} March 19, 2003, the New Jersey {{newspaper}} and website The Independent {{took note of}} Clark's efforts to impeach Bush and others, {{prior to the start}} of the Iraq War.

Bush impeached, and that approximately 150,000 have signed to impeach, he said." [...] A conservative magazine, The Weekly Standard, stated in an article dated February 27, 2004, [...] "...Ramsey Clark's VoteToImpeach.org is a serious operation", and noted the group had run full-sized <b>newspaper</b> <b>advertising</b> on both coasts of the U.S. though the Standard also went on to describe them as also being a [...] "angry petition stage." ...|$|E
