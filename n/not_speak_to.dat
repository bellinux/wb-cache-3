5|$|Mary Dudley {{said that}} if this were not true, I might be sure she would not {{say such a thing}} as it might cost her her life and she was acting now with the Queen's consent, but she (the Queen) would <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the Emperor's {{ambassador}} about it.|$|E
5|$|According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> {{one another}} again {{following}} their fight for 33 years, {{until they were}} asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, played between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined with Evers in signing a 10-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{skipped the}} World Group 1st round tie against Argentina, over fears he could {{exacerbate}} a knee injury, leaving the British {{team in a}} hopeless situation – they lost 4–1. Jamie was furious that Andy was letting them down and the Murrays would <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> each other for two weeks. Seven months later, as the brothers prepared for the tie against Austria, Andy declared that he had healed the rift with Jamie. When Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins were beaten in the doubles, John Lloyd suffered criticism for not playing Andy. Great Britain lost their World Group play-off to Austria 3–2 and were relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group I.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, {{including}} at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square. They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> each other again for 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Despite their celebrated {{success at}} turning {{spectacular}} plays in collaboration, {{relations between the}} teammates {{were said to have}} been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined Evers in signing a ten-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.|$|E
5|$|Lépine {{sat for a}} time in {{the office}} of the {{registrar}} on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{represented}} Great Britain at his maiden Olympics in Beijing 2008. He {{competed in}} the singles and doubles competitions. Despite being seeded sixth in the singles competition, he was eliminated {{in the first round}} by Chinese Taipei's Yen-hsun Lu. Along with his brother Jamie, he advanced to {{the second round of the}} doubles competition with a win over the Canadian pairing of Daniel Nestor and Frédéric Niemeyer. The Murray brothers were eliminated in the second round by France's Arnaud Clément and Michael Llodra. In February, Murray pulled out of the Davis Cup tie against Argentina, because of a knee injury, so Argentina thrashed the under-strength British team. Jamie Murray scathingly criticised Andy and they did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> each other for a fortnight. Their rift continued in the Olympic doubles, over a perceived lack of effort from Andy.|$|E
5|$|Wolves enjoyed an {{excellent}} {{start to the}} 1969–70 season, winning seven of their opening eight games, but fell away to a mid-table finish after the shock retirement of 24-year old forward Peter Knowles, who left the game to become a full-time Jehovah's Witness volunteer. Dougan had a poor season, limited to just ten goals in 33 games due to injuries and an eight-week suspension for verbally abusing a linesman in a home defeat to Everton. In the return fixture at Goodison Park, he suffered a clash of heads with full-back Keith Newton and had to undergo major re-constructive surgery and was out of action for two months. McGarry did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Dougan during his two-month absence, but Dougan decided against issuing a transfer request as {{he did not want}} to further his reputation as a journeyman player.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking on}} {{supplies}} at Las Palmas, Lucas sailed to Praia on Cape Verde, before continuing south on 29 May {{in the direction}} of the Brazilian coast, hoping to profit from favourable winds and currents. In fact, due to persistent calms, a position off the Brazilian shore was only reached on 27 June. Because of the delay, Lucas decided not to supply himself but to sail directly to the Cape. Because Lucas made no stops on his journey between Cape Verde and the Cape, the fact that his voyage took far longer than a journey of this distance should have taken has surprised several authors. Historian C. Northcote Parkinson ascribed the delay, at least partially, to the poor quality of seamanship among Lucas's crews. The Batavian expeditionary force did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding British dispositions when it eventually reached the Cape on 26 July. They first reconnoitred Saldanha Bay, then Table Bay to the south, and eventually on 6 August they anchored in Saldanha Bay.|$|E

5|$|Maitland showed Napoleon {{the great}} cabin, {{which he had}} placed at his disposal, {{and gave him a}} tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m. the Superb {{anchored}} in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard the Bellerophon. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on the Superb, and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS Myrmidon. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, only talking with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as Bellerophon came in sight of Ushant, the last piece of French land visible {{for the remainder of the}} journey. He climbed up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> any of them.|$|E

25|$|According to the article, some {{contemporary}} {{ministers and}} theologians chose {{to focus on}} the life and teachings of Jesus, rather than on God, since Christ was a figure with great appeal among the broader population, but this solution ran dangerously close to ethical humanism. Biblical literalism, on the other hand, might have had an appeal to the fervent believer, but did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> most people in a world where the language of the Bible was increasingly unfamiliar.|$|E
25|$|Thompson {{spent the}} next nine years (3,278 days) as a {{prisoner}} of war, first {{at the hands of}} the Viet Cong in the South Vietnam jungles, until he was moved in 1967 to the Hanoi prison system. During his captivity, he was tortured, starved, and isolated from other American POWs. At one point, Thompson did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> another American for over five years. He was released with the other POWs in mid-March 1973 in Operation Homecoming.|$|E
25|$|Osbourne's father, Don Arden, was a {{rock and}} roll {{entrepreneur}} who managed Black Sabbath and sacked Ozzy Osbourne from the group. He resented his daughter for dating Ozzy and managing his career. While visiting her parents, her mother's dogs attacked her and it was some time before her mother appeared to call them off. She was pregnant {{at the time and}} subsequently lost the baby. She soon lost contact with her father and did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him for 20 years.|$|E
