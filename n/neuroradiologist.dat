5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, <b>neuroradiologist,</b> and often other health professionals.|$|E
25|$|The Loes {{score is}} {{a rating of}} the {{severity}} of abnormalities in the brain found on MRI. It ranges from 0 to 34, based on a point system derived from the location and extent of disease and the presence of atrophy in the brain, either localized to specific points or generally throughout the brain. A Loes score of 0.5 or less is classified as normal, while a Loes score of 14 or greater is considered severe. It was developed by <b>neuroradiologist</b> Daniel J. Loes MD and is an important tool in assessing disease progression and the effectiveness of therapy.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) is an {{established}} 10 -point quantitative topographic {{computed tomography scan}} score to assess early ischemic changes. We performed a non-inferiority trial between the e-ASPECTS software and <b>neuroradiologists</b> in scoring ASPECTS on non-contrast enhanced computed tomography images of acute ischemic stroke patients. METHODS: In this multicenter study, e-ASPECTS and three independent <b>neuroradiologists</b> retrospectively and blindly assessed baseline non-contrast enhanced computed tomography images of 132 patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Follow-up scans served as ground truth to determine the definite area of infarction. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for region- and score-based analysis, receiver-operating characteristic curves, Bland-Altman plots and Matthews correlation coefficients relative to the ground truth were calculated and comparisons were made between <b>neuroradiologists</b> and different pre-specified e-ASPECTS operating points. The non-inferiority margin was set to 10 % for both sensitivity and specificity on region-based analysis. RESULTS: In total 2640 (132 patients[*]×[*] 20 regions per patient) ASPECTS regions were scored. Mean time from onset to baseline computed tomography was 146 [*]±[*] 124 [*]min and median NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 11 (6 - 17, interquartile range). Median ASPECTS for ground truth on follow-up imaging was 8 (6. 5 - 9, interquartile range). In the region-based analysis, two e-ASPECTS operating points (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 44 %, 93 %, 87 % and 44 %, 91 %, 85 %) were statistically non-inferior to all three <b>neuroradiologists</b> (all p-values andlt; 0. 003). Both Matthews correlation coefficients for e-ASPECTS were higher (0. 36 and 0. 34) than those of all <b>neuroradiologists</b> (0. 32, 0. 31, and 0. 3).

40|$|The goal of {{our study}} was to {{determine}} the interobserver variability between observers with different backgrounds and experience when interpreting computed tomography (CT) imaging features of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We retrospectively identified a consecutive series of 50 adult patients admitted at our institution with a suspicion of TBI, and displaying a Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 12. Noncontrast CT (NCT) studies were anonymized and sent to five reviewers with different backgrounds and levels of experience, who independently reviewed each NCT scan. Each reviewer assessed multiple CT imaging features of TBI and assigned every NCT scan a Marshall and a Rotterdam grading score. The interobserver agreement and coefficient of variation were calculated for individual CT imaging features of TBI as well as for the two scores. Our results indicated that the imaging review by both <b>neuroradiologists</b> and neurosurgeons were consistent with each other. The kappa coefficient of agreement for all CT characteristics showed no significant difference in interpretation between the neurosurgeons and <b>neuroradiologists.</b> The average Bland and Altman coefficients of variation for the Marshall and Rotterdam classification systems were 12. 7 % and 21. 9 %, respectively, which indicates acceptable agreement among all five reviewers.
