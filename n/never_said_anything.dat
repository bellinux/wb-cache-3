However, when Walke ordered Phelps to proceed to the next fort with him, Phelps refused, having already received a message to rendezvous with Commander Foote at Cario. Walke felt that Phelps refusal amounted to “insubordination” but Foote <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> about the disagreement.|$|E

500|$|Dudley {{negotiated}} a separate {{peace with the}} Abenakis at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1713. [...] He hoped to separate the western Kennebec tribe from French influence and consequently adopted a fairly hard line, threatening to withhold trade that was vital to their survival and reiterating claims of British sovereignty over the Abenaki. [...] The Treaty of Portsmouth resulted from those negotiations and repeats the claims of sovereignty. Dudley claimed that the French had ceded Abenaki lands as part of Acadia, and one sachem responded: [...] "The French <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to us about it, and we wonder how they would give it away without asking us". [...] Nevertheless, Dudley and succeeding governors treated the Abenaki as British subjects, and friction persisted over British colonial expansion into Maine which flared into Dummer's War in the 1720s.|$|E
500|$|Ferreira {{was largely}} raised by her grandmother, {{who had been}} Michael Jackson's {{personal}} hairstylist for over 30 years. She commented, saying: [...] "I was raised around him, I always saw him [...] had holidays with him and stuff like that", adding that she was unaware of his fame until she was 13 years old. Ferreira expressed interest in singing as a child and, with Jackson's encouragement, Ferreira's grandmother enrolled her in opera lessons. Ferreira has stated that she was sexually assaulted in her adolescence twice, firstly involving a neighbor, and secondly in an incident that involved a stranger who had broken into her home. In an interview with Rookie, Ferreira said: [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> [...] because I don't want it to define me, but I feel like it's appropriate to say something [...] People feel like it defines you, and it doesn't. It's really unfortunate and disgusting and traumatizing, but it doesn't make you who you are." [...] Ferreira {{dropped out of high}} school after completing her sophomore year.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E

500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E

When quizzed about his views during his party leadership bid in July 2016, Crabb said: [...] "I don't believe that being gay is a sin. I don't believe it's something to be cured. I've <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> like that." [...] and claimed accusations to the contrary were [...] "a complete falsehood spread by political opponents".

Dalton Trumbo's troubles were that The Hollywood Reporter had publicly named him and a dozen or so other industry professionals as communist sympathizers, and that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) had seized upon this list as the starting point for their investigation into communist influence in Hollywood. [...] Paulette Goddard was a rising star at Paramount and the studio was heavily invested in her, but she was also at risk of being swept into the HUAC's investigation by virtue of her marriage to actor Burgess Meredith, whose communist affiliations were a matter of record.|$|E
2500|$|Following Michael Heinrich, David Harvey criticized Engels's editing of Capital, Volume III, and {{emphasized}} {{in a conference}} text that Engels himself inserted the sentence [...] "In practice, however, the rate of profit will fall in the long run, as we have already seen." [...] The suggestion is, that in the text preceding Engels's inserted sentence, Marx himself had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> about such a long-run falling tendency. Harvey's view contrasts with Marx's preceding text, in which Marx says that as the capitalist mode of production advances, its general rate of profit must steadily decline, [...] "since the mass of living labour applied continuously declines {{in relation to the}} mass of objectified labor [...] that it sets in motion." [...] However, Michael Heinrich argues that Marx in his old age paid no attention anymore to the falling tendency, suggesting it was no longer important to him.|$|E

[...] The Zionist Organization of America unsuccessfully lobbied the university to rescind its invitation to Kushner. During the controversy, quotes critical of Zionism and Israel made by Kushner were circulated. Kushner {{said at the time}} that his quotes were [...] "grossly mischaracterized." [...] Kushner told the Jewish Advocate in an interview, [...] "All that anybody seems to be reading is a couple of right-wing Web sites taking things deliberately out of context and excluding anything that would complicate the picture by making me seem like a reasonable person, which I basically think I am." [...] In an interview with the Jewish Independent, Kushner commented, [...] "I want the state of Israel to continue to exist. I've always said that. I've <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> else. My positions have been lied about and misrepresented in so many ways. People claim that I'm for a one-state solution, which is not true."

2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E

In the story, {{a young girl}} named Aasé has the prophetic power of speaking the truth in her sleep. In an 1846 English translation, Aasé is described thus:She is somewhat palefaced; and, however blithe and sprightly she may be, she is, nevertheless, now and then troubled {{with a kind of}} dreaming fit. But that will wear off as she gets older. Her mother was so troubled before her; and I believe it runs in the family as I am not entirely free from it myself. I do not give much heed to such dreaming now; but she has <b>never</b> yet <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> while in this state, that has not proved in a manner true; though she can discern nothing, by night or day, more than others may do when they are in their senses.Walt Whitman wrote a now-lost novel based on Ingemann's romance, which he titled The Sleeptalker.|$|R
