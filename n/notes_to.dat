5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter.

Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, would be good for the country. He wrote three or four more <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E
