If the cannon is bronze, it will often have a vent piece made of copper screwed into the length of the vent.|$|E

5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (<b>near)</b> <b>end</b> is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis was {{generally}} similar to H.antimena, the largest living rodent of Madagascar, but even larger, with {{little if any}} overlap in measurements. Grandidier described the extinct species as more robust, with more prominent muscle scars on the long bones and with longer molars with more distinct crests and lobes. The length of the first lower molar is 5.2 to 6.4mm, averaging 5.7mm, in ten H.australis and 3.9 to 5.5mm, averaging 4.8mm, in twenty-four H.antimena. The width of the femur at the proximal (<b>near)</b> <b>end</b> is 18.6 to 21.5mm, averaging 19.9mm, in thirteen H.australis and 16.8 to 18.5mm, averaging 17.5mm, in nine H.antimena. In ten H.australis, total length of the femur is 69.9 to 75.1mm, averaging 72.1mm, compared to 59.7 to 69.9mm, averaging 63.8mm in nine H.antimena.|$|E
5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, the penis is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (<b>near)</b> <b>end</b> is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E

25|$|In the 1940s, bomb {{designers}} at Los Alamos {{thought the}} secondary {{would be a}} canister of deuterium in liquefied or hydride form.

A fission bomb at one end would shock-compress and heat the <b>near</b> <b>end,</b> and fusion would propagate through the canister to the far end.

25|$|The Battle of Orthez (27 February 1814) saw the Anglo-Portuguese Army {{commanded}} by Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington attack a Imperial French army under Marshal Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult. Soult's army was posted {{on a ridge}} {{to the north of}} the town of Orthez in southern France and in the town itself. For over two hours the outnumbered French repulsed repeated Allied assaults on their right flank, forcing Wellington to order a general assault. After a struggle, the Allies overcame the French defenses and Soult was compelled to order a retreat. At first, the French divisions withdrew in good order, but as they approached the bridge over the Luy de Béarn at Sault-de-Navailles, many soldiers began to panic. The next day Soult decided that his army was too demoralized to resist more attacks and continued his retreat. Allied casualties were about 2,200 while the French lost about 4,000 killed, wounded and captured. The battle was fought <b>near</b> <b>end</b> of the Peninsular War.|$|E

25|$|MTU-20 (Ob'yekt 602) (Tankoviy Mostoukladchik) - T-54 {{converted}} into a bridge-layer tank. It has a twin-treadway superstructure mounted on a modified chassis. Each treadway {{is made up of}} a box-type aluminum girder with a folding ramp attached to both ends to save space while the bridge is in the travel position. The vehicle with the bridge in the traveling position is 11.6 m long. When set up, the bridge is 20 m long. This is an increase of about 62% over that of the older MTU-1. The bridge is launched using the cantilever method. First, the ramps are lowered and fully extended before the treadways are forward with the full load of the bridge resting on the forward support plate during launch. The span is moved out over the launching girder until the far end reaches the far bank. Next, the <b>near</b> <b>end</b> is lowered onto the near bank. This method of launching gives the bridgelayer a low silhouette, which makes it less vulnerable to detection and destruction.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} San Francisco 49ers, an old rival from the AAFC, {{at home in}} the ninth game of the season. The 49ers scored first after {{blocking}} a Gillom punt and recovering at Cleveland's one-yard line in the first quarter. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Frankie Albert ran for a touchdown on the following play. The Browns' Chubby Grigg recovered a fumble by San Francisco's Sam Cathcart at the 49ers' seven-yard line <b>near</b> <b>end</b> of the first quarter, setting up a short touchdown pass from Graham to Jones. A 22-yard rushing touchdown by Motley put the Browns ahead midway through the second quarter, but San Francisco tied the game {{at the end of the}} half with a pass from Albert to Alyn Beals. A fumble by Joe Perry, one of five he made in the game, led to a Groza field goal 10 minutes into the third quarter. Groza added to the lead with another field goal in the fourth quarter, and the Browns surged ahead at the end of the game by capitalizing on San Francisco interceptions and fumbles. Both Jones and Bumgardner scored rushing touchdowns, securing a 34–14 win.|$|E
