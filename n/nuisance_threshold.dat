40|$|We {{present a}} {{scientific}} replication of a benthic algae <b>nuisance</b> <b>threshold</b> study originally conducted in Montana, {{but we do}} so using a different sampling methodology in a different state. Respondents are asked to rate eight photographs that depict varying algae conditions. Our initial results show that Utah resident preferences for benthic algae levels are quite {{similar to those of}} Montana residents, thus replicating the Montana study. For the full Utah sample, though, Cronbachís ? indicated poor internal consistency in rating the photographs, so a ëmonotonicity ruleí was used to identify respondents providing monotonic preferences with respect to chlorophyll a densities. Simple graphical analyses are combined with ordered probit analysis to determine the maximum desirable density of chlorophyll a (Chl a). Our analysis indicates that Chl a levels in excess of 150 mg Chl a/m 2 are undesirable, but the regression model suggests that those with strictly monotonic preferences were far more likely favor a more stringent standard...|$|E

30|$|Whole-brain {{statistical}} {{analysis was performed}} at the voxel level using SPM 8 software (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, University College, London) [11]. PET images were spatially normalized onto the PET template of the Montreal National Institute (MNI) space [12], smoothed with a Gaussian filter (8  mm full-width at half-maximum), resulting in 2 [*]×[*] 2 [*]×[*] 2  mm voxel images. Proportional scaling was applied. SPM (T) maps were generated for correlation of metabolism with clinical scores before therapy using regression linear models and comparison before and after VRET using paired t tests (p voxel <[*] 0.005, corrected for cluster volume, with age and gender as nuisance covariates). To evaluate metabolic connectivity from the previously identified metabolic clusters in the intergroup comparison, IRCA was performed as previously described [13], with the same <b>nuisance</b> covariates and <b>threshold</b> as previously detailed for the group SPM (T) map comparisons.|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{critical}} review of North American odour regulations, {{it was concluded that}} current statutory <b>nuisance</b> laws and <b>threshold</b> principles do not meet the requirements of an effective regulatory strategy. An Odour Impact Model (OIM) developed previously helps to solve this deficiency by incorporating the effects of odour hedonics into odour impact assessments. This investigation fit a mathematical expression to the OIM dose-response curves of six pure odorants. A natural extension of this {{led to the development of}} the Odour Impact Dispersion Model (OIDM). This model merges the OIM's dose-response profiles with atmospheric dispersion modelling to predict and map a surrounding community's probability of response and degree of annoyance to an odorous emissions. The OIDM is applied to a case-study to investigate the impact of the facility's odorous emissions on surrounding communities. Recommendations for the development of an effective regulatory strategy for measuring and predicting the impact of odorous emissions are presented...|$|R
40|$|Our {{ultimate}} {{objective is}} to design cost-effective control strategies for Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, an important urban nuisance and disease vector that expanded worldwide during the last 40 years. We conducted mosquito larval surveys from May through October 2009 in the City of Trenton, New Jersey, USA, while performing intensive monthly source-reduction campaigns that involved removing, emptying, or treating all accessible containers with larvicides and pupicides. We examined patterns of occurrence of Ae. albopictus and Culex pipiens, another urban mosquito, among different container types by comparing observed and expected number of positive containers of each type. Expected use {{was based on the}} relative frequency of each container type in the environment. Aedes albopictus larvae and pupae were found significantly more often than expected in medium volumes of water in buckets and plant saucers but were rarely collected in small volumes of water found in trash items such as discarded cups and cans. They were also absent from large volumes of water such as in abandoned swimming pools and catch basins, although we consistently collected Cx. pipiens from those habitats. The frequency of Ae. albopictus in tires indicated rapid and extensive use of these ubiquitous urban containers. Standard larval-based indices did not correlate with adult catches in BG-Sentinel traps, but when based only on Ae. albopictus key containers (buckets, plant saucers, equipment with pockets of water, and tires) they did. Although we found that only 1. 2 % of the 20, 039 water-holding containers examined contained immature Ae. albopictus (5. 3 % if only key containers were counted), adult populations were still above <b>nuisance</b> action <b>thresholds</b> six times during the 2009 mosquito season. We conclude that in urban New Jersey, effective source reduction for Ae. albopictus control will require scrupulous and repeated cleaning or treatment of everyday use containers and extensive homeowner collaboration...|$|R
40|$|Background Open drug {{scenes are}} gatherings {{of drug users}} who {{publicly}} consume and deal drugs. The authors conducted a study of five European cities that have met such scenes constructively. The aim was to investigate shared and non-shared interventions and strategies {{in order to increase}} the understanding of this type of problem. Methods First a description was made for the cities of Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Vienna, Zürich and Lisbon. These descriptions were sent to contact persons in each city prior to visit by the researchers. The methods and strategies in each city were discussed and core choices and efforts extracted. A report was sent to the contact group for corrections and clarifications. The paper analyses shared and non-shared traits and strategies. Results All of the cities had initially a period with conflict between liberal and restrictive policies. A political consensus seems to be a prerequisite for effective action. A core shared characteristic was that drug dependence was met as a health problem and drug use behaviour as a public <b>nuisance</b> problem. Low <b>threshold</b> health services including opioid maintenance treatment were combined with outreach social work and effective policing. Conclusion Prevention, harm reduction and treatment should be combined with law enforcement based on cooperation between police, health care and social services. The aim should be “coexistence” between society and users of illegal substances and the strategy based on several years planning and conjoint efforts. The solutions are found in appropriate combinations of harm reduction and restrictive measures...|$|R
