5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E

5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} when it is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|Burial 6 was a cist located {{under the}} first chamber of the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). It had been heavily looted, to an extent that it was <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} if the scattered human remains of at least four people belonged to one burial or several. The bones belonged to two children and two young adult females and fragments of ceramic offerings were also identified.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, it is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} the exact number involved. However, it has been estimated that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E
5|$|Eight Chinook HC Mk3s {{were ordered}} in 1995 as {{dedicated}} special forces helicopters, which {{were intended to}} be low-cost variants of the US Army's MH-47E. The Mk3s include improved range, night vision sensors and navigation capability. The eight aircraft were to cost £259million and the forecast in-service date was November 1998. Although delivered in 2001, the Mk3 could not receive airworthiness certificates as it was <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> certify the avionics software.|$|E
5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, although it is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> numerically integrate its orbit {{for more than a}} few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{estimate}} {{the chances of}} another very bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its perihelion passage and had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings, {{and less}} {{white in the}} tail feathers. They can also be {{distinguished}} by their constant begging calls. It is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> tell the sexes apart until the male's bill begins to darken. This begins when the male is around one year old, and is complete some time {{after two years of}} age.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second lift arrived, the first supply drop was made onto LZ 'L'. Although most {{supplies}} arrived, {{only a small amount}} could be collected as the area was not under full British control. The poor radio communication meant that it was <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> alert the RAF and unsecured drop zones would be a major problem in the days to come.|$|E

30|$|In {{a real-life}} setting, {{there will be}} cases where very small units of data carry a {{significant}} amount of sensitive information, such as blood type for patients. It will thus be imperative that not only shall it <b>not</b> be <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> match e.g. a blood type to an identity, but in storage it should also <b>not</b> be <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> determine what the data item refers to.|$|R
5|$|Sōryūs {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of nine A6M Zeros and seventeen D3As. The former attacked Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, losing one Zero to American anti-aircraft guns. On the return trip, the Zero pilots {{claimed to have}} shot down two American aircraft while losing two of their own. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but it is <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two of them were shot down during the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral {{upper respiratory tract}} infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and bronchitis the lungs. However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected. The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> identify the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators {{did not believe that}} it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E

5|$|The {{telescope}} possibly detected {{signals from}} Venera 1, a Russian satellite {{en route to}} Venus, in 19–20 May 1961. However, it was <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> confirm {{the origin of the}} signals. A few years later, in December 1962, the telescope tracked and received data from Mariner 2. On 18 October 1967, the telescope received signals from, and tracked, Venera 4, a Russian probe to Venus.|$|E
5|$|The {{underwater}} {{search was}} beset by technical problems and eventually abandoned. Diagrams and notes {{included in the}} declassified documents make clear it was <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> search the entire area where crash debris had spread. Four bomb reservoirs, one nearly intact secondary, and parts equaling two secondaries were recovered on the sea ice; parts equaling one secondary were not accounted for. The search also revealed a weapon cable fairing, polar cap, and a one-foot by three-foot section of a warhead's ballistic case.|$|E
5|$|A Free Ride {{was first}} shown to its target {{audience}} in 1915. At that time, it was <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> screen stag films in public theaters {{due to the}} Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A Free Ride was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E
