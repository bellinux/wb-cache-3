30|$|The {{evaluation}} of the maxillary sinus health was performed by a single otolaryngologist at the hospital. The clinical exam also included questions on {{signs and symptoms of}} sinus disease. Cone-beam computed tomography was performed on all patients. For patients with signs indicating maxillary sinusitis, a quality of life questionnaire was administered and video-assisted <b>nasal</b> <b>fibroscopy</b> was performed.|$|E
40|$|Patients with obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) may have {{subclinical}} swallowing abnormalities due to progressive mechanical trauma of the pharyngeal tissues caused by snoring. There are few trials on swallowing among OSA patients, {{and most of them}} used videoradiography. the aim of this trial was to show swallowing function in OSA patients by <b>nasal</b> <b>fibroscopy.</b> Eleven patients with OSA diagnosed by polysomnography, {{with a mean age of}} 48 +/- 14 years, without spontaneous complaints of swallowing, and 14 non-snoring volunteers, with a mean age of 47 +/- 12 years, without spontaneous complaints of swallowing, participated in the study. the participants were evaluated using <b>nasal</b> <b>fibroscopy.</b> Each participant was offered diet boluses (5 and 10 ml) such as thin liquids, pur,e, and solids, and their swallowing function was determined according to the following criteria: (1) premature oral leakage to the pharynx; (2) laryngeal penetration; (3) tracheal aspiration; and (4) pharyngeal stasis. Sixty-four percent of the OSA patients presented premature oral leakage, 55 % presented pharyngeal stasis of the bolus after swallowing, and we did not observe laryngeal penetration or tracheal aspiration. There were no subclinical manifestations in the control group. OSA patients presented subclinical manifestations of abnormal swallowing, when analyzed using <b>nasal</b> <b>fibroscopy,</b> possibly associated with neuromuscular injury caused by snoring.

30|$|Among the 14 {{patients}} {{submitted to}} zygomatic implants, only three reported having had nasal obstruction {{in the weeks}} preceding the evaluation. One of these patients had a cold, {{and the other two}} reported having self-medicated with antihistamines 1  week prior to the evaluation, with the subsequent disappearance of nasal obstruction. Only one patient reported headache and the sensation of pressure in the region of the maxillary sinus. This patient was submitted to video-assisted <b>nasal</b> <b>fibroscopy,</b> which revealed the maintenance of ostium patency and no drainage of secretions into the middle meatus (bilaterally). The tomographic exam demonstrated the absence of sinusitis. No patient had pain upon palpation or periorbital edema. Only one patient exhibited halitosis, but this clinical sign was related to poor oral hygiene rather than sinusitis.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe supraglottic plan {{represents}} an important dimension in vocal production, and its characterization {{is very important}} in the evaluation and treatment approach of dysphonic individuals. Aimto check if certain glottic configurations are related to specific adjustments in the vocal tract. To use <b>nasal</b> and laryngeal <b>fibroscopy</b> to assess the frequency of supraglottic vocal tract adjustments in dysphonic women with nodules, clefts and cysts. MethodsWe assessed 31 dysphonic women, with age ranging between 18 and 45 years, with vocal alteration and a diagnosis of nodules, middle-posterior cleft and cyst, and we carried out a summarized evaluation of the sensory-motor and oral systems and the patients were submitted to video-laryngostroboscopy and <b>nasal</b> and laryngeal <b>fibroscopy.</b> Three distinct groups were selected: patients with bilateral nodules, clefts and cysts, with similar glottic configuration. Their vocal tracts were visually analyzed through exams of <b>nasal</b> and laryngeal <b>fibroscopy,</b> by speech and hearing therapists and otorhinolaryngologists, checking the following parameters: supraglottic constriction, larynx vertical mobility, pharyngeal constriction and tongue mobility. The data was statistically described and treated. Resultsduring visual analysis we did not find statistically significant differences which would separate the glottic alterations groups. ConclusionThere was no correlation between supraglottic tract adjustments with any particular type of glottic alteration. These are individual behaviors that generate adjustments and justify the different vocal qualities in patients with the same type of laryngeal alteration...|$|R
40|$|O plano supraglótico representa uma importante dimensão na produção vocal, sendo de grande relevância sua caracterização na avaliação e conduta terapêutica de indivíduos disfônicos. OBJETIVO: Verificar se determinadas configurações glóticas se relacionam com ajustes específicos de trato vocal. Avaliar por meio da nasofibrolaringoscopia a freqüência dos ajustes do trato vocal supraglótico em mulheres disfônicas com nódulos, fendas e cistos. MÉTODO: Foram avaliadas 31 mulheres disfônicas, faixa etária entre 18 e 45 anos, com alteração vocal e diagnóstico de nódulos, fenda médioposterior e cisto e realizada avaliação resumida do sistema sensório-motor e oral e exames de videolaringoestroboscopia e nasofibrolaringoscopia. Três grupos distintos foram selecionados: pacientes com nódulos bilaterais, com fenda e com cisto, com configurações glóticas semelhantes. Foi realizada, por fonoaudiólogas e otorrinolaringologistas, a análise visual do trato vocal dos exames de nasofibrolaringoscopia, verificando os parâmetros de: constrição supraglótica, mobilidade {{vertical}} da laringe, constrição faríngea e mobilidade de língua. Os dados foram descritos e tratados estatisticamente. RESULTADOS: Na análise visual não foi encontrada diferença estatística significante que separasse os grupos das alterações glóticas. CONCLUSÃO: Não houve correlação dos ajustes do trato supraglótico com determinado tipo de alteração glótica. São comportamentos individuais que geram os ajustes e justificam as diferentes qualidades vocais em pacientes com mesmo tipo de alteração laríngea.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} rapid maxillary expansion on children with nasal breathing and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Method: Recruitment of children with maxillary contraction, without of adenoid hypertrophy, with a body mass index < 24 kg/m 2, with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome demonstrated by polysomnography, and whose parents signed informed consent. Otolaryngologic and orthognathic-odontologic evaluation with clinical evaluation, anterior rhinometry and <b>nasal</b> <b>fibroscopy,</b> panoramic radiographs, anteroposterior and laterolateral telecephalometry were performed at entry and follow-up. Intervention: Rapid maxillary expansion (ie, active phase of treatment) was performed for 10 to 20 days; maintenance of device (for consolidation) and orthodontic treatment on teeth lasted 6 to 12 months. Results: 31 children (19 boys), mean age 8. 7 years, participated in the study. The mean apnea-hypopnea index was 12. 2 events per hour. At the 4 -month follow-up, the anterior rhinometry was normal, and all children had an apnea-hypopnea index < 1 event per hour. The mean cross-sectional expansion of the maxilla was 4. 32 +/- 0. 7 mm. There was a mean increase of the pyriform opening of 1. 3 +/- 0. 3 mm. Conclusion: Rapid maxillary expansion may be a useful approach in dealing with abnormal breathing during sleep...|$|E
