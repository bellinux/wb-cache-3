Brows are knitted to mournful cellos, Poppy shouts from a motorway bridge, and there's a lot of staring out to sea, which inevitably brings on further flashbacks.

5000|$|A {{first year}} in high school, Misaki is close friends with Meguru and Yuu, {{as well as the}} next door {{neighbor}} and childhood friend of the Zaitsu brothers. Misaki ("Saki" [...] for short) is a teenage girl who is rather tall for her age (she ranks as among the three tallest of the female characters) and is notable for having a well-endowed body, and is highly sought after by the boys around her (with the exception of Yuuji Arihara.) She has a very open relationship with her neighbors. She even comes into Mamoru's room through his window, and appears to be the only character in the series who's not afraid of Misao (mostly due to having grown up together). She somehow knows and is very proficient with wrestling, and can perform submissions instinctively in her sleep; in the anime, she was seen executing some on a hesitant Misao to get some answers out of him. She even has a penchant for loudly declaring the name of her wrestling moves as she performs them. In the manga, she is revealed to be a K-1 fan. Though she claimed she had no interest in relationships at the moment, she developed an interest for Yuuji Arihara when he shoved a lollipop in her mouth (showing an example to his friend, Yoshihiko Bessho). But although she likes Yuuji, she is not used to feeling vulnerable around boys, because she's usually cool and level headed. When Yuuji begins to express his interest in her (In the same way she did to him), it makes her shy and unsettled, so she tells Arihara to leave her alone. He later explains that love is about letting people see your other sides as well, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>your</b> tough side. They seem to be dating after the series end. It was also revealed that being an only child, she's quite envious at those who have siblings, and thus, as part of her attraction to Yuuji, she also takes a liking to his younger sister Ayumi, treating her as a younger sister of her own.|$|E
