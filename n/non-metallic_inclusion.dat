40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the results of the research on the influence of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> on strength properties of 35 B 2 +Cr steel screws. Design/methodology/approach: The investigations were carried out on screws after softening.

40|$|The {{modification}} of the chemical composition of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> by rare-earth elements in the new-developed microalloyed steels was discussed in the paper. The investigated steels are assigned to production of forged elements by thermo- mechanical treatment. The steels were melted in a vaccum induction furnace and {{modification of}} <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> {{was carried out by}} the michmetal in the amount of 2. 0 g per 1 kg of steel. It was found that using material charge of high purity and a realization of metallurgical process in vacuous conditions result in a low concentration of sulfur (0. 004 %), phosphorus (from 0. 006 to 0. 008 %) and oxygen (6 ppm). The high metallurgical purity is confirmed by a small fraction of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> averaging 0. 075 %.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{identify}} the type, fraction and chemical composition of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> modified by rare-earth elements in an advanced group of high-manganese austenitic C-Mn-Si-Al-type steels with Nb and Ti microadditions. Design/methodology/approach: The heats of 3 high-Mn steels of a various content of Si, Al and Ti were melted in a vacuum induction furnace and a modification of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> {{was carried out by}} the mischmetal in the amount of 0. 87 g or 1. 74 g per 1 kg of steel. Evaluation of the metallurgical purity of steels with <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> was done basing on determination their fraction, type, size and morphology. Stereological parameters of the inclusions were assessed by the use of automatic image analyzer cooperating with light microscope. EDS method was used to assess the chemical composition of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions.</b> Findings: It was found that the steels are characterized by high metallurgical purity connected to low concentrations of phosphorus and gases at a slightly higher sulphur content, introduced to a melt together with electrolytic manganese. The steels contain fine sulfide inclusions with a mean size from 21 to 25 µm 2 in a majority and their fraction equals from 0. 047 to 0. 09 %, depending on sulphur content. MnS, carbonitrides of the (Ti,Nb) (C,N) type and complex carbosulfides containing Mn, Ti and Nb were identified in steels. The beneficial influence in decreasing a fraction of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> and their susceptibility to elongate in a rolling direction has a higher addition of mischmetal and titanium microaddition. A modification of the chemical composition of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> by Ce, La and Nd proceeds in an external zone of inclusions. Research limitations/implications: Further investigations relating the type and morphology of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> to mechanical properties of sheets at various sections according to the rolling direction are needed. Practical implications: The knowledge of the type and morphology of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusions</b> forming in high-Mn alloys and the effectiveness of their modification has a significant meaning for metallurgical and steel making technologies.

40|$|The {{flow pattern}} has widely been {{recognized}} {{to have an}} impact on the exogenous <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusion</b> generation in the gating system and mold flux entrapment in the uphill teeming process. Thus, a well-controlled flow pattern during the teeming process can improve the quality of ingots and further increase the yield during steel production. The current study focused on investigating and optimizing the flow pattern of steel in the gating system and molds to improve steel cleanliness during the initial filling moment. A mathematical model considering a trumpet was initially compared to a reduced model only considering part of the runner channel. Thereafter, the influence of swirl blades implemented at the bottom of the vertical runner on the improvement of initial filling conditions in the molds was investigated in a model considering the entire mold system including a trumpet. The effects of a swirl blade orientation on a swirling flow were further discussed. The simulation results, when utilizing swirl blades, were also verified by plant trials performed at Scana Steel. In addition, a new novel swirling flow generation component, TurboSwirl, was studied in a model considering the entire mold system including a trumpet. The model was based on modifications of the refractory geometry at the elbow of the runners near the mold without the usage of an inserted flow control device in the gating system. Owing to its great potential for improving the flow pattern of steel during the initial filling moment, the effect of TurboSwirl on steel cleanliness was also studied. The results showed that the initial filling conditions during the uphill teeming process can be improved by using a swirl blade or a TurboSwirl in the gating system. This makes it possible to further decrease the initial position of mold powder bags. In addition, it reduces the possibilities of exogenous <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusion</b> generation in the gating system as well as mold flux entrapment in the mold during the uphill teeming process. However, the utilization of swirl blades created a considerable amount of droplets when steel entered the molds during the first couple of seconds, which also was verified by the plant trials. The introduction of TurboSwirl showed a greater potential than a swirl blade due to a more evenly distributed swirling flow. The DPM model adopted in the simulations revealed that the TurboSwirl can improve steel cleanliness by increasing the <b>non-metallic</b> <b>inclusion</b> collision rate both with respect to Stokes and turbulent collisions.
