40|$|There {{the study}} object is the {{deoxidation}} of mild rimming steel. The study {{purpose is to}} improve the quality of steel ingot and to rise the output of good metal. The character of recycle flows in the ingot mould during the period of deoxidizer introduction, the size-transfer conditions and the distribution conditions of it in the ingot volume have been determined. The optimum relationship between the carbon concentration and the oxygen activity in the metal during the steel pouring period has been refined. The dioxidation process of mild rimmimg <b>non-ageing</b> <b>steel</b> with activometer use has been developed and has been introduced. The method of forced mixing of deoxidizer with the metal has been developed. The deoxidation process and the pouring process of mild and <b>non-ageing</b> <b>steel</b> has been introduced at the open-furnace shop of "Zaporozhstal" Integrated Iron-and-Steel Works. The metal spoilage has been reduced 2. 9 times at the first conversion, the output of goods has been risen by 0. 3 %Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
50|$|As with Classes 03, 45 and 50, the 20-bar boiler, {{which was}} made of St 47 K and not a <b>non-aging</b> <b>steel,</b> soon caused major problems. As early as 1941, the DRB decreed a {{reduction}} of the permissible operating pressure to 16 bar. In this way {{the wear and tear}} on the boiler could at least be slowed down.|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} of the boilers became worse and worse due {{to the use of}} <b>non-aging</b> St47K <b>steel</b> (on 10 October 1958 the boiler of locomotive 03 1046 exploded as a result of aging). So the Deutsche Reichsbahn had to replace them with newly designed boilers. In addition, several other components were overhauled {{in order to make the}} engines more economical. Thus the term Rekolok ('reconstructed locomotive') is entirely accurate. A total of 16 engines were rebuilt in 1959. In 1952, 03 1087 was converted to the Wendler brown coal dust firing system. Because this type of firing was unsuccessful for passenger train services, it was re-converted in 1959. From 1965 all the Rekoloks were converted to oil-firing (with the exception of 03 1057 and 1087). Until their retirement at the end of the 1970s the three-cylinder express train engines, which covered up to 22,000 km per month, were the spearhead of the DR's high-value express train services. Number 03 1010 is a museum locomotive with the DB AG, stationed in Halle and frequently used in heritage services. It was re-converted to coal-firing. The non-operational, oil-fired 03 1090 is also preserved and is housed in the former locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk or Bw) at Schwerin.|$|R
40|$|Interstitial Free (IF) steels have {{excellent}} deep drawing capabilities and <b>non-ageing</b> properties. These <b>steel</b> grades {{still have some}} disadvantages such as a generally weak mechanical strength and high reactivity in the grain boundaries during galvannealing, which produces brittle Fe-Zn-intermetallic compounds. Furthermore the resistance to secondary work embrittlement is rather low due {{to the absence of}} soluble interstitials in grain boundaries. A good remedy is the insertion of a defined amount of carbon into the surface after recrystallization started. The possibilities and limits of a change in surface properties of Ti-IF sheet steel by a short time annealing in reactive atmospheres (CO, H 2, N 2) were evaluated: The introduction of carbon interstitials during continuous annealing increases mechanical strength associated with bake hardening and moderate age hardening and a good formability. However, to achieve fully recrystallized grains with a favourable (111) -texture the carburizing treatment should start after new grains have nucleated. A short carburizing treatment during continuous annealing can significantly improve the resistance of Ti-IF and P-Ti/Nb-IF steel against secondary work embrittlement (SWE). The r-value was slightly influenced by the added carbon atoms, the r-values were in the range between 3 and 2. The higher the carbon potential of a carburizing atmosphere, the higher is the carbon pickup. This could lead to the formation of an austenite layer which has a much higher solubility for carbon than the ferrite...|$|R
