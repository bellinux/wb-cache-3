5000|$|In {{order to}} provide mono [...] "compatibility", the NICAM signal is {{transmitted}} on a subcarrier alongside the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier.</b> This means that the FM or AM regular mono <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> is left alone for reception by monaural receivers.|$|R

50|$|The PAL-N {{system has}} a {{different}} <b>sound</b> <b>carrier,</b> and also a different colour subcarrier, and decoding on incompatible PAL systems results in a black-and-white image without sound. The PAL-M system {{has a different}} <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> and a different colour subcarrier, and does not use 625 lines or 50 frames/second. This would result in no video or audio at all when viewing a European signal.|$|R

50|$|Art Radio {{claims the}} most {{complete}} CD and LP library of world oldies standards, including some very valuable rare archive records from original <b>sound</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|This ensures video interoperability. However, as some {{of these}} {{standards}} (B/G/H, I and D/K) use different <b>sound</b> <b>carriers</b> (5.5 MHz, 6.0 MHz 6.5 MHz respectively), it {{may result in a}} video image without audio when viewing a signal broadcast over the air or cable. Some countries in Eastern Europe which formerly used SECAM with systems D and K have switched to PAL while leaving other aspects of their video system the same, resulting in the different <b>sound</b> <b>carrier.</b> Instead, other European countries have changed completely from SECAM-D/K to PAL-B/G.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} the IF signal {{consists}} of a video carrier signal at one frequency and the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> at a fixed offset. A demodulator recovers the video signal. Also at {{the output of the}} same demodulator is a new frequency modulated <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> at the offset frequency. In some sets made before 1948, this was filtered out, and the sound IF of about 22 MHz was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. In newer sets, this new carrier at the offset frequency was allowed to remain as intercarrier sound, and it was sent to an FM demodulator to recover the basic sound signal. One particular advantage of intercarrier sound is that when the front panel fine tuning knob is adjusted, the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency does not change with the tuning, but stays at the above-mentioned offset frequency. Consequently, it is easier to tune the picture without losing the sound.|$|R
50|$|So the FM <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> is then demodulated, amplified, {{and used}} to drive a loudspeaker. Until {{the advent of the}} NICAM and MTS systems, {{television}} sound transmissions were invariably monophonic.|$|R
50|$|This {{would have}} meant that the NTSC <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> {{frequency}} of 4.5 MHz above the picture carrier, would have also been the standard for Europe, and hence been a lot more common world wide.|$|R

50|$|The {{proposal}} was defeated as Russian engineers had already shown how NTSC {{could be easily}} adapted to a higher resolution by breaking with NTSC bandwidth restrictions, and moving the <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> up 2 MHz from 4.5 to 6.5 MHz, along with 625 line scanning.|$|R
50|$|PAL-M is {{incompatible}} with 625-line based versions of PAL, because its frame rate, scan line, colour subcarrier and <b>sound</b> <b>carrier</b> specifications are different.

40|$|Aims: The {{present study}} was aimed to {{measurement}} of sound absorption coefficient of mineral wool and determination of their absorption ability. Materials and Methods: Mineral wool was used to find noise absorption coefficient. Random and <b>normal</b> <b>sound</b> absorption coefficient values were predicted. Then, the measures of transmission loss calculated as an overall value, for applied absorbent material and bare sheet metal. Results: The measured values of noise with one octave band frequency demonstrated an attenuation of 5. 5 - 7 dB for these frequencies. The absorption coefficients of materials showed that mineral wool had more <b>normal</b> <b>sound</b> coefficients than its random sound absorption coefficient values. Conclusion: It can be concluded that predicted <b>normal</b> <b>sound</b> absorption coefficients of used mineral wool materials were near to the areas of standard line. It seems that the amount or thickness of absorbent lining was a main reason of noise reduction in low band frequencies. Mineral wool has a higher density and can provide better acoustical and insulating results than fiberglass. Besides, mineral wool doesn′t lose its insulating value when wet and has an outstanding resistance to fire...|$|R
