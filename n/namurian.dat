5|$|Coal balls may {{be found}} in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. North American coal balls are more widespread, both stratigraphically and geologically, than those in Europe. The oldest known coal balls date from the <b>Namurian</b> stage of the Carboniferous; they were found in Germany and on the {{territory}} of former Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|The oldest coal balls {{were from}} the early end of the <b>Namurian</b> stage (326 to 313 mya) and {{discovered}} in Germany and former Czechoslovakia, but their ages generally range from the Permian (299 to 251 mya) to the Upper Carboniferous. Some coal balls from the US vary in age from the later end of the Westphalian (roughly 313 to 304 mya) to the later Stephanian (roughly 304 to 299 mya). European coal balls are generally from the early end of the Westphalian Stage.|$|E

500|$|Ebbor Gorge {{lies on the}} southwest-facing {{slope of}} the Mendip Hills and {{consists}} of a steep-sided ravine cut into 350-million-year-old Carboniferous Limestone of the Dinantian. The gorge was cut into Clifton Down Limestone by meltwater in the Pleistocene Epoch. The lowest part of the gorge is formed in the <b>Namurian</b> Quartzitic Sandstone Group and the South Wales Lower Coal Measures, over which younger limestones have been thrust to the north-east, {{as demonstrated by the}} BGS maps (1:50,000 sheet 280, Wells). [...] An example of the rare mineral mendipite was found {{at the head of the}} gorge.|$|E
2500|$|With [...] {{of natural}} gas and [...] of {{petroleum}} estimated by the field operators as initially recoverable hydrocarbon reserves from eight producing fields (DTI, 2001), the East Irish Sea Basin is at a mature exploration phase. Early <b>Namurian</b> basinal mudstones are the source rocks for these hydrocarbons. Production from all fields is from fault-bounded traps of the Lower Triassic formation, principally the aeolian Sherwood Sandstone reservoir, top-sealed by younger Triassic continental mudstones and evaporites. Future mineral exploration will initially concentrate on extending this play, but there remains largely untested potential also for gas and oil within widespread Carboniferous fluvial sandstone reservoirs. This play requires intraformational mudstone seal units to be present, {{as there is no}} top-seal for reservoirs subcropping the regional base Permian unconformity in the east of the basin, and Carboniferous strata crop out at the sea bed in the west.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper part}} of the (regionally defined) <b>Namurian</b> stage {{corresponds}} to the (internationally used) Bashkirian stage whilst the lower part is assigned to the preceding Serpukhovian stage.

50|$|The <b>Namurian</b> is a {{stage in}} the {{regional}} stratigraphy of northwest Europe with an age between roughly 326 and 313 Ma (million years ago). It is a subdivision of the Carboniferous system or period and the regional Silesian series. The <b>Namurian</b> is named for the Belgian city and province of Namur where strata of this age occur (part of the Belgian Coal Measures). The Millstone Grit Group in the lithostratigraphy of northern England and parts of Wales is also of <b>Namurian</b> age.|$|E

5000|$|In her {{landmark}} study [...] "The Palaeontology of the <b>Namurian</b> {{rocks of}} Slieve Anierin, County Leitrim, Eire", Patricia Yates (1962) demonstrated a [...] "remarkable extent" [...] of <b>Namurian</b> marine fauna bands, abundant with goniatite-Bivalvia, at Sliabh an Iarainn. [...] She described some rock layers as particularly fossiliferous, the shale bands abundant with goniatite faunas and Bivalvia marine and freshwater molluscs. The unfossiliferous shales often contain numerous clay-ironstone bands making conditions intolerable for marine organisms. At {{most of the}} fossiliferous levels in the <b>Namurian</b> beds the number of goniatites and Bivalvia are usually very high with the diversity of species low. The richest and most diverse band in the succession at Sliabh an Iarainn, in terms of species present, contains Trilobites, brachiopods, gastropods, echinoids and Bryozoa. Fragments of trilobites occur abundantly at particular bands. Overall, Yates documented nearly 120 distinct fossiliferous sites around Sliabh an Iarainn, her work complimented by extensive photographs of often beautifully preserved fossils. Her study of Sliabh an Iarainn is considered important, being housed at the Murchison Museum, Imperial College, British Geological Survey Museum, and the Natural Museum in London.|$|E
