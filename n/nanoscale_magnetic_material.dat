30|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} (MNPs) with {{a diameter}} between 1 to 100 nm have found uses in many applications [1, 2]. This <b>nanoscale</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> has several advantages that provide many exciting opportunities {{or even a}} solution to various biomedically [3 – 5] and environmentally [6 – 8] related problems. Firstly, {{it is possible to}} synthesize a wide range of MNPs with well-defined structures and size which can be easily matched with the interest of targeted applications. Secondly, the MNP itself can be manipulated by an externally applied magnetic force. The capability to control the spatial evolution of MNPs within a confined space provides great benefits for the development of sensing and diagnostic system/techniques [9, 10]. Moreover MNPs, such as Fe 0 and Fe 3 O 4, that exhibit a strong catalytic function can be employed as an effective nanoagent to remove a number of persistent pollutants from water resources [11, 12]. In addition to all the aforementioned advantages, the recent development of various techniques and procedures for producing highly monodispersed and size-controllable MNPs [13, 14] has played a pivotal role in promoting the active explorations and research of MNPs.|$|E

Here, I present the first ultrafast magnetization dynamics studies by use of extreme ultraviolet radiation from a tabletop high-harmonic generation source. This new probing technique offers three advantages over conventional ones: ultrafast time resolution, element selectivity, and the tabletop size. I report three experiments showing that high harmonics are a powerful tool for probing magnetization in magnetic materials. First, our group measures simultaneously the magnetizations of Ni and Fe in Permalloy using the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect. Second, we study laser-induced demagnetization dynamics in two ferromagnetic alloys: Permalloy and Permalloy-Cu. Contrary to a common expectation that the dynamics in strong exchange-coupled alloys would be identical, we discover that the magnetization of Fe decays earlier than that of Ni during the first 60 fs. To explain this delay, we propose a simple model incorporating a finite exchange-time factor into the magnetization rate equations. Finally, to confirm the observed sequence of dynamics in alloys, we conduct the magnetization study of elemental Fe and Ni with identical experimental conditions. The results indicate that the order of demagnetizations in the elemental forms is the same as that in Permalloy: Fe demagnetizes faster than Ni does...|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} {{a decade}} ago that individual molecules can function as magnetizable magnets provided a new, 'bottom-up' approach to <b>nanoscale</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials,</b> and such molecules have since been called single-molecule magnets (SMMs). Each molecule functions as a <b>nanoscale,</b> single-domain <b>magnetic</b> particle that, below its blocking temperature (TB), exhibits the classical macroscale property of a magnet, namely magnetization hysteresis. In addition, they straddle the classical/quantum interface in also displaying quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) and quantum phase interference, {{the properties of the}} atomic or microscale. SMMs have a number of potential applications, including very high density information storage, where each bit would be stored as the magnetization orientation of an individual molecule, and as quantum bits for quantum computing, taking advantage of the quantum superposition of states provided by the QTM. To facilitate development of techniques for addressing individual SMMs for such applications, and other reasons, it has been of interest to us to explore whether very large examples (by molecular standards) could be synthesized.

40|$|Studying {{dynamics}} of magnetization relaxation in excited <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials</b> is important both {{for understanding the}} rates and pathways of magnetization relaxation and for the potential use in spin-based electronics and data storage devices in the future. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the size of nanocrystals is an important factor for energy relaxation in quantum dots and metal nanoparticles. Since magnetization relaxation is one of energy relaxation pathways, the size of nanocrystals may be also an important factor for magnetization relaxation in <b>nanoscale</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials.</b> The goal {{of this study is to}} have a better understanding of magnetization relaxation in <b>nanoscale</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials.</b> In particular, we focused on the correlation between the nanocrystal size and the rates of spin-lattice relaxation (SLR), a magnetization relaxation pathway, in magnetic nanocrystals. The size-dependent magnetization relaxation rate after optically induced demagnetization in colloidal Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals was measured by using time-resolved Faraday rotation (FR). Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals were chosen as the model system to study the correlation between the size of nanocrystals and the rates of SLR due to the wellestablished synthetic procedure of making nanocrystals with various sizes and narrow size dispersion. Faster SLR rates were observed in smaller Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals. The results suggested the surface of nanocrystals have higher efficiency of SLR than the interior region by using a simple model to analyze the SLR rates of Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals with various sizes. Higher efficiency of SLR at the surface may be due to the stronger spin-orbit coupling at the surface relative to the interior region. In addition to magnetization dynamics studies, the effect of oxidation on static FR in iron oxide nanocrystals (between Fe 3 O 4 and y-Fe 2 O 3) was studied. The results indicated FR signal is linearly correlated to the strength of optical transition between Fe 2 and Fe 3 in Fe 3 O 4 for a given size of nanocrystals...|$|R

40|$|Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) offer a {{molecular}} approach to <b>nanoscale</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials.</b> These molecules, below their blocking temperature, function as single-domain magnetic particles and exhibit the classical macroscale property of a magnet-magnetization hysteresis. In addition, SMMs straddle the classical/quantum interface in also displaying quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) and quantum phase interference. Potential applications of SMMs include high-density information storage and qubits for quantum computing. There are numerous synthetic and technical challenges to this end, {{the most significant}} of which involves maximization of the barrier to magnetization reversal (Ueff) and understanding the factors that control QTM. To meet these goals, closely- related families of Mn'III-based complexes have been synthesized, in which the ground state spin values, uniaxial anisotropies, and magnetization reversal barriers were varied {{as a result of}} systematic changes in the coordinating ligands and co-crystallizing cations. Detailed single-crystal magnetization hysteresis and high- frequency EPR studies on these complexes provide unprecendented insight towards the mechanism and selection rules for QTM in these complexes, as applicable to all SMMs. SMMs have also been widely touted as a 'bottom-up' approach to the construction of molecular <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials,</b> though very few examples adequately demonstrate this concept. Families of higher-nuclearity Mn₃III-based complexes have thus been synthesized, for which dimeric structures, infinite 1 -D chains, 2 -D grids, and porous 3 -D frameworks have been achieved.

This magnetic switching is found to be inhomogeneous throughout the material, with some individual FePt nanoparticles neither switching nor demagnetizing.
