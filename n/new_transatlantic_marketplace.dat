40|$|This report {{provides}} a summary overview of issues regarding {{the relationship between}} the United States and the EU, many of which may be of interest to the second session of the 111 th Congress. The global financial crisis and recession has challenged both sides to forge a common response. The United States and EU have a number of lingering trade disputes, but have led the push to liberalize world trade, and have sought to reduce non-tariff and regulatory barriers in the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>marketplace...</b>|$|R

40|$|The United States and the European Union are now {{engaged in}} a new {{initiative}} aimed at strengthening transatlantic economic and political cooperation. The initiative has a government component (<b>New</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> Agenda [...] NTA) and a private sector component (the Transatlantic Business Dialogue [...] TABD). Should this transatlantic initiative lead to new trade agreements, the Administration will have to seek congressional approval for such agreements.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the airline planning process, analyzes the demand {{of the busiest}} transatlantic routes and establishes a methodology on how to plan <b>new</b> <b>transatlantic</b> routes from Europe to United States of America with Prague Airport as a hub, or secondary airport for these flights. A few of the most used airports in Europe are chosen and flight data in 2011 from these airports to the United States was analyzed. In addition, demographic, traffic and socioeconomic data of selected airports is collected. A demand forecasting model is then developed in steps using correlation analysis, multiple linear regression analysis and doubly constraint gravity model, and compared with annual number of passengers traveling from Prague Airport to selected destinations in the United States (provided by Prague Airport). The suggested methodology and findings of this thesis {{can be used for}} different airlines to forecast demand and plan <b>new</b> <b>transatlantic</b> routes. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{proposals}} for a <b>new</b> <b>transatlantic</b> {{trade and investment}} initiative between the United States and the European Union (EU) have been floated in recent months. Closer ties, some believe, {{would lead to a}} better transatlantic relationship. The United States Government and the European Commission are conducting independent studies to assess the feasibility of establishing a free trade area or a "transatlantic economic space. " Both sides may agree, at a December 1995 summit, to intensify the U. S. -EU dialogue. Proponents of a <b>new</b> <b>transatlantic</b> initiative argue that the United States and the European Union run a risk of drifting apart {{in the absence of the}} unifying threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Countering the view that there is a "special relationship" between the United States and the European Union are those, like MIT economics professor Lester Thurow, who argue that in the post-Cold War world, the United States and European Union are political and economic rivals engaged in a battle "to determine who owns the twenty-first century. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{tries to}} {{determine}} {{to what extent}} EU-US cooperation {{in the field of}} international peace and security is impacted by bilateral relations under the <b>New</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> Agenda versus multilateral dialogues. It employs Michael Smith's framework of 'bi-multilateral' negotiations in its analysis. The case studies explored are bilateral dialogues under the <b>New</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> Agenda alongside multilateral dialogues in the framework of the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and ad hoc fora such as the Middle East Quartet. The main finding is that bilateral and multilateral dialogues are complementary in EU-US cooperation on issues of international peace and security. Bilateral dialogues by themselves are not sufficient to effectively address complex international peace and security issues. Multilateral dialogues can gain useful support, efficiency and a degree of legitimacy from good relations at the bilateral level. Moreover, ad hoc fora can be valuable additions which may complement both existing bilateral as well as multilateral EU-US dialogues. Finally, the choice of forum and the potential of EU-US cooperation are often considerably influenced {{by the nature of the}} issue under discussion...|$|R
25|$|In 1958, a <b>new</b> <b>transatlantic</b> {{service was}} started by Aer Lingus via Shannon Airport. By the mid 1950s, {{it was clear that}} the {{original}} terminal building was too small to cope with growing passenger numbers. A new North Terminal was opened in June 1959. Originally, the plan was that North Terminal would handle all US and European flights, but instead it became the arrivals terminal for all Dublin Airport passengers, while the original passenger terminal was used for departures.|$|R
50|$|After its {{defeat in}} the Count's Feud, Lübeck's power slowly declined. The city {{remained}} neutral in the Thirty Years' War of 1618-1648, but {{the combination of the}} devastation from the decades-long war and the <b>new</b> <b>transatlantic</b> orientation of European trade caused the Hanseatic League - and thus Lübeck with it - to decline in importance. However, even after the de facto disbanding of the Hanseatic League in 1669, Lübeck still remained an important trading town on the Baltic Sea.|$|R

This cable system targeted traders, and was planned to be the highest bit rate (8.8 terabits/second), lowest latency (59 ms) cable built across the Atlantic.|$|R

50|$|Only {{six years}} later did he get the {{opportunity}} to work based on his qualifications. He was employed by the large shipbuilding company Penhoët, which had a monopoly on the construction of passenger ships. Soon, the Penhoët company was commissioned to work out a project to construct a massive <b>new</b> <b>transatlantic</b> liner called the SS Normandie. Yourkevitch decided to design the body plan of the ship independently, which played a very significant role in his future life.|$|R
50|$|The Aga Khan IV {{commissioned}} a 164-foot yacht, named Alamshar, {{with a price}} tag of £200 million. It should be noted the cost and maintenance are partly covered by chartering.

However, the yacht only reached a top speed of 30 knots in its initial trials.|$|R

50|$|Industrial {{development}} on the flat land adjoining the Thames at New Charlton began {{in the middle of}} the 19th century, especially after the opening of a private railway branch line to Angerstein Wharf in 1852. A notable establishment was the Siemens Brothers Telegraph Works opened in 1863, which manufactured two <b>new</b> <b>transatlantic</b> cables in the 1880s, and contributed to the PLUTO project in World War II. Since the 1960s the area had sunk into industrial decline, with most of the original factories closing.|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} a {{succession}} of <b>newer</b> <b>transatlantic</b> cable systems. All recent systems have used fiber optic transmission, and a self-healing ring topology. Late in the 20th century, communications satellites lost most of their North Atlantic telephone traffic to these low cost, high capacity, low latency cables. This advantage only increases over time as tighter cables provide higher speed - the 2012 generation of cables drop the transatlantic latency to under 60 milliseconds, according to Hibernia Atlantic, deploying such a cable that year.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{international}} {{developments on}} specific environmental and defense issues (concerning respectively the Kyoto protocol and the U.

S. -EU relations, there is a growing anxiety about possible spill-over or domino effect. There is therefore a critical need for assessing and evaluating the record of the <b>New</b> <b>Transatlantic</b> Agenda, established in 1995 to organize a closer partnership between the U. S. and the EU...|$|R
