As of 2007, the first short-term stage was completed (reorganisation of the command system, implementation of the voluntary military service).

The stages aim at modernising the structure of the armed forces, reducing the personnel as well as acquiring newer and improved technology that is compatible with NATO standards.|$|E

5|$|Post-war {{division}} {{of the world was}} formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact; the long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the Cold War, would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy wars.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutions of 1989 and the {{dissolution}} of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and their focus on the continent of Europe. This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> the Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after {{the dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in December 1991. At that time, European countries accounted for 34 percent of NATO's military spending; by 2012, this had fallen to 21 percent. NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Central and Eastern European nations, and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.|$|E

5|$|Battlefield Germany is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Personal Software Services for the Commodore 64 released in April 1987. It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum later that year. It is the eighth instalment to the Strategic Wargames series.

5|$|Belarus has not {{expressed}} a desire to join NATO but has participated in the Individual Partnership Program since 1997, and Belarus provides refueling and airspace support for the ISAF mission in Afghanistan. Belarus first began to cooperate with NATO upon signing documents to participate in their Partnership for Peace Program in 1995. However, Belarus cannot join NATO because it {{is a member of the}} Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Tensions between <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> Belarus peaked after the March 2006 presidential election in Belarus.|$|E
5|$|Complications in the {{relationship}} between <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> Georgia includes presence of Russian forces in internationally recognized Georgian territory as a result of multiple recent conflicts, like the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, over the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are home to a large number of citizens of the Russian Federation. On 21 November 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev while addressing soldiers in Vladikavkaz near the Georgian border stated that the 2008 invasion had prevented any further NATO enlargement into the former Soviet sphere.|$|E

5|$|However, controversies over {{domestic}} reforms, Poland's 1999 {{entry into}} <b>NATO,</b> <b>and</b> the accession process to the European Union, combined with AWS fights with its political allies (the Freedom Union—Unia Wolności) and infighting within AWS itself, {{as well as}} corruption, eventually resulted {{in the loss of}} much public support. AWS leader Marian Krzaklewski lost the 2000 presidential election, and in the 2001 parliamentary elections AWS failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament. After this debacle, Krzaklewski was replaced by Janusz Śniadek (in 2002) but the union decided to distance itself from politics.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{has added}} new members seven times since its {{founding}} in 1949 to include twenty-nine members. Twelve countries were part of the founding of NATO: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The early years of the Cold War saw a stark divide between Capitalist ideologies, backed by <b>NATO,</b> <b>and</b> Communist satellite states of the Soviet Union. This divide encouraged the anti-Communist governments of Greece and Turkey to join NATO in 1952. Greece would suspend its membership in 1974, over the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, but rejoined in 1980 with Turkey's cooperation.|$|E
5|$|The country's current {{political}} structure {{dates to the}} adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991.

The events in the Middle East prompt the superpowers of the United States and the British Empire to intervene, leading up to a conventional war in Europe against the Eastern bloc.

5|$|The two German governments {{promoted}} {{very different}} views of the border. The GDR saw it as the international frontier of a sovereign state– a defensive rampart against Western aggression. In Grenzer ("Border Guard"), a 1981 East German Army propaganda film, <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> West German troops and tanks were depicted as ruthless militarists advancing towards East Germany. Border troops interviewed in the film described {{what they saw as}} the rightfulness of their cause and the threat of Western agents, spies and provocateurs. Their colleagues killed on the border were hailed as heroes and schoolchildren in East Berlin were depicted saluting their memorial.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} other bodies and agencies {{that have not}} had their seats fixed by treaties.

Luxembourg hosts the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union and the European Investment Bank. Strasbourg hosts the office of the European Ombudsman. The other agencies are spread across Europe and since the 2004 enlargement, there has been a drive to locate more agencies in the new member-states to make a more equal distribution.|$|E
5|$|This {{meeting was}} between NATO leaders and {{president}} of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma. NATO members expressed appreciation for Ukraine’s contributions to NATO-led and other international peace support efforts such as KFOR. Ukraine also offered to support Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean (a naval operation of NATO {{which is designed to}} prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction), an offer which NATO would consider. Defence cooperation between <b>NATO</b> <b>and</b> Ukraine was reviewed and the possible launching of a Partnership for Peace Trust Fund to help Ukraine destroy the surplus munitions, small arms and light weapons was discussed.|$|E
