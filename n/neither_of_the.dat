5|$|In January 1918, Friedrich Schlosser {{replaced}} von Trapp {{as commander}} of U-14.

5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited visibility and cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} paper published {{ten years after}} the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.|$|E
5|$|After the 'panic party' {{had taken}} to the boats and the ship {{appeared}} to be sinking, the U-boat approached to within 80 yards of her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and Prize opened fire. Within {{a few minutes the}} submarine was on fire and her bows rose in the air, whilst Prize was further damaged. The U-boat disappeared from sight, and was believed to have been sunk by the crew of Prize and by several of the German crew (including her captain) who had been blown or jumped into the sea. However, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crippled ships had sunk, with Prize being towed in flames back to Kinsale. U-93 struggled back to the Sylt nine days later.|$|E

5|$|Although CNT {{had secured}} fully {{complete}} plans from Weser, the Austro-Hungarian design modifications delayed {{the start of}} construction. Additional changes after construction had begun slowed the boats' progress. Compounding this were shortages of both material and skilled shipyard workers, further slowing construction. As a result, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first two boats was ever launched, much less completed, and the second pair was cancelled before either was laid down. U-48 was 70% complete at the war's end, while U-49 was only 55% complete. Both boats were scrapped in place in 1920.|$|E
5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives.

When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{models were}} plagued from the onset by inefficient engines, but {{were capable of}} the short-distance {{takeoffs}} required by the Swiss (330meters for the P–16, 232meters for the N-20). After wind tunnel and engine tests, but before the N–20 could make its maiden flight, Federal Councillor Karl Kobelt cancelled the N-20project in 1953, leading to much resentment of the government by Emmen engineers when the FFA project was continued. Eventually, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft came into production, although {{the wings of the}} P-16 were later used {{in the development of the}} successful Learjet.|$|E

5|$|Cape Verde competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. Their {{participation}} marked {{their fourth}} Olympic appearance.

5|$|Multiple others {{participated in}} the {{production}} of the ceremony. Musicians Hans Zimmer and Pharrell Williams composed new music exclusive to the Oscars ceremony, which was later released as an album via the iTunes Store. Oscar-winning production designer John Myhre designed a new stage for the ceremony. Director Bennett Miller filmed several vignettes featuring actors discussing movie memories and the business of filmmaking. Cirque du Soleil, who was concurrently renting the Hollywood and Highland Center for their show Iris, performed a dance number at the ceremony inspired by their aforementioned show. Unlike most Oscar ceremonies, however, Grazer and Mischer announced that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two songs nominated for Best Original Song would be performed live.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album's singles were {{particularly}} successful on the US Billboard charts, although the album's title song enjoyed some {{success on the}} adult contemporary format, where it peaked at number twenty-three. Critical response to the album was generally mixed, with critics praising Strip Mes polished production, but stating that Bedingfield failed to deliver anything different or outstanding. The album debuted at number 103 on US Billboard 200 with 10,000 copies sold, a significant drop compared to her previous album, which debuted at number three, and sold five times as many copies.|$|E
