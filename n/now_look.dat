25|$|<b>Now</b> <b>look</b> at the Cantor {{normal form}} of β. If β = ωλm + ωμn+ smaller terms then β = (ωμn+ smaller terms)(ωλ−μ + 1)m {{is a product}} of a smaller ordinal and a prime and an integer m. Repeating this and factorizing the {{integers}} into primes gives the prime factorization of β.|$|E
25|$|Slightly {{later in}} the 13th century the south chapel was added, and the easternmost arch of the south aisle became the {{entrance}} to the chapel. Three of the chapel's windows are round-headed 13th-century late Norman ones: two in the east wall and one in the south wall. The chapel is taller than the nave, so that {{on the south side of}} the clerestory the more easterly windows <b>now</b> <b>look</b> into the chapel instead of outside. The 13th century may also be the period when the church was given a west tower.|$|E
25|$|Besides I've Got My Own Album to Do, Wood has {{recorded}} several other solo efforts. <b>Now</b> <b>Look</b> {{was released in}} 1975, and peaked at NO. 118 on Billboard, and Wood collaborated with Ronnie Lane for the soundtrack album Mahoney's Last Stand. He released Gimme Some Neck in 1979, which hit No. 45 in the US, 1234 was released in 1981, peaking at No. 164. He released Slide on This in 1992, Not for Beginners came out in 2002. and I Feel Like Playing in 2010. As {{a member of the}} Rolling Stones, Wood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and was inducted a second time, as a member of Faces, in April 2012.|$|E

25|$|EBU had {{talks to}} Liechtenstein's only {{broadcaster}} 1FLTV (1 Fürstentum Liechtenstein Television) {{for them to}} join the EBU, and {{become a part of}} the Eurovision Song Contest. 1FLTV's programme director Peter Kolbel had confirmed interest in Liechtenstein's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest as soon as full EBU membership is granted, which may have happened in December 2009. Thus they were getting ready to debut in 2010, considering a national final concept similar to the German version of the Idol series – Deutschland sucht den Superstar (DSDS). In November 1FLTV decided against applying for EBU membership in December for financial reasons, ruling out a debut in at the 2010 contest. The broadcaster will <b>now</b> <b>look</b> at other options for funding EBU membership in the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} of road users would often {{be taken to}} extremes in schemes: by moving motor vehicles onto dedicated routes, their interaction with pedestrians or cycle routes might occur less often but at higher speeds than before, and thus be far more hazardous or intimidating. New towns like Milton Keynes could avoid this by placing motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians on separate levels and routes. However, their interaction would be a particular problem in the established towns, especially in the transition to suburban areas where separation would be more ambiguous and inconsistent. In the search for low casualty rates, urban planners <b>now</b> <b>look</b> to detailed road designs and traffic calming to counteract this affect by reducing vehicle speeds, or take more dramatic steps by destroying this separation and mixing all road users together through shared space planning.|$|E
25|$|Roma {{started the}} second half strongly, {{creating}} a couple of chances in the first 15 minutes of {{the second half}}, including a Rodrigo Taddei effort that forced a last-ditch block from Mikaël Silvestre. Still, United weathered the early storm and, with 20 minutes of the match to go, put the tie beyond reasonable doubt through Carlos Tevez. The Argentinian powered past a pair of Roma defenders, before playing the ball to Owen Hargreaves on the right wing. Tevez continued his run into the box, before finishing with a glancing header off Hargreaves' inch-perfect cross. The day was made complete in the 81st minute, when Alex Ferguson brought Anderson off {{to be replaced by}} Gary Neville, who immediately took over the captaincy, albeit in central midfield, rather than his preferred right-back slot. Neville's every touch was greeted with cheers from the United fans, who had had to wait 13 months for their captain to take to the field again after a succession of injuries. Park Ji-sung had an effort saved late on, but the match was concluded soon after, and United could <b>now</b> <b>look</b> forward to their semi-final first leg away to Barcelona on 23 April. Barcelona were the only team other than United to remain unbeaten in the Champions League up to the semi-finals this season. The win over Roma was the 11th consecutive home victory in the Champions League for United, setting a new record for the competition.|$|E

25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. <b>Now</b> <b>look</b> at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E
500|$|Like Harrison, Wood {{continued}} to incorporate soul music in his solo recordings, working with former Valentino Bobby Womack on his follow-up album, <b>Now</b> <b>Look</b> (1975).

Although Wood and Harrison never officially co-wrote another song after [...] "Far East Man", their friendship continued, with Wood announcing in 1996 that he and Harrison were recording together.|$|E

Francis Dass, writing for the New Straits Times, noted that the season was [...] "very interesting" [...] and possessed [...] "some [...] truly inspiring and hilarious" [...] episodes." [...] Not all seasonal reviews were glowing. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique called the season [...] "a mixed bag of episodes".|$|E

Reproductive Health Services but was not successful in doing so. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor authored {{the decision of the}} Court, allowing the abortion regulations at issue in the case to stand but not overriding Roe. Scalia concurred only in part. Scalia wrote, [...] "Justice O'Connor's assertion, that a 'fundamental rule of judicial restraint' requires us to avoid reconsidering Roe cannot be taken seriously". He noted, [...] "We can <b>now</b> <b>look</b> forward to at least another Term of carts full of mail from the public, and the streets full of demonstrators".|$|E
500|$|Ambrose {{took four}} wickets {{in the fourth}} Test, but West Indies lost the match, their first defeat in Barbados for 59 years, and Ambrose was fined £1,000 by the match referee for {{knocking}} down his stumps in frustration {{when he was the}} last man out. He took one more wicket in the drawn final Test to finish the series with 26 wickets and top the West Indian bowling averages. Writing in Wisden, Lee summarised Ambrose's performances: [...] "Ambrose was magnificent. He was deservedly named man of the series, not only for taking 26 wickets at an average of 19.96 apiece and winning the Trinidad Test single-handed, but for the more profound truth that West Indies <b>now</b> <b>look</b> to him whenever they need wickets... carried the attack alone".|$|E

[...] Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, [...] "We are {{very pleased with the}} settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. We will now be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and Game Gear systems throughout the world." [...] Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller.|$|E

500|$|Considered a horrorcore song, [...] "Monster" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as brooding, disturbing, creepy and the [...] "weirdest A-list event-rap posse cut in recent memory." [...] The song begins with an ominous, distorted vocal roar, sung by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, with Vernon declaring [...] "I shoot the lights out", which sets up the dark atmosphere of the track. The intro of the song is followed by a brief verse given by Ross, delivered in the rapping style of boom bap. In a deep voice, Ross asserts the lines [...] "bitch, I'm a monster, no good bloodsucker, fat motherfucker, <b>now</b> <b>look</b> who's in trouble," [...] over the eerie production featured during the beginning. Following the introduction by Ross, West then provides the song's hook, singing [...] "everybody know / I'm a motherfuckin' monster" [...] in a heavily distorted manner. West then launches into a full verse. Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner stated that West rhyming [...] "esophagus" [...] with [...] "sarcophagus" [...] was surely a hip-hop first.|$|E
500|$|When Citi Bike first launched, {{some local}} bike shops in tourist areas {{reported}} {{a decline in}} their bike rental business, and some complained that Citi Bike's advertising was misleading tourists. At least one bike shop owner {{said that he was}} forced to close down his business in 2014 due to the popularity of Citi Bike. Dorothy Rabinowitz of the Wall Street Journal said, {{a few days after the}} system opened, that under the [...] "autocratic" [...] mayoralty of Bill de Blasio, [...] "we <b>now</b> <b>look</b> at a city whose best cities are absolutely begrimed by these blazing blue Citibank bikes." [...] Some people disliked the bright blue color and branding of the bicycles, while others pointed out that the stations blocked fire hydrants on the street. The concrete wheel stops at the end of each kiosk also poses a hazard, as these barriers act as a sudden, sharp speed bump. Another complaint was that bike stations take up car parking space for each eight bikes, a sentiment repeated in future stall installations.|$|E
500|$|Somerset had an {{extraordinary}} season in 1890, going unbeaten in their thirteen fixtures; winning twelve and tying the other. Though he {{was described in}} the Taunton Courier's summary of the season as [...] "one of Somerset's best bats", Roe was no longer relied upon so much by the team, which could <b>now</b> <b>look</b> to the batting of Hewett and Lionel Palairet. Roe finished the season sixth on the counties batting averages, having managed to play in eight of the county's fixtures. Due to their record in 1890, the county were admitted to the County Championship for 1891 after a unanimous vote, regaining their first-class status. He played infrequently, and without excelling himself, for Somerset over the subsequent few years. One of his highlights during this period was an innings against Gloucestershire in which he scored 75 runs to help Somerset set up a large victory. The Gloucestershire Chronicle praised him for the pace of his innings; he took an hour to patiently accrue his first 28 runs while the Somerset innings was in trouble, then added another 47 in just over half an hour.|$|E
