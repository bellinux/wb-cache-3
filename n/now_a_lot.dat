25|$|The {{boundaries}} of the Brussels-Capital Region were determined from the 1947 language census data. This {{was the last time}} that some municipalities were converted from a monolingual Dutch into a bilingual municipality, and were joined with the Brussels agglomeration. The suggestive nature of the questions led massive protest in Flanders (especially around Brussels), causing it to be unlikely to ever have language-related census data again in Belgium. The result is that the Brussels-Capital region is <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> smaller than the French influence around the capital, and that there's no place in Brussels for important infrastructure. Enlarging the territory of Brussels could potentially give it around 1.5million inhabitants, an airport, a bigger forest, and bring the Brussels Ringroad on Brussels territory. A large and independent status may help Brussels in its claim as the capital of the EU. However, this is highly unlikely to happen in the near future.|$|E
