5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic skills <b>necessary</b> {{for running a}} household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, <b>necessary</b> for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered <b>necessary</b> for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea <b>necessary</b> existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a <b>necessary</b> existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some <b>necessary</b> cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

5000|$|Where <b>necessaries</b> {{are sold}} and {{delivered}} {{to a minor}} ... he must pay a reasonable price for them.A statutory {{definition of the term}} [...] "necessary" [...] is provided in section 2(3) of the Sales of Goods Act of Ghana, 1962 (Act 137) which states: [...] "necessaries are goods suitable to the condition in life of the person to whom they are delivered and his actual requirements {{at the time of the}} delivery".Whilst the onus of proof that a contract is for <b>necessaries</b> falls upon the supplier, contracts in this form have been found in a wide range of situations, including expensive and far reaching purchases. The definition of <b>necessaries</b> includes obvious purchases, such as food and clothing, but also services or goods which are in furtherance of education or apprenticeship. The <b>necessaries</b> of one minor will not necessarily reflect those of another. The particular circumstances, such as age and immediate needs, may lead to differing outcomes. For example, in Peters v Fleming, it was found that a gold ring and watch chain were <b>necessaries,</b> for the child of a Member of Parliament. However, a contract may not be for <b>necessaries</b> where a minor's needs are adequately satisfied, or a purchase can be seen as unnecessary. This is demonstrated by Nash v Inman, where a tailor's claim that a child's purchase of 11 waistcoats was for <b>necessaries</b> failed, on the grounds that he already owned adequate clothing.|$|R

As no evidence has been introduced to suggest that the goods were <b>necessaries,</b> the trial judge's decision was correct.|$|R

5|$|For example, Avicenna gives a {{philosophical}} {{justification for the}} Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the <b>necessary</b> existent. He argues that the <b>necessary</b> existent must be unique, using a proof by contradiction, or reductio, showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes {{that there were more}} than one <b>necessary</b> existent. If one postulates two <b>necessary</b> existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a <b>necessary</b> existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a <b>necessary</b> existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the <b>necessary</b> existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the <b>necessary</b> lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force <b>necessary</b> to lean the bike, countersteering is <b>necessary</b> {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E

5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or <b>necessary.</b> It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is <b>necessary,</b> and that cause must be a <b>necessary</b> existent.|$|E
