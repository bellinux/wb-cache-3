40|$|Concerns about {{deficiencies}} {{in the quality of}} care delivered in US hospitals grew during a time period when an increasing number of hospitals were experiencing financial problems. Our study examines a six-year longitudinal database of general acute care hospitals in 11 states to assess the relationship between hospital financial condition and quality of care. We evaluate two measures of financial performance: operating margin and a broader profitability measure that encompasses both operating and <b>non-operating</b> sources of <b>income.</b> Our model specification allows for gradual adjustments in quality-enhancing activities and recognizes that current realizations of patient quality may affect future financial performance. Empirical results suggest that there is a relationship between financial performance and quality of care, but not as strong as suggested in earlier research. Overall, our results suggest that deep financial problems that go beyond the patient care side of business may be important to prompting quality problems.

50|$|In {{accounting}} and finance, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), {{is a measure}} of a firms profit that includes all expenses except interest and income tax expenses. It is the difference between operating revenues and operating expenses. When a firm does not have <b>non-operating</b> <b>income,</b> then operating income is sometimes used as a synonym for EBIT and operating profit.|$|E

40|$|The Senate Committee that {{investigated}} Enron’s collapse suggests that analysts misled {{the public by}} ignoring signals like the firm’s high proportion of <b>non-operating</b> <b>income.</b> The analysts denied intentional deceit, alleging instead that they were fooled by Enron. This study examines the implications of a firm’s proportion of <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> for its information environment and its valuation. The objective is to ascertain whether market participants ’ ability to value a firm decreases as the proportion of <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> increases. The results show that <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> is associated with information asymmetry and overvaluation. These results apply to the pre- and post-Enron era, so analysts should be more critical about firms ’ <b>non-operating</b> <b>income...</b>|$|E
40|$|The US Senate Committee that {{investigated}} the Enron disaster assessed {{the role of}} analysts. At issue was whether analysts misled the public by ignoring warning signals that included {{a high proportion of}} <b>non-operating</b> <b>income.</b> <b>Non-operating</b> <b>income</b> derives from secondary activities like investments, but operating income is from the primary business activities like manufacturing. While the analysts admitted their limited ability to forecast Enron’s earnings, they denied any intentional deceit and claimed that they were misled by Enron. This study asks whether analysts’ ability to predict earnings is generally negatively associated with the proportion of <b>non-operating</b> <b>income.</b> The rationale is to determine whether the limited ability of analysts to predict earnings for Enron was an isolated incident or a pervasive one that applies to other firms. If pervasive, then another such disaster could occur without a warning from analysts. First, I examine the incentives for firms to resort more to <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> rather than focus on Operating income. Then I examine the association between analysts’ forecast attributes and the ratio of nonoperating to operating income. The results show that <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> and operating income are negatively associated, suggesting that firms use <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> to manage their operating results. Also, analysts’ forecast inaccuracy and dispersion are positively associated with the ratio of <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> to operating income. These results imply that analysts are generally inefficient in predicting earnings of firms with a high proportion of <b>non-operating</b> <b>income.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Taiwanese firms {{generally}} {{have a higher}} proportion of <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> than U. S. and U. K. firms. Taiwan also has many investors who focus only on short-term returns and ignore risks. It therefore is possible that <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> is at least as value relevant as operating income in the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Results show that valuation models based on earnings components have a higher explanatory power than those based solely on earnings. The contribution of <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> is not significantly different from that of operating income. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} disaggregated earnings on stock prices for listed shipping firms. It shows that operating and <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> from ships sales have higher power in explaining stock prices than operating earnings only as key information for future profitability, investment opportunities and firm valuation. The testing period is from 2000 to 2008. The methodologies are those of panel cointegration and panel causality tests. The empirical findings show that both types of earnings are positively related to stock prices, contrary {{to the belief that}} the non-operating component contains little information. The implications are very crucial, since managers may manipulate annual earnings by these non-operating activities. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} examine the {{persistence}} of earnings and earnings components after the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Design/methodology/approach – The study analyses two years before and {{two years after the}} adoption of IFRS in order to examine whether the adoption of IFRS materially affects the persistence, as well as the explanatory power of earnings and earnings components. Findings – The results confirm that disaggregating reported earnings into operating income, <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> and extraordinary charge and credit, captures differences in the information content of the underlying events. Consequently, earnings disaggregation can be used to improve prediction of future profitability. The results suggest that IFRS measurement and reporting guidelines do not seem to improve the persistence of earnings and earnings components. Originality/value – This is the first study that examines whether the mandatory adoption of IFRS has an impact on the information content of earnings components for future profitability.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the profitability of}} earnings-to-price (EP) trading rules based on two alternative measures of earnings: 1. net income before extraordinary items and discontinued operations, and 2. operating income {{that focuses on the}} operating activity of a firm. Specifically, this investigation is motivated by the fact that while prior study finds that operating income is more persistent than <b>non-operating</b> <b>income,</b> there is little evidence on the differential return predictability of the two components of income. To the extent that stock price reflects the market 2 ̆ 7 s expectation about future earnings, the return predictability of the two components of income should differ when they have different persistence. The study finds that while the profitability of the conventional EP trading rule is significant, it increases substantially when the earnings are defined to be operating income rather than net income before extraordinary items and discontinued operations. Further, the conventional risk factors, including market return and firm size, do not fully explain the profitability of EP trading rule based on operating income. These results highlight the importance of core operation-related information to investment decision-making...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{integrate}} the theory of bank financial performance with the practice of bank ratings. The paper studies the effect of bank capital structure and financial indicators in Middle Eastern commercial banks associated with high and low ratings issued by Capital Intelligence (CI). The authors also investigate how bank capital structure and financial indicators can be differentiated between banks with high and low ratings, using the multinomial logit technique. A sample of 65 rated commercial banks from eleven countries is used. The article focuses on commercial banks {{in order to avoid}} comparison problems between various types of banks. The data is taken from the Bankscope database and covers the period of 1994 - 2007. The results reveal that the financial indicators of the highly-rated banks are associated with decreases in the ratio of impaired loans to gross loans, the ratio of loan loss reserve to gross loans, the ratio of non-interest expenses to total assets, the ratio of net loans to deposits and short-term funding and the ratio of net loans to total assets. In contrast, these financial indicators are allied to an increase in the ratio of <b>non-operating</b> <b>income</b> to net income, the gap ratio, the interbank ratio and the equity ratio. The robustness of the results is quite obvious since the financial indicators associated with highly-rated banks are the opposite of those associated with low-rated banks. In view of the findings, some policy implications can be drawn that may be useful for bank management and policymakers in the Middle East region...|$|E
