40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} a {{case study}} of procurement through a comparative analysis of the <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> procurement policies of the Commonwealth, State, and Territory Governments in Australia. <b>Capital</b> <b>works</b> procurement policies provide the mechanism by which governments manage procurement processes, and frame how individual government agencies, as clients, participate in those processes. The paper proposes a typology of <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> procurement approaches, together with implications of how these different policies play out for clients. A tentative proposition is advanced that policy approaches to <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> procurement either explicitly or implicitly, make assumptions about the organisational capability of clients to plan and deliver <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> projects, including their ability to understand and articulate their own building needs. Additionally, the paper concludes that innovation has occurred at a policy level in <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> procurement. Recommendations for further research are suggested. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of the most appropriate procurement method for <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> projects is a challenging task for the Department of Housing and Works (DHW) and other Western Australian State Government Agencies because of the array of assessment criteria that are considered and the procurement methods that are available. A number of different procurement systems {{can be used to}} deliver <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> projects such a traditional, design and construct and management. Sub-classifications of these systems have proliferated and continue to emerge in response to market demands. The selection of an inappropriate procurement method may lead to undesirable project outcomes. To facilitate DHW in selecting an appropriate procurement method for its <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> projects, a six step procurement method selection process is presented. The characteristics of the most common forms of procurement method used in Australia are presented. Case studies where procurement methods have been used for specific types of <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> in Western Australia are offered to provide a reference point and learning opportunity for procurement method selection...|$|R

40|$|Determining {{the optimal}} {{procurement}} approach for <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> is a challenging task considering {{the array of}} procurement methods available and criteria that must be assessed. To assist a public sector client with this complicated decision making process, a procurement method selection process was developed. A focus group compromising of key stakeholders involved with an educational <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> project used the developed approach to determine an appropriate solution for their needs. Overwhelmingly, participants supported the outcome albeit, a small minority who had limited wider exposure to alternative methods initially perceived their bastion (i. e. a default Traditional Lump Sum (TLS), to be a credible option. Indeed, those participants with limited knowledge procured almost 95 % of <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> projects using a TLS and did not adopt a formal approach to procurement method selection. As a clear indicator of demonstrable impact, it can be reported that the approach {{presented in this paper}} is now being used by the public sector agency responsible for <b>capital</b> <b>works.</b> The pragmatic approach developed enabled decision-makers to constantly re-evaluate outcomes during each stage of the process in the form of recommendations that were grounded in practice, reflection and detailed evaluation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a case study}} of the application of cost management techniques for project management of <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> within a major Australian electricity corporation. Historical data was collected from the corporation's archived files to establish the performance status of completed <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> projects. A survey of the corporation's project staff was also conducted to determine the current usage of cost management techniques and further explore the findings of the historical data search. The research indicates a reluctance to utilise formal cost management procedures on minor projects, estimated to cost less than $ 1 million. The time constraints allocated to project management planning and the perceived cost to implement procedures were identified as contributing to the limited use of formal cost management on minor projects. The paper concludes that increased risk of poor budget performance is inevitable if formal cost control is not applied to <b>capital</b> <b>works</b> projects, and recommends informal risk assessment and cost contingency measures to address this issue...|$|R
