[...] This is due to the processor speed on the AirPort extreme. [...] Depending on the setup and types of reads and writes, performance ranges from 0.5 to 17.5 MB/s for writing and 1.9 to 25.6 MB/s for reading.

40|$|<b>Network-attached</b> <b>storage</b> enables network-striped data {{transfers}} directly between {{client and}} storage to provide clients with scalable bandwidth on large transfers. <b>Network-attached</b> <b>storage</b> also decouples policy {{and enforcement of}} access control, avoiding unnecessary reverification of protection checks, reducing file manager work and increasing scalability. It eliminates {{the expense of a}} server computer devoted to copying data between peripheral network and client network. This architecture better matches storage technology's sustained data rates, now 80 Mb/s and growing at 40 % per year. Finally, it enables self-managing storage to counter the increasing cost of data management. The availability of cost-effective <b>network-attached</b> <b>storage</b> depends on it becoming a storage commodity, which in turn depends on its utility to a broad segment of the storage market.
