However it is not optimal and has shortcomings in utilizing the network resources optimally, load balancing & fast recovery in case of faults (fault tolerance). The given algorithm resolves all these problems by using all possible multiple paths for transfer of information, while retaining loop-free property. We have proposed a new dynamic loop-free multipath routing algorithm which improves network throughput and network resource utilization, reduces average transmission delay, and is not affected by faults in the links and router nodes. The main idea of this algorithm is to maintain multiple possible <b>next</b> <b>hops</b> for a destination along with weights.

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this paper, {{we present}} a new routing {{paradigm}} that generalizes opportunistic routing in wireless mesh networks. In multirate anypath routing, each node uses both a set of <b>next</b> <b>hops</b> and a selected transmission rate to reach a destination. Using this rate, a packet is broadcast to the nodes in the set {{and one of them}} forwards the packet on to the destination. To date, there is no theory capable of jointly optimizing both the set of <b>next</b> <b>hops</b> and the transmission rate used by each node. We bridge this gap by introducing a polynomial-time algorithm to this problem and provide the proof of its optimality. The proposed algorithm runs in the same running time as regular shortest-path algorithms and is therefore suitable for deployment in link-state routing protocols. We conducted experiments in a 802. 11 b testbed network, and our results show that multirate anypath routing performs on average 80 % and up to 6. 4 times better than anypath routing with a fixed rate of 11 Mbps. If the rate is fixed at 1 Mbps instead, performance improves by up to one order of magnitude. I...|$|R
40|$|Routing in multi-radio {{wireless}} mesh networks is a {{very challenging}} problem. In this paper, we propose a forwarding paradigm based on MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) which makes use of a novel mechanism, denoted as MPLS splitting policy. Such mechanism allows to configure multiple <b>next</b> <b>hops</b> at an intermediate node, so that the incoming traffic is partitioned among the <b>next</b> <b>hops</b> according to predefined coefficients named split ratios. The MPLS splitting policy {{has been designed to}} allow for load balancing and fast local restoration. With such a mechanism, it is crucial to properly determine the set of split ratios, as they determine how the traffic is routed across the network. We present an approach to compute a set of split ratios that guarantee high performance under different traffic loads. To this end, we adopt the hose traffic model, according to which we only have knowledge of the maximum amount of traffic entering or leaving the network at each edge node. A thorough simulation study is conducted to show that our approach outperforms other routing protocols in terms of throughput and robustness against traffic load variations and single node failures...|$|R

50|$|The {{main idea}} of DSRFLOW is to {{introduce}} a so-called flow table for each network node and thus making DSRFLOW a stateful routing protocol. For each flow a node forwards there is one entry in the flow table which minimally must record the <b>next</b> <b>hop</b> address.|$|E
50|$|The {{algorithm}} {{operates in}} a very simple manner. When a node first starts, it only knows of its immediate neighbours, and the direct cost involved in reaching them. (This information â€” the list of destinations, the total cost to each, and the <b>next</b> <b>hop</b> to send data to get there â€” makes up the routing table, or distance table.) Each node, on a regular basis, sends to each neighbour node its own current assessment of the total cost to get to all the destinations it knows of. The neighbouring nodes examine this information and compare it to what they already 'know'; anything that represents an improvement on what they already have, they insert in their own routing table(s). Over time, all the nodes in the network discover the best <b>next</b> <b>hop</b> for all destinations, and the best total cost.|$|E
50|$|To thwart {{or prevent}} such attacks, it was {{necessary}} to employ authentication mechanisms that ensure that only authorized nodes can inject traffic into the network.

40|$|International audienceWireless sensor {{networks}} (WSN) {{are inherently}} multi - constrained. They {{need to preserve}} energy while offering reliable and timely data reporting for a non-negligible number of scenarios. This is particularly true when a node should decide which forwarder has to be chosen for routing a packet. Nevertheless, solving multi-constrained routing problems is NP-complete. Most approaches involve transforming the problem into a single constrained problem using a cost function, although this may lead to suboptimal solutions. Some other solutions are based on heuristics. However, their high implementation complexity prevents their online use. Hence, they are not suitable for highly dynamic WSNs. In this paper we make use of Operator Calculus (OC) methods on graphs to solve path selection {{in the presence of}} multiple constraints. OC has lower resolution time complexity compared to other techniques. Based on OC, we develop a distributed algorithm for path selection in a graph. We develop a new routing protocol which makes use of this algorithm: the Operator Calculus based Routing Protocol (OCRP). In OCRP, a node selects the set of eligible <b>next</b> <b>hops</b> based on the given constraints and the distance to the destination.
