5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>story,</b> Rikki disappeared, and {{the long}} series of adventures of Suske en Wiske began with the story Op het eiland Amoras, {{achieving}} success beyond the author's expectations. The first album appeared in 1946. This story introduced most of the recurring figures and means of transport through space and time, and set the framework for the complete series. Already in 1946, it was also published in the Dutch newspaper De Stem.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark {{were behind}} on the series from the start. After several late issues, the team announced a four-month hiatus between issues 21 and 22 to allow Lark {{to get ahead of}} schedule. They said they would not solicit any additional issues until the <b>next</b> <b>story</b> arc was completed, and the hiatus actually lasted six months, in part because of miscommunication between Image Comics and Diamond Distribution. During the hiatus, they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five months passed between the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Hergé {{sent his}} publisher, Casterman, {{the cover of}} his {{completed}} nineteenth Tintin adventure, The Red Sea Sharks, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his <b>next</b> <b>story.</b> Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, Tintin in America, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé {{came to believe that}} retracing old ground would be a step backwards. Another idea had Tintin striving to prove that Haddock's butler Nestor was framed for a crime committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, but kept the idea of an adventure with no guns or violence—the only Tintin story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus to save them from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, but kept the setting in a snowy environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.|$|E

She agrees, and every night for the next seventy nights, she gets ready to meet him. But she is thwarted in her attempt every single night by the parrot, which adopts the stratagem of telling her a story. The parrot typically expresses approval of its mistress' intention by agreeing {{that the goal of}} life was to seek pleasure and acknowledges the strength of sexual desire. Then it excites her interest by asking whether she had the wits to escape if any troublesome situation were to arise, as the protagonist of her <b>next</b> <b>story</b> had. Padmavati naturally wants to know the details of the story and the parrot proceeds to narrate it. At the end of the story, Padmavati decides not to go for her rendezvous that night.|$|E

500|$|The 1925 New York edition {{begins with}} the short stories [...] "Indian Camp" [...] and [...] "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife". The two are linked thematically; they are set in Michigan and {{introduce}} Nick Adams. Nick witnesses an emergency caesarean section and a suicide in the first; the tension between his parents in the second. The <b>next</b> <b>story,</b> [...] "The End of Something", is also set in Michigan, and details Nick's break-up with his girlfriend; [...] "The Three-Day Blow" [...] follows, where Nick and a friend get drunk. [...] "The Battler" [...] is about Nick's chance encounter with a prize-fighter. [...] "A Very Short Story", which was the longest vignette in the previous edition, comes next and is followed by [...] "Soldier's Home", set in Oklahoma, and [...] "The Revolutionist", set in Italy. The next three are set in Europe and detail unhappy marriages: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Elliot", [...] "Cat in the Rain" [...] and [...] "Out of Season". They are placed before Nick's reappearance in [...] "Cross Country Snow", which takes place in Switzerland. The penultimate [...] "My Old Man" [...] concerns horse-racing in Italy and Paris, and the volume ends with the two-part Nick Adams story [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", set in Michigan. The vignettes were re-ordered and placed between the short stories as interchapters.|$|E

2500|$|Mega-City One {{is a huge}} fictional {{city-state}} covering {{much of what is}} now the Eastern United States {{and some}} of Canada in the Judge Dredd comic book series and its spinoff series. The exact geography of the city depends on which writer and artist has done which story, but from its first appearance it has been associated with New York City's urban sprawl; originally it was presented as a future New York, which was retconned as the centre of a [...] "Mega-City One" [...] in the very <b>next</b> <b>story.</b>|$|E

[...] He's tried many types of bait (slot machine, trampoline), but found that a teacup pig is the best kind, which Ted then borrows after seeing the reaction Robin, Marshall and Lily gave.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{then began}} work on what he {{intended}} as a new series, starting with Spacehounds of IPC, which he finished {{in the autumn of}} 1930. In this novel, he took pains to avoid the scientific impossibilities which had bothered some readers of the Skylark novels. Even in 1938, after he had written Galactic Patrol, Smith considered it his finest work; he later said of it, [...] "This was really scientific fiction; not, like the Skylarks, pseudo-science"; and even {{at the end of his}} career, he considered it his only work of true science fiction. It was published in the July through September 1931 issues of Amazing, with Sloane making unauthorized changes. Fan letters in the magazine complained about the novel's containment within the solar system, and Sloane sided with the readers. So when Harry Bates, editor of Astounding Stories, offered Smith 2¢/word—payable on publication—for his <b>next</b> <b>story,</b> he agreed; this meant that it could not be a sequel to Spacehounds.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{remaining}} three episodes, the four become involved in a brutal power struggle within a Stone Age tribe. In [...] "The Cave of Skulls", the group encounters a Paleolithic tribe and are subsequently imprisoned by them in a large cave. In [...] "The Forest of Fear", they are shown {{to escape from the}} settlement but are subsequently intercepted before reaching the TARDIS. They barely escape with their lives by exploitation of Ian's knowledge of how to produce fire, which induces fear and respect in the primitive Stone Age society. The final episode, [...] "The Firemaker", has the group mediating separate factions of the tribe before fleeing to the TARDIS. They travel, seemingly at random, to a new destination; even the Doctor does not know where. The TARDIS's view screen shows a mysterious forest that the Doctor declares [...] "could be anywhere", which acts as a teaser for the <b>next</b> <b>story.</b> [...] As the time travellers leave their machine, a radiation meter is shown on the console of the machine, unheeded by them, registering [...] "Danger".|$|E
2500|$|Lucas {{completed}} a second draft of The Star Wars in January 1975, making heavy simplifications and introducing the young hero {{on a farm}} as Luke Starkiller. Annikin became Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. [...] "The Force" [...] was also introduced as a mystical energy field. This second draft still had some differences from the final version in the characters and relationships. For example, Luke had several brothers, {{as well as his}} father, who appears in a minor role {{at the end of the}} film. The script became more of a fairy tale quest as opposed to the action-adventure of the previous versions. This version ended with another text crawl, previewing the <b>next</b> <b>story</b> in the series. This draft was also the first to introduce the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side: the draft included a historical Jedi who became the first to ever fall to the dark side, and then trained the Sith to use it. Impressed with his works, Lucas hired conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie to create paintings of certain scenes around this time. When Lucas delivered his screenplay to the studio, he included several of McQuarrie's paintings.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, it was {{announced}} that Nicieza would replace Yost as the author of Red Robin, and Nicieza was quick to note his interest in using Anarky and Moneyspider in future issues of the series. Nicieza reintroduced Ulysses Armstrong and Lonnie Machin {{over the course of several}} storylines, and regularly used Lonnie as a cast member of the ongoing Red Robin series. Within Nicieza's first storyline, [...] "The Hit List", Tim Drake rescues Lonnie Machin from the evil Ulysses Armstrong, who escapes capture and still claims the [...] "Anarky" [...] mantle. Recruiting Lonnie as he recovers from his coma, Drake asks that Machin act as Moneyspider and join him in fighting crime. Tim Drake comes to rely on Machin for his computer wizardry, as well as for his advice and companionship, in issues that follow. In the <b>next</b> <b>story</b> arc, [...] "The Rabbit Hole", Nicieza reintroduced readers to a concept explored in other DC Universe comic books—the virtual reality realm of the Ünternet. Within the plot, Tim Drake is aided by Machin in hacking the Ünternet, a virtual realm used by criminals as a meeting space and form of entertainment. Once inside, Machin seizes control of the system, where he is returned to a digitized semblance of his former health and reclaims the mantle of [...] "Anarky" [...] within cyberspace. Uniquely gifted with full control of his bicameral mind, he leaves half of his personality as Anarky online at all times, even as the other half interacts with Drake offline as Moneyspider. Fending off villains within the digital realm with Tim Drake's help, Moneyspider is told to shut down the entire system by Drake. Sensing an opportunity, he pretends to do so, but instead secretly salvages it for himself. With the cancellation of the series five months later, the repercussions of these events were left unexplored.|$|E
