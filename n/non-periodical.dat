5000|$|Beginning with {{propaganda}} {{during the}} Reformation, {{the rise of}} the printing press and literacy led to pamphleteering enjoying its heyday from the 17th Century to the 19th Century. Books were considered expensive and tracts did not necessarily address contemporary issues so pamphlets were widely produced and circulated.UNESCO defined a pamphlet as [...] " [...] a <b>non-periodical</b> printed publication of at least 5 but not more than 48 pages, exclusive of the cover pages, published in a particular country and made available to the public" [...] and a book as [...] "a <b>non-periodical</b> printed publication of at least 49 pages, exclusive of the cover pages".

The book sheds light on the category of displaced Palestinians, a marginalised and absent group on local, regional and international levels. In spite of efforts by research and study centres, activists, and those concerned with the issue of Palestinian refugees, in publishing studies, articles and reports, it was noted that this category of the Palestinian people—who sought refuge in the camps of Lebanon after the Nakba of 1948, and especially in the two camps of al Nabatiyah in South Lebanon, and Tel al Zater in East Beirut—have not been covered.|$|E

40|$|Periodical cicadas (Magicicada spp.) in the USA {{are famous}} for their unique prime-numbered life cycles of 13 and 17 years and their nearly {{perfectly}} synchronized mass emergences. Because almost all known species of cicada are <b>non-periodical,</b> periodicity {{is assumed to be}} a derived state. A leading hypothesis for the evolution of periodicity in Magicicada implicates the decline in average temperature during glacial periods. During the evolution of periodicity, the determinant of maturation in ancestral cicadas is hypothesized to have switched from size dependence to time (period) dependence. The selection for the prime-numbered cycles should have taken place only after the fixation of periodicity. Here, we build an individual-based model of cicadas under conditions of climatic cooling to explore the fixation of periodicity. In our model, under cold environments, extremely long juvenile stages lead to extremely low adult densities, limiting mating opportunities and favouring the evolution of synchronized emergence. Our results indicate that these changes, which were triggered by glacial cooling, could have led to the fixation of periodicity in the <b>non-periodical</b> ancestors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- An {{idea of the}} {{new type}} of instrument, {{improved}} by pre-processing of the measurement data {{is presented in the}} paper. This instrument has an extensive data handling procedures, which allow to investigate different periodical and <b>non-periodical</b> components in raw data and to clean the data from identified influences. Such cleaning upgrades the type A uncertainty evaluation. I. The Challenge In raw collected measurement data, may exist some unknown periodical and non periodical components, which appear in an object under investigation or in an measurement instrumentation. The widely internationally accepted Guide to Uncertainty in Measurement, GUM, and its actual and proposed Supplements [1 - 3], [6] do not refer to treatment of raw collected data before procedure of type A uncertainty is applied. Such a pre-processing of raw data, was presented in the paper presented at IMEKO TC 4 2007 Symposium in Iasi [7]. Proposed data pre-processing refers to either regularly in time sampled data or collected in known moments in time. Based on method proposed in [9] the virtual instrument which facilitates a man, who run en experiment is developed and the results of application are presented in the paper. The idea is based on investigation of a priori unknown periodical and <b>non-periodical</b> components i...|$|E
30|$|In the <b>non-periodical</b> ground {{pressure}} period, {{the depth of}} coal wall spalling increased with the face advance speed at {{the upper part of}} the face, and eventually maintained at a certain depth range. When the face advance speed reached 3.05  m/d, the coal wall spalling length and depth reached their maximum values of 35  m and 0.6  m respectively, and the maximum spalling ratio was 66.67  %. The relationship between spalling length, depth, ratio and the face advance speed displayed a significant range. But generally, the values tended to increase with the face advance speed.|$|E
30|$|At {{different}} stages of <b>non-periodical</b> ground pressure and periodical pressure, as the differences in mining height, advance speed and distance from the support tip to the coal wall, the spalling depth and spalling ratio were different at a LLTCC coal mining face (Yan 2008; Yin et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2010). In order {{to better understand the}} spalling mechanism at a LLTCC coal mining face, the coal wall spalling were examined under different conditions including mining heights, advance rates, distances from the support tip to the coal wall, and ground pressure stages.|$|E

In general, the depth of coal wall spalling showed less variation with face advance speed {{at the lower}} part of the face, the average spalling depth concentrated within 0.3 – 0.4  m.
