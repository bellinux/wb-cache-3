The findings help explain the rise of <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> during much of the 1990 s. We show that <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> inhibit enterprise restructuring.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a survey of more than 3, 000 firms in 20 transition countries. It shows that barter and other <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> (including the use of bills of exchange, debt swaps, barter chains, and the redemption of debt in goods) are an important phenomenon in Russia and Ukraine. Contrary to what is commonly believed they are not negligible in Central and Eastern Europe. The causes and consequences vary significantly between countries, but several conclusions emerge strongly. First, barter and other <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> are associated in all countries with financing difficulties for firms. They appear to be helping to assure liquidity in an environment in which contract enforcement (including tax enforcement) is uncertain. Secondly, the use of these mechanisms is not significantly related to the restructuring and performance of firms that use them in most countries except Russia. Thirdly, in Russia and Ukraine the nature of nonmonetary transacting is importantly different from elsewhere. It is much more associated than elsewhere with market power and limited trading networks. It is also more costly in terms of restructuring and performance. Firms that barter are less likely to improve thei...|$|E

40|$|It can be {{observed}} that in consumer-to-consumer on-line auctions, {{there is a strong}} degree of price dispersion, even in liquid markets with a large number of bids per auction item. This Thesis research strives to quantify such dispersion and present explanations for the key findings on the nature of price dispersion in on-line auctions of like goods: Although contrary to common sense and public opinion, I found no significant correlation of winning bid price with feedback rating. This is true for low, medium-high and high value goods and for both new and used goods. This observation holds for all ranges of feedback ratings. Of all of the other variables of an auction listing: (shipping costs, amount of opening bid, number of bids, accepted payment types, picture in listing, and the use of reserve prices), only picture in listing and use of reserve prices are correlated with winning bid price. This observation holds for all types of goods examined. However, correcting for these variables does not significantly reduce price dispersion. The majority of the dispersion in winning bid prices of same-good auctions {{can be explained by the}} unique ability of the on-line auction process to obtain the reservation prices of buyers in the market, through its use of maximum bid amounts and proxy bidding. An auction winning bid curve for a good can be constructed by aggregating the winning bid prices of all auctions of that good over a period of time. The downward sloping and isoelastic nature of this curve can be explained in part by the downward sloping demand curve for that good, made up by the range of premiums buyers are willing to pay in order to increase their chances of winning the auction, and getting the item sooner. The exact shape of the curve can be further explained and in fact reconstructed by an examination of the statistics of grouping bids in auctions. Arbitrage to take advantage of the dispersion of winning bid prices can be shown to be possible, and in theory it appears to be surprisingly profitable. This suggests that on-line auction markets are only weakly market efficient. Several explanations were explored as to why arbitrage has not been pursued, thereby eliminating the observed dispersion. These explanations include the unseen <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transaction</b> and arbitrage costs, the level of sophistication necessary to capitalize on opportunities, and the persisting immaturity of the consumer-to-consumer on-line auction market. by Mark Andrew Perutz.

In the virtual economy, barter and <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> {{play a key role in}} transferring value from productive activities to the natural monopolies and loss-making sectors of the economy. The project aims at providing a consistent and multi-facet exposition of main features of the Russian virtual economy, and explains why it is different from other transition economies. In particular, the endogenous appearance of money substitutes and wide-spread use of <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> are explained as a result of the optimizing behavior of agents in the economy, given the inherited distorted structure, the existence of large natural monopolies, the unproductive sector organized into informal networks, and the government policies aimed at the support of this sector. We highlight the typical distortions of the price system, and provide an explanation of the observed dynamics of the volume of money substitutes in circulation after August 1998 crisis. We show that the Russian virtual economy can be in one of two steady states with approximately the same price systems but essentially different volumes of money substitutes in circulation. Transition into the state with the smaller volume of money substitutes in circulation can be caused by an increase of the number of active producers resulting from some external shock. We conjecture that should the productive business activity be suppressed, then the economy can swiftly return to the former state with the large volume of money substitutes in circulation.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive literature {{review of the}} use of non- monetary transactions (barter, debt offsets, etc.) in Russia since the fall of Communism. The two primary theories are the credit crunch (liquidity constraint) theory and the virtual economy theory. The former relates to the lack of access to bank credit and cash and the rise of <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> as a survival mechanism that oils the gears of the market. The latter asserts that barter is a symptom of a system by which the value added firms (such as Gasprom) subsidize the value destroying firms (the 'white elephants'). Barter allows the two players to arbitrarily set prices so that the value added firm can avoid some of the profit taxes while the value destroying firms can stay alive. barter, non-monetary, Russia, demonetization, transition...|$|E

This non-monetary functioning of the Russian economy has increased the costs of the economic system and new market economy reforms concentrated on monetary consolidation haven’t produced the expected results, because public polices were not credible and policy makers didn’t anticipate the appearance of new firms in the transition period. economic transition, monetary markets, barter economy...|$|E

Using interview data, it {{examines the}} mechanics of barter settlements and classifies the main types of <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions.</b> The major reason for barter is lack of a competitive monetary system. In the 1990 s barter represented a specific vehicle to perform settlements. Barter itself is not a way to evade taxes or to defraud enterprises of assets. But barter changed the motivation of enterprises and led to systematic distortion of accounting data. The low transparency of the barter economy creates barriers for investment and restructuring. The barter economy is an insider's economy. The lack of affiliated entity regulation and mechanisms for disclosure of transactions with related parties stimulates insiders to criminal application of barter and monetary surrogates.

This book provides an accessible and authoritative analysis of barter in the former Soviet Union, addressing such questions as: • What has brought about this demonetization and why have we not seen the same phenomenon on a widespread scale in central and eastern Europe? • Does the nature of demonetization cast light on what underpins monetary transactions in industrial societies? • What are the consequences for output and growth? • Should the state intervene and how? • Does the network character of many <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> have implications for the role and value of social networks in complex modern societies?...|$|E
40|$|Providing basic {{financial}} services to rural people can enhance their security {{by eliminating the}} need for them to hold cash and can offer them alternative venues for borrowing. Placing a branch in rural villages is not however cost effective. In recent years, the concept of branchless banking has emerged in which a person who has a phone and sufficient liquidity (called a shopkeeper hereafter) acts as a bank agent. Others in the village (hereafter called farmers) perform withdrawals and deposits with the shopkeeper. Because the farmers and shopkeepers may not trust one another completely and the possibilities for fraud are legion, some form of security is needed. Because the farmers are unsophisticated, the protocols must be simple and intuitive. We present such a protocol that is robust to dishonest shopkeepers, farmers, and eavesdroppers. The protocol assumes that at least the shopkeeper has a phone and that the farmer can read numbers and can converse. The protocol makes use of secret lists of numbers delivered on scratch cards. A similar protocol can be used for <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions,</b> e. g. to ensure that the proper drugs are delivered...|$|E

The goal is {{to understand how the}} commercial networks devoted to non-timber forest products are affecting one community by including cash-income into the economic life of communities previously dominated by <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> but currently dominated by a mix of monetary and non-monetary practices.

This case study analyses different non-timber forest product projects in Aukre, a village {{that is part of the}} Kayapó Indigenous Territories, Brazil. Th is article identifi es ten criteria that the villagers use to evaluate cash-income opportunities and, considering these criteria, why community members consider non-timber forest product projects desirable.

40|$|Throughout the Western world, {{governments and}} {{financial}} elites {{responded to the}} financial crisis of 2008 by trying to restore the conditions of business as usual, but the economic, social and human damage inflicted by the crisis {{has given rise to}} a reconsideration of the inevitability of unfettered capitalism as a fact of life. A number of economic practices and organizations emerged in Europe and the United States that embodied alternative values: the value of life over the value of money; the effectiveness of cooperation over cut-throat competition; the social responsibility of corporations and responsible regulation by governments over the short-term speculative strategies that brought the economy to the brink of catastrophe. This book examines the blossoming of innovative new experiments in organizing work and life that emerged {{in the wake of the}} financial crisis: cooperatives, barter networks, ethical banking, community currencies, shared time banks, solidarity networks, sharing of goods, <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions,</b> etc., experiments that paved the way for the emergence of a sharing economy in all domains of activity oriented toward the satisfaction of human needs. Other innovations included the creation of cryptographic virtual currencies, epitomized by bitcoin, which blended a libertarian, entrepreneurial spirit with information technology to provide an alternative to standard forms of currency. On the basis of a cross-cultural analysis of alternative economic practices, this book develops an important theoretical argument: that the economy, as a human practice, is shaped by culture, and that the diversity of cultures, as revealed in a time of crisis, implies the possibility of different economies depending on the values and power relations that define economic institutions.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of barter {{is one of the}} most {{surprising}} phenomena in Russia: As a percentage of industrial sales it steadily increased from 5 % in 1992 to nearly 55 % in 1998. Unknown in CEEC's transition countries, barter is only one aspect of the Russian economy's demonetisation [process, along with dollarisation, growing arrears, and the widespread use of veksels and offsets. Barter is often seen as the consequence of the lack of restructuring, but some authors argue that it is a mechanism used to avoid shutting down potentially viable firms, in a context of market imperfections. The implications differ depending on the analysis chosen: in the first case, an expansionary monetary policy might not be appropriate, while the contrary is true if the demonetisation process jeopardizes potentially good enterprises. This paper aims to assess this phenomenon in the Russian economy. The paper's main contribution to work in this field (reviewed and documented in section II) is to highlight two different rationales for barter. Before studying the latter more closely, section III uses official monthly data collected by the central bank of Russia, the Goskomstat, and the Russian Economic Barometer (REB), to emphasize the macro-economic features of barter in Russia, and, more specifically, the link between monetary policy and bartering activity. It appears that macroeconomic policy and macroeconomic indicators are unable to explain the whole process. In section IV, quarterly statistics for 1995 and 1996 taken from the REB survey of roughly 200 firms make it possible to implement a more qualitative survey. The conclusion is striking: barter is used by potentially viable firms as a way of avoiding closure, while at the same time financing increasing inventories and soft goods in the case of indebted firms who use barter transactions, bank credit and choose to accumulate arrers in order to avoid restructuring. barter, <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions,</b> virtual economy, Russia, transition...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing developing countries is the provision of basic services and infrastructure. Provision of these services and infrastructure in these countries is often characterised by ineffectiveness, low quality, inaccessibility and unreliability. One basic service that has proven to be particularly problematic is the provision of water and sanitation, Poor delivery of this service affecting and is affected by the level of economic development of any nation. The main objectives of this study are to determine how much Swazi households are willing to pay (WTP) for an improvement in their water quality and quantity as well as establishing the possible factors affecting this WTP. This will help to put in monetary terms the value of good quality and quantity of domestic water in Swaziland as well as factors that affect this monetary value. The study used the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to evaluate improvements in domestic water quality and quantity, based on households’ perception of domestic water in Swaziland. The method involved an analysis of the factors determining households’ WTP for improved domestic water quality, quantity and the health risk concern from using it. The project covered the eleven main towns of Swaziland with a sample taken from both the rural and urban areas of the towns. The results obtained indicated that the WTP for the domestic water quality and quantity improvements is small but significant. There were more households in the rural areas willing to pay for improvements in the quality (67 %) of water than in the urban areas (20 %). The same trend was observed for the willingness to pay for water quantity. Approximately 58 % of households in the rural areas and 6 % of households in the urban areas were willing to pay for increased water quantity. However, the rural households were willing to pay on average an amount of E 6. 44 for improved water quality per month, which was much lower than the average amount urban households were willing to pay (E 16. 40). In contrast households in the rural area were more willing to pay for increased quantities (E 7. 13) than households in the urban areas (E 6. 82), albeit the small difference between the figures. On average the rural households were consuming less water (0. 92 m 3) per month than their urban counterparts (6. 92 m 3). Rural household heads earned an average income of E 1269. 49 made up a per capita mean income of E 200. Urban households heads’ average income was E 4830 and the per capita mean income was E 1092. 00. Moreover, the survey results show that people aware of health hazards brought about by using unhealthy water are inclined to conserve the water quality by paying a fee for it. Not all the households were willing to pay for improvements in water services. In the urban areas, these were households that were satisfied with the status of the water condition (94 %). And in the rural areas these were households that could not afford to pay for improvements (42 %). In the latter case, the households mainly use <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> for the exchange of services and goods and have never paid for water services before. They believed that access to adequate water quality and quantity was a basic right that should be provided by the government. In addition they did not trust their local authorities and believed that if they were to pay for improve water services their money would not be used accordingly.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the relation}} between institutions {{and the emergence of}} markets {{in the context of the}} Russian transition since the beginning of the 1990 s. Introducing democracy and market economic relations in Russia are goals that require profound changes in the institutional framework inherited from the Soviet Union. Institutions are "rules-in-use" governing interactions in the socio-economic system. Institutions tend to change slowly, either spontaneously in response to changes in the environment in which the system is embedded, or as a result of collective decisions by citizens or their representatives. The topics discussed in this thesis can be framed through the following questions: What is the general role of institutions in the ongoing changes in Russian society? Are there institutions that hamper the transition process towards democracy and a market economy? If so, how do they hamper this process? How can such institutions be changed to better serve the needs of the emerging market system? To what extent must new institutions be substituted for old in order to improve the situation? The studies reported in the thesis address these questions from different but related perspectives. Based on analyses of previous research, official statistical data, and a series of case studies of forest enterprises in eight Russian regions it is shown (in article I) that a specific and, in a market economic perspective, utterly peculiar institutional set-up, the virtual economy, came to govern forest enterprises' behaviour in the early phase of the Russian transition. For reasons having to do with the special resource allocation model of the Soviet command economy a large share of the enterprises that Russia inherited after the disintegration of the Soviet Union was miserably unfit to meet market competition. If forced to meet global market competition many (if not most) of them would have been threatened with bankruptcy. Since there was no institutional infrastructure that could mitigate such massive disruptive events and reallocate resources into new profitable production activities, the consequences would likely have been devastating for the whole Russian society. In this situation, to avoid bankruptcy and stay alive, many enterprises "insulated" themselves from market competition by entering the virtual economy and engaging in <b>non-monetary</b> <b>transactions</b> with other enterprises in a similar predicament. While the first article (I) identifies pertinent characteristics of the institutional set-up defining the virtual economy in the context of the Russian regional forest sector, the second article (II) addresses the issue of how to introduce institutional changes through a collectively chosen design process. Policy exercises were used as a tool for conducting this systemic intervention with the purpose of initiating participatory policy formulating processes in four of the previous case study regions. It was found that, in principle, policy exercises could be an efficient vehicle for a participatory elaboration of policy proposals in Russia. However, in the current political context stakeholders' insufficient trust in public procedures and the weakness of civic organisations hampered a successful participatory Russian forest policy formulation. In the third article (III) one of the previous case study regions (Arkhangelsk Oblast) was revisited and a second round of interviews was made with forest enterprises that took part in the previous study (I). The purpose of the study was to see if the behaviour typical of the virtual economy was giving way to a more market efficient behaviour. The analysis indicated that this was indeed the case, a result that was further corroborated by an analysis of statistical data pertaining to the development in all of Russia. The thesis is based on the assumptions that the process of designing and introducing new or modified institutions to govern actors' behaviour, and to do this in a way that ensures the legitimacy of the resulting policy proposals, is greatly facilitated and improved by the existence of functioning democratic procedures. The last article (IV) discusses the functioning of Russian democracy using a conceptual model for assessing the efficiency of the Russian political market. It is argued that such a model must embrace both the structure and agency characteristics of the political market. To illustrate the approach, a survey was made of recent institutional changes affecting the structure of the Russian political market. The analysis indicated that several reforms introduced in the last few years have improved the structural prerequisites for democracy and more efficiently functioning political market behaviour in Russia. The thesis is believed to contribute to our understanding of the role of institutions in building democracy and market economies in transition countries. Godkänd; 2008; 20080602 (ysko...|$|E
