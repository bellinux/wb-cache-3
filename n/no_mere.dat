25|$|The {{southern}} {{army had}} no such success. Like in 1586, Mingyi Swa invaded northern Siam from Lan Na, and could not again get past the Lampang fort led by Naresuan. But unlike in 1586, it was <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> retreat. The army was thoroughly defeated outside Lampang in March 1591. The remaining army arrived back in such disarray that Nanda verbally disparaged Mingyi Swa and executed {{some of the top}} generals.|$|E
25|$|Total depravity {{does not}} mean, however, {{that people are}} as evil as possible. Rather, it means that even the good which a person may intend is faulty in its premise, false in its motive, and weak in its implementation; and there is <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> {{refinement}} of natural capacities that can correct this condition. Thus, even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact egoist acts in disguise. All good, consequently, is derived from God alone, and in no way through man.|$|E

25|$|Nanda had {{not given}} up. In 1590, the king again ordered Swa to lead another {{invasion}} of northern Siam. Nanda had planned a full-scale invasion but had to scale back his plans to northern Siam because northern Shan states of Mohnyin and Mogaung had also revolted. On , Swa again invaded northern Siam from Lan Na. It was essentially {{a repeat of the}} 1586 invasion except in the severity of defeat. Like in 1586, his army could not again get past the Lampang fort led by Naresuan. But unlike in 1586, it was <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> retreat. The 24-regiment, 20,000-man army was thoroughly defeated outside Lampang in March 1591.

25|$|Gustav found greater success abroad. From 4 February to 25 March 1771, Gustav was in Paris, {{where he}} carried both {{the court and}} the city by storm. The poets and the {{philosophers}} paid him enthusiastic homage, and distinguished women testified to his superlative merits. With many of them he maintained a lifelong correspondence. His visit to the French capital was, however, <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> pleasure trip; {{it was also a}} political mission. Confidential agents from the Swedish court had already prepared the way for him, and the Duke of Choiseul, the retired Chief Minister, resolved to discuss with him the best method of bringing about a revolution in France's ally, Sweden. Before he departed, the French government undertook to pay the outstanding subsidies to Sweden unconditionally, at the rate of one and a half million livres annually. Count de Vergennes, {{one of the most prominent}} French diplomats, was transferred from Constantinople to Stockholm.|$|E
25|$|Of this {{head and}} two other pieces of {{sculpture}} exhibited by Brâncuși in July, 1913, at the Allied Artists' Exhibition in London, Roger Fry said in The Nation, August 2: Constantin Brâncuși's sculptures have not, I think, been seen before in England. His three heads are the most remarkable works of sculpture at the Albert Hall. Two are in brass and one in stone. They show a technical skill which is almost disquieting, a skill which might lead him, in default of any overpowering imaginative purpose, to become a brilliant pasticheur. But {{it seemed to me}} there was evidence of passionate conviction; that the simplification of forms was <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> exercise in plastic design, but a real interpretation of the rhythm of life. These abstract vivid forms into which he compresses his heads give a vivid presentment of character; they are not empty abstractions, but filled with a content which has been clearly, and passionately apprehended.|$|E

25|$|During {{his stay}} in Britain, the Sunday Times {{initially}} put Vanunu up {{in a hotel}} in London close to the newspaper's premises, but shortly afterward, he was moved to what was considered a safer location: a lodge near Welwyn, in rural Hertfordshire, which was in an obscure location and accessed by a narrow road. Hounam considered it an excellent hiding place. During one foray into London together with a Sunday Times journalist, Vanunu encountered an Israeli friend, Yoram Bazak, and his girlfriend Dorit on Regent Street. They agreed to meet later. When they met, Bazak intensely questioned Vanunu on his views towards Israel's defense policy, and during the conversation, Vanunu told Bazak {{about the possibility of}} him publicly revealing secrets from Dimona to the British press, Bazak responded with a menacing threat. Hounam speculated that Vanunu's meeting with Bazak was <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> coincidence, and that Bazak had been recruited by Mossad in an attempt to discover Vanunu's motives and try to dissaude him. Vanunu later grew bored of rural Hertfordshire and asked for a new location in London, and he was booked in the first hotel he had stayed in under a false name. Hounam speculated that as Oscar Guerrero, who had followed him and Vanunu to London, had already stayed there, Mossad likely had that hotel under surveillance.|$|E

500|$|On {{the matter}} of {{historical}} accuracy, Christopher Caldwell wrote in the Financial Times: [...] "Of course, we must not mistake a feature film for a public television documentary", {{pointing out that the}} film should be treated as entertainment, not as a historical account of the time period it is set in. [...] "Django uses slavery the way a pornographic film might use a nurses' convention: as a pretext for what is really meant to entertain us. What is really meant to entertain us in Django is violence." [...] Richard Brody, however, wrote in The New Yorker that Tarantino's [...] "vision of slavery's monstrosity is historically accurate.... Tarantino rightly depicts slavery as <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> administrative ownership but a grievous and monstrous infliction of cruelty." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon after, Johanna Weber and Dietrich Küchemann at the RAE {{published}} {{a series of}} reports on a new wing planform, known in the UK as the [...] "slender delta" [...] concept. The team, including Eric Maskell whose report [...] "Flow Separation in Three Dimensions" [...] contributed {{to an understanding of the}} physical nature of separated flow, worked with the fact that delta wings can produce strong vortexes on their upper surfaces at high angles of attack. The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by Chuck Yeager in the Convair XF-92, but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.|$|E
500|$|Barbette was {{championed by}} avant garde artist Jean Cocteau. Cocteau wrote in 1923 to Belgian friend and critic Paul Collaer: [...] "Next week in Brussels, you'll see a music-hall act called 'Barbette' {{that has been}} keeping me enthralled for a fortnight.

An angel, a flower, a bird." ...|$|E

[...] He also added that the track [...] "is <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> soundtrack" [...] for the video. AllMusic's Heather Phares gave the DVD single four out of five stars, considering it [...] "a necessary addition to the collections of dedicated Bjork fans". Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly also gave the single a positive review, commending its B-sides and writing it [...] "was hardly the most striking piece at the time—but the tune turns out to have been something of a sleeper." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{describes}} his {{articulation of the}} imaginary as:The image, the imagined, the imaginary - these are all terms that direct us to something critical and new in global cultural processes: the imagination as a social practice. <b>No</b> longer <b>mere</b> fantasy (opium for the masses whose real work is somewhere else), no longer simple escape (from a world defined principally by more concrete purposes and structures), no longer elite pastime (thus not relevant {{to the lives of}} ordinary people), and <b>no</b> longer <b>mere</b> contemplation (irrelevant for new forms of desire and subjectivity), the imagination has become an organized field of social practices, a form of work (in the sense of both labor and culturally organized practice), and a form of negotiation between sites of agency (individuals) and globally defined fields of possibility. This unleashing of the imagination links the play of pastiche (in some settings) to the terror and coercion of states and their competitors. The imagination is now central to all forms of agency, is itself a social fact, and is the key component of the new global order.|$|R

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter how bad things were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E
500|$|MacArthur {{remains a}} {{controversial}} and enigmatic figure. He has been {{portrayed as a}} reactionary, although he was in many respects ahead of his time. He championed a progressive approach to the reconstruction of Japanese society, arguing that all occupations ultimately ended badly for the occupier and the occupied. He was often {{out of step with}} his contemporaries, such as in 1941 when he contended that Nazi Germany could not defeat the Soviet Union, when he argued that North Korea and China were <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> Soviet puppets, and throughout his career in his insistence that the future lay in the Far East. This implicitly rejected White American contemporary notions of their own racial superiority. He always treated Filipino and Japanese leaders with respect as equals. At the same time, his Victorian sensibilities recoiled at leveling Manila with aerial bombing, an attitude the hardened World War II generation regarded as old fashioned. When asked about MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey once said that [...] "The best and the worst things you hear about him are both true." ...|$|E
500|$|As in most Westminster system parliaments, Australia's {{government}} is {{formed by the}} party enjoying {{the confidence of the}} lower House of Parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia's Parliament also has a powerful upper house, the Senate, which must pass any legislation initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state's population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation. The Constitution forbids the Senate to originate or amend a money bill, but places no limitation on the Senate's ability to defeat one. In 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, had stated of a budget bill, [...] "Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and destroy the Government which has sponsored it." ...|$|E

500|$|Tom Phillips of Metro {{stated that}} [...] "Amy and Canton's sojourn to the orphanage {{was not just}} a high-mark for sheer skin-crawling horror on recent {{mainstream}} telly— that image of The Silence nesting on the ceiling like cadaverous bat-people will live on in the nightmares of many, many children— but also genuinely, properly weird." [...] Dave Golder from SFX thought that although the series was [...] "shaping up to be like no other before it, as the show moves even further away from its traditional series of sequential standalone stories format and more towards Lost style storytelling", that the episode [...] "is <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> exercise in delayed gratification. You want fun? You want creepy? You want action? You've got it– all not-so-neatly tied up with a neat bow tie." [...] Golder went on to state that [...] "once again we're treated to some outstanding direction, glorious performances, near flawless FX and gorgeous locations ... "Day Of The Moon" [...] is huge fun, effortlessly entertaining, beguilingly bat's-arse [...] and blessed with a cliffhanger so jawdroppingly unexpected it's bound to keep viewers hooked". He gave the episode a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are".|$|E
500|$|The finale {{brings out}} Haydn's playfulness. The sound effect that predominates is unison bariolage, a {{technique}} heard for instance {{at the very}} opening: [...] the first violinist fingers the note A on the D string, then bows {{in a way that}} rapidly alternates playing this fingered A with the identically-pitched A on the adjacent open (unfingered) A string. The resulting strange pulsating effect is the consequence of an open string having a quite distinct timbre (louder, more ringing) from a fingered one. Haydn employed unison bariolage in a number of his works (such as the [...] "Farewell" [...] Symphony), but nowhere is it employed as obsessively as in the Opus 50 No. 6 finale. The sound of unison bariolage has reminded some listeners of a croaking frog, and is what earned the quartet its nickname. But the movement is <b>no</b> <b>mere</b> auditory joke. It contains important thematic connections to the earlier movements that, aside from the explicit segues between movements, result in a significant degree of cyclic integration. The most important thematic connection is that the closing-phrase opening of the first movement reappears in the finale in a modified form: it no longer stands alone, but as the second part of an eight-measure phrase that forms the movement's secondary theme. Presented in this context, the ambiguity inherent in its appearance in the first movement is resolved.|$|E
