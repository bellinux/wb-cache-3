2500|$|The world's first car-carrying {{hovercraft}} {{was made}} in 1968, the BHC Mountbatten class (SR.N4) models, each powered by four Bristol Proteus turboshaft engines. These were both used by rival operators Hoverlloyd and Seaspeed (joined to form Hoverspeed in 1981) to operate regular car and passenger carrying services across the English Channel. Hoverlloyd operated from Ramsgate, where a special hoverport had been built at Pegwell Bay, to Calais. Seaspeed operated from Dover, England, to Calais and Boulogne in France.

These were later joined by the French-built SEDAM N500 <b>Naviplane</b> with a capacity of 385 passengers and 45 cars; only one entered service and was used intermittently for a few years on the cross-channel service until returned to SNCF in 1983. The service ceased in 2000 after 32years, due to competition with traditional ferries, catamaran, the disappearance of duty-free shopping within the EU, the advancing age of the SR.N4 hovercraft and the opening of the Channel Tunnel.|$|E

This {{was a series}} of multi-skirt hovercraft built by SEDAM using and developing the skirt designs by French engineer Jean Bertin. The series included the <b>Naviplane</b> N102, the <b>Naviplane</b> N300 and the N500 <b>Naviplane,</b> the N300 <b>Naviplane</b> was the first full-scale <b>Naviplane</b> designed for commercial use.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Naviplane</b> N300 MKII was a {{proposed}} improved {{model of the}} N300. It {{was intended as a}} 120-seat, high-speed amphibious hoverferry for commercial use and a wide range of military roles.|$|E

50|$|The N500 <b>Naviplane</b> was a French {{hovercraft}} {{built by}} SEDAM (Société d'Etude et de Développement des Aéroglisseurs Marins) in Pauillac, Gironde for the cross channel route.
