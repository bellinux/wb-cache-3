40|$|Capital {{mobility}} {{leads to}} a speed of convergence smaller in an open economy than in a closed economy. This {{is related to the}} presence of two capitals, produced with specific technologies, and where one of the capitals is nontradable, like infrastructures or human capital. Suppose, for example, that the economy is relatively less abundant in human capital, leading to a decrease of the remuneration of this capital during the transition. In a closed economy, the remuneration of physical capital will be increasing during the transition. In the open economy, the alternative investment yields the international interest rate, corresponding to the steady state <b>net</b> <b>remuneration</b> of physical capital in the closed economy. The nonarbitrage condition shows a larger difference in the remuneration of the two capitals in the closed economy. It {{leads to a}} higher accumulation of human capital and thus to a faster speed of convergence in the closed economy. This result stands in sharp contrast with that of the one-sector neoclassical growth model, where the speed of convergence is smaller in the closed economy...|$|E
30|$|The {{old system}} was non-transparent. People did not {{understand}} its rules and did not care about their own participation in the system (see next sections).

40|$|People’s {{motivation}} {{to get work}} {{is to look for}} the wages which means the benchmark to know the level of workers’ welfare. The welfare should be adjusted with the minimum wages which is used as a safety <b>net</b> on the <b>remuneration.</b> The minimum wage itself is the lowest monthly wages which comprises the base salary and fixed allowances. The minimum wages of DIY province in years of 2011 was Rp. 808. 000, 00. UMP should be aimed for the part-time worker and permanent worker. However, It is not found in PT. Anindya Mitra Internasional, Because the minimum wage at the company acquired certain employees within an average of Rp. 830 000. In fact, such amount is in conformity with the UMP DIY, but in that amount includes base salary, fixed allowances, and non fixed allowances. So if the amount is reduced by the allowance amount is not fixed then it certainly will not achieve the minimum wage. The explanation above makes the writer did the research in PT. Anindya Mitra Internasional. In order to know the remuneration in that company if it is in accordance with prevailing rules. Base on the result of research from the writer, it’s obtained a result that the part-time worker got monthly wages depend on UMP DIY. However, non fixed allowances are not included in monthly payment. It’s done by the PT. Anindya Mitra Internasional because they are experiencing the detriment or decrease in income in recent years. It is also comes up in the reduction of some employees who is considered unproductive recently. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Optimal {{contracting}} {{continues to}} dominate boardroom and dinner discussions worldwide {{in light of}} the 2008 global financial crisis and especially in South Africa, due to the growing income gap. Increased scrutiny is being placed on South African state-owned entities (SOEs), {{as a result of the}} seemingly poor performance of SOEs. Some of the SOEs are reported to have received financial bailouts from taxpayers’ money, while executives are raking in millions of rands in remuneration, provoking some concerns on the alignment of executive pay to company performance in SOEs. Aim: The study will assist remuneration committees and policymakers in the structuring of executive pay in SOEs to ensure alignment to company performance. Setting: The study sought to assess, based on empirical evidence, if there is a positive relationship between Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) remuneration and company performance in South African SOEs in the period between 2010 and 2014. All 21 Schedule 2 SOEs were included in the study. Methods: The research was a quantitative archival research methodology. Correlation and multiple regression analysis were the main statistical techniques used in this study. Results: Contrary to popular media, a positive relationship between CEO and CFO remuneration (fixed pay and short-term incentives) and company performance in SOEs was observed. Company size appears to be the key determiner of fixed pay in SOEs. The positive relationship was mainly noted on absolute profitability measurements like EBITDA (earnings before interest and tax and depreciation and amortisation) and <b>net</b> profit. Conclusion: SOE <b>remuneration</b> committees and policymakers should maintain the positive relationship; however, more emphasis should be placed on financial efficiency measurements so as to enhance efficiencies in SOEs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to model a liberal profession, in this case {{physician}}s. We propose a model in which the physician acts in the same way as an agent who maximises his utility function subject to his budget constraint, while at the same time being able to affect his rate of remuneration. This model presupposes that physicians attempt to reach two target, namely income and leisure, and that the trade-o€ between these two target depends on their monopolistic power. Unlike existing models, our proposed model advances that some physicians may have a disutility for leisure and may adopt altruistic or strategic behaviours. To determine the relevance of our model, we estimate salaried, firm and agent versions of the model based on a sample of 317 physicians practicing in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region (PACA). We observe that physicians do not act like a purely profit-maximising firm. Furthermore, they are able to affect their <b>net</b> <b>remuneration</b> rate through their labour supply. The model that we propose therefore is of particular importance. We estimate that around 20 % of physicians experience disutility from leisure, which can be explained by their adoption of altruistic and strategic behaviours.

30|$|Budgetary {{constraints}} and their projections are usually an argument in debates on {{the retirement age}} {{and the need to}} raise it. However, judging from individual perspective, the public hardly ever agrees with that need. The data do not permit us to draw strong and robust qualitative conclusions. However, we perceive our paper as a minor contribution to the complexity of arguments for a higher retirement age, which we understand as the age of the availability of the old-age benefits. The benefits seem to contribute to premature withdrawal from the labour market. At the macro level, this entails an increased fiscal burden and a welfare loss. Analysed from the labour market perspective, these benefits paid to the very old individuals are a natural part of a social safety net, but these benefits paid to the not-yet-old are not necessarily so needed. Premature withdrawals mean stronger down pressure exerted on the <b>net</b> <b>remuneration</b> for work. The working generation has to bear this higher cost arising from the old-age benefits’ premature eligibility. Higher remuneration for work could be possible, if the benefits were not paid out to the not-yet-old. The argument of potentially higher remuneration for the working generation when old-age benefits are not paid to not-yet-old individuals goes beyond purely fiscal statements and may help encourage people to stay in employment rather than retire.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In Australia, {{training}} for general practice (GP) occurs within private practices and {{their involvement in}} teaching can have significant financial costs. At {{the same time there}} are growing demands for clinical places for all disciplines and for GP there is concern that there are insufficient teaching practices to meet the demand at the medical student, prevocational and vocational training levels. One option to address this may be to change how teaching occurs in the practice. A question that arises in posing such an option is whether different models of teaching change the costs for a teaching practice. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the net financial outcome of teaching models in private GP. Methods Modelling the financial implications for a range of teaching options using a costing framework developed from a survey of teaching practices in South Australia. Each option was compared with the traditional model of teaching where one GP supervisor is singularly responsible for one learner. The main outcome measure was net financial outcome per week. Decisions on the model cost parameters were made by the study's Steering Group which comprised of experienced GP supervisors. Four teaching models are presented. Model 1 investigates the gains from teaching multiple same level learners, Models 2 and 3, the benefits of vertically integrated teaching using different permutations, and Model 4 the concept of a GP teacher who undertakes all the teaching. Results There was a significant increase in net benefits of Aus$ 547 per week (95 % confidence intervals $ 459, $ 668) to the practice when a GP taught two same level learners (Model 1) and when a senior registrar participated in teaching a prevocational doctor (Model 3, Aus$ 263, 95 % confidence intervals $ 80, $ 570). For Model 2, a practice could significantly reduce the loss if a registrar was involved in vertically integrated teaching which included the training of a medical student (Aus$ 551, 95 % confidence intervals $ 419, $ 718). The GP teacher model resulted in a <b>net</b> <b>remuneration</b> of Aus$ 207, 335 per year, sourced predominantly from the GP teacher activities, with no loss to the practice. Conclusions Our study costed teaching options that can maximise the financial outcomes from teaching. The inclusion of GP registrars in the teaching model or the supervisor teaching more than one same level learner results in a greater financial benefit. This gain was achieved through a reduction in supervisor teaching time and the sharing of administrative and teaching activities with GP registrars. We also show that a GP teacher who carries a minimal patient load can be a sustainable option for a practice. Further, the costing framework used for the teaching models presented in this study has the ability to be applied to any number of teaching model permutations. </p...|$|E

Gabay, C. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2002 - 01 Journal of Immunology 1682875 - 82 <![CDATA[Leptin is produced almost exclusively by adipocytes and regulates body weight at the hypothalamic level. In addition, recent studies showed that leptin plays an important role in T lymphocyte responses. To examine the role of leptin in Ag-induced arthritis, the development of joint inflammation was assessed in immunized leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob), +/?, and wild-type mice (+/+) following the administration of methylated BSA into the knees. The results showed that ob/ob mice developed less severe arthritis compared with control mice. The levels of IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha mRNA in the synovium of arthritic knees were lower in ob/ob than in +/? mice. In vitro Ag-specific T cell proliferative responses were significantly decreased in ob/ob mice with lower IFN-gamma and higher IL- 10 production, suggesting a shift toward a Th 2 -type response in ob/ob mice. The serum levels of anti-methylated BSA Abs of any isotype were significantly decreased in arthritic ob/ob mice compared with controls. Essentially identical results were obtained in db/db mice, which lack the expression of the long isoform of leptin receptor. By RT-PCR, we observed that B lymphocytes express leptin receptor mRNA, indicating that in addition to its effect on the cellular response, leptin may exert a direct effect on B cell function. In conclusion, leptin contributes to the mechanisms of joint inflammation in Ag-induced arthritis by regulating both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses...|$|E
