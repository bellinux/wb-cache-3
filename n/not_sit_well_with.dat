5|$|Beatty's {{reputation}} for directorial profligacy—notably with the critically acclaimed Reds (1981), did <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Disney. As a result, Beatty and Disney reached a contracted agreement whereby any budget overruns on Dick Tracy would be deducted from Beatty's fee as producer, director, and star. Beatty and regular collaborator Bo Goldman significantly rewrote the dialogue but lost a Writers Guild arbitration {{and did not}} receive screen credit.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{deuterium}} being {{a valuable}} commodity, Archer is {{startled by the}} lack of basic medical supplies and the run-down nature of the colony. The reason becomes apparent when seven Klingons show up to collect deuterium according to their 'regular arrangement'. When Tessic informs Korok (Robertson Dean), the leader of the Klingons, {{that they do not have}} all the deuterium because two pumps were not working, Korok hits him and gives them four days to meet the order. Later, when Tucker and Archer attempt to talk them into fighting against the Klingons, Tessic tell them to take their 200 liters and leave. However, leaving does <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Archer and he convinces the leader to resist with their support.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Daltrey, and a recording session of R covers went unreleased. The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the West End of London. The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's amphetamines down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked, but was reinstated {{on the condition that}} the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted Richard Cole as a roadie.|$|E

5000|$|Cooperation, {{community}} socialization, {{and community}} work were also emphasized. However, going [...] "back-to-the-land" [...] did <b>not</b> always <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> people stuck in outlying [...] "stranded communities" [...] without jobs.

5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and it was unlikely that Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent back down to the Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Bruins fans as Thompson was a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E
5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts {{to cash in on}} the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E
5|$|In September 1966 general {{elections}} were held, and Sangkum legislators with conservative and right-wing sympathies dominated the national assembly. In turn, they nominated Lon Nol, a military general who shared their political sympathies, as prime minister. However, their choice did <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Sihanouk. To counterbalance conservative and right-wing influence, in October 1966 Sihanouk {{set up a}} shadow government made up of Sangkum legislators with left-wing sympathies. At {{the end of the}} month, Lon Nol offered to resign from his position, but was ironically stopped from doing so by Sihanouk. In April 1967 the Samlaut Uprising occurred, with local peasants fighting against government troops in Samlaut, Battambang. As soon as government troops managed to quell the fighting, Sihanouk began to suspect that three left-wing Sangkum legislatorsKhieu Samphan, Hou Yuon and Hu Nimhad incited the rebellion. When Sihanouk threatened to charge Khieu Samphan and Hou Yuon before a military tribunal, they fled into the jungle to join the Khmer Rouge, leaving Hu Nim behind.|$|E

50|$|Hyde {{was then}} paired with new driver Tim Richmond, a young open-wheel racer from Ashland, Ohio, as Hendrick {{went to a}} two-car operation. The brashness of the new driver from outside the {{southern}} stock car circuit did <b>not</b> initially <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the notably irascible Hyde. However, after a few races they developed a relationship and began to win races. This season {{was the source of}} much of the story line for the motion picture Days of Thunder.

Hardly on board he gets shocked, because sisters Hanna, Agnes and Felicitas from cloister Kaltenthal are on the same ship. They received the crusade as a gift, and have in mind to collect donations for a Kaltenthal family in need underway. The nuns meet Felix, son of the ship's owner Max Brockmann. The boy lost his mother by an auto accident and become friends with the crew member Ursula Henning. This <b>not</b> <b>sits</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the boy's father, and he fires Ursula. When Ursula gets of board at Teneriffa, Felix tries to run after her, but Hanna keeps him off and tries to find a solution for this trying situation. Meanwhile, Wöller got to know Isabella Kegel, who is born in Kaltenthal and he wants to marry her on board promptly, but Isabella ditches him right before the wedding altar. Wöller has dumped on Isabella years before when {{he was looking for a}} wife, because of her overweight. In fact that she reduced nearly 30 kilgrams Wöller don't recognize her on board of the cruise ship.|$|R
5|$|Two {{days before}} the program's approval, Nathaniel Davis, the Assistant Secretary of State, told Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State, that he {{believed}} maintaining the secrecy of IA Feature would be impossible. Davis correctly predicted the Soviet Union would respond by increasing involvement in the Angolan conflict, leading to more violence and negative publicity for the United States. When Ford approved the program, Davis resigned. John Stockwell, the CIA's station chief in Angola, echoed Davis' criticism saying that success required {{the expansion of the}} program, but its size already exceeded what could be hidden from the public eye. Davis' deputy, former U.S. ambassador to Chile Edward Mulcahy, also opposed direct involvement. Mulcahy presented three options for U.S. policy towards Angola on 13 May 1975. Mulcahy believed the Ford administration could use diplomacy to campaign against foreign aid to the communist MPLA, refuse to take sides in factional fighting, or increase support for the FNLA and UNITA. He warned however that supporting UNITA would <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> Mobutu Sese Seko, the president of Zaire.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, Mashbir held a {{position}} teaching military science and tactics at Syracuse University, where he first considered studying the Japanese language and culture. In August 1919, {{he asked the}} War Department if he could embark on this course of study, stating {{that it was his}} intention to apply for a posting to Japan for the purpose of learning the language if the War Department saw fit. Ranked captain, Mashbir was assigned as one of four US Army Language Officers in Japan on 7 July 1920. He relocated to Tokyo the following month to begin his four-year tour. When he arrived he reported for duty to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Burnett, the military attaché. Having few Army colleagues, while in Tokyo Mashbir sought the company of other intelligence professionals in the navy, one of whom was an assistant naval attaché, Lieutenant-Commander Ellis M. Zacharias, with whom Mashbir began a lifelong friendship and collaboration. In July 1922, at Zacharias' request, Mashbir secretly worked day and night to produce a secret plan to gather intelligence and get information out of Japan in case of war; it become known as M-Plan, named after Mashbir. His undisclosed activities working for the naval attaché did <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> his superiors, however.|$|E

5000|$|Duberly’s adventures did <b>not</b> always <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> society. She was pointedly snubbed at the Royal {{review of}} her husband’s {{regiment}} {{after the war}}. The journal she published after the war had originally been intended to have a dedication to Queen Victoria, but this was refused, much to her dismay. Nonetheless she was popular with the troops (who nicknamed her [...] "Mrs. Jubilee") and many people in England. Her published journal met with some success and prints of a photo of her taken by Roger Fenton sold quite well.|$|R
5000|$|Cantor {{had adopted}} {{the first name}} [...] "Eddie" [...] when he met his future wife Ida Tobias in 1913, because she felt that [...] "Izzy" [...] was not the right name for an actor. Cantor and Ida were married in 1914. They had five daughters, Marjorie, Natalie, Edna, Marilyn, and Janet, who {{provided}} comic fodder for Cantor's longtime running gag, especially on radio, about his five unmarriageable daughters. Several radio historians, including Gerald Nachman (Raised on Radio), have said that this gag did <b>not</b> always <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> the girls. Natalie's second husband was the actor Robert Clary and Janet married the actor Roberto Gari.|$|R
50|$|The {{marriage}} contract {{was signed in}} September. The wedding was celebrated at Torgau, the palace of the Queen of Poland, on 14 October 1711.

50|$|WRAL and WTVD {{switched}} affiliations in 1985 after WTVD's owner, Capital Cities Communications, bought ABC, but WPTF {{saw little}} windfall from the switch. At {{one point in}} the 1980s, even with NBC's powerful primetime lineup, WPTF-TV was dead last in the Triangle television ratings. It even trailed WLFL, an independent station (and later, a Fox affiliate) that had only been on the air since 1981. The station also continued to preempt NBC programming, albeit at a reduced rate compared to the amount of network shows it declined in the 1970s. This did <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> very <b>well</b> <b>with</b> NBC, which has historically been far less tolerant of preemptions than the other networks.|$|R

This is not even a matter of finding a balance - we know that both are necessary and true (McArdle & McWilliam, 2005). Early childhood professionals are better at living with contradictions than we know.

(She attended classes taught by Vladimir Nabokov.) When she graduated from Cornell in 1961, she began taking State Department tests in order to apply for positions in the U.S. government. Being politically inclined and opinionated, Schoonmaker expressed distaste for the South African policy of apartheid, a stance which did <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> those administering the State Department tests. In reaction to this experience, Schoonmaker switched gears and began taking a course in primitive art.|$|E
25|$|The {{live action}} {{television}} series {{was so popular}} that its campy humor and its Batmobile (a superficially modified concept car, the decade-old Lincoln Futura, owned by George Barris whose shop did the work) were quickly introduced into the Batman comic books. But the high camp and general silliness of the television show did <b>not</b> <b>sit</b> <b>well</b> <b>with</b> long-time Batman comic book fans. So, when the series was canceled in 1968, the comic books reacted by becoming darker and more serious, including having Batman abandon that Batmobile. Its replacement {{for a number of}} years was a much simpler model with a stylized bat's head silhouette decal on the hood being the only decoration of note. The 1960s TV style Batmobile still appears from time to time in the comic books, most recently in Detective Comics #850 and the issues of Batman Confidential.|$|E
