Users of <b>national</b> <b>shipping</b> centres include traders, logistics service providers, <b>shipping</b> <b>lines,</b> terminal operators, and other actors. Shipping is the business of transporting goods to facilitate trade. Shipping and trade are closely associated. Shipping centres are located in transport complex economies that are desirable for their users to perform various shipping related business activities. To explore the formation of <b>national</b> <b>shipping</b> centres, this study identifies trade facilitation measures at both the macro and micro levels that enhance economic performance. To build the model of <b>national</b> <b>shipping</b> centre, hypotheses {{have been developed to}} illustrate the relationship between trade facilitation activities and trade costs. Furthermore, the economic outcomes are also examined in this theoretical model. To validate the proposed research model, data are collected from the World Bank, and analytical tool is used for data analysis. The results suggest that trade facilitation measures are negatively associated with trade costs. The results also suggest that the trade facilitation measures of a country are positively associated with its economic performance. The findings of this study are useful for both business managers and policy makers. Based on the finding, managers can formulate effective business strategies to select a location for their firms to conduct their business activities. On the other hand, policy makers can formulate relevant measures to attract business firms to locate at their countries. In studying the formation of <b>national</b> <b>shipping</b> centres, the importance of developing social capital for trade facilitation is also emphasized. To illustrate the validity of the findings, two case studies are presented. The first case study examines countries with more than one port. These countries are China, Japan, and Korea. The second case study look into areas with single port (i. e., Hong Kong and Singapore). Overall, this study builds a theoretical model and validates the model to seek answers to the following questions: • What are the roles of trade facilitation at the macro-level and micro-level in the development of <b>national</b> <b>shipping</b> centres? • Does trade facilitation influence the economic development of a country? • What is the link between the development of social capita (in terms of trade facilitation measures) and the economic performance of a country? • What are the differences <b>national</b> <b>shipping</b> centres between developed and developing countries...|$|R

40|$|The present era of {{globalization}} and regional competition has witnessed the increasing influence of the global operations of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> on port development and the declining monopoly of ports. This warrants {{the need for an}} identification of the port selection criteria {{from the perspective of the}} <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> Hence, an attempt is made to determine the port choice from the perspective of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> Moreover, most port operators have designed their strategies based on the 'stated preference' of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines.</b> However, the stated preference approach can have several shortcomings such as the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> would tend to overstate their demands for services at the port. This directs for an examination of the port choice of the <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> based on a revealed preference approach. The 'revealed preference' approach aims at judging the port choice of <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> purely from their 'actions' rather than what they actually 'state'. The empirical study in this article is based on a survey conducted among major <b>shipping</b> <b>lines</b> operating in Singapore and Malaysia. The findings have shown port charges and wide range of port services to be the only significant factors in their port choice.
