5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in <b>neuroblast</b> migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E
25|$|Neuronal {{migration}} disorder (NMD) {{refers to}} a heterogenous group of disorders that, it is supposed, share the same etiopathological mechanism: a variable degree of disruption in the migration of neuroblasts during neurogenesis. The neuronal migration disorders are cerebral dysgenesis, brain malformations caused by primary alterations during neurogenesis; on the other hand, brain malformations are highly diverse and refer to any insult to the brain during its formation and maturation due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes that ultimately will alter the normal brain anatomy. However, there is some controversy in the terminology because virtually any malformation will involve <b>neuroblast</b> migration, either primarily or secondarily.|$|E
25|$|Polysialic acid (PSA) is a {{relatively}} new biocompatible and bioresorbable material for artificial nerve conduits. It is a homopolymer of α2,8-linked sialic acid residues and a dynamically regulated posttranslational modification of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Recent studies have demonstrated that polysialylated NCAM (polySia-NCAM) promotes regeneration in the motor system. PSA shows stability under cell culture conditions and allows for induced degradation by enzymes. It has also been discovered recently that PSA is involved in steering processes like neuritogenesis, axonal path finding, and <b>neuroblast</b> migration. Animals with PSA genetically knocked out express a lethal phenotype, which has unsuccessful path finding; nerves connecting the two brain hemispheres were aberrant or missing. Thus PSA is vital for proper nervous system development.|$|E

The <b>neuroblasts</b> {{that give rise to}} the brain segregate from the procephalic neurectoderm and form three neuromeres, called protocerebrum, deuterocerebrum, and tritocerebrum. The expression of the proneural genes of theachaete-scutecomplex (AS-C) is required for neurectodermal cells to acquire the competency to form <b>neuroblasts.</b> We show here that the expression of the proneural genelethal of scute(l'sc) is required {{for the development of the}} majority of the procephalic <b>neuroblasts.</b> l'scexpression in the procephalic neurectoderm is controlled by the head gap genestailless(tll),orthodenticle(otd),buttonhead(btd), andempty spiracles(ems), which are expressed in partially overlapping domains of the head neurectoderm.

25|$|Learning about PCD {{in various}} species is {{essential}} in understanding the evolutionary basis and reason for apoptosis in development of the nervous system. During {{the development of the}} invertebrate nervous system, PCD plays different roles in different species. The similarity of the asymmetric cell death mechanism in the nematode and the leech indicates that PCD may have an evolutionary significance {{in the development of the}} nervous system. In the nematode, PCD occurs in the first hour of development leading to the elimination of 12% of non-gonadal cells including neuronal lineages. Cell death in arthropods occurs first in the nervous system when ectoderm cells differentiate and one daughter cell becomes a <b>neuroblast</b> and the other undergoes apoptosis. Furthermore, sex targeted cell death leads to different neuronal innervation of specific organs in males and females. In Drosophila, PCD {{is essential in}} segmentation and specification during development.|$|E
2500|$|Induction {{of neural}} tissues causes {{formation}} of neural precursor cells, called neuroblasts. [...] In drosophila, neuroblasts divide asymmetrically, {{so that one}} product is a [...] "ganglion mother cell" [...] (GMC), {{and the other is}} a <b>neuroblast.</b> [...] A GMC divides once, to give rise to either a pair of neurons or a pair of glial cells. [...] In all, a <b>neuroblast</b> is capable of generating an indefinite number of neurons or glia.|$|E
2500|$|Lateral {{inhibition}} is a cell-cell interaction {{that occurs}} within a proneural cluster to determine {{and limit the}} cells {{that give rise to}} <b>neuroblast.</b> During this interaction, nascent neuroblasts express pronuclear genes above a determined threshold and, at the same time, they express a membrane bound ligand, called ‘’Delta’’, which binds and activate Notch receptors expressed in neighboring cells. Once Notch is activated, the activity of proneural genes decreases in these cells, probably due to the activation of genes in the ‘’enhancer of split E(spl)’’ complex, encoding in inhibitory bHLH [...] transcription factors. When inhibited, proneural genes prevent cells from becoming neural, but also reduce their levels of ‘’Delta’’. These particular interactions restrict the proneural activity to a single cell in each proneural cluster giving rise to a salt-and-pepper pattern.|$|E

40|$|The {{conversion}} of astrocytes to <b>neuroblasts</b> holds great promise {{for treatment of}} neurodegenerative and traumatic brain diseases. Here we have shown that adult human astrocytes could be reprogrammed to <b>neuroblasts</b> by miR- 302 / 367, both in vivo and in vitro.

We did not observed tumor formation during two months follow up.

25|$|NMDs {{occur in}} the {{instance}} that 1) <b>neuroblasts</b> do not migrate {{from all of the}} ventricles or migrate only part of the way, 2) only some of the <b>neuroblasts</b> reach the cortical layer, 3) <b>neuroblasts</b> overshoot the appropriate cortical layer and protrude into the subarachnoid space, or 4) the late stage organization of the neuronal layer in the cortex is disrupted. Abnormal migration ultimately results in abnormal gyral formation.|$|R
2500|$|In invertebrates, the proneural genes, {{particularly}} {{the members of}} the achaete-scute complex(AS-C) promote neurogenesis, while the neurogenic genes prevent neurogenesis and facilitate epidermal development. The formation of neuroblasts depends on the Achaete-scute complex genes – achaete (ac), scute (sc), lethal of scute (lsc) and ventral nervous system defective (‘’vnd’’). However, only ‘’vnd’’ can control this formation process because this gene activates the expression of the others. ac, sc, lsc factors are initially expressed within the primordium of the embryonic central nervous system (neuroectoderm) in proneural clusters, from which single neuroblasts later arise. Every cell of the proneural cluster shares a common neuroblasts-forming potential. The local inhibition of the remaining cells by the enlarging neuroblasts ensures that only one <b>neuroblast</b> arises from the proneural cluster. All cells of the cluster retain their NB forming potential, at least while the NB is enlarging, but lose this potential by the time the cell is about to divide. The patterns of expression of the proneural genes lead to different modes of neuroblasts formation in the head and trunk. [...] Co-expression of proneural genes in brain neuroblasts is transient and varies with the developmental stage.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIn both {{vertebrates}} and insects, neurons typically {{arise from}} neural stem cells or terminally dividing intermediate progenitors. Here, we describe another mode of neurogenesis where neural stem cells generate secondary precursors that undergo multiple rounds of self-renewing transit-amplifying divisions. We identify the Posterior Asense-Negative (PAN) <b>neuroblasts,</b> {{which do not}} express the transcription factors Asense or Prospero. PAN <b>neuroblasts</b> rely on the segregating determinants Numb and Brat to generate smaller, secondary <b>neuroblasts</b> that in turn give rise to ganglion mother cells (GMCs) and neurons throughout larval development. In brat or numb mutants, misspecified secondary <b>neuroblasts</b> are unable to produce differentiated progeny and initiate tumor-like overgrowth. In prospero mutants, however, tumors arise from GMCs while secondary <b>neuroblasts</b> are correctly specified. Our data describe a transit-amplifying lineage in the Drosophila nervous system and suggest that different vulnerabilities in intermediate cell types can affect the outcome of tumor suppressor loss in stem cell lineages...|$|R
50|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, {{asymmetric}} {{cell division}} {{plays an important}} role in neural development. Neuroblasts are the progenitor cells which divide asymmetrically to give rise to another <b>neuroblast</b> and a ganglion mother cell (GMC). The <b>neuroblast</b> repeatedly undergoes this asymmetric cell division while the GMC continues on to produce a pair of neurons. Two proteins play an important role in setting up this asymmetry in the <b>neuroblast,</b> Prospero and Numb. These proteins are both synthesized in the <b>neuroblast</b> and segregate into only the GMC during divisions. Numb is a suppressor of Notch, therefore the asymmetric segregation of Numb to the basal cortex biases the response of the daughter cells to Notch signaling, resulting in two distinct cell fates. Prospero is required for gene regulation in GMCs. It is equally distributed throughout the <b>neuroblast</b> cytoplasm, but becomes localized at the basal cortex when the <b>neuroblast</b> starts to undergo mitosis. Once the GMC buds off from the basal cortex, Prospero becomes translocated into the GMC nucleus to act as a transcription factor.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDrosophila <b>neuroblasts</b> undergo {{asymmetric}} divisions {{along the}} apicobasal axis to produce two daughter cells of unequal size and different developmental fate. Inscuteable (Insc) protein functions {{as part of}} an apically localized complex to coordinate orientation of the mitotic spindle and basal sorting of cell fate determinants (reviewed in [1] and [2]). insc mRNA transcripts also localize apically in <b>neuroblasts</b> [3, 4], yet the mechanism underpinning this process and its developmental significance are unknown. Here, we show that the Egalitarian (Egl) /Bicaudal-D (BicD) /dynein mRNA transport machinery [5] mediates apical localization of insc mRNA transcripts in <b>neuroblasts,</b> and we provide evidence that insc localization is required for efficient apical targeting of Insc protein. egl and BicD mutant <b>neuroblasts</b> display defects in apicobasal polarity, which is consistent with apical Insc activity being reduced. Also, we observe shortened mitotic spindles at metaphase in egl, BicD, and insc mutant <b>neuroblasts</b> and demonstrate a previously unknown, dose-dependent requirement for Insc in augmenting metaphase spindle length. We conclude that localization of insc mRNA transcripts in <b>neuroblasts</b> confers maximal levels of apical Insc activity, which is required for accurate control of metaphase spindle length, division orientation, and asymmetric cell division...|$|R
50|$|Development of the {{vertebrate}} {{nervous system}} begins when the neural tube {{forms in the}} early embryo.

50|$|Each <b>neuroblast</b> goes on {{to create}} a {{specific}} sequence of cells with particular identities.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in brain development is how precursor cells generate {{a diverse group}} of neural progeny in an ordered manner. Drosophila <b>neuroblasts</b> sequentially express the transcription factors Hunchback (Hb), Krüppel (Kr), Pdm 1 /Pdm 2 (Pdm) and Castor (Cas). Hb is necessary and sufficient to specify early-born temporal identity and, thus, Hb downregulation is essential for specification of later-born progeny. Here, we show that distal antenna (dan) and distal antenna-related (danr), encoding pipsqueak motif DNA-binding domain protein family members, are detected in all <b>neuroblasts</b> during the Hb-to-Cas expression window. Dan and Danr are required for timely downregulation of Hb in <b>neuroblasts</b> and for limiting the number of early-born neurons. Dan and Danr function independently of Seven-up (Svp), an orphan nuclear receptor known to repress Hb expression in <b>neuroblasts,</b> because Dan, Danr and Svp do not regulate each other and dan danr svp triple mutants have increased early-born neurons compared with either dan danr or svp mutants. Interestingly, misexpression of Hb can induce Dan and Svp expression in <b>neuroblasts,</b> suggesting that Hb might activate a negative feedback loop to limit its own expression. We conclude that Dan/Danr and Svp act in parallel pathways to limit Hb expression and allow <b>neuroblasts</b> to transition from making early-born neurons to late-born neurons at the proper time...|$|R
