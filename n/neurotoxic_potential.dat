40|$|The <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of {{amphetamine}} {{and related}} drugs is well documented. However, methylphenidate, an amphetamine derivative {{used in the}} treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and known to increase synaptic dopamine (DA) levels, seems to lack <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>potential.</b> It is hypothesized that both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are involved in the neurotoxicity of amphetamine derivatives. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>potential</b> of methylphenidate and to test whether stimulation of the serotonergic system may confer neurotoxic properties to methylphenidate for DA or serotonin (5 -HT) neurons. In addition, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the necessity to perform future SPECT studies in individuals using both methylphenidate and 5 -HT-acting agents. We therefore measured monoaminergic transporters in rat brain using radioligands suitable for SPECT imaging ([123 I]beta-CIT and [123 I]FP-CIT). Groups of rats were treated with methylphenidate or saline for 4 days. Additional groups were treated with the selective 5 -HT(2) receptor agonist quipazine or the selective 5 -HT reuptake blocker fluoxetine, alone or in combination with methylphenidate. Binding studies were performed 5 days after the last treatment. In a second experiment, methylphenidate in combination with quipazine, along with a control group, was retested. In this experiment, monoaminergic terminal density was estimated 2 weeks (rather than 5 days) after drug treatment. Five days, but not 2 weeks, after treatment a significant reduction in specific [123 I]FP-CIT binding was observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats treated with methylphenidate in combination with quipazine. These changes probably do not reflect neurotoxic changes of frontal cortex and hippocampal DA terminal markers, but a compensatory downregulation of DA transporters. These findings suggest potential harmful effects of concomitant use of drugs directly activating 5 -HT 2 receptors in patients using methylphenidat...|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicology}} of 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), {{often referred}} to as ecstasy, was first evaluated by the U. S. military in the 1950 s. In the late 1970 s into the early 1980 s, this drug was used in psychotherapy sessions to increase self-esteem and facilitate conversation. In 1985, the DEA classified MDMA as a Schedule 1 drug due to <b>potential</b> <b>neurotoxic</b> effects and addictive properties. MDMA use continued, albeit illegally, and became strongly associated with the rave scene of the 1990 s. This drug is now used by a wider demographic and is rising in popularity among young adults (Green, Mechan, Elliott, O’Shea, & Colado, 2003). The appeal of this drug stems from the rapid release of serotonin (5 -HT) and resulting euphoria experienced after administration. More specifically, MDMA binds to the 5 -HT transporter (SERT) with high affinity and blocks reuptake of 5 -HT. It also enters neurons via this transporter. Once inside the neuron the drug stimulates 5 -HT release from the synaptic vesicles into the cytoplasm. The SERTs then reverse direction, releasing 5 -HT from the cytoplasm into the extracellular fluid. The acute and long-term deleterious effects of this process on serotonergic neurons are not well understood. The extensive history of the drug, its rising popularity, and inconsistent research findings on MDMA mediated neurotoxicity suggest a need to review the current literature pertaining to <b>potential</b> <b>neurotoxic</b> effects of MDMA...|$|R
