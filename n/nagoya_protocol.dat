40|$|AbstractOne of the {{objectives}} of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources. It addresses traditional knowledge of the indigenous or local communities associated with genetic resources with provisions on access, benefit-sharing (ABS) and compliance, as enshrined under Article 8 (j) and Article 15 of CBD. The 2010 <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol</b> is a supplementary agreement to CBD by providing a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of ABS, which is a cornerstone of CBD. To ensure its success, the <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol</b> requires effective implementation of ABS measures at the domestic level to provide for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, which is crucial for mega bio diverse countries like Malaysia, with the contracting party providing such genetic resources. This study embarked to examine the obligations set by the <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol</b> on the parties to CBD to implement ABS by taking legislative, administrative and policy (LAP) measures at the domestic level. The findings reveal the core obligations laid down by the <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol</b> for its contracting parties to take appropriate LAP measures to protect traditional knowledge and to sustainably manage and use their biodiversity...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol</b> on Access and Benefit-sharing is {{the latest}} {{protocol}} to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{evolution}} of global ABS governance under the CBD {{from the perspective of}} transparency, taking into account the 2010 <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol.</b> In line with the overall framework of this book, we discuss, first, the emergence and framing of transparency in this area of governance. We argue that transparency, which was not initially envisioned as a policy solution, has increasingly moved to center stage in the debate on ABS governance under the CBD,which especially builds on bilateral contracts between providers and users. This move results, not least, from a growing marketization of GR and increasing awareness (through, for example, NGO campaigns) of the lack of information about GR uses. Subsequently, we outline the main elements and instruments of the transparency infrastructure elaborated,and given legal force, in the <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol,</b> including the bilateral, contract-based approach to ABS governance therein. We then discuss the(in) effectiveness of governance by disclosure thus far, as well as prospects for improvement, especially through the <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol.</b> The overall CBD system has performed weakly since the 1990 s. Even after negotiation of the <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol,</b> there remains a lasting imbalance between relatively advanced standards and practices for transparency for access and more problematic and imperfect standards for transparency for benefit sharing, which disadvantages least-developed countries and results in calls for capacity-building efforts. The conclusions summarize the results of the analysis...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, the {{relationship}} between the Convention on Biological Diversity and multilateral trade obligations administered by the World Trade Organization has no doubt {{been one of the most}} well-known case studies within the ‘trade-and-environment’ debate. Commentators have especially focused on the potential conflict with the WTO agreements arising from restrictions on trade in genetically modified organisms as well as from the CBD provisions on access to genetic resources and sharing of benefits resulting from their utilization. Following the <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol,</b> both issues are now regulated under protocols to the CBD. As the purpose of these protocols is to operationalize the programmatic and frequently vague provisions of the CBD, it is foreseeable that, as already occurred with the Cartagena Protocol, the adoption and implementation of the <b>Nagoya</b> <b>Protocol</b> will generate a new wave of enhanced policy and scholarly discussions on its compatibility with the world trade system.
