40|$|Abstract Background Because {{cerebral}} cortex {{has a very}} large number of testosterone receptors, we examined the possible sex differences in color appearance of monochromatic lights across the visible spectrum. There is a history of men and women perceiving color differently. However, all of these studies deal with higher cognitive functions which may be culture-biased. We study basic visual functions, such as color appearance, without reference to any objects. We present here a detailed analysis of sex differences in primary chromatic sensations. Methods We tested large groups of young adults with normal vision, including spatial and temporal resolution, and stereopsis. Based on standard color-screening and anomaloscope data, we excluded all color-deficient observers. Stimuli were equi-luminant monochromatic lights across the spectrum. They were foveally-viewed flashes presented against a dark background. The elicited sensations were measured using magnitude estimation of hue and saturation. When the only permitted hue terms are red (R) yellow (Y), green (G), blue (B), alone or in combination, such hue descriptions are language-independent and the hue and saturation values can be used to derive a wide range of color-discrimination functions. Results There were relatively small but clear and significant, differences between males and females in the hue sensations elicited by almost the entire spectrum. Generally, males required a slightly longer wavelength to experience the same hue as did females. The spectral loci of the unique hues are not correlated with anomaloscope matches; these matches are directly determined by the spectral sensitivities of L- and M-cones (genes for these cones are on the X-chromosomes). Nor are there correlations between loci of pairs of unique hues (R, Y, G, B). Wavelength-discrimination functions derived from the scaling data show that males have a broader range of poorer discrimination in the middle of the spectrum. The precise values for all the data depend on whether <b>Newtonian</b> or Maxwellian <b>optics</b> were used, but the sex differences were the same for both optical systems. Conclusion As with our associated paper on spatio-temporal vision, there are marked sex differences in color vision. The color-appearances we measured are determined by inputs from thalamic neurons (LGN) to individual neurons in primary visual cortex. This convergence from LGN to cortex is guided by the cortex during embryogenesis. We hypothesize that testosterone plays a major role, somehow leading to different connectivities for males and females: color appearance requires a re-combination and re-weighting of neuronal inputs from the LGN to the cortex, which, as we show, depends on the sex of the participant. </p...|$|R

Given IIA's expertise in telescope-making, designing a sturdy, easy-to-handle and low-cost telescope {{was seen as an}} important goal of IIA's Astronomy for All programme, whose aim is to spread the excitement of viewing objects of the night sky as widely as possible. The design efforts of the Photonics division resulted in a prototype Newtonian reflecting telescope with a 100 mm-diameter Aluminium-coated mirror as the aperture, and a standard 10 x eye-piece. The telescope was designed to have a sturdy circular base, and an Alt-Azimuth mount, with dual-axis manual fine movement. The light-weight tube was designed to house the <b>Newtonian</b> <b>optics,</b> and have a simple gun-sight arrangement for ease of pointing. The telescope was mass-produced by Lensel Optics Pvt.

40|$|As {{advances}} in concentrated solar energy progress there will inevitably {{be an increase}} in the demand of resources for testing new conceptions. Currently, there are limited facilities available for taking concentrated solar energy concepts from the laboratory bench scale to the engineering test scale. A proposed solution is a scientific and developmental facility that provides highly concentrated solar energy at ground level. The design presented is a solar down beam test facility utilizing a <b>Newtonian</b> <b>optics</b> approach with a flat rectangular down beam mirror to reflect and concentrate the sun 2 ̆ 7 s rays at ground level. Literature review suggests a hyperbolic reflector implementation for down beam reflector systems. An alternative Newtonian design uses a planar mirror to direct converging light from the heliostat field to a convenient focus at ground level. A flat mirror has the advantage of relatively cheap construction, and the intrinsic capability to host multiple experiments. Additionally, in comparison to a convex down beam mirror, there is significantly less optical distortion of the solar energy collected on a solar receiver {{at the top of a}} tower. The Newtonian design inherently preserves the focus of the heliostat field, mimicking the behavior of tower top geometry. The planar mirror geometry simply reflects the rays to ground level, and thus has little effect on the achievable concentration ratio other than the additional reflective losses. The presented work focuses on the optical analysis and modeling of such a novel test facility. System examination was accomplished utilizing the commercially available ray tracing software Advanced Systems Analysis Program (ASAP®). ASAP® is able to simulate the interaction of the sun 2 ̆ 7 s rays with the designed optical system by utilizing Monte Carlo ray tracing techniques. This allowed for all optical losses to be simulated within the model; including cosine, blocking, shadowing, attenuation, and reflective losses. In order to achieve a high level of concentration with a planar down beam reflector, converging heliostats were utilized. Parallel rays were implemented to identify the focusing conditions of the heliostats. A realistic sun source was developed within ASAP ® to simulate the maximum 0. 5 ° angular divergence characteristics of the sun 2 ̆ 7 s rays. This allowed for practical concentration ratios to be simulated within the model. Algorithms were developed and implemented in MATLAB® to properly simulate the sun 2 ̆ 7 s position as well as the heliostat field layout and orientation for any given hour of the year. A Sun Position Orientation (SPO) algorithm was constructed to determine the relative location of the sun source for any given hour within the ASAP ® model. A Heliostat Reflection Orientation Position Vector (HROPV) algorithm was developed to properly orientate each heliostat to reflect to the proper aim point (AP) of the heliostat filed. Additionally, a North-South Cornfield Heliostat Field Layout (NSCHFL) algorithm was established to tightly pack heliostats within the utilizable range of the down beam reflector. Utilizing a tightly packed North-South (N-S) cornfield heliostat field layout the optical performance of the facility was demonstrated for a day in each of the four seasons, providing a general performance trend over the course of the year. Extensive ray tracing establishes the achievability of the targeted 1 MW, 1, 000 suns concentration at ground level for several hours of the day over the course of the year. Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate nearly 2 MW and 4, 000 suns concentration is achievable for optimal orientation hours in which the tower, sun, and center of the heliostat field are all co-linear. Future system analysis should examine modifications of optical geometry parameters such as heliostat dimensions, heliostat field layouts, and down beam reflector heights as well as orientations. Additionally, the effect of varying focal points needs to be investigated. The implications of heliostat pointing inaccuracies should also be accounted for...|$|E
