500|$|Roz Laws {{writing for}} the Sunday Mercury felt there was [...] "plenty of chemistry" [...] present between Gilly and Steph. Their {{relationship}} was frequently commented on by the Daily Mail Jaci Stephen in her weekly soap column. She expressed disinterest in Steph and Cheryl's rivalry over Gilly, and found it implausible that Jem and Steph would quarrel over him. When the two finally admitted their feelings for one another in May 2010, Stephen accurately predicted that their happiness would be short-lived. She bemoaned the lack of subtlety in the scripting of the lead-up to their wedding, observing: [...] "Of course, {{you know that the}} moment she says that <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop her marrying Gilly, the Grim Reaper will be pulling up in his hearse, shortly behind the wedding car." ...|$|E
500|$|Steph's {{relationships}} were {{a focal point}} of many reviews. The Daily Mirror Nicola Methven and Polly Hudson found a 2004 love triangle between Steph, her sister Debbie and love interest Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair) [...] "surprising compelling". Grace Dent of The Guardian observed of her failed engagement to Fernando: [...] "With the best will in the world, I don't feel that marriage {{was ever going to}} last". Dent had previously named Steph singing the Sugababes' [...] "About You Now" [...] at Max's funeral one of her four favourite soap moments of 2008.

5000|$|One reason Ballou {{claimed to}} get in to the studio side of music was to have [...] "maximum control over Converge's music" [...] he further stated, [...] "When we were {{starting}} out, {{no one wanted to}} help us anyway, so if we didn't take control, <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get done."

6000|$|There {{may have}} been two happier and more excited girls somewhere in Canada or the United States at that moment, but I doubt it. Every snip of the scissors, as rose and peony and {{bluebell}} fell, seemed to chirp, [...] "Mrs. Morgan is coming today."

5000|$|My {{favorite}} part was {{the energy of}} a crowd out to see some music. <b>Nothing</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop them from seeing music. They <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see all the music. That sheer determination converted me: I slipped into the crowd and immediately abandoned all pretense of maintaining an academic disinterest in the bands I'd only heard of peripherally. It swept away my staunch decision to maintain no bias when seeing a band I kind of love right now.|$|R
2500|$|Conversely, {{writing for}} the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick Lasalle bluntly noted that the motion picture starts out [...] "bad" [...] and later [...] "gets worse". He summed up his displeasure by stating, [...] ""Sunshine" [...] has nothing to offer, and this <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be offered relentlessly and earnestly, like a holy missive." [...] In a {{primarily}} negative review, Joanne Kaufman writing for The Wall Street Journal, called the film [...] "a warmed-over stew of sci-fi and gothic horror". Unenthusiastic, she affirmed, [...] "There are the predictable malfunctions that compromise the space craft, the banal speechifying {{about the fate of}} mankind, the issue of who will live and who will die. Who cares? The characters are so sketchily drawn that it's hard to keep them straight, let alone get worked up about their survival." [...] Also describing an unfavourable opinion, Marrit Ingman of The Austin Chronicle professed the film exhibited [...] "problems which arise in the film's third act" [...] which causes [...] "a profoundly implausible plot turn that sends the movie skidding into bogeyman horror. It cheapens the sentiment, and the film doesn't recover." ...|$|E

This rule was also applied to the variety of fish and insects the player is able to collect.|$|R
