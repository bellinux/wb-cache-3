6000|$|... "But {{how can the}} {{prevalent}} offence be house-breaking {{in a place like}} this?" [...] "Easily enough. When you've seen a little of the city you'll see. Natives sleep and lie about all over the place, and whole quarters are just so many rabbit-warrens. Wait till you see the Machua Bazar. Well, besides the petty theft and burglary, we have heavy cases of forgery and fraud, that leave us with our wits pitted against a Bengali's. When a Bengali criminal is working a fraud of the sort he loves, he is about the cleverest soul you could wish for. He gives us cases a year long to unravel. Then there are the murders in the low houses--very curious things they are. You'll see the house where Sheikh Babu was murdered presently, and you'll understand. The Burra Bazar and Jora Bagan sections are the two worst ones for heavy cases; but Colootollah is the most aggravating. There's Colootollah over yonder--that patch of darkness beyond the lights. That section is full of tuppenny-ha'penny petty cases, that keep the men up all night and make 'em swear. You'll see Colootollah, and then perhaps you'll understand. Bamun Bustee is the quietest of all, and Lal Bazar and Bow Bazar, as you can see for yourself, are the rowdiest. You've no notion what the natives come to the police station for. A man will come on and want a summons against his master for refusing him half-an-hour's leave. I suppose it does seem rather revolutionary to an up-country man, but they try to do it here. <b>Now</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> minute, before we go down into the city and see the Fire Brigade turned out. Business is slack with them just now, but you time 'em and see." [...] An order is given, and a bell strikes softly thrice. There is a rush of men, the click of a bolt, a red fire-engine, spitting and swearing with the sparks flying from the furnace, is dragged out of its shelter. A huge brake, which holds supplementary horses, men, and hatchets, follows, and a hose-cart is the third on the list. The men push the heavy things about as though they were pith toys. The men clamber up, some one says softly, [...] "All ready there," [...] and with an angry whistle the fire-engine, followed by the other two, flies out into Lal Bazar. Time--1 min. 40 secs. [...] "They'll find out it's a false alarm, and come back again in five minutes." [...] "Why?" [...] "Because there will be no constables on the road to give 'em the direction of the fire, and because the driver wasn't told the ward of the outbreak when he went out!" [...] "Do you mean to say that you can from this absurd pigeon-loft locate the wards in the night-time?" [...] "What would be the good of a look-out if the man couldn't tell where the fire was?" [...] "But it's all pitchy black, and the lights are so confusing." ...|$|E

60|$|The boat rowed away to {{the distant}} town, and Blackbeard waited two days for its return, and then he grew very angry, for he {{believed}} that his messengers had been taken into custody, and he came very near hanging Mr. Wragg and all his companions. But before he began to satisfy his vengeance, news came from the boat. It had been upset in the bay, and had had great trouble in getting to Charles Town, but it had arrived there at last. Blackbeard <b>now</b> <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> day or two longer; but as no news came from Mr. Marks, he vowed {{he would not be}} trifled with by the impudent people of Charles Town, and swore that every man, woman, and child among the prisoners should immediately prepare to be hanged.|$|R

5000|$|And {{immediately}} that he came, he Acacius showed his orders, {{just at the}} time when Marcian and his army were fighting against Nisibis, and expecting to assault it the next day, and win the city; and all were in astonishment, and their hands were weakened. And the illustrious Marcian, who had been assiduously making his preparations, and was upon the point of capturing Nisibis, on hearing the orders, said to Acacius, 'You see how great labour we have taken for the purpose of capturing this city; and <b>now,</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> little, and grant us a delay of two days only, and then do what you have been commanded; for the king has a right that what he orders should be done.' But he Acacius was angry with him Marcianus, and insulted him, and in hot wrath laid hands upon him in the presence of all his officers, and pulled him about, and threw him down, and cut his girdle, scoffing at him, and even, as was said, he struck him on the cheek. And the whole army was indignant, and their hands weakened, and execrating the wickedness which had been done before their eyes, they lowered their standard, and turned it upside down. And thereupon the whole army fled, and left the city far behind them, and loud was their grief and lamentation at what had happened to their commander; for {{he was a good man}} and a believer: and besides, at the very time when they were expecting to enter and take the city, they had shown their backs when there was no enemy who pursued them, and had become the laughter and scorn of their foes." ...|$|E
5000|$|We want to {{communicate}} to all {{that we are not}} calling for persons merely to be moral. We want them to be believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, because we don't just need instruction, we need salvation. Now, because of that, something has to explain why we would take this time on a Sunday night to talk about something like the federal judiciary. I want to make clear why there is such a sense of urgency that we would do this. It's because so much that is precious to us, so much that is essential to this civilization, this culture, this great democratic republic {{is in the hands of}} the courts. And we know that means that much is at risk. Because we have been watching. And we have been learning. For far too long, Christians have been concerned to elect the right people to office, and then go back home. We have learned the importance of the electoral process, and yet we're also discovering that that third branch of government, the judiciary, is so very, very important. We have been watching court cases come down the line. In 1973, Roe v. Wade declared a woman's right to an abortion. We now know in the aftermath of that decision, that Justice Harry Blackmun, who was the author of the majority opinion, even has admitted that they were determined to legalize abortion, and they just went to the Constitution to try to find an argument that would get them where they wanted to go. And they did. Now, that was a wake-up call for Americans to say, <b>now</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> minute, there's nothing in the Constitution about abortion. By no stretch of the imagination did the founders of this nation and the framers of that document intend for anyone to be able to read those words and find a right to kill unborn children.

[...] This passage has been historically interpreted to mean that the right of habeas corpus is inherently established. Gonzales dissents from the consensus view, siding with Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who said [...] "athough the Constitution prohibits Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus except during times of rebellion or invasion, this provision was probably meant to keep Congress from suspending the writ and preventing state courts from releasing individuals who were wrongfully imprisoned. The constitutional provision does not create a right to habeas corpus; rather federal statutes so." [...] Additionally, [...] "the Constitutional Convention prevented Congress from obstructing the states courts' ability to grant the writ, but did not try to create a federal constitutional right to habeas corpus". [...] "After all, if the suspension clause itself were an affirmative grant of procedural rights to those held in federal custody, there would have been little need for the first Congress to enact as it did, habeas corpus protections in the Judiciary Act of 1789.

Because you didn’t fly on Wednesday, {{does that mean that}} you’ll have to fly on Saturday afternoon? I’m glad that you got a little sleep anyway. You really surprised me when you answered all those questions. Well, hon, you tried to get a date for Woody so if you can’t, you just can’t. Well, Tom Kennedy’s getting engaged, maybe, sorta lets him out. I hardly think Woody would appreciate a married man. Well, if you can get somebody it will be nice but thanks for trying anyway. Are you kidding. I’d love to go to the Meadow Brook. You know how I love Harry James but you don’t like him do you? I have a vague idea how to get there but I could never actually get there by myself. Well, honey, maybe some Saturday night when we don’t have anything special to do we could go to a show or something with your mother 2 ̆ 6 sister. I know they’d like to see more of you because they both are crazy about you. It’s wonderful to have such a nice brother 2 ̆ 6 son, I’ll bet. I love the way you causually [sic] mention {{the fact that you are}} in love. Are you really sure about that “good friend” stuff? Please stop trying to talk yourself out of love. You might succeed 2 ̆ 6 then where would I be? <b>Now,</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> minute—I’m slightly confused. I asked you why you don’t want to get too serious. Then you said it’s too serious already as far as you were concerned 2 ̆ 6 that you didn’t think it’s fair to either of us with the war 2 ̆ 6 things as they are. And that you weren’t the type of guy who will let himself get in too deep. That needs more explaining. I don’t know if I understand what you mean. I agree with your instructor about your judgement [sic] not being so good—Just in regard to me, though. Just one more night and I’ll be seeing you again. What will the weeks seem like after you go to another field and don’t get home for months at a time? About the other fellows I like—I’ll have to try and explain the situation to you sometime. It’s really very simple when you understand it (of course I don’t but that’s beside the point.) I’d like to write more but it’s time for dinner and I want to go to bed right after dinner. Last week is really catching up with me now. I yawn all the time 2 ̆ 6 when we’re showing it’s an effort not to yawn in the buyers’ faces. Tommy Dorsey’s playing on the ballroom now 2 ̆ 6 Frankie’s singing. Ah— You said something about calling tonight if you didn’t have to fly 2 ̆ 6 every time the phone rings I tear madly downstairs to answer it. Honey, what’s going to happen about the game Saturday? From the way things look now you’ll probably have to fly Saturday afternoon. Daddy wants me to go fishing with him, so if you have to fly I’d spend a lovely day with some smelly old fish—Get a nice windburn and cold, too, probably but I love fishing. Well, darling, I’ll see you Saturday. I love you very much. Please write whenever you get time. Lots of love,Dottie P. S. You just called and it was so nice to hear your voice again.

40|$|Translation begins] Monday My Darling, What weather we’re {{getting the}} rain today that you’ve been having all week. It’s pouring and {{looks as though}} it were never going to stop. As usual I’m still half asleep- It’s about eleven now. Now where shall I start. Well, {{yesterday}} I was very busy getting my room straightened up in the early morn. Well, there was a reason for that. I knew that Hilda + Charlotte were giving me a shower here last night. Anyhow, in the morning Sis Walter, Ronnie and Murial came up. They are a riot. Mother and I just sat there and the tears rolled down our cheeks. We just laughed + laughed. That family is so crazy. You would have had a wonderful time. Sis got a rash on her hand (this is a real long story so I’ll condense it) and went to the doctors – He told her to take off her dress. Ronnie asked what she did then. Sis sad she took it off of course. What did he think she’s do. Ronnie (by the way he’s nice) (in case you forgot) replied he thought she’d slap his face. That kid is so funny. The whole family gets along so well. I’ve never heard Sis really angry in all the 20 years that I’ve known her. You must get to know them after we’re married. Oh, they gave us a $ 25 war bond for a wedding gift. Our first real one- (the can opener + coffee measurer don’t count). Good lord! What a mood you were in Wednesday. What a letter! You certainly sounded like the little sunshine boy. I hope not flying doesn’t always do that to you. I’ll write to you later. After reading that I’m not in any mood to write. Anything I say might come out wrong. Well, listening to the radio for a while helped but not much. Hilda doesn’t need a date. She’s married in the first place. She’s older. Has a little daughter. Not the same Hilda you were talking about. She has dark hair and was always over here. Her husband’s name is George. The one who always fixes things around here that no one else can. She was at the announcement party. Do you remember her now? Well, you see, about Charlotte it’s a very complicated story. First of all I stopped working + couldn’t afford the $ for her train fare. She wants to come down. Well, mother + Daddy are happier this way. <b>Now</b> <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> minute – Judson- I want to get something straightened out with you. There’s a lot of reasons why we can’t get down there by Wednesday. You of all people ought to realize how sick mother is. In the first place- she was absolutely forbidden by her doctor to travel at all. He was furious + said she’d undo all the progress (which wasn’t very much) that he’d made towards helping her. He was going to give her penicillin injections but was afraid they wouldn’t react favorably + she would be worse. He’s finally consented to her going. But the point is that she’s not supposed to be away from him long. That’s why we’re not leaving until Wednesday. I wasn’t going to tell you that at all. If {{it was up to me}} we’d be down there now but Christmas, I can’t be that selfish. Look, it’s not a question of a mind of my own. When I wrote you last mother was much better + could have taken the bus but she’s gotten much worse. I’m sure she couldn’t stand the trop. The jarring of the bus would be too much for her. The train ride would be long enough but that bus takes longer. I can’t just say I want to do this or that, Judd. There are other people to consider, too. I can’t understand your attitude hope it’s just the mood you were in because it isn’t like you to be so thoughtless. You should know that I’d be down there as soon as possible because I want to see you but since you’ve taken that attitude I had to tell you why. I really didn’t want to tell you about mother but you made me so mad. Your letter sure put me in a great mood. You have no idea how much they affect me. It’s awful to look forward to them so and then get one like that. Oh, let’s skip it. It’s too bad that it wasn’t clear so that you could get those fourteen hours in. Hope it’s clear this week. Since you predicted clear weather for Friday I suppose it snowed or something. That must have been great- shooting skeet in the rain. Hope you hurry and finish that so your arm gets better. (which arm is sore? right?) No, honey, you didn’t tell me you heard from your uncle- but mom did. Well, honey, I hope you’re feeling happier now. I love you so. You’ll have all my love. Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
