5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to <b>new</b> <b>guidelines</b> based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effect of training of <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> on Pressure ulcer (PU) prevention in the intensive care units (ICUs). PU is the third costly disorder with high mortality and morbidity. Thus reduction of PU incidence is very important and effective step for health systems. PU {{is one of the most}} common medical conditions, occurring in both hospital and community settings, in all age groups, but mostly among the elderly, the immobile, and patients with severe acute and chronic illnesses or neurological deficits. This semi-experimental study was conducted on high-risk patients with a Norton scale score of 16, while they had daily care for PU prevention. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups of intervention and control patients in each. The control group was assessed with routine care o PU prevention in the first three months of the study. Then the nurses were trained with the <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> and after that the data were collected again in the second three months period. The data were analyzed through the SPSS statistical software (version 13). results showed that <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> training program was associated with decreased risk of PU. Education of the <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> on PU is an effective way to decrease the rate of PU in (ICUs). Training the <b>new</b> care <b>guideline</b> of the PU prevention for the involved nurses probably can reduce the incidence rate of pressure ulcer...|$|R

40|$|When {{developing}} lectures it {{is important}} to consider didactic methods and simultaneously work efficiently. A guideline that supports the development of lectures is missing, and the need for such a guideline is even more evident when distributed teams are developing a lecture together. This work describes such a <b>new</b> <b>guideline.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> is developed by combining didactic methods and an existing guideline for product development, VDI 2221. The resulting guideline supports the development of the lecture from the idea to the final documents. The clear structure of the developed guideline ensures the processing of all important tasks, the scheduling of the different efforts and the documentation of the course. The usage of the <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> is validated by using it for the development of a course by a team of distributed lecturers.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} various {{guidelines for}} conducting LCA studies on passenger vehicles, and ultimately develops a <b>new</b> LCA <b>guideline.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> balances workload and capturing the major factors of the vehicle’s life cycle.

From the results, the vehicle’s material breakdown, basic driving emissions, use of climate control systems, and maintenance of parts, were found to have the highest environmental impact. The <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> was developed and applied to the same case studies, maintaining close agreement with the previous results. The results were also compared to LCA studies from other manufacturers. Impact categories that depend on the use phase showed little variation, but production dominated categories showed large discrepancies between manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the findings of}} focus group research into public attitudes to the sentencing of drug offences. The study was commissioned by the Sentencing Council for England and Wales to inform {{the development of their}} <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> on drug offences.

Thus the findings of the study indicate that lighter sentences for drug ‘mules’ (as were subsequently introduced by the Sentencing Council’s <b>new</b> <b>guideline)</b> would be tolerated by the public.

40|$|AbstractThe American College of Cardiology (ACC) /American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines {{recently}} {{issued the}} 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> endorses {{a paradigm shift}} in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly {{increase the number of}} patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the <b>new</b> evidence-based <b>guideline,</b> the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment...|$|R
