40|$|The 20 -nanogold cluster Au- 20 {{exhibits}} a large variety of two- and three-dimensional isomeric forms. Among {{them is the}} ground-state isomer Au- 20 (T-d) representing the stable cluster with a unique tetrahedral shape, with all atoms on the surface, and large HOMO-LUMO gap which even slightly exceeds that of the <b>buckyball</b> <b>fullerene</b> C- 60. The anionic cluster Au- 20 (-) (T-d) that holds its parent tetrahedral symmetry features a high catalytic activity. The list of {{the properties of the}} 20 -nanogold clusters surveyed in the present work ranges from the energetic order of stability of its isomers to the optical absorption and excitation spectra of the Au- 20 (T-d) cluster. We also report the structures and properties of its doubly charged clusters Au- 20 (2 +) and Au- 20 (2 -) and computationally confirm that Au- 20 is indeed stable. The zero-point-energy-corrected adiabatic second electron affinity of Au- 20 (T-d) amounts to 0. 43 - 0. 53 eV that is consistent with the experimental data. In addition, we provide computational evidence of the existence of the novel, hollow cage isomer of Au- 20 and analyze its key properties. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally {{compounds}} in crystal chemistry {{are described in}} terms of their composition and geometry (i. e. bond lengths and angles). While this geometrical description is powerful, it has an intrinsic weakness in {{that it is hard to}} describe structures in terms of features (e. g. pores) important to their application in the chemical industry (e. g. catalysis, adsorption). An alternative method of describing structures in terms of their underlying topology (i. e. atomic connectivity) tries to overcome this weakness. The work described in this thesis mainly focuses on expanding this topological description to a set of calculable descriptors that allow for facile comparison between structures. The first part of the thesis describes the development of topological descriptors, based on the face-size distribution, and its application to rationalise the energetics of the all-siliceous zeolites. It is shown that decomposing framework materials into a space-filling set of face-sharing polyhedral cages, and analysing the face-size distribution obtained, leads to powerful insights into the dependence of the thermodynamic viability of zeolite- and more general framework material synthesis upon changes in structural properties such as pore-size and framework density. The second part of the thesis focuses on silica nanoclusters and a description of their possible topologies. It is shown that silica and related oxides can in principle be synthesized in the form of fully coordinated nanoclusters with structures reminiscent of those of carbon <b>buckyballs</b> (<b>fullerenes).</b> Furthermore, it is demonstrated that such fully coordinated nanoclusters are interesting computational model systems (surface defects, infrared spectra) for dehydrated silica surfaces.

Experiments on functionalized SWCNTs were compared with functionalized, C 60 <b>fullerenes</b> (<b>buckyballs)</b> to probe the general applicability of the method and further characterize the bundling process.

50|$|One of the {{promising}} applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is {{their use in}} solar panels, due to their strong UV/Vis-NIR absorption characteristics. Research has shown that they can provide a sizable increase in efficiency, even at their current unoptimized state. Solar cells developed at the New Jersey Institute of Technology use a carbon nanotube complex, formed by a mixture of carbon nanotubes and carbon <b>buckyballs</b> (known as <b>fullerenes)</b> to form snake-like structures. Buckyballs trap electrons, but they can't make electrons flow. Add sunlight to excite the polymers, and the buckyballs will grab the electrons. Nanotubes, behaving like copper wires, will {{then be able to}} make the electrons or current flow.|$|R

40|$|In {{nanotechnology}} research, allotropes {{of carbon}} like Graphene, <b>Fullerene</b> (<b>Buckyball)</b> and Carbon nanotubes {{are widely used}} due to their remarkable properties. Electrical and mechanical properties of those allotropes vary with their molecular geometry. This paper is specially based on modeling and simulation of graphene in order to calculate energy band structure in k space with varying the C-C bond length and C-C transfer energy. Significant changes have been observed in the energy band structure of graphene due to variation in C-C bond length and C-C transfer energy. In particular, this paper focuses over the electronic structure of graphene within the frame work of tight binding approximation.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIn this MS thesis, {{cytotoxicity}} {{tests of}} various nanomaterials, which have commercial applications and involve a contact with human body, were performed at different conditions. The nanomaterials {{used for the}} experiments included pristine 100 ply carbon nanowire, graphene nanoflakes, multiwall carbon nanotubes, nanoclay and C 60 (<b>buckyball</b> or <b>fullerene).</b> The nanomaterials cytotoxicities were calculated and compared to each other using human and mice fibroblast cancerous cells (3 T 3 and L 929 resp.). The in vitro MTT Assay {{was used as the}} testing method because of its simplicity and reliability. The results were analyzed by means of a spectrophotometer at 590 nm wavelength. From the optical density studies, the viabilities were calculated and the toxicities of those nanomaterials were compared. Pristine 100 ply carbon nanowire was the most viable nanomaterial with the average viability value of 86. 9 %. The effect of dilution on carbon nanowire was negligible which may have be due to its single dimensional threaded structure. This structure also reduced its toxicity values. However, with increase in time duration this structure became slightly weaker, and the nanowires unwound and dispersed into the media, leading to a slight increase in cytotoxicity. The concentration of the carbon nanowire at which the MTT test was conducted was 3 cm 2 /ml (external surface area) which weighed 18. 52 mg/ml. The second most viable material after the carbon nanowire was fullerene with a viability of 75. 2 %. Its close packed 3 D structure, negative charge and hydrophobicity {{may have contributed to the}} low cytotoxic behaviour of this nanomaterial. It was also observed that with the decrease in concentration there was a steep increase in the viability of the cells. By decreasing the concentration from 10. 00 mg/ml to 2. 00 mg/ml, the viability of fullerene was increased from 75 % to 85 %. The viabilities of other nanomaterials were in the order of multiwall carbon nanotubes (69. 75 %), graphene (67. 48 %) and nanoclay (61. 34 %). By decreasing the concentration from 1. 10 mg/ml to 0. 58 mg/ml, the viability was increased from 70 % to 80 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the unique catalytic effects of gold nanoparticles on oxide substrates[1] has stimulated a flurry of research into the structures and properties of free gold nanoclusters, which may {{hold the key to}} elucidating the catalytic mechanisms of supported gold clusters. One of the most remarkable results has been the {{discovery of}} planar gold cluster anions (Aun-) of up to twelve gold atoms and the 2 D to 3 D transition for clusters with n larger than 12. [2]– [4] Among larger gold clusters, Au 20 {{has been found to be}} a perfect tetrahedron. [5] A more recent study of the structures of Aun- cluster anions in the medium size range (n= 15 – 19) [6] has shown that clusters with n= 16 – 18 possess unprecedented empty cage structures. In particular, the Au Au 16 - cluster anion has an interesting tetrahedral structure with an inner diameter of about 5. 5 Å and can be compared to the <b>fullerenes</b> (<b>buckyballs).</b> Although Au 32 was first suggested to be a “ 24 -carat golden fullerene,”[7], [8] subsequent studies showed that the Au 32 - ion is in fact a low-symmetry compact 3 D structure. [9] Other larger gold cage clusters have also been proposed computationally,[10], [11] but none has been observed or is expected to be the global minimum. The cage structures of the cluster anions Au 16 - and Au 17 - have recently been confirmed by electron diffraction[12] and thus they are the first experimentally confirmed and the smallest possible gold cages. The large empty space inside these cage clusters immediately suggested that they can be doped with a foreign atom to produce a new class of endohedral gold cages[6] analogous to endohedral fullerenes...|$|R
40|$|Images {{taken of}} {{interstellar}} space often display a colorful canvas of {{portions of the}} electromagnetic spectrum. Dispersed throughout the images are interstellar clouds of dust and gas [...] remnants ejected from stars and supernovae over {{billions and billions of}} years. For more than 40 years, astronomers have observed that interstellar dust exhibits a consistent effect at a spectral wavelength of 2, 175 angstroms, the equivalent of 5. 7 electronvolts in energy on the electromagnetic spectrum. At this wavelength, light from stars is absorbed by dust in the interstellar medium, blocking the stars light from reaching Earth. The 2, 175 -angstrom feature, which looks like a bump on spectra, is the strongest ultraviolet-visible light spectral signature of interstellar dust and is visible along nearly every observational line of sight. Scientists have sought to solve the mystery of what causes the 2, 175 -angstrom feature by reproducing the effect in the laboratory. They speculated a number of possibilities, including <b>fullerenes</b> (<b>buckyballs),</b> nanodiamonds, and even interstellar organisms. However, none of these materials fits the data for the unique spectral feature. Limitations in the energy and spatial resolution achievable with electron microscopes and ion microprobes [...] the two main instruments used to study samples of dust [...] have also prevented scientists from finding the answer. A collaborative effort led by Livermore physicist John Bradley and funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has used a new-generation transmission electron microscope (TEM) and nanoscale ion microprobe to unlock the mystery. The Livermore group includes physicists Zu Rong Dai, Ian Hutcheon, Peter Weber, and Sasa Bajt and postdoctoral researchers Hope Ishii, Giles Graham, and Julie Smith. They collaborated with the University of California at Davis (UCD), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Washington University's Laboratory for Space Sciences in St. Louis, and NASA's Ames Research Center for their discovery. The team analyzed micrometer-size interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), each about one-tenth the diameter of a human hair. Within the particles, they found carriers of the 2, 175 -angstrom feature: organic carbon mixed with amorphous silicates (glass with embedded metals and sulfides, GEMS), two of the most common materials in interstellar space. Ishii says, 'Organic carbon and amorphous silicates are abundant in interstellar dust clouds, and abundant carriers are needed to account for the frequent astronomical observation of the 2, 175 -angstrom feature. It makes sense that this ubiquitous feature would come from common materials in interstellar space'. The group's results increase scientific understanding of the starting materials for the formation of the Sun, solar system, and life on Earth...|$|R
