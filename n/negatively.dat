5|$|TBR1 both {{positively}} and <b>negatively</b> regulates gene expression in postmitotic neurons.|$|E
5|$|Basic IUPAC {{inorganic}} nomenclature has {{two main}} parts: the cation and the anion. The cation {{is the name}} for the positively charged ion and the anion is the name for the <b>negatively</b> charged ion.|$|E
5|$|Gender {{is one of}} {{the main}} social {{determinants}} of health—which include social, economic, and political factors—that play a major role in the health outcomes of women in India. Therefore, the high level of gender inequality in India <b>negatively</b> impacts the health of women.|$|E
5|$|However, black {{wildebeest}} {{can also}} affect human beings <b>negatively.</b> Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|However, blue {{wildebeest}} {{can also}} affect human beings <b>negatively.</b> They {{can compete with}} domestic livestock for grazing and water and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest to cattle and cause epidemics among animals. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E
5|$|However, {{many of the}} {{features}} introduced in Alpha Centauri were carried over into subsequent Civilization titles; in fact, upon its release, Civilization III was compared <b>negatively</b> to Alpha Centauri, whose Civilization characteristics were reminiscent of faction bonuses and penalties.|$|E
5|$|If {{one end of}} a {{wormhole}} {{was positively}} charged, the other end would be <b>negatively</b> charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or <b>negatively</b> charged; the <b>negatively</b> charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a <b>negatively</b> charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{is viewed}} <b>negatively</b> in Rabbinic sources; his sack of Nehardea mortified the Jews, {{and he was}} cursed by the Babylonian Jews and the Jews of Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies in}} mice {{have found that}} TBR1 is a {{repressor}} or Fezf2. It has also been found to <b>negatively</b> regulate corticospinal tract formation.|$|E
5|$|Seymour Goes to Hollywood {{received}} {{both positive}} and average ratings from the video game press at the time, and was compared to Dizzy video games both positively and <b>negatively.</b> The character also received both praise and criticism for his shape.|$|E
5|$|Since it has {{numerous}} arms {{emanating from}} a common centre, the octopus is often used as a symbol for a powerful and manipulative organisation, usually <b>negatively.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} and geomorphic characteristics of Argentina tend to create extreme weather conditions, often leading to natural disasters that <b>negatively</b> impact the country both economically and socially. The Pampas, {{where many of}} the large cities are located, has a flat topography and poor water drainage, making it vulnerable to flooding. Severe storms can lead to tornados, damaging hail, storm surges, and high winds, causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructure, displacing thousands of people and causing significant loss of life. Extreme temperature events such as heat waves and cold waves impact rural and urban areas by <b>negatively</b> impacting agriculture, one of the main economic activities of the country, and by increasing energy demand, which can lead to energy shortages.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is one of}} the few {{brain regions}} where new neurons are generated. This process of neurogenesis is confined to the dentate gyrus. The production of new neurons can be positively affected by exercise or <b>negatively</b> affected by epileptic seizures.|$|E
5|$|The party {{opposed the}} 2016 {{criminalisation}} {{of the use}} of prostitution in France, {{on the grounds that it}} would <b>negatively</b> impact the safety of sex workers.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily {{upon the}} electrode being {{used and the}} desired properties of the weld. Direct current with a <b>negatively</b> charged electrode (DCEN) causes heat to build up on the electrode, increasing the electrode melting rate and decreasing {{the depth of the}} weld. Reversing the polarity so that the electrode is positively charged (DCEP) and the workpiece is <b>negatively</b> charged increases the weld penetration. With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between electrode melting rate and penetration.|$|E
5|$|While {{the quality}} of the game's {{graphics}} was lauded and sales were good during its month of release, the control was received <b>negatively</b> by critics, who felt it was awkward and unintuitive. Nevertheless, the game spawned two sequels, released in 2001 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|According to a late 2012 Bertelsmann Foundation Poll, the Germans view Japan {{overwhelmingly}} positively, and regard {{that nation}} as less a competitor {{and more a}} partner. The Japanese views of Germany are positive as well, with 97% viewing Germany positively and only 3% viewing Germany <b>negatively.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adam {{was created}} during {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies original pitch to the BBC {{as part of}} his plans to revive Doctor Who for the channel. Though established early in the series' planning, Adam was always intended to be a short-term character. Though reviewers generally reacted <b>negatively</b> to the character, Adam's role as a foil to the stock companion figure has been praised alongside the moral lessons of his departure.|$|E
5|$|Although Fuchs {{had given}} Ruth his {{unconditional}} release, no major league team {{expressed an interest}} in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement {{and the end of the}} 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner Alva Bradley replied <b>negatively.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither <b>negatively</b> or positively.|$|E
5|$|Based on an August 2 diary entry {{describing}} {{heavy rainfall}} and gusty northeasterly winds at Fort George Island, {{a tropical storm}} {{is believed to have}} made landfall just south of there. In southeastern Georgia, the storm <b>negatively</b> affected the cotton crop that was already suffering from persistent drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|Brooding {{species are}} most often ahermatypic (not reef-building) in areas of high current or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is <b>negatively</b> buoyant, sinking on to the waiting egg {{carriers}} who harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks. Synchronous spawning events sometimes occurs even with these species. After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E
5|$|Daredevil was {{released}} on February 14, 2003. It received generally mixed reviews from critics with many praising the action sequences, acting performances, its soundtrack, storyline and its visual style and stunts, while many <b>negatively</b> criticized its dramatic depth and commented that the film resembles a Greek tragedy. Despite its critical reaction, the movie became the second-biggest February release to that time and grossed over $179 million against production budget of $78 million.|$|E
5|$|Desmond plays a show {{entirely of}} new songs, {{and the crowd}} loves it. Piz tells Desmond {{that he was there}} the whole time, but he does not react <b>negatively.</b> Mac, Max and Logan finish their report, but the {{professor}} cuts Logan off in the middle and dislikes it. Leo becomes a deputy again, while Vinnie enters the Sheriff’s office and states his intention to run against Keith in the special election.|$|E
5|$|During {{that same}} year, Opus Dei {{received}} some unwanted attention {{due to the}} extraordinary success of the novel The Da Vinci Code, in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted <b>negatively.</b> The film version was released globally in May 2006, further polarizing views on the organization.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{many local}} {{businesses}} collapsed, several railroads went bankrupt, and numerous small rural banks folded. Manufacturing {{came to an}} abrupt halt or was severely cut back due the dwindling demand for products. The Depression continued to <b>negatively</b> affect Indiana until the buildup for World War II. The effects continued to be felt for many years thereafter.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} USAF {{officers}} {{were unable to}} explain, two versions of each day's ATO were published, one for the USAF units at Incirlik, and another for the Eagle Flight unit at Pirinclik. The ATO version sent to Eagle Flight, for unknown reasons, gave a wrong IFF Mode I code for the TAOR. Although army Black Hawks had been operating {{for almost two years}} in the TAOR while squawking a wrong code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever told them that they were using a wrong code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks on two different IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV). The first responded <b>negatively</b> because the Black Hawks were squawking the wrong code. The second mode responded <b>negatively</b> for technical reasons that the investigation was unable to conclusively determine.|$|E
5|$|For {{substances}} in solution the isoelectric point (pI) {{is defined as}} the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of <b>negatively</b> charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.|$|E
5|$|Fraudulent {{accounting}} {{can arise}} {{from a variety}} of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may <b>negatively</b> alter an accountant's behavior. This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.|$|E
5|$|H. reaumuri {{differs from}} other desert {{woodlice}} {{in a number}} of respects. It is crepuscular, while other species are nocturnal. Apart from at the highest temperatures, it is also positively phototactic (is attracted to sunlight), while other species are <b>negatively</b> phototactic (move away from bright light). Compared to other woodlice, H. reaumuri walks in an unusual manner, with its body held high off the ground.|$|E
5|$|Her {{determination}} sometimes caused clashes {{of wills}} with Charles. In most matters of patronage, Mary had {{to defer to}} Charles, which is why his relations in this area were not much better with Mary than with their aunt Margaret. He often criticized her decisions, which <b>negatively</b> affected their otherwise affectionate relationship.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some of his}} Twitter posts proved {{controversial}} and were highlighted <b>negatively</b> by the opposition and press. As Minister of State for External Affairs he re-established long-dormant diplomatic relationships with African nations, where his fluency in French made him popular with Francophone countries and their heads of state.|$|E
5|$|Images of meth mouth {{are usually}} {{considered}} disturbing {{and have been}} used in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. The condition is often mentioned in media coverage of methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to <b>negatively</b> stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed as inevitable or characteristic.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 a {{meta-analysis}} of 25 independent studies assessing effects of Bt Cry proteins on honeybee survival (mortality) showed that Bt proteins used in commercialized GE crops to control lepidopteran and coleopteran pests do not <b>negatively</b> impact {{the survival of}} honeybee larvae or adults. Additionally, larvae consume only a small percent of their protein from pollen, {{and there is also}} a lack of geographic correlation between GM crop locations and regions where CCD occurs.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Arsenal invited Galatasaray {{to compete}} at their annual Emirates Cup tournament. Some Arsenal fans reacted <b>negatively</b> to the news, {{claiming}} that there was still bad blood between {{the two sets of}} supporters and were concerned {{that there would be a}} resumption of hostilities between them.|$|E
