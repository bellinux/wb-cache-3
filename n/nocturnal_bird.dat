5|$|This <b>nocturnal</b> <b>bird</b> of prey hunts mainly rodents, {{usually by}} {{dropping}} from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes {{a higher proportion}} of birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting. The tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the eagle owl or northern goshawk.|$|E
5|$|Greco-Roman mythology {{described}} the Empusae, the Lamia, and the striges. Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the gelloudes or Gello. Like the Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>bird</b> that fed on human flesh and blood.|$|E
5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a <b>nocturnal</b> <b>bird</b> of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E

5|$|The European {{nightjar}}, Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) is a crepuscular and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>bird</b> in the nightjar {{family that}} breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia. The Latin generic name {{refers to the}} old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards {{the east of the}} range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>bird</b> that fed on human flesh and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named Strigoï has no direct relation to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there could drink its blood and communicate.|$|E
500|$|Caprimulgus {{and the old}} name [...] "goatsucker" [...] both {{refer to}} the myth, old even {{in the time of}} Aristotle, that nightjars suckled from nanny goats, which {{subsequently}} ceased to give milk or went blind. This ancient belief is reflected in nightjar names in other European languages, such as German Ziegenmelker, Polish kozodój and Italian succiacapre, which also mean goatsucker, but despite its antiquity, it has no equivalents in Arab, Chinese or Hindu traditions. It is likely that the birds were attracted by insects around domestic animals, and, as strange nocturnal creatures, were then blamed for any misfortune that befell the beast. Another old name, [...] "puckeridge", was used to refer to both the bird and a disease of farm animals, the latter actually caused by botfly larvae under the skin. [...] "Lich fowl" [...] (corpse bird) is an old name which reflects the superstitions that surrounded this strange <b>nocturnal</b> <b>bird.</b> Like [...] "gabble ratchet" [...] (corpse hound), it may refer to the belief that the souls of unbaptised children were doomed to wander in nightjar form until Judgement Day.|$|E

2500|$|Besides owls, bat hawks, frogmouths and nightjars also display {{good night}} vision. Some bird species nest deep in cave systems which are too dark for vision, and {{find their way}} to the nest with a simple form of [...] {{echolocation}}. The [...] oilbird is the only <b>nocturnal</b> <b>bird</b> to echolocate, but several Aerodramus swiftlets also utilise this technique, with one species, Atiu swiftlet, also using echolocation outside its caves.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Guacharo quits {{the cavern}} at nightfall, {{especially}} when the moon shines. It is almost the only frugivorous <b>nocturnal</b> <b>bird</b> that is yet known; the conformation of its feet sufficiently shows {{that it does not}} hunt like our owls. It feeds on very hard fruits, as the Nutcracker and the Pyrrhocorax. The latter nestles also in clefts of rocks, and is known under the name of night-crow. The Indians assured us that the Guacharo does not pursue either the lamellicorn insects, or those phalaenae which serve as food to the goat-suckers. It is sufficient to compare the beaks of the Guacharo and goat-sucker to conjecture how much their manners must differ. [...] It is difficult to form an idea of the horrible noise occasioned by thousands of these birds in the dark part of the cavern, and which can only be compared to the croaking of our crows, which in the pine forests of the north live in society, and construct their nests upon trees the tops of which touch each other. The shrill and piercing cries of the Guacharos strike upon the vaults of the rocks, and are repeated by the echo in the depth of the cavern. The Indians showed us the nests of these birds by fixing torches {{to the end of a}} long pole. These nests were fifty or sixty feet high above our heads, in holes in the shape of funnels, with which the roof of the grotto is pierced like a sieve. The noise increased as we advanced, and the birds were affrighted by the light of the torches of copal. When this noise ceased a few minutes around us we heard at a distance the plaintive cries of the birds roosting in other ramifications of the cavern. It seemed as if these bands answered each other alternately.|$|E
