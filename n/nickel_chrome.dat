40|$|AbstractBackgroundMetal {{impurities}} such as <b>nickel</b> and <b>chrome</b> {{are present}} in natural ingredients-containing cosmetic products. These traces are unavoidable due to the ubiquitous nature of these elements. Dead Sea mud is a popular natural ingredient of cosmetic products in which <b>nickel</b> and <b>chrome</b> residues are likely to occur. ObjectiveTo analyze the potential systemic and local toxicity of Dead Sea mud taking into consideration Dead Sea muds' natural content of <b>nickel</b> and <b>chrome.</b> MethodsThe following endpoints were evaluated: (Regulation No. 1223 / 20, 21 / 12 / 2009) systemic and (SCCS's Notes of Guidance) local toxicity of topical application of Dead Sea mud; health reports during {{the last five years}} of commercial marketing of Dead Sea mud. Results and conclusionsFollowing exposure to Dead Sea mud, MoS (margin of safety) calculations for <b>nickel</b> and <b>chrome</b> indicate no toxicological concern for systemic toxicity. Skin sensitization is also not to be expected by exposure of normal healthy skin to Dead Sea mud. Topical application, however, is not recommended for already nickel-or chrome-sensitized persons. As risk assessment of impurities present in cosmetics may be a difficult exercise, the case of Dead Sea mud is taken here {{as an example of a}} natural material that may contain traces of unavoidable metals...|$|R

[...] On February 11, 1940, Germany and the Soviet Union entered into the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement, an intricate trade pact in which the Soviet Union would send Germany 650 million Reichmarks in raw materials in exchange for 650 million Reichmarks in machinery, manufactured goods and technology.

Prior to entering the war, the Fascist government sought to gain control over resources in the Balkans, particularly oil from Romania. The agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union to invade and partition Poland between them resulted in Hungary that bordered the Soviet Union after Poland's partition, and Romania viewing Soviet invasion as an immediate threat, resulting in both countries appealing to Italy for support, beginning in September 1939. Italy - then still officially neutral - responded to appeals by the Hungarian and Romanian governments for protection from the Soviet Union, by proposing a Danube-Balkan neutrals bloc. The proposed bloc was designed to increase Italian influence in the Balkans: it met resistance from France, Germany, and the Soviet Union that did not want to lose their influence in the Balkans; however Britain, who believed that Italy would not enter the war on Germany's side, supported the neutral bloc. The efforts to form the bloc failed by November 1939 after Turkey made an agreement that it would protect Allied Mediterranean territory, along with Greece and Romania.|$|E
