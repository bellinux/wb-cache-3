We {{differ from the}} literature since we concentrate oil the complete set of compliance rules agreed in Marrakech and. as a new element. we systematically discuss these compliance incentives in Conjunction with the implicit compliance incentives: reputation protection. emission trading and banking. We conclude that effectiveness and efficiency {{go hand in hand}} for all explicit and implicit compliance incentives except one emission trading. Trading improves efficiency but this Call also Occur at the cost of increasing <b>non-compliance.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} effects of continuous SSRI administration and abrupt discontinuation on biochemical and behavioral indices of rat brain serotonin function {{and attempted to}} identify underlying mechanisms Biochemistry of serotonin was assessed with brain tissue assays and microdialysis behavior was assessed as the acoustic startle reflex Long-term SSRI administration to rats reduced the content of 5 -HT and its main metabolite shortly after inhibition of 5 -HT synthesis in many brain areas with more than 50 % Turnover was not appreciably decreased but significantly increased within 48 h of drug discontinuation The microdialysis experiments indicate that neuronal release of 5 -HT depends strongly on new synthesis and emphasize the role of 5 -HT 1 B receptors in the regulation of these processes Discontinuation of the SSRI rapidly increased behavioral reactivity to the external stimulus Additional startle experiments suggest that the increased reactivity is more likely related to the reduced extracellular 5 -HT levels than to impaired synthesis The combination of the marked reduction of serotonin content and limited synthesis may destabilize brain serotonin transmission during long-term SSRI treatment These combined effects may compromise the efficacy of an SSRI therapy and facilitate behavioral changes following <b>non-compliance</b> (<b>C)</b> 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|Since their {{adoption}} in the 1970 s, compliance with European Union (EU) procurement directives has been problematic. Many {{studies have reported}} {{on the effectiveness of}} the directives, mostly in terms of the impact on the openness of public procurement and the impact on cross-border trade. However, research on the explanation (or the lack) of compliance with EU directives is limited. This article identifies the directives which are most sensitive to non-compliance. A multidisciplinary model for explaining compliance is presented, drawing from criminal theory, economics, social psychology and public purchasing. The impact on compliance is quantified, using survey data from purchasing professionals of the Dutch Ministry of Defence. The results indicate that both the expected gains of compliance and the organizational pressure {{have a positive impact on}} compliance. In contrast, no support is found for the effect of certainty and severity of sanctions and the perceived resistance of suppliers in case of <b>non-compliance.</b> Copyright (<b>c)</b> 2010 The Author(s).

40|$|Context: The role of hand hygiene in {{preventing}} health care associated infections (HCAIs) has been clearly established. However, compliance rates remain poor among health care personnel. Aims: a) To investigate {{the health care}} workers&#x 2032; hand hygiene compliance rates {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU), b) to assess reasons for <b>non-compliance</b> and <b>c)</b> to study the efficacy of a multimodal intervention strategy at improving compliance. Settings: A mixed medical-surgical ICU of a tertiary level hospital. Design: A before-after prospective, observational, intervention study. Materials and Methods: All health care personnel who came in contact with patients in the ICU were observed for their hand hygiene compliance before and after a multimodal intervention strategy (education, posters, verbal reminders and easy availability of products). A self-report questionnaire was also circulated to assess perceptions regarding compliance. Statistical analysis was done using c 2 test or Fisher exact test (Epi info software). Results: Hand hygiene compliance among medical personnel working in the ICU was 26 &#x 0025; and the most common reason cited for non-compliance was lack of time (37 &#x 0025;). The overall compliance improved significantly following the intervention to 57. 36 &#x 0025; (P < 0. 000). All health care worker groups showed significant improvements: staff nurses (21. 48 - 61. 59 &#x 0025;, P < 0. 0000), nursing students (9. 86 - 33. 33 &#x 0025;, P < 0. 0000), resident trainees (21. 62 - 60. 71 &#x 0025;, P < 0. 0000), visiting consultants (22 - 57. 14 &#x 0025;, P = 0. 0001), physiotherapists (70 - 75. 95 &#x 0025;, P = 0. 413) and paramedical staff (10. 71 - 55. 45 &#x 0025;, P < 0. 0000). Conclusions: Hand hygiene compliance among health care workers in the ICU is poor; however, intervention strategies, such as the one used, can be useful in improving the compliance rates significantly...|$|R
40|$|LLM (Environmental Law and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 South Africa is a water-scarce {{country and}} over the years, the quality of water {{resources}} has deteriorated due to poor effluent discharge, agricultural, industrial, mining and human activities. The major contributing factors of poorly-treated or inadequately treated wastewater may be attributed to: (a) the poor design and construction of wastewater treatment plants; (b) lack of qualified process controllers; (<b>c)</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with applicable legislation; (d) lack of proper monitoring; and (e) management issues with regard to wastewater treatment plants. Water quality is important as many communities depend on water resources for their daily activities and livelihood. There is a need therefore to build and manage wastewater treatment plants effectively as they {{have an impact on}} water quality. Wastewater treatment plants in South Africa are regulated by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998, the National Water Act 36 of 1998, the Water Services Act 108 of 1997, Provincial legislation, Municipal by-laws and other Government policies applicable to Local Government. Chapter 7 of the Constitution inter alia, provides that Local Government has the duty to provide a safe and healthy environment to its community in a sustainable manner. Schedule 4 B of the Constitution imposes the function of delivering water, sanitation and wastewater treatment services on Municipalities. This responsibility rests on District Municipalities but may be performed by a Local Municipality if the district municipality lacks the capacity to do so. Although Local Government has the right to govern on its own initiative the affairs of its communities, it needs support and monitoring from other spheres of Government (National and Provincial) to ensure the delivery of wastewater treatment services in a sustainable manner. In this study, Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality is used {{as an example of a}} Municipality in the Limpopo Province faced with challenges related to the operation and management of its wastewater treatment plant. This study aims to determine who should be responsible for the regulation of wastewater treatment plants in Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality area in order to ensure service delivery to communities in a sustainable manner. In order to deal with the challenges experienced by Local Government in dealing with wastewater treatment plants, the study considers Best Practice Guidelines and external service delivery mechanisms, specifically in the form of Public-Private Partnerships. The study concludes with recommendations based on Best Practice Guidelines which Municipalities can use to avoid wastewater pollution and proposes management mechanisms in managing a Public-Private Partnership effectively in order to ensure that they provide service delivery in a sustainable manner.
