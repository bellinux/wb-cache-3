40|$|The metal {{container}} industry has plants throughout central and western Canada, but {{the concentration of}} plants are in Ontario. The {{metal container}} industry has gone through many changes {{with the advent of}} metal recycling. In-plant recycling of waste products has become a normal operating procedure. In 1976, the Progressive Conservatives led by Premier Bill Davis decided to pass amendments to the Environmental Protection Act which would require the gradual phasing out of <b>non-refillable</b> pop <b>containers.</b> The Metal Container Manufacturer’ Advisory Council (MCMAC) stated that if the regulations were implemented there would be a loss of more than 1, 200 jobs in steel can making and capital facilities worth more than $ 50 million owned by companies involved with soft drink can manufacturing would be abandoned. 38 cm, (1 box) containing correspondence, press releases, clippings and publications pertaining to the Metal Containers Manufacturers' Advisory Council...|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{environmental}} scientist Lester Brown, {{founder of the}} Worldwatch Institute and {{founder and president of}} the Earth Policy Institute, outlined a detailed [...] "tax shifting" [...] structure which would not lead to an overall higher tax level: [...] "It means reducing income taxes and offsetting them with taxes on environmentally destructive activities such as carbon emissions, the generation of toxic waste, the use of virgin raw materials, the use of <b>non-refillable</b> beverage <b>containers,</b> mercury emissions, the generation of garbage, the use of pesticides, and the use of throwaway products... activities that should be discouraged by taxing."" [...] Brown subsequently added that such a tax shift would amount to an [...] "honest market," [...] explaining, [...] "The key to restructuring the economy is the creation of an honest market, one that tells the ecological truth." [...] In 2011 he estimated the cost of such a tax shift, including the effects of better technology, the use of renewables and [...] "updating the concept of national security." ...|$|R
50|$|Weatherchem’s {{standard}} line includes {{products with}} flap-style dispensing for one-handed use, {{as well as}} products with non-removable grinders. Weatherchem’s original Flapper Dispensing Closure was introduced in 1983. That patented technology {{is used in the}} food industry by such companies as McCormick, {{as well as in the}} healthcare, personal-care and chemical industries. Weatherchem’s NutraFlapper can be found on Nature Made and similar product lines, while its Agricap, a heavy-duty, tamper-evident closure, can be found in the agricultural chemicals market. In 2006, the company introduced four new products: the Grinder NR, LiquiFlapper, FlapMate and NutraGen II. The Grinder NR is a dry-spice packaging system with a non-removable grinder and a <b>non-refillable</b> polyethylene <b>container.</b> (The Grinder NR design is specifically intended to discourage reuse in order to force consumers to purchase high-profit-margin new units instead of simply refilling already-purchased units with economical bulk spices.) LiquiFlapper is used for the controlled dispensing of liquid products. The sift-resistant FlapMate eliminates the need for liner removal. NutraGen II is designed for the dispensing of larger pills. Through its technical services group, Weatherchem provides in-line manufacturing trials, product performance studies and guidance on sustainability practices in manufacturing.|$|R
40|$|This {{exercise}} {{provides an}} interactive case simulation {{in which you}} will be assigned to a group that will {{assume the role of}} one of several stakeholder groups (government, industry, environmental groups) in an actual dispute over the trade-consistency of the Canadian Province of Ontario’s application of an environmental levy on <b>non-refillable</b> malt beverage <b>containers.</b> In this case, the U. S. government, on behalf of the U. S. beer industry, objected to the tax, arguing that it violated the national treatment obligation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization – hereafter GATT/WTO). The U. S. contemplated appealing the case to the GATT/WTO. This simulation assumes that the U. S. proceeds with the appeal, and puts participants in the roles of the various disputants: U. S. Government, Ontario and Canadian governments, U. S. brewing industry, a coalition of environmental groups, and the U. S. aluminum industry...|$|R
