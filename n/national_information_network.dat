40|$|BACKGROUND: Depression often occurs {{simultaneously}} {{with a variety}} of somatic, psychiatric, and social conditions. Knowledge about differences in the pharmacological treatment of depressed patients with and without co-morbidity is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To compare GPs' pharmacological treatment of depressed patients with and without co-morbidity. METHODS: Data were extracted from the computerized medical records of 77 general practices participating in the Dutch <b>National</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Network</b> of General Practice (LINH). We used diagnosis and prescription data of newly diagnosed depressed patients aged 18 - 65 years (n= 4372). A mixed-model technique was used for analyzing the medical data. RESULTS: During the year after diagnosing depression, depressed patients who also suffered from chronic somatic or psychiatric morbidity were prescribed more psychotropics than patients with depression only. Prescription patterns of psychotropic drugs for depressed patients with and without co-morbid social problems differed only during the first 3 months after diagnosis. For the whole 1 -year period after diagnosis, the pharmacological treatment of depression in patients with and without co-morbid social problems did not differ. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that chronic somatic or psychiatric co-morbidity in depressed patients leads to higher GP prescription levels of psychotropics, whereas co-morbid social problems do not seem to influence GPs' pharmacological treatment decisions for depression.

40|$|Bridging {{the digital}} divide between {{information}} and technol-ogy haves and have-nots has waned {{from the top of}} the national policy agenda in the United States during a time in which the sunken investments of the 1990 s need to be leveraged. A <b>national</b> <b>information</b> <b>network</b> now exists yet this infrastructure—largely hardware—needs to be continually modernized and parlayed with commitments to building human capacity, developing relevant con-tent, and scaling socially beneficial technology applications, such as telemedicine, in order to optimize these initial multi-billion-dollar outlays. This article makes the case that sidestepping public– private initiatives aimed at accelerating digital opportunity is imprudent, given the mounting empirical evidence highlighting the payoffs of information and communications technologies, when properly integrated and applied, especially in enhancing the life chances of underserved Americans. Policy next steps should ad-vance the goals of expanding universal service initiatives, includ-ing hastening broadband deployment to homes and learning insti-tutions, and deepening programs which leverage the utility of the existing infrastructure, such as expanding human-capital develop-ment, producing relevant content, and innovating socially benefi-cial technology applications.

40|$|All European {{countries}} have recommendations for influenza vaccination {{among the elderly}} and chronically ill. However, only a few countries are able to provide data on influenza uptake among these groups. The aim of our study is to investigate whether a population survey is an effective method of obtaining vaccination uptake rates in the different risk groups {{and to find out}} what reasons people give as to why they have accepted or refused influenza vaccination and whether this varies among the risk groups. A mail questionnaire was sent out to households in The Netherlands, the response rate was 73 %. This resulted in data for 4037 individuals on influenza and influenza vaccination during the 2001 - 2002 influenza season. The uptake rates and size of different risk groups from the panel survey were comparable with other national representative sources (from the <b>National</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Network</b> of GPs (LINH) and Statistics Netherlands (CBS)). The main reason cited for undergoing vaccination was the existence of a chronic condition. The main reasons for refraining from vaccination were having enough resistance to flu and ignorance about the recommendations. In The Netherlands, the GP is the main administrator of influenza vaccines. We believe that population surveys may be useful for revealing influenza vaccination uptake rates for the groups at risk. When combined with questions about reasons for undergoing vaccination, the results may provide useful policy information and can be used to direct vaccination campaigns at under-vaccinated risk groups or to target the information campaign more effectively.

40|$|The Finnish {{health care}} system is a mixture of public and private services. Its {{governance}} and funding is highly decentralized. Contrary to governmental policies and expectations, autonomous decisions by local authorities and service providers associated with lack of information models and common technical standards have led to a broad spectrum of one-off ICT –systems with little tech-nical and semantic interoperability. National strategies to overcome these challenges have prompted initiatives to create sharable electronic health records (EHR) by supporting a collection of federated interoperable repositories with regional middleware ser-vices. In the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa an established regional eHealth network (RHIN) connects 24 public hospitals, 29 municipal health centers (primary care) and two private health care clinics. There are 7. 500 end-users, information from 1, 4 million citizens and 40 million links to EPRs.
