The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E

He was {{assigned}} the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson—who had defended John Linley Frazier and also been assigned to the Herbert Mullin case—but due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's only option was to plead <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity to the charges. Kemper twice {{tried to commit suicide}} in custody, surviving both times. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.|$|E

By 1992, Sweeney was on 16-hour-a-day furloughs. Members of the Lowenstein family, who had opposed prosecutorial plans to seek a sentence of death for Sweeney, expressed grave concern about the supervision Sweeney would receive and anger that a murderer was being given such privileges.|$|E
5000|$|Captain Walker is {{tried for}} murder but found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reasons</b> of self-defense. However, Tommy fails to {{celebrate}} his father's release, and his family quickly realizes that he has apparently gone deaf, dumb, and blind. Tommy's parents have him undergo a battery of medical tests, to no avail ("Sparks"). At ten years of age, Tommy's unresponsive state remains unchanged ("Amazing Journey - Reprise"). The Walkers all go to church and host a Christmas family dinner, though the family is unnerved that Tommy does not {{know that it is}} Christmas or understand its significance ("Christmas"). Everyone is stunned when Tommy responds only to his uncle Ernie's playing the French horn. Mr Walker, {{in a desperate attempt to}} reach his son, shouts [...] "Tommy, can you hear me?" [...] multiple times. Older Tommy, only visible to young Tommy, who persistently stares at the mirror, sings to him ("See Me, Feel Me").|$|R
50|$|Per Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2, a {{defendant}} intending {{to pursue an}} insanity defense must timely notify {{an attorney for the}} government in writing. The government then has a right to have the court order a psychiatric or psychological examination. If the defendant does not submit to the examination, the court may exclude any expert evidence from the defendant {{on the issue of the}} defendant’s mental disease, mental defect, or any other mental condition. Federal law provides for the commitment of those found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> only <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> of insanity. Once such a verdict is handed down, the defendant has the burden of proof of showing that his release would not create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage of property of another due to a present mental disease or defect. Because of the difficulty in proving such a thing, in some cases, defendants found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> only <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> of insanity serve more time in a mental hospital than they would have served in prison had they been found guilty. A risk panel is typically tasked with making such assessments.|$|R

Hinckley stated that his actions were an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, on whom Hinckley was fixated, by mimicking Travis's mohawked appearance at the Palantine rally. His attorney concluded his defense by playing the movie for the jury.|$|E
25|$|Gacy had {{attempted}} to convince the doctors that he suffered from a multiple personality disorder. His lawyers opted to have Gacy plead <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity to the charges against him, and produced several psychiatric experts who had examined Gacy the previous year to testify to their findings. Three psychiatric experts appearing for the defense at Gacy's trial testified they found Gacy to be a paranoid schizophrenic with a multiple personality disorder.|$|E

50|$|Crown counsel {{comprised}} some of {{the most}} accomplished lawyers in Canada: Christopher Robinson, Britton Bath Osler, George Burbidge, David Lynch Scott, and Thomas Chase-Casgrain. Chase-Casgrain was the lone French-Canadian in the prosecution. They called nine witnesses for the prosecution, General Frederick Middleton, Dr. John Henry Charles Willoughby, Thomas McKay, George Ness, George Kerr, John W. Astley, Thomas E. Jackson, Dr. A. Jukes, and Riel's cousin Charles Nolin. The cross-examination of the defence attempted to prove his mental instability and render a <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> plea <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> of insanity, but to little success.|$|R
50|$|The fort {{has also}} been a penitentiary, a mental {{hospital}} (1885-1886), an HBC residence, and a golf course/motor country club (1911 - 1963).

50|$|Federal law {{provides}} {{that the director}} of the facility in which a person is hospitalized due to being found incompetent to stand trial or <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> only <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> of insanity of a Section 871 violation shall prepare annual or semiannual reports concerning the mental condition of the person and containing recommendations about the need for his continued hospitalization; a copy of the reports shall be submitted to the Director of the United States Secret Service to assist it in carrying out its protective duties. The Ninth Circuit ruled that it is constitutional to hold a presidential threatener beyond Section 871's prescribed five-year statutory maximum if he is found to be dangerous and mentally ill. It is possible under federal law to hold some presidential threateners indefinitely.|$|R
25|$|On July 26, 2006, the Texas jury in her retrial {{found that}} Yates was <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity.

In January 2007, she was moved to a low security state mental hospital in Kerrville, Kerrville State Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Reported to {{have been}} driven by an obsessive {{fixation}} on Jodie Foster, he was found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity and remained under institutional psychiatric care until September 2016. Public outcry over the verdict led to the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, which altered the rules for consideration of mental illness of defendants in Federal Criminal Court proceedings in the United States. Hinckley was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, and lives full-time at his mother's home.|$|E

Burky was arrested in December 2009 outside her daughter's preschool. He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity. In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered {{to stay away from}} the Affleck family for 10 years if released from hospital.|$|E
50|$|Coyle {{passed out}} some of the money, in $100 bills, to friends and neighbors.

He was tried, but found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> of theft <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> of temporary insanity. The armored car company, Purolator Armored Services, eventually recovered around $1 million of the original amount.|$|R
5000|$|The Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984 {{amended the}} United States federal laws {{governing}} defendants with mental diseases or defects {{to make it}} significantly more difficult to obtain a verdict of <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> only <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> of insanity. It removed the volitional component, that a defendant lacked capacity to conform their conduct to the law, from the ALI test. Defendants were only exculpated only if [...] "at {{the time of the}} commission of the acts constituting the offense, ... {{as the result of a}} severe mental disease or defect, were unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of her acts." [...] The law passed in the wake of public outrage after John Hinckley, Jr.'s acquittal <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> of insanity for his attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan.|$|R
5000|$|At his trial, Judge Andries Beyers {{declared}} Tsafendas <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> {{of murder}} <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> of insanity. He {{had been diagnosed}} as being schizophrenic and it was claimed by police and his defence that he had {{said that he had}} a giant tapeworm inside him, which spoke to him. The court ordered that he be detained [...] "at the pleasure of the State President", which meant that only the State President (later President) had the authority to order his release. He was never discharged.|$|R
25|$|In 1976, Deborah Gardner {{was found}} murdered {{in her home}} in Tonga, where she was serving in the Peace Corps. Dennis Priven, a fellow Peace Corps worker, was later charged with the murder by the Tonga government. He was found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity, {{and was sentenced to}} serve time in a mental {{institution}} in Washington D.C. Privan was never admitted to any institution, and the handling of the case has been heavily criticized. The main criticism has been that the Peace Corps seemingly worked to keep one of its volunteers from being found guilty of murder, due to the reflection it would have on the organization.|$|E
25|$|With {{the other}} members of her family preoccupied, Miriam's {{obsession}} takes a new turn when she finds herself entering people's houses and stealing small objects from them. Several times she is almost discovered, but, though she tries to anchor herself to the real world through emotionally detached sex with Saul, she cannot resist the pull of the empty houses. At the National Spelling Bee, Eliza performs well but does not win, so she begins to prepare for the following year, with Saul's enthusiastic help. But the family is about to be torn apart. Miriam is arrested, pleads <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity, and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

25|$|Anatomy of a Murder {{is based}} on a real murder (and {{subsequent}} trial) that occurred in Big Bay in the early morning of July 31, 1952. Coleman A. Peterson, a lieutenant in the Army, was charged with murdering Maurice Chenoweth. The alleged motive was revenge for the rape of Peterson's wife by Chenoweth. Voelker successfully defended Peterson, who was found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity. Other books by Voelker were based on other legal cases in the Upper Peninsula or his love of fly fishing for brook trout. He authored over 100 opinions during his short tenure on the Michigan Supreme Court, the most famous of which was in a case called People v. Hildabridle involving a nudist colony near Battle Creek.|$|E

Viki reasserted herself in order to rescue Jessie, and after many months of drama involving the alters, underwent psychotherapy {{to deal with the}} reality of her childhood. She would remember the most terrible secret of her life in therapy though - back in 1976, she briefly became [...] "Tori" [...] and murdered Victor herself (although years later, it would be revealed that Victor survived the attempt on his life).

40|$|There is {{emerging}} evidence to link criminal offending and brain injury, {{but there is}} still limited research in this area, in particular for people with brain injury and psychiatric disorders. To explore this issue, we reviewed 276 individuals presented to the New South Wales Mental Health Review Tribunal (MHRT), an independent agency that reviews people who are deemed <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> of offending <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> of mental illness. Nine individuals (3. 3 %) were identified with brain injury and psychiatric disorders, the majority as a result of non-traumatic brain injury related to alcohol and substance abuse. All of them were male. They were diagnosed with serious psychiatric disorders such as paranoid psychosis and schizophrenia and had committed serious offences such as murder, intent to murder, sexual assault and physical assault. Most had previous psychiatric, criminal, and alcohol and substance abuse histories. Two case studies suggest a lack of treatment follow-up. The study suggests an urgent need to consider early intervention and how services are offered post-rehabilitation, and the importance of collecting and maintaining data to ensure appropriate mental health management and policy formulation...|$|R

25|$|During the 1870s Abe Buford {{suffered}} {{a series of}} financial reversals that forced him into bankruptcy with the resulting loss of Bosque Bonita Farm to his creditors. In addition, he {{suffered a}} devastating personal loss when his only son, William A. Buford, died at age twenty-three in 1872. He lost his wife Amanda Harris Buford in 1879 and on March 26 of that same year, his brother, Colonel Thomas Buford of Henry County, Kentucky, shot and killed Judge John Milton Elliott in Frankfort, Kentucky. Tom Buford surrendered to police and was jailed pending trial. Abe Buford came to his brother's aid and {{spent a great deal}} of money on legal fees for his defense. On appeal of a guilty verdict, Thomas Buford would eventually be found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity and was sent to the Anchorage, Kentucky psychiatric hospital.|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 1974, Anthony Barbaro was arraigned {{on three}} counts of second-degree murder, six counts of first-degree assault, and five counts of first-degree {{reckless}} endangerment. Barbaro was then being held without bail at the Olean City Jail. Following the shooting, police had found homemade smoke bombs, {{as well as}} gasoline and glass bottles, and empty propane canisters in Barbaro's bedroom. Police also found, in Barbaro's bedroom, bomb recipes and a journal that detailed {{his plans for the}} shooting. In April 1975, he had entered a plea of <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity, however he was found competent to stand trial by two court-appointed psychiatrists. Barbaro was soon transferred from the Olean City Jail to the Cattaraugus County Jail in Little Valley.

Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Daryl Matthews testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, {{but he did not}} meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that he knew what he had done was wrong.|$|E
