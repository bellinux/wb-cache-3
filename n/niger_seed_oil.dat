Bip., G. zavattarii Lanza and G. arborescens (I. Friis) collected from Ethiopia were studied using Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) markers. Higher genetic diversity was revealed among the individuals {{belonging to the}} same population than among the populations of the different regions. Overall, greater variation was observed between the niger populations originating from Wollo and Hararghe {{on the one hand}} and those from the rest of the regions on the other. Among the wild Guizotia species, G. scabra ssp. Schimperi was found to be closer to G. villosa than to any of the wild Guizotia taxa. Likewise, G. zavattarii and G. arborescens are found to be more closely related to each other than to the rest of the wild taxa. Based on the ISSR results, revision of the previous classification that placed G. scabra ssp. Schimperi as a sub species of G. scabra was suggested. Both the field evaluation of agronomic characters as well as the ISSR analysis revealed variation among the niger populations grown in different regions of the country. Based on the agronomic characters, it was observed that the niger populations obtained from Wollo and Hararghe are of the early maturing types while the accessions originating from the rest of the regions are mostly of the late maturing types. The early maturing and the late maturing niger types differ in many of their agronomic characters notable among which are days to flower initiation, days to 50 % flowering, plant height and seed size. Niger breeding experiment was undertaken in an attempt to elevate the oleic acid content in the seed oil. The objective to increase the oleic acid content in <b>niger</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> from what it is today, approximately 5 - 11 % in the wild type niger of Ethiopian origin to over 80 % in the strains improved for oleic acid content has been achieved.

40|$|Background: Studies of the biogeographic {{distribution}} of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants are fundamental {{to understanding the}} mechanisms of adaptive evolution in plants as <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is the primary energy source needed for germination and establishment of plants. However, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content as an adaptive trait in plants is poorly understood. Here, we examine the adaptive nature of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in 168 angiosperm families occurring in different biomes across the world. We also explore the role of multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition in plant adaptation in a phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic context. Result: It was observed that the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in tropical plants (28. 4 %) {{was significantly higher than}} the temperate plants (24. 6 %). A significant relationship between oil content and latitude was observed in three families Papaveraceae, Sapindaceae and Sapotaceae indicating that selective forces correlated with latitude influence <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content. Evaluation of the response of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition to latitude and the correlation between <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition showed that multiple <b>seed</b> traits, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition contribute towards plant adaptation. Investigation of {{the presence or absence of}} phylogenetic signals across 168 angiosperm families in 62 clades revealed that members of seven clades evolved to have high or low <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content independently as they did not share a common evolutionary path. Conclusion: The study provides us an insight into the biogeographical distribution and the adaptive role of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants. The study indicates that multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and the fatty acid composition of the <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> determine the fitness of the plants and validate the adaptive hypothesis that <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> quantity and quality are crucial to plant adaptation...|$|R
