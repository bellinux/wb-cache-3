5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (about {{the size of}} a half dollar) being issued by the Mint was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> in February 1857.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of 1932 Gielgud played in a <b>new</b> <b>piece,</b> Musical Chairs by Ronald Mackenzie, and {{directed}} one new and one classic play, Strange Orchestra by Rodney Ackland in the West End, and The Merchant of Venice at the Old Vic, with Malcolm Keen as Shylock and Ashcroft as Portia. In 1932 he starred in Richard of Bordeaux by Elizabeth MacKintosh. This, a retelling in modern language {{of the events of}} Richard II, was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw's Saint Joan nine years earlier, more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had been. After an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell-out hit and played in London and on tour over the next three years.|$|E
5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to be printed (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing is all the more remarkable as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E

5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the watchful}} eye of police detective Bobby Fulbright, Phoenix, Apollo and Athena become {{involved}} in several cases. Apollo and Athena investigate the murder of alderman Rex Kyubi. They face Simon Blackquill in court, who prosecutes despite serving a murder sentence himself. Additional content set after these events tells the story of Phoenix's first case after regaining his badge, having to defend an orca accused of killing her owner. Afterwards, Athena defends her childhood friend Juniper Woods who is charged with the murder of her teacher. Some time later, following a bombing at a space station, Apollo's friend Clay Terran is found murdered. During the trial, where Athena and Apollo defend an astronaut named Solomon Starbuck, a bomb goes off in the courtroom, injuring Apollo. Juniper is accused of the bombing, but Phoenix defends her and finds the real culprit. Feeling personally involved in the case, Apollo takes a leave of absence from the agency to investigate the case on his own while Phoenix takes over Solomon's case. He proves Solomon's innocence, but a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> of evidence places Athena as the prime suspect.|$|E

25|$|In 1959 Boulez left Paris for Baden-Baden, moving {{eventually}} {{into a large}} hillside villa at Kapuzinerstraße 9, {{which was}} his main residence {{for the rest of}} his life. Robert Piencikowski suggests a number of reasons for the move to Germany: excellent rehearsal conditions with the South-West German Radio orchestra, with which he had an arrangement to work as composer-in-residence and to conduct some smaller concerts; an electronic studio where he could work on a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> (Poésie pour pouvoir); but also disenchantment with the cultural and political climate in France under de Gaulle at the time of the Algerian war.|$|E
25|$|Comparing {{the market}} cost of {{recyclable}} material {{with the cost}} of new raw materials ignores economic externalities—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a <b>new</b> <b>piece</b> of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A life cycle assessment can be used to determine the levels of externalities and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a carbon tax) can be used to bring externalities into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.|$|E

It is true that the absurdities of the part would be more acceptable in one of the frankly extravagant inventions of the older librettist than in a more professedly historical, and one which presents in all other respects, faithful pictures of the place and period chosen.|$|E
