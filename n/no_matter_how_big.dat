Rising upward could be achieved a number of ways, such as by gaining wealth, by gaining skill in some department, by qualifying for a learned profession, by showing conspicuous valour, or by performing some service to the community.

One type of the businesses, which suffers {{a lot of}} from this situation, is hotel business. Therefore, the writers are interested to conduct a survey on Garden Palace Hotel, Surabaya who often puts advertisement in newspaper, such as : Jawa Pos, Surabaya Post and Business Indonesia. The advertisements offer interesting packages. This is important as a hotel needs to maintain and increase its occupancy level. Furthermore, the hotel management realize {{that they need to}} conduct staff training program so that they may even improve the services. In this paper the writers relate the advertising campaign and the staff training program that have been carried out. They also evaluate the correlation between the room sales of the hotel and advertising and training cost. Thus, there are three factors to be considered: (1) Steps in developing advertising campaign, (2) Training in certain departments, (3) The influence of service improvement and advertising toward the sales volume using statistical method. The result of the evaluation states that both advertising campaign and training program conducted by Garden Palace Hotel are effective and efficient. Through statistical calculation, the writers find that both advertising and training variables give positive effects toward the room sales of Garden Palace Hotel. Here the writers will evaluate the advertising campaign and the staff-training program and see the correlation...|$|R

There {{is a lot of}} medium available for traveling from one place to another. Among this mediums, traveling by roadway vehicles seems to be generally used. In recent times, many research has been done to create awareness for the driver and facilitate building assistance technologies. These assistance technologies help drivers not only to maintain but increase safe driving while not to interfere or giving too much information. These days many new technologies were implmented to create awareness for the driver. Before implementing a new technology into a vehicle, vehicle simulator can be used for driving assessment. In vehicle simulator, test scenarios are created for experimentation and to see how the test subject reacts on new surroundings. It is easy to execute the scenario in vehicle simulator and observe the human behavour rightaway and create the same environment over and over again. In this thesis, I have watched and analysed naturalistic drive records and afterwards convert those videos into vehicle simulator scenarios. There are a lot of naturalistic drive records from different projects performed earlier in SAFER. These video recordings were taken from different type of roads. These video records can help us to understand better, how the driving vehicle would interact with other road users. Video records from FOT project and from China was analysed in this thesis. For analyzing the videos I have several meetings with my professor, supervisor and colleague from SEMCON and the results were put into a excel file. After analyzing, sorting and extracting the most significant video clips, I have designed storyboards based on that. Those story boards were used to develop scenarios in car simulator at the interaction design lab. These scenarios will be used for further future HMI studies and to test the design see if it can help the driver to avoid different kind of dangerous moments happening on the road. After designing the scenarios in vehicle simulator (STISIM), the results were taken out in log file and in realtime to use it another EFESOS projects...|$|R
