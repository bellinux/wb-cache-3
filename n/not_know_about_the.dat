5|$|Throughout {{the morning}} of 26 September, the Germans pressed home their attacks and finally linked up from both sides at the river. It was not until about noon that they {{realised}} the British had actually withdrawn. Later in the day, they rounded up about 600 men, mostly {{the men in the}} aid stations and those left on the north bank, as well as some pockets of resistance that had been out of radio contact with division Headquarters and did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 2015, the {{pipeline}} operators in Midland, Texas remotely detected pressure anomalies {{and shut down}} Line 901 at 11:30am. The Santa Barbara County Fire Department initially responded around 11:40am to a report of a strong smell coming from the area. Fire crews found the crude oil flowing from a drainage culvert that passed under U.S. 101, and into the Pacific Ocean and reported the leak to authorities. Local pipeline workers did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> leak until they were notified by the state parks staff around noon that there was oil in the water. After struggling to find the leaking pipeline, workers located Line 901 where it had leaked and flowed into the storm culvert around 1:30pm. Clean-up efforts didn't begin for 16 to 18 hours.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet {{invasion}} of Finland, {{which had been}} covertly ceded to it under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact secret protocols, created domestic problems for Hitler.

These flashes were extremely bright strobe lights. They involved multiple colors with a strobe effect at about 12 Hz. Although 95% of the 685 just complained of dizziness, some were hospitalized.

While being held prisoner in Malfoy Manor, Harry briefly glimpses Aberforth's eye in the remaining shard of the two-way mirror he was given by Sirius and calls for Aberforth's help. Aberforth bought its counterpart from Mundungus Fletcher. Using the mirror to watch over the trio, Aberforth sends Dobby to rescue them and the other prisoners from the Manor.

X-Ray Company was {{conducting}} an operation alongside Afghan National Army troops to dominate areas posing a dangerous threat to British forces and the local Afghan population. The men who were killed were members of the Quick Reaction Force (QRF) which was working in support of the company operation. The members of the QRF were talking to locals when a 13-year-old boy pushed a wheelbarrow containing an explosive device toward them, which was then detonated killing the marines and killing and injuring a number of children and civilians. It is thought that the boy did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> explosives in the wheelbarrow and was an unsuspecting victim of the blast.|$|E
25|$|The Order makes a brief {{diversion}} to Cliffport {{to confront}} the Linear Guild. After Nale frames Elan for the Linear Guild's crimes, Elan escapes from prison and reunites with Haley {{with the help of}} a dashing swordsman named Julio Scoundrel. Haley recovers her speech and confesses her love for Elan, who reciprocates. The Order returns to Azure City to ask Lord Shojo for further directions. Miko, who does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> plan to find the gates but does know about Xykon's army, overhears the conversation and jumps to the conclusion that both are in league with Xykon. She strikes her master down, and is immediately stripped of her paladin status by her gods and imprisoned. Xykon's hobgoblins attack the city the next day. The Order helps Shojo's heir, Hinjo, hold the city walls. Xykon attempts to circumvent the defenders, but Roy leaps up to the zombified dragon that Xykon is riding, and the two duel once more. Xykon overpowers Roy and sends him falling to his death. Xykon and Redcloak attempt to activate the gate hidden within the castle's throne room, but Miko, having escaped from prison, destroys the gate in an attempt to protect it. In the ensuing explosion, Miko is killed, and Xykon and Redcloak escape. The city falls to the hobgoblins. Haley and Belkar become separated from the party when they go to recover Roy's corpse, while the others sail away with Hinjo and the surviving Azurites.

500|$|In {{terms of}} engineering, the Tagora had no major flaws (except {{perhaps for the}} poor cabin ventilation). The 1979 energy crisis, however, dealt {{a blow to the}} European {{automotive}} market: the large car segment contracted significantly, making Chrysler's initial sales projections unrealistic. The Tagora was ultimately launched under the Talbot brand, which was not established in the marketplace and had a confused pedigree, putting the car at an immediate disadvantage in an executive car market dominated by well established offerings such as the Ford Granada. In the view of Martin Buckley Talbot did not advertise the car effectively so [...] "people did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> car".|$|E
500|$|Howe's {{failure at}} Savannah led to {{criticism}} from Georgia state officials, who {{believed he had}} abandoned the state to the British, {{as well as from}} fellow Continental Army generals, such as William Moultrie, who criticized Howe for even attempting to resist the British while being so greatly outnumbered. [...] During his testimony before a later court–martial, Howe claimed that he knew about the pathway through the swamp taken by the British, but stated that he did not defend it because he believed the chance of an attack along the path was [...] "so remote". [...] This contradicted earlier testimony from Georgia militia officer George Walton, who stated that Howe did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> path prior to the battle and that Howe told Walton that he was mistaken in believing a path through the swamps existed.|$|E

500|$|One {{poster for}} the film {{included}} the statement: [...] "Rick Baker, the new master of special effects, who brought you the magic of The Exorcist and gave you the wonder of King Kong, now brings you his greatest creation, The Incredible Melting Man". Although Baker assisted with the effects in The Exorcist (1973), Dick Smith was the makeup artist who primarily worked on that film, not Baker. Exorcist director William Friedkin was so angry about the poster that, upon seeing it on an associate's wall, he tore it down and ripped it to pieces. Baker, who did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> poster in advance, was horrified by the publicity campaign and publicly apologized for it, claiming: [...] "Dick wanted some help so I first went out to do some work on the dummy whose head turns around 360 degrees. I really didn't do anything creative, I just did labor".|$|E
500|$|The event CGs were {{decided by}} Nakazawa {{based on the}} game's plot and script, and written down in a {{specification}} document given to the art team. Because this was done before the scenario was completely finished, there were some places that he {{when looking at the}} scenario as a whole realized would have benefited more from a CG than some of the passages that did get one, despite how he updated the specification document every so often throughout the development. Because of this, it was decided to add more CGs to several scenes for the game's [...] "Premium Edition" [...] re-release. A challenge in creating the CGs was that the art team did not understand the game's main plot twist, resulting in several finished CGs with mistakes that a person who does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> twist would not have noticed, that had to be fixed. For the background art, inspiration was drawn from the films Cube and The Abyss and the video game Resident Evil.|$|E
500|$|Spock's {{death in}} the film was widely {{reported}} during production. [...] "Trekkies" [...] wrote letters to protest, one paid for trade press advertisements urging Paramount to change the plot, and Nimoy even received death threats. Test audiences reacted badly to Spock's death and the film's ending's dark tone, so it was made more uplifting by Bennett. The scene of Spock's casket on the planet and Nimoy's closing monologue were added; Meyer objected, but did not {{stand in the way}} of the modifications. Nimoy did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> scene until he saw the film, but before it opened, the media reassured fans that [...] "Spock will live" [...] again. Due to time constraints, the casket scene was filmed in an overgrown corner of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, using smoke machines to add a primal atmosphere. The shoot lasted from midday to evening, as the team was well aware there would be no time for reshoots.|$|E
