5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of <b>niacin</b> in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include <b>niacin,</b> aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), <b>niacin</b> (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets). In {{much of the}} developed world, such deficiencies are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders.|$|E
5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, <b>niacin</b> and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (<b>niacin</b> and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E
5|$|In organisms, NAD can be {{synthesized}} {{from simple}} building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex {{components of the}} coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called <b>niacin.</b> Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles {{them back into the}} active form. Some NAD is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme {{is similar to that of}} NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (<b>niacin),</b> is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient {{is a man who}} is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (<b>niacin).</b> House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{assembling}} NAD de novo {{from simple}} amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base. The three vitamin precursors {{used in these}} salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B or <b>niacin.</b> However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD. Some of the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for {{the high level of}} reactions that consume NAD in this organelle. salvage pathway delays aging without altering steady-state NAD+ levels | journal = J.

25|$|Medication and {{supplemental}} <b>niacin</b> {{are primarily}} {{used to treat}} high blood cholesterol and pellagra (<b>niacin</b> deficiency). Insufficient <b>niacin</b> in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. The lack of <b>niacin</b> may also be observed in pandemic deficiency disease, which {{is caused by a}} lack of five crucial vitamins (<b>niacin,</b> vitamin C, thiamin, vitamin D, and vitamin A) and is usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition. <b>Niacin</b> is provided in the diet from a variety of whole and processed foods, with highest contents in fortified packaged foods and meat from various animal sources. Some countries require its addition to grains.|$|E
25|$|Particularly the {{time-release}} variety, at {{extremely high}} doses, can cause acute toxic reactions. Extremely {{high doses of}} <b>niacin</b> can also cause <b>niacin</b> maculopathy, a thickening of the macula and retina, which leads to blurred vision and blindness. This maculopathy is reversible after <b>niacin</b> intake ceases.|$|E
25|$|In animal {{models and}} in vitro, <b>niacin</b> {{produces}} marked anti-inflammatory effects {{in a variety}} of tissues– including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and vascular tissue– through the activation of NIACR1. <b>Niacin</b> has been shown to attenuate neuroinflammation and may have efficacy in treating neuroimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Unlike <b>niacin,</b> nicotinamide does not activate NIACR1, however both <b>niacin</b> and nicotinamide activate the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in vitro.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Altschul {{and colleagues}} {{described}} <b>niacin</b> {{as having a}} lipid lowering property. As such, <b>niacin</b> is the oldest lipid lowering drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Niacin</b> supplementation has {{not been}} found useful for {{decreasing}} the risk of cardiovascular disease in those already on a statin, but appears {{to be effective in}} those not taking a statin. Although <b>niacin</b> and nicotinamide are identical in their vitamin activity, nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological effects (lipid modifying effects) as <b>niacin.</b> Nicotinamide does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing. As the precursor for NAD and NADP, <b>niacin</b> is also involved in DNA repair.|$|E
25|$|Though {{treatment}} with <b>niacin</b> {{does little to}} alter the effects of Alzheimer's dementia, <b>niacin</b> intake from foods is inversely associated with the disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Niacin</b> (vitamin B3) is also {{believed}} to prevent dementia as research shows {{those who have}} the highest levels of <b>niacin</b> in their blood, are believed to have the lowest risk of developing dementia or having cognitive decline. <b>Niacin</b> is involved with DNA synthesis and repair and also neural cell signaling, it improves circulation and reduces cholesterol levels. In order for <b>niacin</b> to {{have a positive effect on}} the brain, it is recommended that patients have 100 to 300mg per day.|$|E
25|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet {{may have}} similar response to taking <b>niacin</b> (lowered LDL and increased HDL) through beta-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body, coupling the <b>niacin</b> receptor (HM74A).|$|E
25|$|<b>Niacin</b> is {{sometimes}} used {{in addition to}} other lipid-lowering medication. Systematic reviews do not find that taking <b>niacin</b> affected either cardiovascular disease or risk of death in those already taking a statin, in spite of raising HDL cholesterol. <b>Niacin</b> alone appears to reduce the rate of cardiovascular events as well as coronary or cardiovascular deaths.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, some {{individuals}} believed that vitamin deficiencies caused mental illness. Psychiatrists Humphry Osmond and Abram Hoffer gave people having acute schizophrenic episodes {{high doses of}} <b>niacin,</b> while William Kaufman used niacinamide. While <b>niacin</b> has no known efficacy in psychiatric disease, the use of <b>niacin</b> in combination with statins and other medical therapies {{has become one of}} several medical treatments for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Most of the <b>niacin</b> in mature {{cereal grains}} is present as niacytin, which is <b>niacin</b> {{bound up in}} a complex with {{hemicellulose}} which is nutritionally unavailable. In mature corn this may be up to 90% of the total <b>niacin</b> content. The preparation method of nixtamalization using the whole dried corn kernel made this <b>niacin</b> nutritionally available and reduced the chance of developing pellagra. Niacytin is concentrated in the aleurone and germ layers which are removed by milling. The milling and degerming of corn {{in the preparation of}} cornmeal became feasible with the development of the Beall degerminator which was originally patented in 1901 and was used to separate the grit from the germ in corn processing. However this process of degermination reduces the <b>niacin</b> content of the cornmeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{high doses}} of <b>niacin</b> used to improve the lipid profile {{have been shown to}} elevate blood sugar by 5-10%, thereby {{worsening}} diabetes mellitus. <b>Niacin</b> therapy increases the risk of new-onset diabetes by approximately 34%.|$|E
25|$|Fortified {{breakfast cereals}} have {{among the highest}} <b>niacin</b> {{contents}} (more than 20mg per 100 grams). Whole grain flours, such as from wheat, rice, barley or corn, and pasta have <b>niacin</b> contents {{in a range of}} 310mg per 100 grams.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{clinical}} symptoms, blood {{level of}} tryptophan or urinary metabolites such as 2-pyridone/N-methylniacinamide ratio <2 or NAD/NADP ratio in {{red blood cells}} {{could be used to}} diagnose pellagra. Diagnosis could be confirmed after rapid improvements in the symptoms in patients using high doses of <b>niacin</b> (250–500nbsp&mg/day) or <b>niacin</b> enriched food.|$|E
25|$|A {{prescription}} extended release <b>niacin,</b> Niaspan, has a {{film coating}} that delays {{release of the}} <b>niacin,</b> resulting in an absorption {{over a period of}} 8–12 hours. The extended release formulations generally reduce vasodilation and flushing side effects, but increase the risk of hepatotoxicity compared to the immediate release forms.|$|E
25|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values (DRV), with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 1.6 mg <b>niacin</b> per megajoule (MJ) of energy consumed. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 238.8 kcal, an adult consuming 2388 calories should be consuming 16 mg <b>niacin.</b> This is comparable to U.S. RDAs. The <b>niacin</b> UL is set at 10mg/day, which is much less than the U.S. value. The UL applies to <b>niacin</b> as a supplement consumed as one dose, and in intended to avoid the skin flush reaction. This explains why the PRI can be higher than the UL.|$|E
25|$|<b>Niacin</b> and {{niacinamide}} {{are used}} for prevention and treatment of pellagra.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Conrad Elvehjem, a {{biochemistry}} {{professor at}} the University of Wisconsin-Madison, showed that the vitamin <b>niacin</b> cured pellagra (manifested as black tongue) in dogs. Later studies by Dr. Tom Spies, Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper established that <b>niacin</b> also cured pellagra in humans, for which Time Magazine dubbed them its 1938 Men of the Year in comprehensive science.|$|E
25|$|<b>Niacin</b> also is {{proved to}} {{increase}} the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
25|$|Several {{thousand}} tons of <b>niacin</b> {{are manufactured}} each year, starting from 3-methylpyridine.|$|E
25|$|Severe <b>niacin</b> {{deficiency}} typically {{manifests itself}} as the disease pellagra. Synthesis of B3 from tryptophan involves vitamin B2 and B6, so deficiencies in either of these nutrients can lead to <b>niacin</b> deficiency. An excess of leucine, an essential amino acid, in the diet can also interfere with tryptophan conversion and subsequently result in a B3 deficiency.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{nutritional}} {{benefits of}} nixtamalization {{arise from the}} alkaline processing involved. These conditions convert corn's bound <b>niacin</b> to free <b>niacin,</b> making it available for absorption into the body, thus preventing pellagra. Alkalinity also reduces {{the amount of the}} protein zein available to the body, which improves the balance among essential amino acids, although the overall amount of protein is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Hyperuricemia {{is another}} {{side effect of}} taking {{high-dose}} <b>niacin</b> and may exacerbate gout.|$|E
25|$|Mild <b>niacin</b> {{deficiency}} {{has been}} shown to slow metabolism, causing decreased tolerance to cold.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B3, {{also known}} as <b>niacin,</b> {{includes}} both nicotinamide as well as nicotinic acid, both of which function in many biological oxidization and reduction reactions within the body. These functions include the biochemical degradation of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. <b>Niacin</b> is also involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, which are known mediators of brain biochemistry, and in effect, of cognitive function.|$|E
25|$|Sufficient <b>niacin</b> intake {{is either}} {{obtained}} from diet, or synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Niacin</b> {{also appears}} to upregulate brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression.|$|E
