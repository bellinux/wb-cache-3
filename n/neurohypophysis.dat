25|$|In the hypothalamus, {{oxytocin}} {{is made in}} magnocellular neurosecretory {{cells of}} the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and is stored in Herring bodies at the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the posterior lobe (<b>neurohypophysis)</b> of the pituitary gland. These axons (likely, but dendrites have not been ruled out) have collaterals that innervate neurons in the nucleus accumbens, a brain structure where oxytocin receptors are expressed. The endocrine effects of hormonal oxytocin and the cognitive or behavioral effects of oxytocin neuropeptides {{are thought to be}} coordinated through its common release through these collaterals. Oxytocin is also produced by some neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that project {{to other parts of the}} brain and to the spinal cord. Depending on the species, oxytocin receptor-expressing cells are located in other areas, including the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.|$|E
2500|$|Peptide hormones have {{important}} influences upon the hypothalamus, {{and to do}} so they must pass through the blood–brain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective blood–brain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules. [...] Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the <b>neurohypophysis</b> and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite. They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin and relaxin, each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Neurons in the OVLT and SFO project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas. The circumventricular organs may also be the site of action of interleukins to elicit both fever and ACTH secretion, via effects on paraventricular neurons.|$|E

50|$|The {{inferior}} hypophysial artery is {{an artery}} supplying the <b>neurohypophysis</b> of the pituitary gland. It is {{a branch of}} the cavernous carotid artery (internal carotid artery).|$|E
50|$|The neurohypophysial hormones form {{a family}} of {{structurally}} and functionally related peptide hormones. Their main representatives are oxytocin and vasopressin. They are named for being secreted by the <b>neurohypophysis,</b> i.e. the posterior pituitary gland (hypophysis refers to the pituitary gland), itself a neuronal projection from the hypothalamus.|$|E
50|$|A few sources {{include the}} pars {{intermedia}} {{as part of}} the posterior lobe, but this is a minority view. It is based upon the gross anatomical separation of the posterior and anterior pituitary along the cystic remnants of Rathke's pouch, causing the pars intermedia to remain attached to the <b>neurohypophysis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also known}} as neurohypophyseal {{diabetes}} insipidus, referring to the posterior pituitary (<b>neurohypophysis),</b> which is supplied by the hypothalamus in the brain. This condition has only polyuria in common with diabetes and although not mutually exclusive, with most typical cases, the name diabetes insipidus is a misleading misnomer. A better name might be [...] "hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal ADH deficiency".|$|E
50|$|The {{pituitary}} is {{subdivided into}} two principal lobes, the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary (also {{known as the}} <b>neurohypophysis.</b> Each one functions as a separate endocrine organ. The posterior pituitary is made up by a stalk, the infundibulum, which consists of axonal projections that extend from the hypothalamus. It {{is located in the}} sella turcica of the sphenoid bone {{at the base of the}} skull.|$|E
50|$|A major {{organ of}} the {{endocrine}} system, the anterior pituitary (also called the adenohypophysis or pars anterior), is the glandular, anterior lobe that together with the posterior lobe (posterior pituitary, or the <b>neurohypophysis)</b> makes up the pituitary gland (hypophysis). The anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes including stress, growth, reproduction and lactation. Proper functioning of the anterior pituitary and of the organs it regulates can often be ascertained via blood tests that measure hormone levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{posterior}} lobe (the neural lobe or <b>neurohypophysis)</b> of the {{pituitary gland}} is not, despite its name, a true gland. The posterior lobe contains axons of neurons that extend from the hypothalamus {{to which it}} is connected via the pituitary stalk. The hormones vasopressin and oxytocin, produced by the neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, are stored in the posterior lobe and released from axon endings (dendrites) within the lobe.|$|E
50|$|In addition, each Herring body also {{contains}} ATP and {{a type of}} neurophysin. Neurophysins are binding proteins, {{of which there are}} two types: neurophysin I and neurophysin II, which bind to oxytocin and ADH, respectively. Neurophysin and its hormone become a complex considered a single protein and stored in the <b>neurohypophysis.</b> Upon stimulation by the hypothalamus, secretory granules release said hormones into the bloodstream. Fibers from supraoptic nuclei are concerned with ADH secretion; paraventricular nuclei with oxytocin.|$|E
50|$|Secretin {{is found}} in the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the {{hypothalamus}} and along the neurohypophysial tract to <b>neurohypophysis.</b> During increased osmolality, it is released from the posterior pituitary. In the hypothalamus, it activates vasopressin release. It is also needed to carry out the central effects of angiotensin II. In the absence of secretin or its receptor in the gene knockout animals, central injection of angiotensin II was unable to stimulate water intake and vasopressin release.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the very}} low {{prevalence}} of the disease, and the wide array of symptoms associated with it, the exact biochemical pathology of the disease is still being researched. There are several studies that focus on {{different aspects of the}} disease to try to find its exact cause and expression. One study done examined the specific oral features in one patient. Another study found abnormalities in the brain, such a corpus callosum dysgenesis, an under developed anterior pituitary and a brain stalk with an ectopic <b>neurohypophysis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{posterior}} pituitary (or <b>neurohypophysis)</b> is {{the posterior}} lobe of the pituitary gland {{which is part}} of the endocrine system. The posterior pituitary is not glandular as is the anterior pituitary. Instead, it is largely a collection of axonal projections from the hypothalamus that terminate behind the anterior pituitary, and serve as a site for the secretion of neurohypophysial hormones (oxytocin and vasopressin) directly into the blood. [...] The hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system is composed of the hypothalamus (the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus), posterior pituitary, and these axonal projections.|$|E
50|$|Vasotocin is an {{oligopeptide}} homologous to oxytocin and vasopressin {{found in}} all non-mammalian vertebrates (including birds, fishes, and amphibians) and possibly in mammals during the fetal stage of development. Arginine vasotocin (AVT), a hormone produced by neurosecretory cells within the posterior pituitary gland (<b>neurohypophysis)</b> of the brain, is a major endocrine regulator of water balance and osmotic homoeostasis and is involved in social and sexual behavior in non-mammalian vertebrates. In mammals, {{it appears to have}} biological properties similar to those of oxytocin (stimulating reproductive tract contraction as in egg laying or birth) and vasopressin (diuretic and antidiuretic effects). It has been found to have effects on the regulation of REM sleep. Evidence for the existence of endogenous vasotocin in mammals is limited and no mammalian gene encoding vasotocin has been confirmed.|$|E
50|$|In {{vertebrate}} anatomy, the pituitary gland, or hypophysis, is an {{endocrine gland}} {{about the size}} of a pea and weighing 0.5 g in humans. It is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. The hypophysis rests upon the hypophysial fossa of the sphenoid bone in the center of the middle cranial fossa and is surrounded by a small bony cavity (sella turcica) covered by a dural fold (diaphragma sellae). The anterior pituitary (or adenohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that regulates several physiological processes (including stress, growth, reproduction, and lactation). The intermediate lobe synthesizes and secretes melanocyte-stimulating hormone. The posterior pituitary (or <b>neurohypophysis)</b> is a lobe of the gland that is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence via a small tube called the pituitary stalk (also called the infundibular stalk or the infundibulum).|$|E

5000|$|Oxytocin and {{vasopressin}} (also called anti-diuretic hormone), the two peptide hormones of {{the posterior}} pituitary gland (the <b>neurohypophysis),</b> are secreted from the nerve endings of magnocellular neuroendocrine cells into the systemic circulation. The cell {{bodies of the}} oxytocin and vasopressin neurons are in the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus, respectively, and the electrical activity of these neurons is regulated by afferent synaptic inputs from other brain regions. By contrast, the hormones of the anterior pituitary gland (the adenohypophysis) are secreted from endocrine cells that, in mammals, are not directly innervated, yet the secretion of these hormones (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and growth hormone) remains {{under the control of}} the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the anterior pituitary gland via releasing factors and release-inhibiting factors; these are blood-borne substances [...] means via bloodstream and not by the lymphatic system nor air, nor any other modes of transport released by hypothalamic neurons into blood vessels at the base of the brain, at the median eminence. These vessels, the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal vessels, carry the hypothalamic factors to the anterior pituitary, where they bind to specific receptors on the surface of the hormone-producing cells.|$|E
