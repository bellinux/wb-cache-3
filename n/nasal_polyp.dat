25|$|Sporoidiobolus salmonicolor is a yeast-like fungus in the Basidiomycota more {{commonly}} {{known by the}} name of its asexual yeast-like state, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. It is generally considered a Biosafety Risk Group 1 fungus; however isolates of S.salmonicolor have been recovered from cerebrospinal fluid, infected skin, a <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp,</b> lymphadenitis and a case of endophthalmitis. It has also been reported in AIDS-related infections. The fungus exists predominantly in the asexual state as a unicellular, haploid yeast yet this species can sometimes produce a sexual state when conjugation of compatible yeast cells occurs. The asexual form consists of a characteristic, pink, ballistosporic yeast. Ballistoconidia are borne from slender extensions of the cell known as sterigma, and are forcibly ejected into the air upon maturity. Levels of airborne yeast cells peak during the night and are abundant in areas of decaying leaves and grains. Three varieties of Sporobolomyces salmonicolor have been described; S.salmonicolor var. albus, S.salmonicolor var. fischerii, and S.salmonicolor var. salmoneus.|$|E

40|$|Background: Nasal {{polyposis}} is {{a common}} problem in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. Since allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) can present with unilateral or bilateral <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps,</b> {{it is important to}} be aware of the prevalence of AFS in patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps.</b> Patients and Methods: The medical records of 91 patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> admitted for functional endo [...] scopic sinus surgery were reviewed. The diagnosis of AFS was considered if histopathology showed the presence of eosinophillic mucin-containing hyphae. The following data were collected: presence of associated asthma, IgE levels, grading of CT scan findings, and operative details. Results: Histopathological diagnosis was positive for AFS in 11 of 91 patients 12. 1 &#x 0025;. There was a highly significant statistical difference in IgE levels between patients suffering AFS and chronic hyperplastic rhinosinusitis with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> (P&# 60;. 0001).

Eosinophils comprises more than 60 % of the cell population. Activated T cells, mast cells and plasma cells are also increased compared with the normal nasal mucosa. The stroma has numerous mediators, including cytokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, and immunoglobulins. Both Th 1 and Th 2 types of cytokines are upregulated independent of the atopic status. An increased production of GM-CSF, IL 5, RANTES and eotaxin can contrib-ute to chronic eosinophilic inflammation by regulating the migration, survival and activation of eosinophils.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> are {{a common}} disease, the {{etiology}} and pathogenesis of which are still unclear. For diagnosis, a nasal endoscope is essential, while for follow-up treatment, a reliable score system is necessary. The existing score systems consist of few score steps and measure only large changes in polyp size. The question is whether a score system with a continuous scale will provide more reproducible, and sensitive results. The epidemiology of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> {{in the general population}} is not known. The main aims of this work were; to develop a sensitive and reliable method for assessing the size and extension of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps,</b> and to determine the prevalence of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> in a general population. Methods: Different score systems, three newly developed and two established, were compared with regard to their ability to assess polyp size and detect changes during medical treatment. A total of 150 adult patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> were investigated in these studies. The new score systems used were: lateral imaging (LI), assessment of <b>polyp</b> obstruction, and <b>nasal</b> airway patency. The established score systems were ad modum Lildholdt et al. and ad modum Lund and Mackay. The score systems were compared with the patients' subjective symptoms. A nasal endoscope was used to get a good view of polyps in the entire nasal cavity. One investigator examined the patients twice, whereafter three otorhinolaryngologists examined 30 patients independently of each other, using the same technique and performing the investigations under the same conditions. Thereafter, the different methods of polyp staging were compared. The sensitivity of LI in comparison with the Lildholdt et al. score system was tested by measuring early (i. e., within 14 days), and small, changes in polyp size during treatment with a topical corticosteroid. In the epidemiological study, 1, 900 adult subjects were randomly drawn from a small town register. Of these, 1, 387 were examined with a nasal endoscope, tested for smell impairment, and questioned with regard to relevant medical conditions. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) was investigated among individuals diagnosed with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> and compared with that of individuals without <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> and patients with symptomatic <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps.</b> Results: The reproducibility of all five score systems was good and the reliability between different investigators was significantly better for score systems LI, Lildholdt et al., and assessment of polyp obstruction than for the other two. The LI was significantly more sensitive and better able than the Lildholdt et al. score system to detect early changes in polyp size. The symptom score showed significant improvement after 3 days. The prevalence of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> in adults was 2. 7 %, and was more frequent among men and asthmatics, as well as with increasing age. The individuals with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> experienced the same frequency of asthma and reduced sense of smell as patients, and had impaired HRQL. Conclusion: Lateral imaging, evaluated by nasal endoscopy, has been shown to have good reproducibility and to be a reliable method for detecting early changes in polyp size. The prevalence of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> was 2. 7 % in the general adult population studied. <b>Nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> lead to reduced HRQL. <b>Nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> are a manifestation of a mucosal disease including both the upper and the lower airways...|$|R

A prospective analysis of 90 patients of chronic rhinosinusitis who were classified into two groups depending on presence and absence of nasal polyps was performed in the study. The two groups were evaluated using subjective (patient complaints) and objective (computed tomography scan and endoscopy scores) criteria.

The patients of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> group presented with increased severity of symptoms of nasal blockage, nasal discharge and reduced sense of smell as compared to the chronic rhinosinusitis group who had significantly higher presentation of headache and facial pain.

Though the universal rationale of management by adequate drainage and ventilation of sinus is similar in both groups, there is a reduction in both objective and subjective scores during 1  year follow up in the <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> group...|$|E
40|$|Background: Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{is known to}} be {{associated}} with the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). VEGF is produced by a variety of cells including fibroblasts. It was recently reported that prostaglandin (PG) E 2 induces VEGF release by <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> fibroblasts. However, little is known regarding possible regulation of VEGF by other PGs. We have reported that molecules that regulate PGD 2 metabolism play roles in the pathogenesis of CRS including in local eosinophilia and type 2 cytokine production. In the present study, we sought to determine whether PGD 2 regulates VEGF release by <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> fibroblasts. Methods: <b>Nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> fibroblasts were established from nasal polyps. These fibroblasts were stimulated with serial dilutions of PGD 2 or PGD 2 receptor (DP/CRTH 2) -selective agonists in the presence or absence of receptor-selective antagonists. The concentration of VEGF in the culture supernatants was determined using ELISA. Results: 5  μM of PGD 2 significantly induced VEGF release by <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> fibroblasts. VEGF release was also obtained by stimulation with a DP receptor-selective, but not with a CRTH 2 receptor-selective agonist. In addition, PGD 2 -induced VEGF release was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment with DP receptor-selective antagonists. In contrast, pre-treatment with a CRTH 2 receptor-selective antagonist significantly enhanced PGD 2 -induced VEGF release. Conclusions: PGD 2 stimulates VEGF production via DP but not CRTH 2 receptors in <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> fibroblasts...|$|E
40|$|Background: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of severe chronic airway disease, such as nasal polyps. However the mechanisms underlying the initiation of damage and/or invasion of the nasal mucosa by S. aureus are not clearly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between S. aureus and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) in the invasion of the nasal mucosa and <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> tissue. Methodology/Principal Findings: Inferior turbinate and <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> samples were cultured and infected with either HSV 1 alone, S. aureus alone or a combination of both. Both in turbinate mucosa and <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> tissue, HSV 1, with or without S. aureus incubation, led to focal infection of outer epithelial cells within 48 h, and loss or damage of the epithelium and invasion of HSV 1 into the lamina propria within 72 h. After pre-infection with HSV 1 for 24 h or 48 h, S. aureus was able to pass the basement membrane and invade the mucosa. Epithelial damage scores were significantly higher for HSV 1 and S. aureus co-infected explants compared with control explants or S. aureus only-infected explants, and significantly correlated with HSV 1 -invasion scores. The epithelial damage scores of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> tissues were significantly higher than those of inferior turbinate tissues upon HSV 1 infection. Consequently, invasion scores of HSV 1 of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyp</b> tissues wer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Decreased {{infiltration}} of Foxp 3 + T regulatory cell (Treg) {{is considered to}} be critical for the Th 1 /Th 2 dysregulation of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps,</b> while the cellular mechanism underlying Foxp 3 + Treg insufficiency is currently not well defined. Methods We attempted to investigate the tissue expression of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (pmTOR) and {{infiltration of}} Foxp 3 + Tregs in 28 <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> and 16 controls by histological staining. We also evaluated the effects of blocking the mTOR signaling pathway with rapamycin on T cell phenotype selection and Foxp 3 +CD 4 + Tregs expansion in a tissue culture system. Results Significantly increased infiltration of pmTOR+ inflammatory cells and decreased infiltration of Foxp 3 +CD 4 + Tregs into <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> was observed, with an inverse association. In the tissue culture system, we detected significantly elevated Foxp 3 expression and IL- 10 production, as well as an increased percentage of Foxp 3 + Tregs in <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> after blocking the mTOR signaling pathway with rapamycin. Conclusion Here we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the mTOR signaling pathway is associated with Foxp 3 + Tregs insufficiency in <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps.</b> Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway may be helpful for enhancement of Foxp 3 + Treg expansion, as well as modulation of T cell phenotype imbalances in <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Chronic rhinosinusitis with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> often {{represents}} a chronic severe inflammatory {{disease of the}} upper airways and {{may serve as a}} model for lower airway diseases such as late-onset intrinsic asthma. Enterotoxins derived from Staphylococcus aureus have been implicated in the pathophysiology of <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> as disease-modifying factors; recent findings using therapeutic proof-of-concept approaches support this hypothesis. Recent findings <b>Nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> (chronic rhinosinusitis with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps)</b> are characterized by a T-helper- 2 dominated cytokine pattern that includes interleukin- 5 and formation of immunoglobulin E. This is in contrast to chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps, which exhibits T-helper- 1 biased cytokine release. It is now evident that the cytokine environment is decisive regarding the impact of S. aureus derived enterotoxins, which function as superantigens. S. aureus enterotoxin B further shifts the cytokine pattern in <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> toward T-helper- 2 cytokines (increases greater than twofold for interleukin- 2, interleukin- 4 and interleukin- 5), but it disfavours the T-regulatory cytokines interleukin- 10 and transforming growth factor-beta(1). Furthermore, S. aureus derived enterotoxins influence local immunoglobulin synthesis and induce polyclonal immunoglobulin E production, which may contribute to severe inflammation via activation of mast cells. Summary From this new understanding of chronic rhinosinusitis with <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps,</b> new therapeutic approaches emerge such as anti-interleukin- 5, anti-immunoglobulin E, and antibiotic treatment. These may enlarge the nonsurgical armentarium...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> are {{inflammatory}} proliferative tumors {{arising from}} the mucosa of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Although many cases concerning <b>nasal</b> <b>polyps</b> have been reported, those involving external nasal deformities are rare.
