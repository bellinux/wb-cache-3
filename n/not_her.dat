The lyrics reference the events Duff experienced in the years leading to the album's release, and the album's songs contain influences {{of rock and roll}} and hip hop music.|$|E

Dunderdale received a score of 71.4 {{out of a possible}} 100.0, though the report did mention that her strong performance with regards to government spending was in part due to the province’s significant economic growth and <b>not</b> <b>her</b> ability to restrain growth in spending.|$|E

5|$|Back in Zone Three, Al•Ith {{finds that}} her people have {{forgotten}} her, and her sister, Murti• {{has taken over}} as queen. Disturbed by the changes she sees in Al•Ith, Murti• exiles her to the frontier of Zone Two. Al•Ith, drawn by its allure, tries to enter Zone Two, but finds an unworldly and inhospitable place and is told by invisible people that it is <b>not</b> <b>her</b> time yet. At the frontier of Zone Five, Ben Ata reluctantly marries Vahshi, a tribal leader of a band of nomads who terrorise the inhabitants of her zone.

He also slowly wins over Vahshi's confidence and persuades her to stop plundering Zone Five.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was <b>not</b> <b>her</b> way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E

5|$|Chris is {{suspended}} from school {{when he gets}} into a fight with a rival basketball captain. When his parents {{find out about the}} fight and that he is gay, they throw Chris out and he stays with Summer. She later breaks down and reveals that she is struggling with his sexuality.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is <b>not</b> <b>her</b> authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
