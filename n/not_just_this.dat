25|$|Mixon had an {{extensive}} criminal history. Beginning at age 13, {{he was arrested}} multiple times for battery, and by age 20 was serving a Corcoran state prison sentence following a felony conviction for {{assault with a deadly}} weapon and armed robbery in San Francisco. After he was paroled, Mixon went in and out of prison. When the shootings happened, he was living in East Oakland at his grandmother's house and was wanted on a no-bail arrest warrant for violating his current parole conditions. On March 20, 2009, the day before the shootings, the Oakland Police Department learned that Mixon was linked by DNA to the February 5, 2009, rape of a twelve-year-old girl who was dragged off the street at gunpoint in the East Oakland neighborhood where Mixon's sister lived. On May 4, 2009, a state laboratory confirmed <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> link, but also confirmed that Mixon robbed and raped two young women about seven hours before the shootings (see above). Investigators said that Mixon may have committed several other rapes during recent months, although no convictions or indictments had been secured before his death. Had Mixon been arrested for his parole violation, he would have faced at most six months in prison; if convicted of rape, he faced a life sentence.|$|E

Dos Santos called it [...] "arguably the best episode of Glee, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> season but {{in the history of}} the series", while Ausiello praised the episode as [...] "a standout hour". Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly also viewed the episode in advance, and was similarly impressed; he wrote that it was [...] "one of the series' best episodes ever".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{nominated}} for a Writers Guild Award in 1991. Holly E. Ordway for DVD Talk Review commented positively on <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> episode, but the whole of the first season, saying, [...] "What's not to like about an episode like 'The Stakeout,' in which (among other things) we are witness to the invention of George's alter ego, Art Vandelay (and his import/export business)?" [...] Mary Kay Shilling and Mike Flaherty of Entertainment Weekly also liked the episode but had some doubts, saying it was, [...] "A painfully realistic take on the lovers-to-friends transition that should have been more comically fruitful." ...|$|E

500|$|The Marble Index was {{produced}} during a little-studied period of Nico's life. For The Quietuss Matthew Lindsay, [...] "the liminal drift {{of these years}} only emphasizes the music's amorphous moorings and lack of precedent." [...] Nico approached Danny Fields around the summer of 1968 {{with the desire to}} make an album and prove herself artistically. Resentful of her beauty, she radically changed her image – dyeing her hair red and wearing black clothes in an effort to distance herself from what had made her a popular fashion model. John Cale said, [...] "She hated the idea of being blonde and beautiful, and in some ways she hated being a woman, because she figured all her beauty had brought her was grief... So The Marble Index was an opportunity for her to prove she was a serious artist, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> kind of blonde bombshell." [...] Nico already had the title for the album in mind from The Prelude, William Wordsworth's magnum opus; in it, he contemplates a statue of Isaac Newton [...] "with his prism and silent face / The marble index of a mind for ever / Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone." [...] Asked about the significance of this Wordsworth quote, Nico replied: [...] "I sometimes find a little of my own poetry in other poets, yes. Incidentally, or accidentally." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of its {{depiction}} of teenage violence, A Clockwork Orange {{became one of}} the most controversial films of the decade, and part of an ongoing debate about violence and its glorification in cinema. It received an X-rated certificate upon release, just before Christmas in 1971, though many critics saw much of the violence depicted in the film as satirical, and less violent than Straw Dogs, which had been released a month earlier. Kubrick personally pulled the film from release in the United Kingdom after receiving death threats following a series of copycat crimes based on the film; it was thus completely unavailable legally in the UK until after Kubrick's death, and not re-released until 2000. John Trevelyan, the censor of the film, personally considered A Clockwork Orange to be [...] "perhaps the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I've ever seen, and believed it to present an [...] "intellectual argument rather than a sadistic spectacle" [...] in its {{depiction of}} violence, but acknowledged that many would not agree. Negative media hype over the film notwithstanding, A Clockwork Orange received four Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, and was named by the New York Film Critics Circle as the Best Film of 1971. After William Friedkin won Best Director for The French Connection that year, he told the press: [...] "Speaking personally, I think Stanley Kubrick is the best American film-maker of the year. In fact, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> year, but the best, period".|$|E

2500|$|The fight itself {{left many}} fans disappointed. Forbes.com {{contributor}} Brian Goff called it [...] "arguably, the least entertaining 'mega fight' in memory", attributing the disappointment to Mayweather's defense-oriented strategy, which is atypical of top boxers. [...] The New York Times {{felt that the}} bout was [...] "far from electrifying and had some fans grumbling about Mayweather’s methodical defensive style". Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Dwyre felt that the fight was [...] "as compelling as the 405 freeway at 8 a.m.". Regarding Pacquiao's undisclosed shoulder injury, he called the entire situation very damaging to boxing, accusing the fight's promoters of allowing the fight {{to go on for}} monetary reasons, and potentially alienating fans. Dwyre {{went on to say that}} [...] "This was billed the Fight of the Century. As the Wall Street Journal so aptly put it, it's good that we have 85 years left to top it."

Howard felt excited to play in his hometown, citing an affinity for the tactics of coach Mike Budenholzer and saying that [...] "I'm looking forward to <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> season, but finishing my career at home.” He made his debut for the Hawks in their season opener on October 27 against the Washington Wizards. In 30 minutes of action, he recorded 11 points and 19 rebounds in a 114–99 win. Howard posted the most rebounds for anyone in their Atlanta debut, breaking the mark of 18 that Shareef Abdur-Rahim set October 30, 2001. On November 2, he recorded a season-high 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 123–116 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Hawks started the season 9–2 before dropping 10 of the next 11 games.

2500|$|The writers {{found they}} needed another {{character}} to play off of Cave during his recordings; instead of hiring a voice actor {{for a few}} lines, they economized by reusing McLain to play Caroline, Cave's assistant. This led naturally to providing a backstory {{for the creation of}} GLaDOS, who is revealed in-game to be based on Caroline's personality. This later led the writers to develop a full story arc for GLaDOS where she would come to recall her past, learn from it to solve the dilemma and then subsequently delete it and reset herself. The designers wanted to start GLaDOS' role in Portal 2 off with her being [...] "incredibly upset at [...] ". They felt however that this would [...] "get old pretty quick" [...] if they did not put her [...] "into another space". They accomplished this through a combination of her anger with Wheatley and her conflict with her past life as Caroline. Through the course of the game's events, GLaDOS' personality shifts significantly; however, at the end, she resets her personality to her original personality, an action Wolpaw sums up as [...] "explicitly reject it" [...] and saying [...] "You know what? Done." [...] While they wanted to give players the sense that they had defeated GLaDOS, they felt that they should not have players fight her as a boss battle; as a result, they had her let Chell go due to the reasoning that Chell was too difficult for her to handle. Writer Jay Pinkerton stated that GLaDOS was an exemplification of a villain who can go from [...] "genuinely tender" [...] to [...] "genuinely villainous" [...] and that [...] "she’s <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> moustache-twirling villain". He also stated that she has a [...] "passive-aggressive nature" [...] and will never [...] "overtly attack, it’s always these subtle mind games". The designers also intended to make it vague whether or not GLaDOS was {{under the control of the}} machine that she was attached to. Wolpaw also called her [...] "passive aggressive" [...] as well as [...] "mildly sarcastic" [...] and compared her to The Sopranos character Livia Soprano.|$|E

Could it be that she had discerned and interpreted those renascent feelings even then stirring within me, and of which I myself was as yet scarcely conscious? At this moment, fortunately for me, the women rose; the men remained to smoke; and Scherer, as they discussed matters of finance, became himself again. I joined in the conversation, but I was thinking of those instants when in flashes of understanding my eyes had met Nancy's; instants in which I was lifted out of my humdrum, deadly serious self {{and was able to}} look down objectively upon the life I led, the life we all led--and Nancy herself; to see with her the comic irony of it all. Nancy had the power to give me this exquisite sense of detachment that must sustain her. And was it <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>this</b> sustenance she could give that I needed? For want of it I was hardening, crystallizing, growing blind to the joy and variety of existence. Nancy could have saved me; she brought it home to me that I needed salvation.... I was struck by another thought; in spite of our separation, in spite of her marriage and mine, she was still nearer to me--far nearer--than any other being.|$|E
