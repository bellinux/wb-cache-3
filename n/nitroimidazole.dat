25|$|Metronidazole {{is of the}} <b>nitroimidazole</b> class. It {{inhibits}} {{nucleic acid}} synthesis by disrupting the DNA of microbial cells. This function only occurs when metronidazole is partially reduced, and because this reduction usually happens only in anaerobic cells, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or aerobic bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Flagyl (metronidazole) is a <b>nitroimidazole</b> {{antibiotic}} medication used {{particularly for}} anaerobic bacteria and protozoa.

50|$|Under {{anaerobic}} conditions, the {{nitro group}} of <b>nitroimidazoles</b> {{is believed to}} be reduced by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase complex to create a reactive nitro radical species. The nitro radical can then either engage in other redox reactions directly or spontaneously give rise to a nitrite ion and imidazole radical instead. The initial reduction takes place because <b>nitroimidazoles</b> are better electron acceptors for ferredoxin than the natural substrates. In mammals, the principal mediators of electron transport are NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH, which have a more positive reduction potential and so will not reduce <b>nitroimidazoles</b> to the radical form. This limits the spectrum of activity of <b>nitroimidazoles</b> so that host cells and DNA are not also damaged. This mechanism has been well-established for 5-nitroimidazoles such as metronidazole, but it is unclear if the same mechanism can be expanded to 2-nitroimidazoles (including benznidazole).|$|R
25|$|Other {{antibiotics}} {{that may}} work include macrolides, lincosamides, <b>nitroimidazoles,</b> and penicillins.|$|R
25|$|Many natural products, {{especially}} alkaloids, {{contain the}} imidazole ring. These imidazoles share the 1,3-C3N2 ring but feature varied substituents. This ring system {{is present in}} important biological building blocks, such as histidine and the related hormone histamine. Many drugs contain an imidazole ring, such as certain antifungal drugs, the <b>nitroimidazole</b> series of antibiotics, and the sedative midazolam.|$|E
50|$|In {{treatment}} of amoebic liver abscess, chloroquine {{may be used}} instead of or {{in addition to other}} medications in the event of failure of improvement with metronidazole or another <b>nitroimidazole</b> within 5 days or intolerance to metronidazole or a <b>nitroimidazole.</b>|$|E

40|$|A reversed-phase {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic method with reductive mode electrochemical detection {{was developed}} for the determination of misonidazole and desmethylmisonidazole in plasma. A thin-layer amperometric detector with glassy carbon working electrode was used to detect the <b>nitroimidazoles</b> at a potential of - 0. 60 V. The calibration curves were linear. The within-day and day-to-day coefficients of variation were below 3 % for plasma misonidazole concentrations of 6 - 60 mg/ 1 and 1 - 15 mg/ 1 for desmethylmisonidazole. Electrochemical detection limits were between 2 and 4 pg, which is about 10 - 20 times lower than that obtained by detection at 323 nm. Limits of quantitation of the <b>nitroimidazoles</b> in plasma {{were in the order}} of 1 - 2 μg/l. Under the described conditions other <b>nitroimidazoles</b> and nitro compounds can also be detected with ultimate sensitivity by reductive mode electrochemical detection...|$|R

40|$|<b>Nitroimidazoles</b> exhibit high microbicidal activity, but mutagenic, {{genotoxic}} and cytotoxic properties {{have been}} attributed to the presence of the nitro group. However, we synthesised <b>nitroimidazoles</b> with activity against the trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi, but that were not genotoxic. Herein, <b>nitroimidazoles</b> (11 - 19) bearing different substituent groups were investigated for their potential induction of genotoxicity (comet assay) and mutagenicity (Salmonella/Microsome assay) and the correlations of these effects with their trypanocidal effect and with megazol were investigated. The compounds were designed to analyse the role played by the position of the nitro group in the imidazole nucleus (C- 4 or C- 5) and the presence of oxidisable groups at N- 1 as an anion receptor group and the role of a methyl group at C- 2. <b>Nitroimidazoles</b> bearing NO 2 at C- 4 and CH 3 at C- 2 were not genotoxic compared to those bearing NO 2 at C- 5. However, when there was a CH 3 at C- 2, the position of the NO 2 group had no influence on the genotoxic activity. Fluorinated compounds exhibited higher genotoxicity regardless of the presence of CH 3 at C- 2 or NO 2 at C- 4 or C- 5. However, in compounds 11 (2 -CH 3; 4 -NO 2; N-CH 2 OHCH 2 Cl) and 12 (2 -CH 3; 4 -NO 2; N-CH 2 OHCH 2 F), the fluorine atom had no influence on genotoxicity.

40|$|Tuberculosis {{continues}} to be a global health threat, making bicyclic <b>nitroimidazoles</b> an important new class of therapeutics. A deazaflavin-dependent nitroreductase (Ddn) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalyzes the reduction of <b>nitroimidazoles</b> such as PA- 824, resulting in intracellular release of lethal reactive nitrogen species. The N-terminal 30 residues of Ddn are functionally important but are flexible or access multiple conformations, preventing structural characterization of the full-length, enzymatically active enzyme. Several structures were determined of a truncated, inactive Ddn protein core with and without bound F 420 deazaflavin coenzyme as well as of a catalytically competent homolog from Nocardia farcinica. Mutagenesis studies based on these structures identified residues important for binding of F 420 and PA- 824. The proposed orientation of the tail of PA- 824 toward the N terminus of Ddn is consistent with current structure-activity relationship data...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} {{investigated the}} antimicrobial {{properties of the}} essential oil of Myrtus communis L. against clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori collected in the Institute of Microbiology of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, Italy. H. pylori is now a well-recognized cause of chronic active gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric carcinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue lymphomas or MALTomas, and its eradication is strongly recommended for patients with these diseases and those with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia. Current treatment for H. pylori infections includes an antisecretory agent plus {{two or more of}} the following antibiotics: amoxicillin, clarithromycin, <b>nitroimidazoles,</b> tetracycline and levofloxacin. Strains displaying primary resistance to <b>nitroimidazoles</b> and clarithromycin are being reported with increasing frequency throughout the world. Together with noncompliance, antibiotic resistance is a major cause of treatment failure in patients with these infections. For this reason, we assessed the effects of the essential oil of M. communis on the growth and survival of H. pylori...|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{resistance}} to antimicrobial agents {{is of particular}} concern {{because it is a}} major determinant in the failure of eradication regimens. Antimicrobial drug resistance has been reported to occur for <b>nitroimidazoles,</b> macrolides, fluoroquinolones, rifampin and tetracyclines. Resistance to <b>nitroimidazoles</b> is the most common, in the range of 30 - 40 % on the average in Europe while the overall prevalence rate of {{resistance to}} macrolides is lower, probably ranging between 2 - 10 % in most countries. Development of secondary (acquired) resistance to <b>nitroimidazoles</b> and to the macrolides usually occurs as a rule (> 70 - 100 %) in case of failed eradication therapy. Data available from several centres seems however to indicate that a significant shift towards increasing resistance to metronidazole and to the macrolides might have possibly occurred in many countries over the last years. Resistances to both metronidazole and to clarithromycin are the most significant ones because they influence the success of the treatments although this seems to be less marked and more dependent on the treatment regimens considered in the case of metronidazole resistance than in the setting of clarithromycin resistance. These differences may in part relate to methodological variations and to the inherent difficulties in assessing the susceptibility of H. pylori to metronidazole. It is possible that different resistance cut-off might also have to be considered for metronidazole depending on the treatment regimens administered. The mechanisms of resistance have been well defined for the macrolides and are beginning to be unraveled for the <b>nitroimidazoles.</b> In all cases, resistance of H. pylori to antimicrobial agent seems to be due to the development of single mutational events in chromosomal genes rather than to the acquisition of exogenous resistance genes. Owing to the restricted ability of microbiology laboratories with expertise in H. pylori culture and the lack of standardised methodology for susceptibility testing, H. pylori culture is not often performed routinely. It should however be considered after documented treatment failure or in patients from a geographic area or of an ethnic origin with higher likelihood of antimicrobial drug resistance. Likewise it is deemed very important to institute national and regional surveillance programs to follow the evolution of H. pylori resistance and to better adapt treatment regimens to changes in resistance patterns...|$|R

50|$|From the {{chemistry}} perspective, <b>nitroimidazole</b> antibiotics {{can be classified}} according {{to the location of}} the nitro functional group. 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert.

Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. <b>Nitroimidazole</b> antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose.
