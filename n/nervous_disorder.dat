5|$|An {{extension}} to battery {{was given in}} Wilkinson v Downton, where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no physical force being used. The defendant told the claimant (as a practical joke) {{that her husband had}} been seriously injured. As a result, the claimant suffered a <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder</b> and was thought to be suicidal for a time. It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause physical damage and does so. The principle was extended by Khorasandjian v Bush, in 1993, where there was a risk that the defendant's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage. The tort set down in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Riley's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} neurasthenia, a <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder,</b> and recommended {{long periods of}} rest as a cure. Riley remained ill {{for the rest of}} his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to Mexico in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, writing to his friends that he thought he could die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.|$|E
25|$|Goodfellow {{fell ill}} {{in the summer}} of 1910 with an illness which he had {{reportedly}} been exposed to during the Spanish–American War. He sought treatment from his sister Mary's husband, Dr. Charles W. Fish, in Los Angeles. Over the next six months his health gradually declined, and soon a <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder</b> prevented him from performing surgery. He was hospitalized for several weeks at the end of 1910 at Angelus Hospital in Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|Christie {{was asked}} {{to go to the}} hotel to {{identify}} his wife. She apparently did not recognise him until later, when she was recovering at her sister's house, Abney Hall. Christie issued a statement to the press saying that his wife was suffering from a <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder</b> and that she had complete loss of memory. The 1979 dramatic film Agatha was based on this event with Agatha and Archie portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave and Timothy Dalton. After this, the couple separated. Agatha went to live in a flat in London, and Christie remained at Styles so that he could sell it. In 1928, Christie married Nancy Neele in St George's, Hanover Square, with just a few close friends present at the ceremony.|$|E

500|$|Several critics praised Tucci's {{performance}} and his interactions with Shalhoub. Diane Werts wrote for Newsday, [...] "Which one's nuttier? It's a toss-up, and a fascinating {{one with the}} terrific Tucci as Shalhoub's emotional tango partner." [...] A reviewer for Times Colonist commented [...] "Watching Shalhoub pretend to be Monk {{pretending to be a}} suave, sophisticated sleuth is a delight in its own right. Watching Tucci take Monk's nervous tics to ridiculous extremes is even more of a delight, especially when its appears that Monk's <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder</b> may be catching."

500|$|Blackstone {{had long}} {{suffered}} from gout, and by November 1779 {{also had a}} <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder</b> which caused dizziness, obesity, {{high blood pressure and}} possibly diabetes. By 3 February 1780 he was too weak to write, and after [...] "some Days almost totally insensible", he died on 14 February. After a service conducted by Bishop Barrington on 22 February, Blackstone was buried in the family vault under St Peter's Church, Wallingford. His estate at his death was worth less than £15,000; therefore William Eden secured a £400 annual royal pension for Sarah Blackstone. The initial reaction to Blackstone's death was subdued, but in December 1780 the Fellows of All Souls College agreed that [...] "a Statue be erected to the memory of Sr W Blackstone deceased". Constructed by John Bacon, the life-sized statue of Blackstone in his judicial robes cost £539, and has rested in the Codrington Library since 1872. His brother-in-law, James Clitherow, also published two volumes of his law reports which added £1,287 to the estate, and in 1782 the Biographical History of Sir William Blackstone appeared.|$|E
500|$|Marx was {{afflicted by}} poor health (what he himself {{described}} as [...] "the wretchedness of existence") and various authors {{have sought to}} describe and explain it. His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterwards free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia {{in the head and}} rheumatic pains. A serious <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder</b> appeared in 1877 and protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics. The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, [...] "none of which are good for liver patients", but he also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount [...] "and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars". From 1863, Marx complained a lot about boils: [...] "These are very frequent with liver patients and {{may be due to the}} same causes". The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Marx's irritability is often found in liver patients: ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare body sway {{characteristics}} of the healthy elderly and the disordered elderly. The subjects were 38 healthy elderly and 24 disordered elderly with disequilibrium. The latter consisted of two groups : 12 elderly with vestibular organ or central <b>nervous</b> systems <b>disorder</b> (central <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders),</b> and 12 elderly with disorder in other systems (other disorders). The measurement device can calculate the center of foot pressure (CFP) of vertical loads from the values of three vertical load sensors, which are located {{at the corners of}} an isosceles triangle on a level surface. The data sampling frequency was 20 Hz. Four body sway factors with high reliability (unit time sway, frontback sway, left-right sway, and high frequency band power) were used to evaluate body sway. As compared with healthy people, central <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders</b> had larger unit time sway, high frequency band power, and left-right sway factors. Other disorders were larger in unit time sway and high frequency band power factors. Central <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders,</b> as compared with other disorders, had larger unit time sway and left-right sway factors. Disorders produced large and fast sway, and central <b>nervous</b> <b>disorders</b> in particular showed a marked sway in the left-right direction. The existence of disease influenced body sway more than decline in various functions related to posture control with aging, because even with the same elderly, disorders showed a larger body sway...|$|R

2500|$|As {{the most}} {{accomplished}} entomologist in the United States, Hentz was offered an honorary M.A. degree by the University of North Carolina in 1829. Yet, there were mixed feelings in the community about the renowned scholar. The community at the university was largely Presbyterian and did not approve of Hentz's Roman Catholic background, and was predisposed to [...] "ejaculatory prayer". The professor also had a severe <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder.</b> [...] Many of his students thought the study of French went against their religious principles. Consequently, Hentz was suspected of French revolutionary liberalism. Professor Hentz resigned from the university in 1833 after finding new academic regulations too restrictive. After Hentz left the university, French was completely dropped from the curriculum.|$|E
2500|$|Eliot, {{having been}} {{diagnosed}} with some form of <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder,</b> had been recommended rest, and applied for three months' leave from the bank where he was employed; the reason stated on his staff card was [...] "nervous breakdown". He and his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot, travelled to the coastal resort of Margate, Kent {{for a period of}} convalescence. While there, Eliot worked on the poem, and possibly showed an early version to Ezra Pound when, after a brief return to London, the Eliots travelled to Paris in November 1921 and stayed with him. Eliot was en route to Lausanne, Switzerland, for treatment by Doctor Roger Vittoz, who had been recommended to him by Ottoline Morrell; Vivienne was to stay at a sanatorium just outside Paris. In Hotel Ste. Luce (where Hotel Elite stands since 1938) in Lausanne, Eliot produced a 19-page version of the poem. He returned from Lausanne in early January 1922. Pound then made detailed editorial comments and significant cuts to the manuscript. Eliot later dedicated the poem to Pound.|$|E
2500|$|Crabbe's life at Parham was not happy. The {{former owner}} of the estate had been very popular for his hospitality, while Crabbe's {{lifestyle}} was much more quiet and private. His solace here was the company of his friend Dudley Long North and his fellow Whigs who lived nearby. Crabbe soon sent his two sons George and John to school in Aldeburgh. After four years at Parham, the Crabbes moved to a home in Great Glemham, Suffolk, placed at his disposal by Dudley North. The family remained here {{for four or five}} years. In 1796 their third son, Edmund {{died at the age of}} six. This was a heavy blow to Sarah who began suffering from a <b>nervous</b> <b>disorder</b> from which she never recovered. Crabbe, a devoted husband, tended her with exemplary care until her death in 1813. Robert Southey, writing about Crabbe to his friend, Neville White, in 1808, said [...] "It was not long before his wife became deranged, and when all this was told me by one who knew him well, five years ago, he was still almost confined in his own house, anxiously waiting upon this wife in her long and hopeless malady. A sad history! It is no wonder that he gives so melancholy a picture of human life." ...|$|E
