5000|$|A virtual <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> is a {{communication}} method to connect two computer applications directly using a virtual serial port. Unlike a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable, a virtual <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> is a software solution which emulates a hardware <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> within the computer. All {{features of a}} hardware <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> are available in a virtual <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> as well. There are some advantages to this: ...|$|E
50|$|If {{using the}} serial ports of the computer, a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable (or a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> adapter {{connected}} to a standard serial cable) must be used to connect {{each of the two}} computers to communicate properly. Such connection uses PPP protocol.|$|E
50|$|For instance, DOSBox {{has allowed}} older DOS games to use virtual <b>null</b> <b>modems.</b>|$|R
50|$|If a given cable {{will not}} allow a data connection, {{especially}} if a gender changer is in use, a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable may be necessary. Gender changers and <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cables are {{not mentioned in the}} standard, so there is no officially sanctioned design for them.|$|E
50|$|A <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> {{cable is}} a RS-232 serial cable where the {{transmit}} and receive lines are crosslinked. In some cables {{there are also}} handshake lines crosslinked. In many situations a straight-through serial cable is used, together with a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> adapter. The adapter contains the necessary crosslinks between the signals.|$|E

50|$|The PC version allowed head-to head dogfighting using a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable.|$|E
50|$|Originally, the RS-232 {{standard}} {{was developed and}} used for teleprinter machines which could {{communicate with each other}} over phone lines. Each teleprinter would be physically connected to its modem via an RS-232 connection and the modems could call each other to establish a remote connection between the teleprinters. If a user wished to connect two teleprinters directly without modems (<b>null</b> <b>modem)</b> then they would crosslink the connections. The term <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> may also refer to the cable or adapter itself as well as the connection method. <b>Null</b> <b>modem</b> cables were a popular method for transferring data between the early personal computers from the 1980s to the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{application of a}} <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> was to connect two teleprinter terminals directly without using modems. As the RS-232 standard was adopted by other types of equipment, designers needed to decide whether their devices would have DTE-like or DCE-like interfaces. When an application required that two DTEs (or two DCEs) needed {{to communicate with each}} other, then a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> was necessary.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Null</b> <b>modem</b> is a {{communication}} method to directly connect two DTEs (computer, terminal, printer, etc.) using an RS-232 serial cable. The name {{stems from the}} historical use of RS-232 cables to connect two teleprinter devices to two modems in order to communicate with one another; <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> communication refers to using a crossed-over RS-232 cable to connect the teleprinters directly to one another without the modems.|$|E
5000|$|A {{frequent}} use of a serial port is for a direct computer-to-computer connection. This requires an adapter called a <b>null</b> <b>modem,</b> which isn't actually a modem in the traditional sense, but rather a connector plug that simply crosses the complementary pins on two serial ports so the two sides can communicate. A <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> typically connects the DTR output of each computer to both the DCD and DSR inputs of the other.|$|E
50|$|The RS-232 {{standard}} is asymmetric {{as to the}} definitions of the two ends of the communications link, assuming that one end is a DTE {{and the other is}} a DCE, e.g. a modem. With a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> connection the transmit and receive lines are crosslinked. Depending on the purpose, sometimes also one or more handshake lines are crosslinked. Several wiring layouts are in use because the <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> connection is not covered by the RS-232 standard.|$|E
50|$|XTreme Racing can {{be played}} by up to four players on one computer, or with up to 8 players via a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> connection.|$|E
5000|$|Null modems were {{commonly}} used for file transfer between computers, or remote operation. Under the Microsoft Windows operating system, the direct cable connection can be used over a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> connection. The later versions of MS-DOS were shipped with the InterLnk program. Both pieces of software allow the mapping of a hard disk on one computer as a network drive on the other computer. No Ethernet hardware (such as a network interface card or a modem) is required for this. On the Commodore Amiga system, a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> connection was a common way of [...] between two machines.|$|E
50|$|This {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} games that allowed two players to play against each other over a modem (or <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable), and the first to run in 256 color MCGA mode.|$|E
50|$|If it is {{necessary}} to connect two DTE devices (or two DCE devices but that is more unusual) a cross-over <b>null</b> <b>modem,</b> in the form of either an adapter or a cable, must be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{player can}} compete against {{computer}} opponents or, {{at least on}} the Atari ST and Amiga versions, with another player using two computers connected via a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable, each with their own TV or monitor.|$|E
5000|$|Connecting two DTE devices {{together}} {{requires a}} <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> {{that acts as}} a DCE between the devices by swapping the corresponding signals (TD-RD, DTR-DSR, and RTS-CTS). This can be done with a separate device and two cables, or using a cable wired to do this. If devices require Carrier Detect, it can be simulated by connecting DSR and DCD internally in the connector, thus obtaining CD from the remote DTR signal. One feature of the Yost standard is that a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable is a [...] "rollover cable" [...] that just reverses pins 1 through 8 on one end to 8 through 1 on the other end.|$|E
5000|$|Below is a {{very common}} wiring diagram for a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable to {{interconnect}} two DTEs (e.g. two PCs) providing full handshaking, which works with software relying on proper assertion of the Data Carrier Detect (CD) signal: ...|$|E
5000|$|A Laplink cable {{can be seen}} as a {{parallel}} equivalent to a serial <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable. Because of the higher bandwidth of the parallel port versus the serial port, a LaplinkÂ® cable is able to shift data more quickly.|$|E
50|$|Another common example {{consists}} of Unix pseudoterminals (pty) which present a standard tty interface to user applications, including virtual serial controls. Two such ptys may easily be linked together by an application {{to form a}} virtual <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> communication path.|$|E
50|$|When {{a serial}} {{connection}} is made between two computers using a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> adapter, the DTR and the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) lines are typically paired. This allows {{both ends of}} the connection to sense when the connection is active.|$|E
50|$|When two devices, {{that are}} both DTE or both DCE, must be {{connected}} together without a modem or a similar media translator between them, a crossover cable must be used, e.g. a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> for RS-232 or an Ethernet crossover cable.|$|E
50|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based map-oriented {{military}} simulation game. Along with Modem Wars and Populous, {{it was one of}} {{the early}} games offering an online mode for real-time-matches via telecommunication networks. The original online-game was played via modem or <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> serial connection.|$|E
50|$|A serial {{cable is}} a cable used to {{transfer}} information between two devices using a serial communication protocol. The form of connectors {{depends on the}} particular serial port used. A cable wired for connecting two DTEs directly {{is known as a}} <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{compatibility}} {{issues and}} potential {{problems with a}} simple <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable, a solution was developed to trick the software into thinking there was handshaking available. However, the cable pin out merely loops back, and does not physically support the hardware flow control.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{does not}} address the possibility of connecting a DTE directly to a DTE, or a DCE to a DCE. <b>Null</b> <b>modem</b> cables can be used to achieve these connections, but these are not defined by the standard, and some such cables use different connections than others.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> is a {{computer}} communications adapter which {{may appear to be}} a gender changer, but it reroutes the wiring. The [...] "transmit" [...] pair from each side is routed into the [...] "receive" [...] pair of the other side, {{in the manner of a}} crossover cable.|$|E
5000|$|Battle Chess {{could be}} played against a human {{opponent}} (by hotseat, or by <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> or over a {{local area network}} in some ports) or against the computer's artificial intelligence (AI). The game has an opening library from over 30,000 moves (which were not available for the Commodore 64 and Apple II versions).|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} re-released in 1994 as Falcon Gold a {{compilation}} which included Art of the Kill video digitized on the CD collection, along with Operation Fighting Tiger and the announcement for Falcon 4.0. It noted for their early multiplayer support, as {{even the first}} version supported two players via a <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> serial port connection.|$|E
5000|$|The cable was {{introduced}} in 1983 with the [...] "LapLink" [...] software package, from Traveling Software, to allow fast data transfer between the early PCs running MS-DOS, giving much faster transfer rates than the traditional <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> serial cable. At the time, almost all PCs had a parallel printer port, but neither USB nor modern Ethernet was available.|$|E
50|$|Anno 1602 also {{features}} online and network play {{with up to}} 4 other players simultaneously. Because the network play is less sophisticated than that of modern games, lag and disconnections often occur. Despite this, Anno 1602 is still occasionally played by small groups of lan PC gamers, or by players over the internet. The game is also playable via <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> connection.|$|E
50|$|Two {{different}} types of devices are assumed on {{each end of the}} interconnecting cable for a case of simply adding DTE to the topology (e.g. to a hub, DCE), which also brings a less trivial case of interconnection of devices of the same type: DTE-DTE or DCE-DCE. Such cases need crossover cables, such as for the Ethernet or <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> for RS-232.|$|E
50|$|The {{scenarios}} can {{be played}} against the AI or in multiplayer games with up to eight players participating. The DOS version initially provided multiplayer games by <b>null</b> <b>modem</b> cable, modem or IPX, and Mac players could also play via TCP/IP or AppleTalk. Blizzard quickly released a facility to connect with Kali, which allows programs to access the Web by means of IPX.|$|E
