50|$|Although an {{international}} toy safety standard exists, nations {{around the world}} still create their own legislation and standards to address the issue.Current toy safety standards focus on design principles and rely on batch testing of samples to assure safety. As has {{been seen in the}} large scale recalls of 2007, sample testing can miss <b>non-conforming</b> <b>product.</b> A design may be conceptually safe, but without control of the production, the design may not be met by the manufacturer. Similarly, the applicable toy safety standards to which a toy is tested by a laboratory may not discover a hazard in a product: in the case of 2007's magnetic toy recalls and the Bindeez recall, the products in question met the requirements laid down in the applicable safety standard, yet were found to present an inherent risk.Proposed process and quality control standards, similar to the ISO 9000 systems, seek to eliminate production errors and control materials to avoid deviation from the design.The creation of manufacturing quality standards for toys will help ensure consistency of production. Using a continual improvement model, production can be subject to constant scrutiny, rather than assuming the compliance of all production by testing random samples.In October and November 2007, mandatory third party testing by companies such as LGA, Eurofins, Bureau Veritas or SGS Consumer Testing Services was proposed by regulators in the EU and US, to a (possibly new) international standard, requiring a new safety mark. There is no indication that the proposals will address manufacturing control.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: The {{clinical}} laboratory {{is part of}} the group of actors in health systems that are under increasing pressure by users and administrators to increase their productivity in order to respond efficiently to the increased volume of patients, optimizing costs and professional time. This pressure forced laboratories to perform a full review of their procedures and develop technical, logistical and computational tools to enable excellent response times. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of the automated blood cell counter autoverification process {{and its impact on the}} safety of patients. Methods: Verification rules were designed in the connectivity software, based on manual validation criteria for laboratory professionals, according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Guideline Auto 10 -A and the International Consensus Group for Hematology Review (ISLH). The autoverification percentage was established, and <b>non-conforming</b> <b>product</b> (NCP) percentages were estimated before and after the procedure. Pilot tests were also performed in different days so as to adjust the process. Results: 53. 4 % of automated blood cell counters autoverification were achieved, and, subsequently in the audit of 18 months, 60 % was reached due to verification adjustments in the delta programmed filter. The NCPs rose from 0. 065 % to 0. 0036 % from the beginning to the end of the process.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an approach}} to minimize the number of process tooling adjustments and deliver an acceptable fraction of <b>non-conforming</b> <b>products</b> based on given product quality specification limits in assembly processes. A linear model is developed to describe the relationships between product quality and process tooling locating positions. Based on the model, the process mean shifts of tooling locating positions are estimated for both deterministic and stochastic cases by using the least-square estimation or linear mixed model estimation, respectively. A simultaneous confidence interval is obtained to construct the estimation region of a process mean shift under the given false alarm rate. Furthermore, a tooling adjustment strategy is proposed to determine when the process adjustment is essentially {{needed in order to}} ensure an acceptable fraction of non-conforming units based on the given product quality specification limits.

Even though rework and repair methods are acceptable processes in manufacturing, there is little investigation done on the classification and cost parameters of a repairable or re-workable part.

We consider a single machine subject to random failure rate and producing progressive deteriorating products. A preventive maintenance (PM) strategy with minimal repair is applied with non negligible durations of maintenance tasks. This study consists in developing analytical models {{in order to}} determine the optimal integrated maintenance plan taking into account the impact of <b>non-conforming</b> <b>products.</b> Two strategies are developed. The first strategy consists on selling products at a discount price due to the loss of quality caused by the machine degradation. The aim of this strategy is to determine the optimal number of batches produced N* before applying each preventive maintenance action maximizing the total profit (PT) per time unit. For the second strategy, we propose a rework activity for deteriorated products in order to improve their quality condition to be sold at the best price Pmax. For this second approach, our objective is to determine the number of batches sold after a reworking task N 1 and the number of batches sold at a discount price N 2. A mathematical model is developed to find simultaneously the optimal value of the two decision variables N 1 * and N 2 * which maximize the total net profit (PNT) per time unit for a finite horizon H taking into account rework and setup costs. The preventive maintenance action will be undertaking after each N 1 +N 2 batches.

Although {{much has been}} done to eliminate such products with respect to development and production processes, researchers have not yet explored, in depth, the relationship between the degree of virtuality with which project teams in the industry operate {{and the degree to which}} product quality may be compromised. The aim of this research was to develop a simple set of basic organisational enablers and project and team focussed processes that could be utilised by dispersed project teams to enhance their probability of successful project outcomes. A conceptual model was developed from the literature and the author’s experience of supporting virtual project teams in global organisations. This was tested by conducting an online survey with dispersed teams involved in the design, development or production of pharmaceutical and medical products to ascertain which variables negatively impacted project outcomes and which variables acted as enablers for successful goal achievement. The survey was conducted in one global organisation. The study highlighted key basic organisational inputs and project and team focussed processes that act as enablers for project success and can be implemented by managers and teams at all levels of ability and development. There was sufficient evidence to support recommending a focus on these enablers in a business context and as a basis for further research in an academic context. The implications of these findings are the provision of a basic framework for researchers to build on when investigating the enablers required for effective goal achievement in dispersed project teams and a simple model for use in business to enhance the probability of project success. ...|$|R
