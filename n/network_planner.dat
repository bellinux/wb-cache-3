30|$|First, the <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> (logically) has the {{capability}} of optimizing wireless networks and is thus able to derive the number and location of the sinks (i.e., energy-consuming nodes that collect {{the data from the}} other nodes) using the coverage optimization algorithm described in[27]. For two independent sensor networks that have the common incentive ‘lower energy consumption’, the symbiotic <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> could, e.g., decide to reduce the total number of sinks, without affecting coverage. Second, the <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> is also able to establish a symbiotic cooperation between the different co-located networks. This cooperation has extensively been discussed in[30]. Third, the <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> is able to set the nodes’ transmit/receiver mode on or off and to control the nodes’ transmit power. And fourth, the <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> can also tune its propagation models for more reliable predictions and hence better future decisions. These four features will be illustrated in Section 5., where they will be applied to a real-life wireless test network.|$|E
30|$|This article aims {{to create}} a {{symbiotic}} physical-layer optimization of different wireless networks, which is automatically controlled {{by means of a}} self-regulating (cognitive) feedback loop. These functionalities are implemented in a previously developed <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> (WiCa Heuristic Indoor Propagation Prediction—WHIPP[27, 28]). In this section, we will first go into the WHIPP <b>network</b> <b>planner,</b> followed by a description of the practical implementation of the self-regulating cognitive mechanism into this <b>network</b> <b>planner.</b> Finally, the advantages of the self-regulating symbiotic approach are highlighted.|$|E

The <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> can be run as a software component on a server or, alternatively, the optimization process can be calculated by an independent (external) server that gains access to the collected data. Existing current-day management platforms are already capable of controlling the settings of wireless nodes in a building, for example, to support handovers between different access points in wireless conferencing systems. Our symbiotic <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> extends these or similar systems with the capability to fulfill specific network incentives.|$|E

Advanced decision support tools require the most efficient optimization techniques, must be able to find the optimal investment path considering multiple scenarios, and should not only consider classic expansion strategies but also intelligent ones (e. g. energy storage and controlling active demand). Advanced decision support tools would greatly help network operators to make better decisions under uncertainty, which contributes to an affordable, sustainable, and reliable electric energy supply...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{formulate}} a three-period model for studying how {{the exercise of}} local market power by generation firms affects the equilibrium investment between the generation and the transmission sectors. Using a 30 -bus network example, we compare the transmission investment decisions made by a “proactive ” <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> (who proactively plans transmission investments to induce a more socially-efficient equilibrium of generation investments) with both those made by an integrated-resources planner (who jointly plans generation and transmission expansions) and those made by a “reactive” <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> (who plans transmission investments only considering the currently installed generation capacities). We show that, although a proactive <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> cannot do better (in terms of social welfare) than an integrated-resources planner, it can recoup some of the lost welfare due to the separation of generation and transmission planning by proactively expanding transmission capacity. Conversely, a reactive <b>network</b> <b>planner,</b> who ignores the interrelationship between the transmission and the generation investments, foregoes this opportunity.

50|$|From a {{technical}} perspective, the new IP-based networks are also {{far more difficult}} to plan. The self-routing nature of IP <b>networks</b> requires <b>planners</b> {{to determine how the}} network will behave under normal, overloaded, and failure scenarios. The fact that IP can drop or delay packets during overload conditions introduces new complexity to the system. Interactive services such as voice, two-way video, and gaming are particularly susceptible to the resultant digital jitter and delay.

The <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> automatically designs a symbiotic network out of a set of co-located-independent wireless networks, based on a common incentive between the networks. Symbiotic networks[1] are coexisting homogeneous (using the same technology, e.g., two independent Wi-Fi networks from different companies, sharing their access points) or heterogeneous (e.g., Wi-Fi and UMTS networks allowing a smartphone user to collect data) networks that cooperate based on common incentives through infrastructure and resource sharing. Incentives are network goals that should be improved in order for the network to consider cooperating with other networks[2], e.g., a lower power consumption. The optimization is performed for multiple networks and over multiple network layers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{optimization}} problem of planning Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) is a challenging {{problem that has}} been regarded as a cost-minimization problem, while other pertinent Quality of Service (QoS) criteria are modeled as constraints to be satisfied. We propose a novel approach that models, to some realistic extent, the problem of planning WMNs as a simultaneous optimization of deployment cost and network throughput under obvious network constraints. We propose two multi-objective models differing mainly in how the throughput objective is optimized. We tailor a nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the two models. The cost {{and the effectiveness of}} the planning solutions are two conflicting objectives which undermine each other. In such situations, the <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> would prefer a set of trade-off planning solutions at his disposal to choose from A comparative experimental study with different key-parameter settings on the two instance models is conducted to help <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> decide which planning optimization model to choose given their specific requirements and/or scenarios...|$|E
30|$|After {{applying}} the <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> {{as a first}} optimization step (phase 2, see Table 1), the sinks for each network are determined, and they are marked with black dots (see Figure 3). To be able to receive data from other nodes, the radio of the sink node should always be active and is therefore the main contributor to the total energy consumption, provided the data traffic in the network is limited. The 11 sinks together thus consume 11 · 65.01 mW = 715.1 mW. The other 34 nodes {{are assumed to be}} ‘on’ during, e.g., 20 % of the time, to allow sending packets and detecting incoming packets. The value of 20 % will depend on the type of network and the intended communication. Under this assumption, the power consumption of these 34 nodes is 34 · 65.01 mW · 20 % = 442.1 mW, resulting in a total energy consumption of 1157.2 mW for all 45 nodes (see Figure 4).After selecting these sinks, 100 packets are sent by each node to its corresponding sink and signal quality data are logged in a database (Figure 1). The feedback loop from the database towards the symbiotic <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> then allows the adjustment of the prediction models, based on the difference between the RSSI recorded at the receiver nodes and the RSSI predicted by the path loss model. Figure 1 illustrates how this process is repeated. A first comparison between the measured path loss PLmeasured and the predicted path loss PLpredicted in the symbiotic network yielded an average prediction error δ[*]=[*]PLmeasured[*]−[*]PLpredicted of [*]−[*] 3.9 dB and an average absolute prediction error |δ| of 6.8 dB. Applying the symbiotic <b>network</b> <b>planner</b> and adapting the path loss model with this fixed offset of − 3.9 dB results in a prediction improvement of 1.9 dB, with an average absolute error |δ| of 4.9 dB in the second run. Although this article only intends to present a framework into which more advanced strategies can easily be implemented, either for adjusting the path loss models or for the incentive-based symbiotic <b>network</b> <b>planner,</b> the improvement of 1.9 dB already indicates the usefulness of the feedback loop (e.g., for finetuning the nodes’ transmit power, see phase 4).|$|E
