5|$|His {{performance}} at the Olympic trials was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice and stated that a right to work was not sufficient reason to remove it. The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, was satisfied with the outcome, stating that those abusing drugs did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E

5|$|Davidson's later {{career as}} a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His {{attempts}} at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles {{that he had not}} been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and that he did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> the humiliations he endured.|$|E
5|$|Fleming and {{the judge}} {{who presided over the}} trial each spoke with her; both argued that they did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> blame for the lynching. A schoolteacher who had known Washington told Freeman that Washington was illiterate, and that all {{attempts}} to teach him to read had been futile. Freeman concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington's lynching, although many disliked that his body was mutilated. She determined that the mob was led by a bricklayer, a saloonkeeper, and several employees of an ice company. The NAACP did not publicly identify them. Freeman concluded that Washington killed Fryer, and that he was motivated by her domineering attitude towards him.|$|E
5|$|For her {{performance}} as Alice Howland, Julianne Moore won an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Critics' Choice Movie Award. Still Alice marked her first Academy Award win after four previous nominations. Although she was widely considered the Best Actress frontrunner {{in anticipation of}} the Academy Awards ceremony, some critics felt that Still Alice was not one of Moore's strongest performances and did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> to win. Moore dedicated her Academy Award win to Glatzer, who died from ALS several weeks later on March 10, 2015.|$|E

Ice-T is getting onto Coolio about how he does not put forth enough effort in his work and does <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> the job. The song begins to play after this scene ends, and the plot follows Coolio who, while on the job, sees acts of strip poker, lesbian affairs, and several sexual scenarios. The bellboy {{eventually}} is invited {{into one of the}} rooms and the music comes to an end. The video ends with a scene of Ice-T continuing to complain about the bellboy's work ethics.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his tour}} of duty Nash had been wary of {{preferential}} treatment towards him due to his fame and opposed any attempts to promote him, which he believed he did <b>not</b> <b>deserve.</b> However, a jeep crash resulted in further injury to Nash's knees and ultimately led to a medical discharge from the Army on 18 February 1944. Following his return to Australia, Nash sold War Bonds and appeared at war-related charity functions, including one where he raised an additional £100 by singing to the large crowd.|$|E
5|$|After Victory Road, Samoa Joe and Booker T {{continued}} their rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the July17 episode of Impact, Management Director Jim Cornette demanded that Booker T give the championship back to Joe, who {{was recognized as}} the official champion by TNA. Booker T refused this demand, while Joe also declined the offer as he felt he did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> to hold the title due to being pinned at the event. Due to these feelings, Cornette instead scheduled a rematch between the two for the championship at TNA's next PPV event Hard Justice on August10. On the July24 episode of Impact!, Joe challenged Booker T to contest their rematch in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match, which Booker T accepted after adding that weapons would be allowed in the match. Joe defeated Booker T at the event to retain the championship.|$|E

5|$|Nowotny {{was sent}} on a {{propaganda}} tour in Germany, {{which included the}} presentation of the Knight's Cross of the War Merit Cross to the railroad engineer August Kindervater on 7December1943 – Nowotny's 23rd birthday. Shortly before Christmas, he visited the Focke-Wulf production site at Bad Eilsen, where he was met by Professor Kurt Tank. The mayor of Vienna, Dipl.-Ing. Hanns Blaschke awarded Nowotny the city's ring of honor on 11January1944, the presentation taking place a week later. It was a token that Nowotny accepted reluctantly, feeling that he did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> it. His next official visit was the Büromaschinenfabrik (office machinery factory) at Zella-Mehlis, before he briefly returned to Jagdgeschwader 54. Nowotny was made Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 101 (JG 101) and commander of the Jagdfliegerschule 1, a Luftwaffe fighter pilot training school at Pau in southern France, in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, {{the judge}} {{sentence}}d Cisneros and Garza {{to life in}} prison after the jury decided that neither of them posed a threat to society, and thus did <b>not</b> <b>deserve</b> the death penalty. This sentence included the possibility for parole after they complete 35 mandatory years behind bars. The head juror said the tapes were the strongest evidence against them, along with Martínez' testimony. Fischer's parents said they were pleased with the decision, and that justice was finally served, but said their son's absence would leave a void {{for the rest of their}} lives. The prosecution intended to have Cisneros sentenced to death arguing that her actions were premeditated. Garza's closing words centered around him being told by Martínez that Cisneros wanted Fischer hurt, and that he would not have knowingly participated in a murder. Both defense attorneys said they would appeal the verdict. Cisneros's attorney in particular said the judge's denial of a separate trial for his client was the reason for his early appeal. The defense said that trials where two defendants implicate each other are often severed, The judge refused to sever them because Cisneros's statement did not mention Garza. The defense also said they would appeal the verdict because they believed that the voice recordings were tampered with and unauthenticated. A judge formalized the jury's decision and sentenced Cisneros and Garza {{to life in prison}} on April 18.|$|E
