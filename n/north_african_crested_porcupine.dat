50|$|Most of what {{is known}} about {{reproduction}} in the <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> comes from individuals in captivity. Usually, female <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> have one litter every year. One or two very well developed young are born in a chamber within the burrow that is usually lined with grass, after a 66-day gestation period, on average. The young weigh about 1000 g at birth, which is about 5% of the mother's weight. They leave the den after one week. At this time, the spines begin to harden. <b>Crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> reach adult weight at one to two years and are often sexually mature just before then. Breeding occurs throughout the year.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is a {{terrestrial}} mammal; {{they very}} seldom climb trees, but can swim. They are nocturnal and monogamous. The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> {{takes care of}} the young {{for a long time and}} small family groups consist of the adult pair and young of various ages. In defense, when disturbed, they raise and fan their quills to make themselves look bigger. If continually bothered, the <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> will stamp its feet, whirr the quills, and charge the disturber back end first trying to stab the enemy with the thicker, shorter quills. These attacks are known to have killed lions, leopards, hyenas, and even humans.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Hystrix cristata), {{a typical}} {{representative}} of the Old World porcupines, occurs throughout the south of Europe and North and West Africa. It is replaced in southern and central Africa by the Cape porcupine, H. africaeaustralis, and in India by the Malayan porcupine (H. brachyura) and Indian (<b>crested)</b> <b>porcupine</b> (H. indica). The latter also lives throughout the Middle East.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is {{protected}} under the India Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, amended up to 2002. Nonetheless, because they are destructive to gardens and agricultural crops, porcupines are widely hunted. A large trade of these porcupines exists for consumption and medicinal use. Despite being considered a pest, Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> {{play an important role}} in spreading seeds and pollen.|$|R

50|$|Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} southwest and central Asia and {{in parts of}} the Middle East, including Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, China, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan,Lebanon, Nepal, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Yemen. Due to their flexible environmental tolerances, Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> occupy a broad range of habitats. They prefer rocky hillsides, but are also common in tropical and temperate shrublands, grasslands, forests, plantations, and gardens. Their range seems to be limited by seasonal densities of forage and the availability of suitable substrates for digging burrows. More specifically, the northern range of the Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is limited by minimum summer night duration: they do not occur above latitudes where minimum night duration is less than 7 hours, presumably because of the amount of foraging time required to meet their dietary needs.|$|R
