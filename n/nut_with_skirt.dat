40|$|ABSTRACT. Pistachio (Pistacia vera) <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> {{shell and}} kernel defects detract from {{consumer}} acceptance and, in some cases, {{may be more}} prone to insect damage, mold decay, and/or aflatoxin contamination. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop imaging algorithms to improve sorting of <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> the following shell defects: oily stains, dark stains, adhering hull, and the following kernel defects: navel orangeworm (NOW) damage, fungal decay, and Aspergillus molds, all of which indicate risk of aflatoxin contamination. Imaging algorithms were developed to distinguish normal nuts from those <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> oily stains, dark stains, and adhering hull as well as nuts having kernel defects. Image algorithm testing on a validation data set showed that nuts having oily stain, dark stain, or adhering hull could be distinguished from normal <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> an accuracy of 98 %. Removing <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> oily stain, dark stain, and adhering hull will also remove 89. 7 % of <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> kernel decay, 93. 8 % of <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> Aspergillus molds present, and 98. 7 % of NOW positive nuts...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} to separate pistachio <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> closed-shells from those with open-shells. It was observed that upon impact on a steel plate, <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> closed-shells emit different sounds than <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> open-shells. Two feature vectors extracted from the sound signals were melcepstrum coefficients and eigenvalues obtained from the principle component analysis of the autocorrelation matrix of the signals. Classification of a sound signal was done by linearly combining feature vectors from both mel-cepstrum and PCA feature vectors. An important property of the algorithm {{is that it is}} easily trainable. During the training phase, sounds of the <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> closed-shells and open-shells were used to obtain a representative vector of each class. The accuracy of closed-shell nuts was more than 99 % on the test set...|$|R
40|$|In {{the results}} of survey on {{operating}} state of pine nut processors located in Gapyeong–gun, Gyeonggi–do and Hongcheon–gun, Gangwon–do, representative pine nut producing area, the total purchasing amount of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone of Gapyeong–gun, Gyeonggi–do was 500 ~ 4, 000 bags (1 bag is 80 kg), of which average amount per processor was 2000 bags. The price range per bag of pine nuts was 470 ~ 620 thousand won and the average price was 550 thousand won. Total purchase price of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone per processor averaged 1. 2 billion won and the mean net income per bag of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone was 35 thousand won. Total purchasing amount of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone of Hongcheon–gun, Gangwon–do was 1, 000 ~ 2, 000 bags, averaging 1, 500 bags per processor and the price range per bag of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone was 580 ~ 630 thousand won, averaging 610 thousand won. Total purchase price of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone per processor averaged 0. 9 billion won and the mean net income per bag of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone was 100 thousand won. However, 9 processors among total 16 processors answered to plan to maintain the present state because of difficulty in securing material amount of pine <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> a cone, low profitability, poor selling, lack of equipment introducing fund, and lack of pine nuts purchasing fund for future business scale. Therefore, {{it was suggested that}} in order to activate local economy through maintenance and expansion of pine nut processors, financial supports such as low interest loan for expansion of processing amount were necessary in the short run and expansion of new forestation and crown shape control to facilitate seed exploitation as well as work enforcement such as thinning for increase of yield was required in the long run...|$|R

40|$|The {{qualitative}} phytochemical {{analysis revealed}} {{the presence of}} alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, cardiac glycoside, glycoside, saponins glycosides, steroid, and volatile oil for both red and white cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> varying degree in their concentration, only anthraquinone was not detected. The quantitative analysis revealed {{that there was a}} significant difference at (p< 0. 05) in saponins content of white cola <b>nut</b> when compared <b>with</b> red cola <b>nut</b> which has the highest percentage of saponins content (20. 60 %) than red cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> (10. 80 %). While no significant difference in the contents of alkaloid, flavonoids, tannins and glycosides. The alkaloids contents of red cola nut was higher (16. 07 %) when compared to white cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> (14. 40 %), while flavonoids contents of white cola nut was high (6. 33 %) compared to red cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> (5. 60 %), glycoside contents of white cola nut (6. 76 %) to that of red cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> (5. 68 %) and tannin content of white cola nut (1. 18 %) as compared with the red cola nut (1. 12 %). Conclusively this proved the scientific basis for the traditional uses of the plant extracts that have long being the knowledge for many years. It therefore recommended that further research study should be conduct on characterization of bioactive secondary metabolite of cola <b>nut</b> <b>with</b> a view of stabilizing the active ingredient so that they can be prevented from losing their potency...|$|R

During the training phase, sounds of <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> closed shells and with open shells were used to obtain a representative vector of each class.
