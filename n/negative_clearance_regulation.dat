40|$|Abstract. Fine-{{blanking}} with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{is a kind}} of {{fine blanking}} processes. The punch size of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is larger than the die size. The paper does lots of simulations for the changes of blanking force in fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> and common blanking by DEFORM software, and the blanking force curves are gained by these experiments. The changing principle of blanking force and internal material is obtained through the simulation and experiments. The result shows that simulation blanking force of AISI- 1045 is lager than the actual blanking force. According to the curves derived from experiments, we can see that the maximum blanking force of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is higher than common blanking force. Compared with fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance,</b> the common blanking force reduces faster after the blanking force reaches maximum value. The experiment result shows that the force of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> under a smaller blanking clearance is a bit bigger than the force of common blanking force, and the blanking quality of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is much better than that of common blanking. Cracks can be closed effectively by the special squeeze forming in fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance.</b> Then, the crack can not expand continuously, and the bonding force is enhanced. The squeeze forming can restrain intergranular deformation and reduce the damage. However, the stretch forming easily leads to the inner crack and defect of materials.

This paper studied the common blanking of 60 Mn and the fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> of 60 Mn blanking work piece metallographic structure by using scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> process can increase the work-hardening degree and further thin the punching surface tissue, inhibit the crack, and make the blanking surface smooth. The tensile and tear result in the generation of cracks and burrs, and the extrusion forming of fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> inhibit the generation of cracks, and eliminate the conditions of the burrs. As the extrusion process, the degree of work hardening in fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is higher than the common blanking, the organizations are more closed.

This paper {{carried through}} {{fine-blanking}} with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> processing {{experiment with the}} AISI- 1020 and AISI- 1045 and obtained the work piece of fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance.</b> The fractography photographs in the different deform regions of rollover zone, shearing band, fracture zone and under sheared surface were scanned by scanning electron microscope (SEM-JSM- 6360 LV). The research result indicates that the plastic flow of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{has been carried out}} to punch downspin, then jib at the place of allowance value, so that the length of work piece burnish band as much as possible to maximize and the length of the smooth shearing fracture could reach more than 90 % thickness of the metallic sheet.

40|$|Abstract. Machining {{experiments}} of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{show that}} the blanking force {{is very different from}} ordinary blanking in different blanking stages. Studying on the blanking force size of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> in different blanking stages is a very important significance for studying die wear and analyzing the state of material stress-strain. Firstly, numerical simulation and stress state analysis of the fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> are carried out, with DEFORM-metal forming finite element analysis software. Afterward the relationship curve of blanking force and stroke are measured, and the blanking force with different blanking stages of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is analyzed by the simulation and the experiment. The analysis result shows that the simulation blanking force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but the blanking force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, the blanking force changes quickly. The metal sheet will enter into the state of plastic deformation after the blanking force reaching maximum value. Along with the punch continues to move down, the area of shear zone is decrescent so that the blanking force inches down, and the blanking force reaches a certain value in the place of blanking allowance value finally. With punch pushing the metal sheet to enter the plastic state and punch downward the place of the allowance value, the metal sheet sustained the big blanking force all the time as well as the deformation zone material keeps the plastic deformation. The research result provides theoretic reference and the experimental data for the practice application of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance,</b> and has instructive significance and reference value to mould design...|$|R

Being an {{important}} blanking parameter, the blanking allowance of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{has a direct}} relationship {{with the quality of}} work piece and ejector force. The full process of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> for ASTM- 1022 in different blanking allowances is simulated through the finite element analysis software DEFORM- 2 D, then the ejector force under different blanking allowances is measured through the experiment of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance.</b> Based on the analysis of the ejector force, the proportion of burnish band and the work piece fracture, the following conclusions are summarized. The size of blanking allowance is not related with the blanking force with the sheet entering plastic state and the maximum blanking force, and is only related with the ejector force. When the value of the blanking allowance is between 0. 1 mm and 0. 3 mm, the friction force between the punch-die and the sheet affects ejector force, and the ejector force is not related with the mechanical properties of material. When the value of the blanking allowance is between 0. 5 mm and 0. 8 mm, with the blanking allowance increasing, the ejector force increases rapidly...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a small animal model to enable the direct assessment of airway ENaC function in vivo. Experimental approach: Tracheal potential difference (TPD) was utilized as a measure of airway epithelial ion transport in the guinea-pig. ENaC activity in the trachea was established with a dose-response assessment to a panel of well-characterized direct and indirect pharmacological modulators of ENaC function, delivered by intra-tracheal (i. t.) instillation. Key results: The TPD in anaesthetized guinea-pigs was attenuated by the direct ENaC blockers: amiloride, benzamil and CF 552 with ED 50 values of 16, 14 and 0. 2 μg kg - 1 (i. t.), respectively. 5 -(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride, a structurally related compound but devoid of activity on ENaC, was without effect on the TPD. Intra-tracheal dosing of the Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors aprotinin and placental bikunin, which have previously been demonstrated to inhibit proteolytic activation of ENaC, likewise potently attenuated TPD in guinea-pigs, whereas α 1 -antitrypsin and soya bean trypsin inhibitor were without effect. Conclusions and implications: The pharmacological sensitivity of the TPD to amiloride analogues and also to serine protease inhibitors are both consistent with that of ENaC activity in the guinea-pig trachea. The guinea-pig TPD therefore represents a suitable in vivo model of human airway epithelial ion transport. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved...|$|R

The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss whether the timing for the Commission’s Proposal for {{reforming}} the implementation of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty is appropriate based on legal certainty considerations. The Proposal suggests to decentralise the day-to-day application of the EC antitrust rules further than is the case today and to abolish the present notification system whereby undertakings can apply for exemptions pursuant to Article 81 (3) and <b>negative</b> <b>clearances.</b> The article provides examples showing that presently, the answers to certain legal questions of EC competition rules are vague or contradictory, and that if the proposed reform were to be implemented in its present form, the undertakings would have to carry the full risk for compliance with the competition rules but without a simple or straightforward way of obtaining guidance or legally binding exemptions or <b>negative</b> <b>clearances.</b> While recognising the need for a reform of the implementation system of the EC competition rules, the article argues that consistency and coherence in the understanding and application of the competition rules are a prerequisite to ensure legal certainty which, in turn, is a prerequisite for the implementation of the Commission’s plans to decentralise EC competition law application. It is therefore suggested that the time is not yet ripe for the type of reform proposed by the Commission and that efforts should instead focus on creating the basis for such a reform by adopting clear guidelines and/or binding legislation that secure the legal certainty of the undertakings that have to operate under the EC competition law framework...|$|R

Remote sensing is presently employed in the monitoring of land cover change for data collection purposes but is under-utilised in the regulatory field, particularly in the forensic realm. Preliminary investigations suggest: 1) a lack of systematic monitoring or at least data-sharing between agencies mapping landcover change and those responsible for enforcing land management regulations; and 2) an agency reluctance to refuse permits, to prosecute, and/or to prefer counter-productive revegetation works to preservation.

40|$|Acetylcholine (ACh), a {{classical}} transmitter of parasympathetic nerve fibres in the airways, is also synthesized {{by a large}} number of non-neuronal cells, including airway surface epithelial cells. Strongest expression of cholinergic traits is observed in neuroendocrine and brush cells but other epithelial cell types—ciliated, basal and secretory—are cholinergic as well. There is cell type-specific expression of the molecular pathways of ACh release, including both the vesicular storage and exocytotic release known from neurons, and transmembrane release from the cytosol via organic cation transporters. The subcellular distribution of the ACh release machineries suggests luminal release from ciliated and secretory cells, and basolateral release from neuroendocrine cells. The scenario as known so far strongly suggests a local auto-/paracrine role of epithelial ACh in regulating various aspects on the innate mucosal defence mechanisms, including mucociliary <b>clearance,</b> <b>regulation</b> of macrophage function and modulation of sensory nerve fibre activity.
