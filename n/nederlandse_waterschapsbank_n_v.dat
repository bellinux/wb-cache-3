40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the efficacy of alar batten graft in correcting internal and external nasal valve collapse (i. <b>n.</b> <b>v.</b> and e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.)</b> and evaluate the functional and aesthetic results. From July 2006 to September 2008, 80 patients (54 females and 26 males) underwent alar batten cartilage grafting. The patients were divided into three groups: (1) 55 patients with iatrogenic nasal valve collapse (80 % i. <b>n.</b> <b>v.,</b> 20 % e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.),</b> (2) 15 patients with posttraumatic nasal valve collapse (45 % i. <b>n.</b> <b>v.,</b> 55 % e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.),</b> and (3) 10 patients with congenital nasal valve collapse (100 % e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.).</b> Patients were evaluated at 6, 12, 24, and some at 36 months after surgery. The final follow-up was at least 24 months. The results of this study revealed a significant increase in the size of the aperture at the internal or external nasal valve after the application of alar batten grafts. All the patients noted improvement in their nasal airway breathing and in their cosmetic appearance. No major complication was observed. The alar batten graft is a simple, versatile technique for long-term reshaping, repositioning, and reconstruction of the nasal valve collapse...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{correspondence}} P associates {{to every}} subset A ⊆ N a partition P (A) of A and to every game (<b>N,</b> <b>v),</b> the P -restricted game (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> ¯) defined by v ¯ (A) = ∑ F ∈ P (A) v (F) for all A ⊆ N. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on P to have inheritance of convexity from (<b>N,</b> <b>v)</b> to (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> ¯). The main condition is a cyclic intersecting sequence free condition. As a consequence, we {{only need to}} verify inheritance of convexity for unanimity games and for the small class of extremal convex games (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> S) (for any 0 ̸ ≠ S ⊆ N) defined for any A ⊆ <b>N</b> by <b>v</b> S (A) = | A ∩ S | − 1 if A ∩ S ≠ 0 ̸, and v S (A) = 0 otherwise. In particular, when (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> ¯) corresponds to Myerson’s network-restricted game, inheritance of convexity can be verified by this way. For the P min correspondence (P min (A) is built by deleting edges of minimum weight in the subgraph G A of a weighted communication graph G), we show that inheritance of convexity for unanimity games already implies inheritance of convexit...|$|R
