The present subgroup analyses further show <b>no</b> <b>effects</b> by tumour characteristics at diagnosis, suggesting that low-dose aspirin has <b>no</b> preventive <b>effect</b> on breast cancer...|$|R
5|$|Other storms were {{individually}} unusual. Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category5 intensity, {{but neither}} caused any damage. Hurricane Fausto had <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on land, but it regenerated into a weak tropical storm at an abnormally high latitude.|$|E

5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on aging.|$|E
5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, {{the situation of}} the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the tax increase had had <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics have <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> against viral infections {{or against}} the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E

5|$|Antioxidant dietary {{supplements}} do not improve health {{nor are they}} effective in preventing diseases as shown by randomized clinical trials including supplements of beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E singly or in different combinations having <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on mortality rate or cancer risk. Supplementation with selenium or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress can be considered as either a cause or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating drug development for antioxidant compounds for use as potential therapies.|$|E
5|$|As {{a strong}} acid, HCl {{has a large}} Ka. Theoretical {{attempts}} to assign a Ka to HCl have been made. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl, they have practically <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on pH, indicating that Cl− is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to concentrated solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity (a unit of concentration) equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on humans, wildlife, pollinators and most other beneficial insects.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of auxins in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can be applied as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of seedlings of various species of plants, including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it was used as a folk cure for tuberculosis, though it had <b>no</b> <b>effect.</b> In more recent times, it has been found that L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.|$|E
5|$|By February 1326, it {{was clear}} that Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with the exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had <b>no</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crowds {{gathered}} at four {{different points in}} the city, and along the route it was believed the soldiers would take in order to embark on their trains.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the effect of executive competency, the firm size, the independent commissioner and the institutional ownership towards tax avoidance. The number of population in this research is 141 manufacturing companies which are listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange during 2012 to 2014. This research uses purposive sampling technique. The multiple linear regression analysis is used to analyze the data. There are 49 companies used as the samples of this study. Based on the conducted data analysis on this research, it concludes that:(1) the executive competence has <b>no</b> <b>effects</b> on tax avoidance (2) the firm size has <b>no</b> <b>effects</b> on tax avoidance (3) the independent commissioner has <b>no</b> <b>effects</b> on tax avoidance while (4) the institutional ownership affects tax avoidance...|$|R
5|$|Forster was {{not present}} in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux {{had been sent to}} Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – {{to become a part of}} the French Republic. The application was accepted, but had <b>no</b> <b>effect,</b> since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored. Forster lost his library and collections and decided to remain in Paris.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government to the firm hence it has <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E

Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed the matter with Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed.|$|E
