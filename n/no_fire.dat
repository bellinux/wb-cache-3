5|$|On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire {{broke out}} on the 11th floor of the North Tower. The fire spread through {{the core of the}} {{building}} to the 9th and 14th floors, as the insulation for telephone cables, located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors, had been ignited. Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately, and the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors, water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below. At the time, the World Trade Center complex had <b>no</b> <b>fire</b> sprinkler systems.|$|E

One surmises that this area’s fire protection needs were served, initially, by either Fire Station #3, which was opened at 3515 12th in 1911, or Fire Station #7, in operation by 1916 at Beechwood and Prospect (now Kavanaugh).|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} just cleared high-tension {{overhead power}} lines and {{came to rest on}} a narrow strip of land surrounded by tall trees immediately south of the A30 road, and a short distance south of the King George VI Reservoir near the town of Staines-upon-Thames. There was <b>no</b> <b>fire</b> on impact, but one broke out during the rescue effort when cutting apparatus was used.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} had <b>no</b> <b>fire</b> detection or warning devices. But it had two built-in CO2 {{fire extinguishers}} to fight engine fires. The extinguishers were not automatic. There was a control {{panel on the}} starboard side of the cockpit, from which the co-pilot would operate the extinguishers when instructed by the pilot. Investigators found that both of the extinguishers had been discharged. This suggested that {{a member of the}} crew, presumably the co-pilot, Warrant Officer Brož, had tried to extinguish the engine fire.|$|E

25|$|During {{the impact}} and short ground roll, the nose gear collapsed, the right main gear {{separated}} from the aircraft, penetrating the central fuel tank and cabin space, and the left main gear was pushed up through the wing. The aircraft {{came to rest on}} the threshold markings {{at the start of the}} runway. A significant amount of fuel leaked, but there was <b>no</b> <b>fire.</b> Four crew members and eight passengers received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries (concussion and a broken leg).|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} {{moments after the}} crash, the cockpit crew told flight attendants to delay {{evacuating}} the aircraft as they were communicating with the tower. A flight attendant seated at the second door {{on the left side}} (door 2L) observed fire outside the aircraft near row 10 and informed the cockpit crew, at which point the evacuation order was given some 90 seconds after the aircraft came to rest. Flight attendants told NTSB investigators that there was <b>no</b> <b>fire</b> inside the cabin when the evacuation began.|$|E
25|$|The Hamlet plant {{had three}} {{previous}} fires, but no {{action was taken}} to prevent recurrence or to unlock the doors. The building had fires before Imperial took over as well, although these, too, were non-fatal. The Imperial plant at Cumming, Georgia, had two major fires, one of which, in 1989, caused $1.2 million worth of damage. The Hamlet plant had <b>no</b> <b>fire</b> alarm system to warn workers farther back in the plant, {{and there were no}} sprinklers in the building.|$|E

25|$|On 23 August 2008, AIRES Flight 051 {{sustained}} substantial damage {{following the}} collapse of the right hand main landing gear on landing at Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz Airport (BAQ), Colombia. None of the 31 occupants were injured. The Bombardier Dash 8-301, registered HK-3952, operated on an international flight from Curaçao-Hato International Airport (CUR). The approach and landing were normal, touching down about 770 metres past the threshold of runway 23. The crew noticed a vibration of the right hand main gear. The undercarriage leg collapsed. There was <b>no</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{inflated}} {{escape slide}} blocked both forward doors from {{being used to}} evacuate the aircraft, and prevented two flight attendants seated on the forward jumpseat from assisting the evacuation. There was <b>no</b> <b>fire,</b> but had there been a fire, this malfunctioning slide would have dramatically affected the survivability of the occupants. As {{a result of this}} occurrence, the NTSB issued a safety recommendation to replace the slide cover latch brackets on forward slide compartments of all older Boeing 737 models with the latch brackets installed on later models.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} crash-landed in a birch {{forest at}} 23:35 local time, its left wing broke off, and the hull broke into two. There was <b>no</b> <b>fire.</b> Fire services arrived 30 minutes later. All crew members except the flight engineer who was seriously injured, escaped the crashed plane on their own. They could not immediately explain the reason of the crash, {{saying that it}} happened too fast. One of the crew members (purser) reached the nearby highway and stopped a car which {{took her to a}} hospital. Three other crew members also reached the highway and waited there for an ambulance.|$|E

25|$|A typeI error (or {{error of}} the first kind) is the {{incorrect}} rejection of a true null hypothesis. Usually a type I error leads one to conclude that a supposed effect or relationship exists when in fact it doesn't. Examples of type I errors include a test that shows a patient to have a disease when in fact the patient {{does not have the}} disease, a fire alarm going on indicating a fire when in fact there is <b>no</b> <b>fire,</b> or an experiment indicating that a medical treatment should cure a disease when in fact it does not.|$|E
25|$|One witness {{interviewed by}} the NTSB, a pilot driving on a road {{southwest}} of the airport, told investigators that he saw the airplane in normal flight at normal altitudes, and that {{he believed that the}} approach was not abnormal. The airplane completed a 180-degree turn from the downwind leg of the approach and continued the turn. He then saw the aircraft pitch slightly, before it rolled to the left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then turned nose-down and smashed into the ground. He saw <b>no</b> <b>fire</b> or smoke during the flight and he believed both propellers were rotating.|$|E
25|$|The fire {{occurred}} at the Sofa Super Store, composed of a 42,000ft² (3,902 m²) single-story steel trussed showroom building with a 17,000ft² (1,579 m²) warehouse building located behind the retail space, located at 1807 Savannah Highway in Charleston. The building had <b>no</b> <b>fire</b> sprinkler system. The fire started at approximately 7:00p.m. in a covered loading dock area built between the showroom and warehouse buildings which was attached to both buildings. At the time, the business was open and employees were present. Charleston firefighters {{arrived on the scene}} within three minutes of the alarm, followed soon after by firefighters from the St. Andrews Public Service District.|$|E

50|$|Using a {{specialized}} cartridge, the Groza has <b>no</b> <b>firing</b> pins {{in a traditional}} sense. When fired, an internal piston within the cartridge launches the bullet forward and retains all the gases within the barrel, thus making a near silent weapon.|$|R
25|$|Thus the Spaniards {{pushed on}} {{for two days}} through the woods, streams and swamps, without a trail to follow. On {{the evening of the}} third day, September 19, Menéndez reached the {{neighborhood}} of the fort. The night was stormy and the rain fell so heavily that he thought he could approach it without being discovered, and encamped for the night in the pine grove {{on the edge of a}} pond within less than a quarter of a league from it. The spot he had chosen was marshy; in places the water stood up to the belts of the soldiers, and <b>no</b> <b>fire</b> could be lighted for fear of revealing their presence to the French.|$|E
25|$|Good Samaritan {{provisions}} are not universal in application. The legal principle of imminent peril may also apply. In {{the absence of}} imminent peril, {{the actions of a}} rescuer may be perceived by the courts to be reckless and not worthy of protection. To illustrate, a motor vehicle collision occurs, but there is <b>no</b> <b>fire,</b> no immediate life threat from injuries and no danger of a second collision. If someone, with good intentions, causes injury by pulling the victim from the wreckage, a court may rule that good Samaritan laws do not apply because the victim was not in imminent peril and hold the actions of the rescuer to be unnecessary and reckless.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rescue}} area two A-1 Sandys, after several {{strafing}} runs to drive off approaching troops, drew <b>no</b> <b>fire</b> on a final low {{pass over the}} area. O'Mara crested a ridgeline into the canyon and lowered his hoist {{to pick up the}} F-4's aircraft commander, Tempest 03A, with whom he was in radio communication. His helicopter was immediately hit from above by small arms fire, forcing O'Mara to pull out. Tempest 03A on his last transmission radioed that he had been hit in the chest. O'Mara made two further rescue attempts in the badly damaged HH-3E before his hoist was knocked out, forcing him to return to base. O'Mara was awarded the Air Force Cross in 1969 for his efforts.|$|E
