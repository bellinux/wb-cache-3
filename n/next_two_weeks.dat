5|$|For the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> the outnumbered Berryforce {{attempted}} to retake the strategically important {{town in the}} Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the French Foreign Legion and tanks. Berryman then tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{served in}} the Confederate Army from November 2, 1861, until early 1865. In mid-January 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis summoned Breckinridge to the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia, and rumors {{followed}} that Davis would appoint Breckinridge Confederate States Secretary of War, replacing James A. Seddon. Breckinridge arrived in Richmond on January 17, and {{some time in the}} <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> Davis offered him the appointment. Breckinridge made his acceptance conditional upon the removal of Lucius B. Northrop from his office as Confederate Commissary General. Most Confederate officers regarded Northrop as inept, but Davis had long defended him. Davis relented on January 30, allowing Seddon to replace Northrop with Breckinridge's friend, Eli Metcalfe Bruce, on an interim basis; Breckinridge accepted Davis's appointment the next day.|$|E

40|$|A {{programmable}} {{optical computer}} has remained an elusive concept. To construct a practical computing primitive equivalent to an electronic Boolean logic, one should find a nonlinear phenomenon that overcomes weaknesses present in many optical processing schemes. Ideally, the nonlinearity {{should provide a}} functionally complete set of logic operations, enable ultrafast all-optical programmability, and allow cascaded operations without {{a change in the}} operating wavelength or in the signal encoding format. Here we demonstrate a programmable logic gate using an injection-locked Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL). The gate program is switched between the AND and the OR operations at the rate of 1 GHz with Bit Error Ratio (BER) of 10 e- 6 without changes in the wavelength or in the signal encoding format. The scheme is based on nonlinearity of normalization operations, which can be used to construct any continuous complex function or operation, Boolean or otherwise.

5|$|Hurricane Kyle was the fifth-longest-lived Atlantic {{tropical}} or subtropical cyclone on record. The eleventh named {{storm and}} third hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Kyle {{developed as a}} subtropical cyclone on September 20 to the east-southeast of Bermuda. Looping westward, it transitioned into a tropical cyclone and became a hurricane on September 25. For the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> Kyle tracked generally westward, oscillating in strength several times because of fluctuations in environmental conditions. On October 11, the cyclone turned northeastward and made landfalls near Charleston, South Carolina, and Long Beach, North Carolina, at tropical storm status. After lasting as a cyclone for 22days, Kyle dissipated on October 12 as it was absorbed by an approaching cold front.|$|E

40|$|Glue {{sniffing}} neuropathy {{commonly known}} as n-hexane neuropathy. It is well documented that industrial exposure to n-hexane causes neuropathy, however it is less well recognized that inhalation of n-hexane present in the vapors can also cause neuropathy However such patients are not seen that frequently. The acute worsening also generates differential diagnosis of GBS. Most of literature is reported from west. We report such case {{for the first time}} from Saudi Arabia. A 35 year old male presented to us with progressive numbness followed by weakness in both legs since last three <b>weeks.</b> Over <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>week</b> he became chair bound and in the beginning of third week he also stated to feel numbness in both the hands and some weakness was also noted in hands. His past history was significant for carpet cleaning glue sniffing for many years. His exam was significant for distal weakness feet greater than hands, deep tendon reflexes were absent all over. All sensory modalities showed glove and stocking pattern. Nerve conduction velocities showed slowing. His CSF exam was normal. We conclude that n-hexane is neurotoxic when inhaled to excess and, that the neuropathy has characteristic electrophysiological and pathological features...|$|R

5|$|Olaf {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave {{that left the}} coast of Africa on September 17. Over the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> it moved westbound into the East Pacific Ocean. Initially, the wave was not in an environment conductive for further development. However, on October 2, a low-level circulation was noted on satellite imagery. This circulation quickly became better defined {{over the next several}} hours while located 400 miles (645km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. The next day, Dvorak Classifications, a tool that estimates a tropical cyclone intensity, were placed at 1.5. This is equivalent to winds of around 30mph (50km/h). In addition, a ship nearby reported winds of 35mph (45km/h). Microwave imagery also indicated that the center was near the associated convection. Based on this, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1944, Mickl was {{promoted}} to Generalleutnant. He identified that the Partisan 13th Division was using the Drežnica valley as a huge armoury, hiding captured Italian arms and ammunition in villages, basements, and even in fake graves in cemeteries. This was of major concern if the feared Allied landing eventuated. In mid-April, Mickl ordered Operation Keulenschlag (Mace Blow) to clear the area, using the 846th Infantry Regiment {{and parts of the}} 847th Infantry Regiment, supported by the divisional artillery and flak battalion. Over the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> the division pushed the Partisan 13th Division north to the area of Mrkopalj and Delnice, and captured sufficient material to equip two divisions, including 30 tons of small arms ammunition and 15 tons of artillery ammunition.|$|E

Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic, co-op, kitchen, and dining room for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.|$|E
