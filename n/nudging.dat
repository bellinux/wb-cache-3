Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by <b>nudging</b> {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose of the craft to be raised or lowered by motion control, with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
5|$|Franchitti led {{the field}} to the restart on lap eight, ahead of Tagliani, Hunter-Reay (up from fourth), Kanaan (up from sixth), and Matos, who {{advanced}} seven positions while avoiding the mêlée at turn one. Franchitti became only the third driver in series history to lead the final lap of one season and the first lap of the next, having won the championship by winning the 2009 Firestone Indy 300 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The top five remained the same until lap 15 when Dan Wheldon passed the De Ferran Luczo Dragon Racing car of Matos for fifth place. Hunter-Reay took second place from Tagliani into the final hairpin on lap 19, before Milka Duno brought out the second caution of the afternoon on lap 22 by <b>nudging</b> her Dale Coyne Racing car into the wall at turn four.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recognizing the mindless {{nature of}} many food decisions, {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that attempts to increase healthy eating should not focus on convincing people what is 'right' but rather aim to adjust the environment such that people are automatically directed toward healthy choices. This study investigated a <b>nudge</b> aiming to promote healthy food choices in train station snack shops. METHODS: The <b>nudge</b> involved a repositioning of food products: healthy foods were placed at the cash register desk, while keeping unhealthy products available elsewhere in the shop. Three snack shops were included: a control condition; a <b>nudge</b> condition repositioning healthy products and a <b>nudge</b> + disclosure condition employing the same <b>nudge</b> together with an explanatory sign. Next to examining its effectiveness during 1 week, the study assessed customers' acceptance of the <b>nudge.</b> RESULTS: Controlling for a baseline week, more healthy (but not fewer unhealthy) products were sold in both <b>nudge</b> conditions, with no difference between the <b>nudge</b> and the <b>nudge</b> + disclosure condition. A majority of customers reported positive attitudes toward the <b>nudge.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Repositioning healthy foods is a simple, effective and well-accepted <b>nudge</b> to increase healthy purchases.

The results show that while the default <b>nudge</b> was effective at the time of application, it was not enough to change attitudes towards the <b>nudged</b> behavior as would be needed for long-term success. Indeed, we rather find that those who adopted an action that went against the <b>nudge</b> were more motivated to follow on through with this action later on than those who went with the <b>nudge.</b> We furthermore show that giving people more leeway in how to respond to a <b>nudge</b> improves acceptance of the <b>nudge.</b> We finally discuss the practical implications of our findings in terms of the applicability of default-based <b>nudges</b> as a tool for policy interventions...|$|R

25|$|The playfield is a {{planar surface}} {{inclined}} upward {{from three to}} seven degrees (current convention is {{six and a half}} degrees), away from the player, and includes multiple targets and scoring objectives. Some operators intentionally extend threaded levelers on the rear legs and/or shorten or remove the levelers on the front legs to create additional incline in the playfield, making the ball move faster and harder to play. It is important that the playfield be level left-to-right; a quick visual test compares the top of the back cabinet against a brick or block wall behind it, or to roll a marble {{down the center of the}} playfield glass. If it clearly rolls off to one side, a player may be inclined to stuff folded paper beneath the legs on the lower side to level the playfield. Additionally, leg levelers that are all extended fully make the game easier to nudge; when collapsed low, the entire game is more stable, and <b>nudging</b> becomes harder.|$|E

Due to damage inflicted in his spectacular accident the previous day, Boyd did not start, thus leaving the grid at 28 cars. Once again, Ericsson made an awful getaway, with Bottas and Mortara both slotting in behind a fast-starting Vernay. Into Lisboa, Ricciardo got alongside Ericsson as they battled for fourth with the Australian brushing {{the wall and the}} two continued side-by-side into San Francisco, with Ricciardo again <b>nudging</b> the wall. Behind them, Vanthoor left his braking far too late for Lisboa, and mounted over Chilton, which caused the teenage Briton to retire on the spot. Ricciardo's clip with the wall caused a left-rear puncture, but he managed to carry on up the hill, until he crashed {{at the entrance to the}} Solitude Esses. His car rebounded off the wall, and into direct line of the rest of the field. No less than half a dozen cars impacted with the stricken car, and blocked the track which ultimately led to a red flag, and a race suspension. Also taken out in the incident were the third Carlin of Hartley, the Premas of Coletti and Zampieri, the Fortecs of Rosenzweig and McKenzie, and Ho. Imperatori was also involved, returning to the pits for a lengthy period, but returned to complete three laps towards the end.

Alesi carried his form over from free practice, <b>nudging</b> the crash barriers lining the circuit on more than one occasion to set a provisional pole position time of 1:23.754. Berger was also impressive, power-sliding through Casino Square, to the delight of the crowd, on his way to the third-fastest time, although he complained that Alesi had held him up on what he thought would have been his quickest lap of the session. The form of the Ferraris came as something of a surprise, as the 41T2's unique V12 engine configuration theoretically produced less torque than its rivals, a disadvantage on a circuit as tight as Monaco. Alesi said that he believed the results of the session were due to the extreme effort that he and Berger were putting into their driving overcoming any deficiencies with the car. The Ferraris were split by Schumacher, who felt that the rain shower had prevented him from fulfilling his potential, as he did not complete his full quota of 12laps as a result of the track conditions becoming slower. His teammate, Herbert, took provisional sixthplace. Of the Williams drivers, Hill was fourth, but Coulthard admitted that he was still learning the track on his way to 11th, 2.8seconds slower than Alesi's best. Häkkinen continued McLaren's promising form with a provisional fifthplace, but was fined $10,000 for ignoring yellow flags during the season.

40|$|The {{two major}} {{smartphone}} platforms (Android and iOS) {{have more than}} two mil- lion mobile applications (apps) available from their respective app stores, and each store has seen more than 50 billion apps downloaded. Although apps provide desired functionality by accessing users’ personal information, they also access personal information for other purposes (e. g., advertising or profiling) that users {{may or may not}} desire. Users can exercise control over how apps access their personal information through permission managers. However, a permission manager alone might not be sufficient to help users manage their app privacy because: (1) privacy is typically a secondary task and thus users might not be motivated enough {{to take advantage of the}} permission manager’s functionality, and (2) even when using the permission manager, users often make suboptimal privacy decisions due to hurdles in decision making such as incomplete information, bounded rationality, and cognitive and behavioral biases. To address these two challenges, the theoretical framework of this dissertation is the concept of nudges: “soft paternalistic” behavioral interventions that do not restrict choice but account for decision making hurdles. Specifically, I designed app privacy <b>nudges</b> that primarily address the incomplete information hurdle. The <b>nudges</b> aim to help users make better privacy decisions by (1) increasing users’ awareness of privacy risks associated with apps, and (2) temporarily making privacy the primary task to motivate users to review and adjust their app settings. I evaluated app privacy <b>nudges</b> in three user studies. All three studies showed that app privacy <b>nudges</b> are indeed a promising approach to help users manage their privacy. App privacy <b>nudges</b> increased users’ awareness of privacy risks associated with apps on their phones, switched users’ attention to privacy management, and motivated users to review their app privacy settings. Additionally, the second study suggested that not all app privacy <b>nudge</b> contents equally help users manage their privacy. Rather, more effective <b>nudge</b> contents informed users of: (1) contexts in which their personal information has been accessed, (2) purposes for apps’ accessing their personal information, and (3) potential implications of secondary usage of users’ personal information. The third study showed that user engagement with <b>nudges</b> decreases as users receive repeated <b>nudges.</b> Nonetheless, the results of the third experiment also showed that users are more likely to engage with repeated <b>nudges</b> (1) if users have engaged with previous <b>nudges,</b> (2) if repeated <b>nudges</b> contain new in- formation (e. g., additional apps, not shown in earlier <b>nudges,</b> that accessed sensitive resources), or (3) if the <b>nudge</b> contents of repeated <b>nudges</b> resonate with users. The results of this dissertation suggest that mobile operating system providers should enrich their systems with app privacy <b>nudges</b> to assist users in managing their privacy. Additionally, the lessons learned in this dissertation may inform designing privacy <b>nudges</b> in emerging areas such as the Internet of Things...|$|R
