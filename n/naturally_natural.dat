5000|$|Everyday, roughly 4.2 {{trillion}} {{gallons of}} precipitation {{falls in the}} United States. About one fourth of that will make {{its way through the}} aquifers and become ground water. Shallow and permeable water tables tend to be more susceptible to contamination. In addition, the less rain an area receives the more concentrated the contamination will be. Evotranspiration can also decrease the amount of water moving downward. [...] Some aquifer susceptibility does happen <b>naturally.</b> <b>Natural</b> chemicals can seep through the aquifers from nearby soil and rocks. However, too much of this can be bad. One of the most common concerns is the amount of chloride and dissolved solids that are found in the water. Federal standards state the maximum for dissolved solids are 500 mg/L, and 250 mg/L for chloride. Dissolved solids and chloride are often found in coastal aquifers and in aquifers deeper than a few hundred feet. Iron and Magnesium can also affect the groundwater. It can also reduce the efficiency of well pumping.|$|E
40|$|Recovery {{rates of}} cyanobacterial-lichen soil crusts from {{disturbance}} were examined. Plots were either undisturbed or scalped, and scalped plots were either inoculated with surrounding biological crust material or left to recover <b>naturally.</b> <b>Natural</b> recovery rates {{were found to}} be very slow. Inoculation significantly hastened recovery for the cyanobacterial/green algal component, lichen cover, lichen species richness, and moss cover. Even with inoculation, however, lichen and moss recovery was minimal. Traditional techniques of assessing recovery visually were found to underestimate time for total recovery. Other techniques, such as extraction of chlorophyll a from surface soil and measurement of sheath material accumulation, were used and are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{material}} strength {{is dependent on}} micro structure {{in which there is}} no well-recognized idea to predict the complex structureprocess of fracture. For the fundamental simulation of metallic material, the embedded atom method (EAM) is exclusively practical along with satisfactory accuracy. Fracture simulation based on EA-cohesive (Embedded Atom Cohesive) model is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of natural fracture/decohesion mechanism compared with the prescribed fracture criteria and cohesive law. EA-cohesive model uses the Cauchy-Born rule to form the communication between the macro deformation and the micro structure evolution within the stable material region. The educed constitutive models within EA-cohesive model incorporate both normal and tangential cohesive laws with respect to the surface separation within the unstable material regions <b>naturally</b> (<b>natural</b> fracture/decohesion mechanism hereafter). Fracture simulation results of prototype high strength steel plate are presented to demonstrate the natural capacity of simulating fracture of EA-cohesive model...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{infection}} of humans with Leishmania parasites has {{contributed significantly to}} the understanding of the etiology, transmission, and pathogenesis of leishmaniasis and the im-munity associated with it. Leishmania organisms recovered from human and animal tissue, in-sect vectors, and in vitro cultures have all produced cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis in human subjects who were voluntarily inoculated with them. Volunteers bitten by infected Phlebotomine sandflies also developed cutaneous or visceral disease. In these experiments, it appeared that the parasite must undergo certain developmental changes within the sandfly for it to become infective and that the parasites in sandflies were far more efficient in causing full-blown infection than were cultured Leishmania organisms. The clinical manifestations of these experimental in-fections did not differ from infections that were acquired <b>naturally.</b> <b>Natural</b> or experimental in-fections appeared to confer resistance to subsequent leishmanial infection. This immunity was best documented to be a species-specific phenomenon; however, a small number of studies have demonstrated cross protection between some Leishmania species. In this reviewarticle, data from human experimental infections are summarized and discussed in light of recent advances in the field...|$|E
40|$|During 1992, {{alternative}} silvicultural {{systems were}} established in two areas of steep-sloped, old-growth forests {{on the west coast}} of the Queen Charlotte Islands. These systems consisted of single-tree selection (25 % basal area removal), two levels of group selection (25 % and 50 % area removed in rectangular groups, < 0. 3 ha in size), and clearcutting. An unlogged control area was applied at each site. Both forests, at Hangover and Gregory Creek, were within the CWHvh 2 biogeoclimatic zone and composed of western hemlock, Sitka spruce and western redcedar. A Sikorsky S- 64 E Skycrane helicopter yarded all treated sites, causing little disturbance to ground surfaces. Harvesting within the group selection treatments came closer than single-tree selection to meeting prescriptions. Single-tree selection tended to cut greater volume than prescribed. Residual tree damage attributed to harvesting was highest with the single-tree treatment (24. 8 % of trees damaged) and lowest in the 50 % and 25 % group selection treatments, with 15 % and 9. 5 % of trees damaged respectively. Natural regeneration composition was similar in all harvested treatments, with western hemlock representing from 74 % to 90 % of total regeneration and stocking exceeding maximum stocking based on current guidelines. Sitka spruce natural regeneration density was widely distributed but redcedar was the least reliable species to regenerate <b>naturally.</b> <b>Natural</b> regeneration density was lowest in the clearcut at both locations...|$|E
40|$|Quality of soil is {{critical}} for plant growth, and hence, important to agriculture. Management practices that are appropriate to improve soil characteristics and climate can enhance soil quality and its fertility. Natural soil management is a sustainable way of managing soil that benefits from recycling of natural resources. A field experiment was conducted at the Crop Farm, Eastern University, Sri Lanka to {{study the effects of}} natural and inorganic soil management practices during Yala 2010. Two separate plots having 50 square meter extent were selected for this experiment. One plot was managed <b>naturally</b> (<b>natural</b> soil) with mulching, green manuring and application of soil amendments (Jiwamirta and Amutha karaisal) whereas other plot (inorganic soil) was managed based on the recommendations of Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka including chemical fertilizers. Five soil samples from each plot were analyzed for soil properties namely moisture content (MC), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total nitrogen, available potassium and phosphorus and organic matter (OM). Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS. Natural soil consisted significantly (P < 0. 05) higher MC than the inorganic soil. The natural soil had a neutral pH while the inorganic soil was acidic. OM content, EC, total nitrogen and available potassium were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in natural soil. However, available phosphorus was significantly lower in natural soil. Therefore, it could be concluded that natural soil management practices improved soil properties better than inorganic practices which could be environmental friendly and economically beneficial for the farmers...|$|E

However, for high-performance interactive manipulation of a manifold, it is much simpler and more practical to have a parametric representation instead of an implicit equation that must be solved numerically; a significant additional feature of many parametric representations is that they embody symmetry information that can be used to further enhance the visualization process.
