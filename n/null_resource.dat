40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new method to produce low {{overhead}} redundant bits used to detect transmission errors of J 2 K streams on noisy communication channels. This method takes advantage of algorithms already existing on the JPEG 2000 standard and does not require any intrusive alterations on the coder. We will show {{that it is possible}} to improve standard JPEG 2000 error resilience in exchange for <b>null</b> <b>resource</b> footprint. Remark that this capability can be very important, for example in wireless communications that are mainly used by mobile devices with small processing capabilities...|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{the genes}} {{responsible}} for common human diseases promises {{to be one of}} the most significant advances in medical knowledge and treatment. To date, the numerous attempts to identify the genes responsible for complex and multi-factorial common diseases have met with only a handful of successes. The key to calculating the optimal effort and ideal. approach to successful identifications ties with understanding the likely allelic spectrum of the target disease. The allelic spectrum describes the number of disease loci and the frequency of each disease allele. It has been implicitly assumed that disease spectra are biased towards either commonness or rareness relative to the allelic spectrum of the overall human genome. We present a hypothesis that the allelic spectra of common diseases are generally similar to the spectrum that characterizes the entire genome. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that only a few loci have major significance to familial disease risks and that there may be many disease loci which each make a minor contribution to a disease. Additionally, although relatively few alleles of the human genome have been examined for disease involvement, current estimates of the number of disease genes are very high. Because selection will have been operating only weakly and for a relatively short time on most of the alleles associated with complex diseases, spectra that are characteristic of near-neutral selection may well apply. We thus propose that the hitherto neglected hypothesis that puts the likely allelic spectra of common diseases in the middle ground between the prevailing hypotheses of spectral skew towards rareness or commonness is the most likely. By using this hypothesis as the <b>null,</b> research <b>resources</b> may be optimally allocated and greater success in identifying disease genes may be achieved. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{points of}} a graph G will form {{clusters}} {{as a result}} of a flow process. Initially, points i of G own resources x(i) which are i. i. d. random real numbers. Afterwards, resources flow between points, but always from a point to a neighbor that has accumulated a larger total resource. Thus points with small resource tend to lose it and points with large resource tend to gain. Eventually the flow stops with only two kinds of points, <b>nulls</b> with no <b>resource</b> left and absorbers with such large resource that no neighbor can take it. The final resource at an absorber is a sum of certain initial resources x(i), and the corresponding points i form one cluster. Analytical results are obtainable when G is the chain of integer points on the line. Probability distributions are derived for the distance between consecutive absorbers and the size of a cluster. Indeed these distributions do not involve the given distribution for the x(i). The Laplace transform of the distribution of final resources at absorbers is derived but the distribution itself is obtained by a simulation. For general graphs G only partial results are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Ontogenetic {{influences}} {{in patterns of}} niche breadth and feeding overlap were investigated in three species of Siluriformes (Heptapterus sp., Rhamdia quelen and Trichomycterus poikilos) aiming at understanding the species coexistence. Samplings were conducted bimonthly by electrofishing technique from June/ 2012 to June/ 2013 in ten streams of the northwestern state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The stomach contents of 1, 948 individuals were analyzed by volumetric method, with 59 food items identified. In general Heptapterus sp. consumed {{a high proportion of}} Aegla sp., terrestrial plant remains and Megaloptera; R. quelen consumed fish, and Oligochaeta, followed by Aegla sp.; while the diet of T. poikilos was based on Simuliidae, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera. Specie segregation was observed in the NMDS. Through PERMANOVA analysis feeding differences among species, and between a combination of species plus size classes were observed. IndVal showed which items were indicators of these differences. Niche breadth values were high for all species. The niche breadth values were low only for the larger size of R. quelen and Heptapterus sp. while T. poikilos values were more similar. Overall the species were a low feeding overlap values. The higher frequency of high feeding overlap was observed for interaction between Heptapterus sp. and T. poikilos. The null model confirmed the niche partitioning between the species. The higher frequency of high and intermediate feeding overlap values were reported to smaller size classes. The <b>null</b> model showed <b>resource</b> sharing between the species/size class. Therefore, overall species showed a resource partitioning because of th...|$|R
