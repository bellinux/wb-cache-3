5|$|Comets 42P/Neujmin and 53P/Van Biesbroeck {{appear to}} be {{fragments}} of a parent comet. Numerical integrations have shown that both comets had a rather close approach to Jupiter in January 1850, and that, before 1850, the two orbits were <b>nearly</b> <b>identical.</b>|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E

5|$|The Takovo Uprising is {{the title}} of two <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> oil {{paintings}} by the Serbian realist Paja Jovanović. They depict rebel leader Miloš Obrenović inciting his countrymen against the Ottoman Empire and initiating the Second Serbian Uprising.|$|E
5|$|The two U-43-class U-boats were <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> to {{the eight}} boats of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-27 class, which were built to UB II plans. Despite the similarities, {{the two groups}} are {{identified}} in sources as distinct classes.|$|E
5|$|The variety Lactarius fallax var. concolor is <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> to {{the main}} species in {{appearance}} and distribution, but has gill edges that are colored like the gill face.|$|E
50|$|The B4 Passat was a face lifted B3 (receiving its own {{generation}} number is controversial), remaining <b>nearly</b> mechanically <b>identical,</b> but with entirely new sheetmetal, and an updated interior design.|$|R
5000|$|... the supine or, in some texts, {{the perfect}} passive participle, which are <b>nearly</b> always <b>identical.</b> Texts that {{commonly}} list the perfect passive participle use the future active participle for intransitive verbs. Some verbs lack this principal part altogether.|$|R
50|$|Plecanatide is a 16 {{amino acid}} peptide with the amino acid sequence: H-Asn1-Asp2-Glu3-Cys4-Glu5-Leu6-Cys7-Val8-Asn9-Val10-Ala11-Cys12-Thr13-Gly14-Cys15-Leu16-OHIs <b>nearly</b> {{structurally}} <b>identical</b> to human uroguanylin, {{apart from the}} substitution of Asp3 with Glu3.

5|$|Kong's New York stage {{appearance}} {{looks very}} much like a re-enactment of the 1933 film's sacrifice scene, including the posts the 'beauty' is tied to and the <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> performance and costumes of the dancers. In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that scene is Max Steiner's original score for the 1933 film.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{have their}} termini located close together in 3D space. Because of this, {{it is often}} possible to design circular permutations of proteins. Today, circular permutations are generated routinely in the lab using standard genetics techniques. Although some permutation sites prevent the protein from folding correctly, many permutants have been created with <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> structure and function to the original protein.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> ultimata {{were issued}} to Latvia and Estonia, {{although}} they were given only eight hours to respond. With Lithuania already in Soviet hands, armed resistance in Latvia or Estonia was even more futile. All three states were occupied and lost their independence.|$|E
50|$|The screenplay, {{attributed}} to Noel Langley, was <b>nearly</b> word-for-word <b>identical</b> {{to the one}} used in the 1937 version, which was by John L. Balderston, adapted by Wells Root, from the Hope novel and the stage play by Edward Rose, with additional dialogue by Donald Ogden Stewart.|$|R
5000|$|The 307 Winchester {{cartridge}} {{was introduced}} by Winchester in 1982 {{to meet the demand}} of [...]300 Savage performance in a lever-action rifle equipped with a tubular magazine.

40|$|A {{series of}} exactly {{solvable}} non-trivial complex potentials (possessing real spectra) are generated {{by applying the}} Darboux transformation to the excited eigenstates of a non-Hermitian potential V(x). This method yields {{an infinite number of}} non-trivial partner potentials, defined over the whole real line, whose spectra are <b>nearly</b> exactly <b>identical</b> to the original potential...|$|R
5|$|The 2013 season saw a <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> {{season to}} 2012. The Crusaders {{made the playoffs}} {{with a record of}} 11 wins and 5 losses. In the {{qualifier}} round the Crusaders crushed the Reds 38-9. However, they were defeated again by the (eventual champion) Chiefs 20-19 in the semi-final, played in Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|The Plaza of the Seven Temples is to {{the west}} of the South Acropolis. It is bordered on the east side by a row of <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> temples, by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side.|$|E
5|$|The finale {{completes the}} {{interconnectedness}} {{of the work}} with a theme audibly {{similar to those of}} the first movement and the minuet and trio.

40|$|Abstract We {{illustrate}} {{the convenience of}} a long-lasting microgravity environment to study flows of granular materials with and without gas interaction. We consider collisional granular flows of <b>nearly</b> elastic <b>identical</b> spheres in an axisymmetric Couette channel featuring two cylindrical moving bumpy boundaries and two flat walls. We review governing equations for these flows, {{illustrate the}}ir solutions and compare them with numerical simulations...|$|R
50|$|The opioid {{receptor}} types are <b>nearly</b> 70% <b>identical,</b> with the differences {{located at the}} N and C termini. The μ receptor {{is perhaps the most}} important. It is thought that the G protein binds to the third intracellular loop of all {{opioid receptor}}s. Both in mice and humans, the genes for the various receptor subtypes are located on separate chromosomes.|$|R
25|$|The D.C. Commissioners advertised for {{construction}} bids on May 8, 1909. Eight bids were received, with Cranford Paving Company receiving the contract. Design {{of the second}} span was <b>nearly</b> the <b>identical</b> to the first, and Captain Edward M. Markham (assistant to the engineer commissioner) and C.B. Hunt (D.C. Engineer of Highways) oversaw the construction. The estimated time for completion of the span was January 1, 1910.|$|R
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements {{and the fact that}} its composition is <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> to that of Earth's crust.|$|E
5|$|William Hunt, the onsite {{architect}} {{employed to}} oversee Blore's design, while remaining faithful to Blore's overall plans, {{was not afraid}} to alter them. Most notably, the Western Gatehouse, the main approach to the palace, was intended to have octagonal towers, but Hunt redesigned the gatehouse in an English 14th-century castle style, with solid round towers and machicolations, <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> to the towers at Bodiam Castle, East Sussex.|$|E
5|$|A <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> re-impression {{was made}} in 1866 on laid paper which are {{distinguished}} by slightly different dimensions. Further re-impressions date to 1895. The Epaulettes have also subsequently {{been the subject of}} various commemorative stamps. The Epaulettes featured as part of the design of stamps issued by Belgium in 1925 and 1972. For their 100th and 150th anniversary, in 1949 and 1999, the Belgian postal service published commemorative series.|$|E
50|$|Citrus {{taxonomy}} is complex. Cultivated citrus {{are derived}} from various citrus species found in the wild. Some are only selections of the original wild types, while others are hybrids between two or more ancestors. Citrus plants hybridize easily between species with completely different morphologies, and similar-looking citrus fruits may have quite different ancestries. Conversely, different-looking varieties may be <b>nearly</b> genetically <b>identical,</b> and differ only by a bud mutation.|$|R
50|$|Modern banana {{plants are}} {{reproduced}} asexually, through replanting the plant's basal shoot that grows {{after the original}} plant has been cut down. The fruit contains no seeds, nor does the male flower produce pollen suitable for pollination, prohibiting sexual reproduction. This causes all bananas of a single breed to be <b>nearly</b> genetically <b>identical.</b> The fungus is able to spread easily from plant to plant as the individual plants' defenses are near identical.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{the first}} {{generation}} is <b>nearly</b> mechanically <b>identical</b> to the Toyota Hilux. All first generation 4Runners had two doors and were indistinguishable from the pickups from the dashboard forward. Nearly all changes were to {{the latter half of}} the body; in fact, because the rear springs were not upgraded to bear the additional weight from the rear seats and fiberglass top, these early models tended to suffer from a sagging rear suspension.|$|R
5|$|A new wing {{was added}} in early 1980 to provide {{additional}} space for the arts, with a large room for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open {{east side of the}} courtyard, the design is <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E
5|$|As {{tetravalent}} transition metals, {{all three}} elements form various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +4. For {{the first three}} metals, {{it has been shown}} that they are resistant to concentrated alkalis, but halogens react with them to form tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, all three metals react with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Because of the lanthanide contraction of the elements in the fifth period, zirconium and hafnium have <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> ionic radii. The ionic radius of Zr4+ is 79picometers and that of Hf4+ is 78pm.|$|E
5|$|At 03:49 on {{the morning}} of August 9, 1945, Bockscar, flown by Sweeney's crew, carried Fat Man, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the {{secondary}} target. The mission plan for the second attack was <b>nearly</b> <b>identical</b> to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney took off with his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged.|$|E
5000|$|Due to a timing {{conflict}} with the C64's video chip, the C64 doesn't work properly with the 1540. The better-known 1541 is mechanically and <b>nearly</b> electronically <b>identical</b> to the 1540 but has a revised ROM that permits it {{to work with the}} C64 by slowing the drive down slightly. However, it is possible to revert the 1541 into 1540 mode with a Commodore BASIC software command (...) to permit better speed when used with a VIC-20.|$|R
50|$|MINA.MINERVA is {{a journey}} through the tumultuous {{relationship}} of two very feisty twins. When a petty argument <b>nearly</b> pushes sixty-five-year-old <b>identical</b> twin sisters Mina and Minerva to fisticuffs, decades of unaired baggage threatens to implode their already strained relationship.|$|R
40|$|Biofuels {{utilizing}} algae as a feedstock processes the algae’s chloroplasts {{to transform}} the plant into oil that is <b>nearly</b> chemically <b>identical</b> to crude oil. Algae can grow using only available raw materials including sunlight, carbon dioxide and nutrients from wastewater. Algae can {{play a major role}} in the treatment/utilization of major wastewater and reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. High upfront costs, outdated technology, and non-existing incentives are the main reasons algae as a feedstock is currently an unpopular choice for biofuel...|$|R
