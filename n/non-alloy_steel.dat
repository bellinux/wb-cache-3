40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this project}} is {{development}} of the contemporary gradient materials using the powder metallurgy methods to ensure the required properties {{and structure of the}} designed material. Design/methodology/approach: The materials were fabricated with the conventional powder metallurgy method consisting in compacting the powder in the closed die and finally sintering it. Forming methods were developed for the HS 6 - 5 - 2 high-speed steel and <b>non-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> powders, making it possible to obtain materials with three layers, and later - after their further modification - with six layers in their structure. Findings: It was found out basing on the microhardness tests that hardness of test pieces grows along with the sintering temperature and with carbon content in the interface and non-alloy layers. It was also observed that porosity decreases along with the carbon content in these layers. It was found out, basing on the comparison of structures and properties of the compacted and sintered test pieces, that in structures of all examined test pieces in the sintered state fine carbides occurred distributed homogeneously in the high-speed steel layer. Research limitations/implications: It was noticed, that increase of the sintering temperature results in the uncontrolled growth and coagulation of the primary carbides and melting up to forming of eutectics in layers consisting of the high-speed steel. Practical implications: Material presented in this paper has layers consisting on one side from the <b>non-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> with hardness growing with the increase of carbon content, {{and on the other side}} the high-speed steel, characteristic of the high ductility. Such material is tested for turning tools. Originality/value: The layers were poured in such way that the first layers consisted of the <b>non-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> and the last one from the high-speed steel, and were compacted next. The layers inside the material are mixes of the high-speed steel and <b>non-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> powders in the relevant proportions...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this work}} is to obtain the {{gradient}} materials based on the non-alloyed steel reinforced high-speed steel using the conventional powder metallurgy method and pressureless forming powder metallurgy.

40|$|The {{paper is}} based on results {{obtained}} from topography of surfaces of sheets rolled from deep-drawing steel of the type KOHAL grade 697, <b>non-alloy</b> low-carbon structural <b>steel</b> EN 10263 - 2 : 2004 and aluminium. The presented results document correctness of {{the assumption that the}} rolling force Froll increases with the increasing reduction Î”h {{and the quality of the}} rolled surface is improved at the simultaneous increasing of strength of rolled sheets and the decreasing of size of structural grains. The experiment was performed on the two-high rolling stand DUO 210 SVa, which enables only non-continuous technology in contrast to the rolling mill with continuous reduction on one sheet in several degrees on rolling trains, in consequence of which the obtained height parameters of the section are in close correlation with the predicted dependence. Contribution of the work consists in the creation of a mathematical model (algorithm) for predicting technological parameters of the two-high rolling stand DUO 210 SVa at change of the absolute reduction Î”h, for example for a deep-drawing steel of the type KOHAL grade 697 and <b>non-alloy</b> lowcarbon structural <b>steel</b> PN EN 10263 - 2 : 2004 and aluminium, and also in the development of a method of calculation applicable to any material being rolled in general, because the authors have found that various materials can be differentiated by a derived analytical criterion IKP. This criterion is a function of ratio between the modulus of elasticity of reference material and that of actually rolled material. The reference material is here deep-drawing steel of the type KOHAL grade 697. Verification was carried out by measuring changes of final surface roughness profile and final strength of rolled sheets of the stated materials in relation to reductions and those were compared with theoretically predicted values. It is possible to identify and predict on the basis of this algorithm an instant state of surface topography in respect to variable technological conditions. On this basis it is then possible to calculate and plot individual main technological parameters. Web of Science 14315114...|$|R
