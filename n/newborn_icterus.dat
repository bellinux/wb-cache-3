40|$|In {{the last}} few years the close {{association}} of hydrops fetalis, congenital anemia of the <b>newborn,</b> <b>icterus</b> gravis neonatorum, and erythroblastosis fetalis has been stressed because of the occurrence of these pathological processes in various combinations in individual children and on some occasions in several of the offspring of one family. The opportunity for observing individually the children of a family thus afflicted has not often presented itself. The object of the present paper is to report the case histories of four siblings delivered in the New Haven Hospital, the first-born of whom had gross congenital anomalies; the second, icterus gravis neonatorum and kernicterus; and the third and fourth, icterus gravis, congenital anemia, and erythroblastosis fetalis. The case studies that have been previously reported in the literature have been adequately summarized in 1932 by Diamond, Blackfan and Baty, 1 who added one of their own, and more recently by Hawksley and Lightwood in 1934. 2 Pasachoff and Wilson, 4 and Netter 8 in this country have subsequently published additional familial case studies. The parents of the siblings in the present report were in normal health and were not blood relatives. Both had negative Kahn tests on blood serum. The mother had scarlet fever and diphtheria in childhood; her menstrual history revealed nothing unusual. She was twenty-eight years old when she married and was pregnant thirteen months later. Abstracts of the case histories of the children are as follows, and are given in the order of their births. No other pregnancies are known to have occurred. Case 1. (N. H. H. No. 60, 500). The first pregnancy was uneventful except for severe nausea. and vomiting during the early months. After thirteen hours of normal labor the infant was delivered by cesarean section becaus...|$|E
40|$|Background: Newborn {{screening}} is an {{area with}} potential for immense impact in lifelong morbidity and mortality. Objective: To determine cost effective for glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 -PD) enzyme screening and prevalence of deficiency in newborns and children in Tehran, Iran. Materials and Methods: All full term <b>newborns,</b> neonates with <b>icterus</b> and children with acute hemolysis were evaluated to determine prevalence of G- 6 -PD enzyme deficiency and cost effectiveness of a screening test for G- 6 -PD enzyme deficiency. The qualitative color reduction test performed on healthy newborns and quantitative test on <b>newborns</b> with <b>icterus</b> and children with acute hemolysis. Results: Three (2 %) of 146 screened newborns were G- 6 -PD deficient {{at a cost of}} $ 18 for three positive screening tests and $ 856 for 143 unaffected newborns Thirty-one (11. 4 %) of 272 <b>newborns</b> readmitted with <b>icterus</b> were G- 6 -PD deficient with a cost of 31 tests were $ 186 and $ 1446 for unaffected newborns. The only significant difference between G- 6 -PD deficient and normal newborns was bilirubin level (p < 0. 001). Eleven (0. 2 %) of 5054 hospitalized children were found to be G- 6 -PD deficient at a screening cost of $ 66 and $ 3. 258 for remainder children. The prevalence of G- 6 -PD is estimated to be approximately 2. 4 % and 2. 2 % in males and females respectively. Conclusion: Glucose- 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase screening in newborns is not cost effective and for prevention of hemolysis during the next years all <b>newborns</b> admitted with <b>icterus</b> should be evaluated for G- 6 -PD enzyme deficiency...|$|R
40|$|This is the {{clinical}} {{history of a}} term baby born at home who presents a severe hyperbilirubinémia. The medical monitoring was assessed by a private midwife according to parental choice. On {{the third day of}} life, the <b>newborn</b> presented an <b>icterus</b> and was exposed to natural daylight in the familial greenhouse under the midwife recommandations. On that day, no laboratory test precised the bilirubin level. On the fifth day, a blood sampling revealed a very high blood bilirubinémia (31 mg/dl or 527 mmol/L), the baby is refered to our NICU and underwent an exchange transfusion. The radiological assessment report structural abnomalies in basal ganglia seen on both MRI and transfontannellar echography. These lesions are known to be responsible of cerebral palsy and hearing loos. The neurophysiologic investigations showed background abnormaly and depression. The extensive blood sampling excluded haemolysis. The clinical examination brought out neurologic impairement and weight loos in this exclusively breastfed baby. This clinical case point out the increasing risk of home Kernicterius as hospital stays diminish and homebirth enthousiasm rise up. The present clinical situation vouches for an adaptation of care giving to both mother and child at home in order to avoid this severe illness. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
