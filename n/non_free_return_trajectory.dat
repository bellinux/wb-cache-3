5000|$|In {{some cases}} it is {{possible}} to design a TLI to target a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory,</b> so that the spacecraft will loop around behind the Moon and return to Earth without need for further propulsive maneuvers. [...] Such <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectories</b> add a margin of safety to human spaceflight missions, since the spacecraft will return to Earth [...] "for free" [...] after the initial TLI burn.|$|R
50|$|A {{variant of}} this maneuver, the <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> allows the {{spacecraft}} {{to depart from}} a planet, circle another planet once, {{and return to the}} starting planet using propulsion only during the initial departure burn. Although in theory it is possible to execute a perfect <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory,</b> in practice small correction burns are often necessary during the flight. Even though it does not require a burn for the return trip, other <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> types, such as an aerodynamic turn, can result in a lower total delta-v for the mission.|$|R
50|$|On September 15, 1968 the RD-0214 module {{launched}} the Zond 5 around the Moon on a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory,</b> {{that sent the}} first alive organisms around the moon and back to Earth.|$|R
50|$|A trans-Earth {{injection}} (TEI) is a propulsion maneuver {{used to set}} {{a spacecraft}} on a trajectory which will intersect the Earth's Sphere of influence, usually putting the spacecraft on a <b>Free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{circumlunar}} trajectory, trans-lunar <b>trajectory</b> or lunar <b>free</b> <b>return</b> {{is a type}} of <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> {{which takes}} a spacecraft from Earth, around {{the far side of the}} Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set.|$|R
50|$|On 15 September 1968 the RD-0210, RD-0211 and the RD-0212 module {{launched}} the Zond 5 around the Moon on a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory,</b> {{that sent the}} first alive organisms around the moon and back to Earth.|$|R
50|$|Spacecraft {{trajectory}} - During early Apollo program {{missions to}} the Moon, the spacecraft {{was put on}} a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> — if the engines had failed at lunar orbit insertion, the craft would have safely coasted back to Earth.|$|R
5000|$|In Episode Four {{the narrator}} states that [...] "if they (Apollo 8) fail to lock into the moon's orbit they will fly on, forever lost in space". In fact, Apollo 8 used a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> {{that would have}} taken them back to Earth had the engine {{performing}} lunar orbit injection failed.|$|R
40|$|<b>Free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectories</b> in earth-Mars mission {{opportunities}} between 2000 and 2020 {{are identified}} and tradeoffs in mission design involving such trajectories are considered. A method {{of searching for}} trajectories containing no deterministic maneuvers is developed which is suitable for generating contours. Sample contours are presented for the trajectories and are used to show the variations in trajectory parameters found in the real world...|$|R
50|$|Like Zond, Apollo Moon {{flights were}} {{generally}} launched on a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> that would <b>return</b> them to Earth via a circumlunar loop {{in the event}} that a Service Module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only manned circumlunar loop mission flown to date.|$|R
50|$|Until 2017, EM-2 was a {{projected}} single-launch mission of a Space Launch System Block IB with an Exploration Upper Stage, lunar Block 1 Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), and a payload insertion of 50.7 t. It {{was to be}} an eight-day mission with a crew of four astronauts, sent on a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> around the Moon, to visit a captured asteroid in lunar orbit.|$|R
5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory,</b> keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit, {{which would allow}} a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion. Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2017, Elon Musk {{announced}} that substantial deposits from two individuals had been received by Space X for a Moon loop flight using a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> {{and that this}} could happen as soon as late 2018. Musk said {{that the cost of}} the mission would be [...] "comparable" [...] to that of sending an astronaut to the International Space Station, about $70 million US dollars in 2017.|$|R

50|$|A three-body problem also {{arises from}} the {{situation}} of a spacecraft and two relevant celestial bodies, e.g. the Earth and the Moon, such as when considering a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> around the Moon, or other trans-lunar injection. While a spaceflight involving a gravity assist tends {{to be at least}} a four-body problem (spacecraft, Earth, Sun, Moon), once far away from the Earth when Earth's gravity becomes negligible, it is approximately a three-body problem.|$|R
50|$|Space {{tourism is}} space travel for recreational, leisure or {{business}} purposes. To date only orbital space tourism {{has taken place}} provided by the Russian Space Agency, although work continues developing sub-orbital space tourism vehicles by Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. In addition, SpaceX announced in 2017 that they are planning on sending two space tourists on a lunar <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> in 2018 aboard their Dragon V2 spacecraft launched by the Falcon Heavy rocket.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{spacecraft}} traveled using free-return trajectory on October 4, 1959 was Russian «Луна-3» (Moon-3). Then, <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectories</b> {{were introduced}} by Arthur Schwaniger of NASA in 1963 {{with reference to}} the Earth-Moon system. Limiting the discussion to the case of the Earth and the Moon, if the trajectory at some point crosses the line going through the centre of the Earth and the centre of the moon, then we can distinguish between: ...|$|R
50|$|However, Apollo 13 {{had left}} its initial <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> {{earlier in the}} mission, as {{required}} for the planned lunar landing at Fra Mauro. Therefore, {{the first order of}} business was to re-establish the <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> with a 30.7-sec. burn of the Lunar Module Descent Engine (LMDE). The descent engine was used again two hours after pericynthion, the closest approach to the Moon ("PC+2 burn"), to speed the return to earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. A more aggressive burn could have been performed at PC+2 by first jettisoning the Service Module, returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort,p. III-20 but this plan was rejected since it would require leaving the command module's heat shield exposed to the extreme temperatures of space, it would virtually deplete the DPS's propellant supply (leaving nothing for midcourse correction burns), and it would result in Apollo 13 landing in the Atlantic Ocean where the US Navy had no recovery ships placed. The 4-min. 24-sec. burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed before Earth reentry.|$|R
5000|$|It {{consisted}} of a DFH-3A [...] "Chang'e 2 type" [...] spacecraft featuring the Chang'e 5 return capsule, launched by a Long March 3C rocket into a lunar <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory.</b> It looped behind the Moon and returned to Earth, with the return capsule testing the high speed atmospheric skip reentry. The DFH-3A [...] "service module" [...] remained in orbit around the Earth before being relocated via Earth-Moon L2 to lunar orbit by 13 January 2015, where it will use its remaining 800 kg of fuel to test maneuvers key to future lunar missions.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet Union {{sent the}} first {{spacecraft}} to {{the vicinity of}} the Moon, the robotic vehicle Luna 1, on January 4, 1959. [...] It passed within 6,000 km of the Moon's surface, but did not achieve lunar orbit. [...] Luna 3, launched on October 4, 1959, was the first robotic spacecraft to complete a circumlunar <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory,</b> still not a lunar orbit, but a figure-8 trajectory which swung around {{the far side of the}} Moon and returned to the Earth. This craft provided the first pictures of the far side of the Lunar surface.|$|R
25|$|In September 2016, CEO Elon Musk {{unveiled}} the mission {{architecture of the}} Interplanetary Transport System program, an ambitious privately funded initiative to develop spaceflight technology for use in manned interplanetary spaceflight, and which, if demand emerges, could lead to sustainable human settlements on Mars over the long term. This is the main purpose this System was designed for. In 2017, Elon Musk announced {{that the company had}} been contracted by two private individuals to send them in a Dragon spacecraft on a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> around the Moon. Provisionally launching in 2018, this could become the first instance of lunar tourism.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to aim a spacecraft from Earth {{so that it will}} loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory.</b> Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.|$|R
50|$|The {{missions}} 4 through 8 were {{test flights}} under for the Soviet Moonshot during the Moon race. The Soyuz 7K-L1 (also mentioned just as L1) spacecraft {{was used for}} the Moon-aimed missions, stripped down to make it possible to launch around the Moon from the Earth. They were launched on the Proton rocket which was just powerful enough to send the Zond on a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> around the Moon without going into lunar orbit (the type path that Apollo 13 flew in its emergency abort). With minor modification, Zond was capable of carrying two cosmonauts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second stage}} (S-II) of the Saturn V rocket {{used in the}} American Apollo program used four (originally eight) ullage motors located on the aft {{interstage}} skirt. In the S-IVB third stage, there was an Auxiliary Propulsion System that also had ullage functions. Ullage is often a secondary function of the reaction control system such as on the Apollo Lunar Module (LM). In his book Lost Moon, Jim Lovell recounted {{a description of a}} course-correction burn of the LEM's main descent engine to re-enter a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> to Earth during the successful recovery of the Apollo 13 capsule: ...|$|R
5000|$|Using the LM as a [...] "life boat" [...] {{providing}} battery power, oxygen, and propulsion, Lovell and {{his crew}} re-established the <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> that they had left, and swung around the Moon to return home. Based on the flight controllers' calculations made on Earth, Lovell had to adjust the course two times by manually controlling the Lunar Module's thrusters and engine, using his watch for timing. Apollo 13 returned safely to Earth on April 17. Lovell {{is one of only}} three men to travel to the Moon twice, but unlike John Young and Eugene Cernan, he never walked on it.|$|R
2500|$|Space {{tourism is}} space travel for recreational, leisure or {{business}} purposes. There are several {{different types of}} space tourism, including orbital, sub orbital and lunar space tourism. To date [...] orbital space tourism has been performed only by the Russian Space Agency. Work also continues towards developing sub-orbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. In addition, SpaceX (an aerospace manafacturer) announced in 2017 that they are planning on sending two space tourists on a lunar <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> aboard their Dragon V2 spacecraft [...] in 2018.The spacecraft will be launched by the Falcon Heavy rocket.|$|R
2500|$|TRW {{designed}} and built the descent engine or (LMDE) for the Apollo lunar lander. [...] Due {{to the need for}} a soft landing on the Moon, it was the first throttleable engine for manned space flight. [...] This, and the requirements for high thrust, low weight, and crushability (in case of landing on a large rock), earned surprising praise from NASA's history pages, considering the complexity of the lunar missions: [...] "The lunar module descent engine probably was the biggest challenge and the most outstanding technical development of Apollo". [...] This engine was used on Apollo 13 to achieve <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> and make a minor course correction after damage to the Service Module.|$|R
50|$|Edward Belbruno and Rex Ridenoure {{heard about}} the problem and {{proposed}} a 3-5 month low energy transfer trajectory that would swing past the moon and leave the satellite in geostationary orbit around the earth. Hughes had no ability to track the satellite at such a distance, and considered this trajectory concept unworkable. Instead, Hughes used an Apollo-style <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> that required {{only a few days}} to complete, a trajectory designed and subsequently patented by Hughes Chief Technologist Jerry Salvatore. This maneuver removed only 40 degrees of orbital inclination and left the satellite in a geosynchronous orbit, whereas the Belbruno maneuver would have removed all 51 degrees of inclination and left it in geostationary orbit.|$|R

40|$|Abort trajectories are {{optimized}} for human halo orbit missions about the translunar libration point (L 2), {{with an emphasis}} on the use of <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectories.</b> Optimal transfers from outbound <b>free</b> <b>returns</b> to L 2 halo orbits are numerically optimized in the four-body ephemeris model. Circumlunar <b>free</b> <b>returns</b> are used for direct transfers, and cislunar <b>free</b> <b>returns</b> are used in combination with lunar gravity assists to reduce propulsive requirements. Trends in orbit insertion cost and flight time are documented across the southern L 2 halo family as a function of halo orbit position and <b>free</b> <b>return</b> flight time. It is determined that the maximum amplitude southern halo incurs the lowest orbit insertion cost for direct transfers but the maximum cost for lunar gravity assist transfers. The minimum amplitude halo is the most expensive destination for direct transfers but the least expensive for lunar gravity assist transfers. The on-orbit abort costs for three halos are computed as a function of abort time and return time. Finally, an architecture analysis is performed to determine launch and on-orbit vehicle requirements for halo orbit missions...|$|R
2500|$|The Europa Life Signature Assayer (ELSA) concept {{consists}} of a probe that is flown as a secondary payload. ELSA would use a small impactor to create a plume of subsurface particles and catapult them to altitudes {{where it would be}} able to pass through to collect samples and analyze them on board. [...] A variation of this concept is the 1996 Ice Clipper, which involves a 10 kg impactor that would be jettisoned from the main spacecraft to impact Europa, thereby creating a debris cloud in nearby space about 100 km altitude, subsequently sampled by a small spacecraft on a close flyby and use Europa's gravitational force for a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory.</b> The collection mechanism is tentatively considered to be Aerogel (similar to Stardust mission).|$|R
2500|$|Haise flew as the Lunar Module Pilot on the aborted Apollo 13 lunar {{mission in}} 1970. [...] Due to the <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory</b> on this mission, Haise, Jim Lovell and Jack Swigert, {{the other two}} astronauts on Apollo 13, likely hold {{the record for the}} {{farthest}} distance from the Earth ever traveled by human beings. Haise was slated to become the sixth human to walk on the Moon during Apollo 13 behind Lovell, who was to be fifth. Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell eventually became the fifth and sixth, respectively, on Apollo 14, which completed Apollo 13's mission to the Fra Mauro formation. During this flight Fred developed a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) and later kidney infections. These caused him to be in pain for most of the trip.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel global {{optimisation}} approach {{is used to}} search for potentially interesting solutions for a mission to Mars. The approach blends the characteristics of evolutionary algorithms with the systematic search, typical of branching 11 techniques. Solutions for a roundtrip to Mars, either direct or via Venus, considering long and short stays on Mars or <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectories</b> are considered, thus providing a comprehensive view of all the opportunities within {{a wide range of}} possible 13 launch dates. Finally, electric propulsion options are investigated including the possibility of using Mars’ Lagrangian points for a low cost capture. The proposed global search was effectively able to find globally minimal Av solutions for Earth–Mars 15 roundtrips giving the expected characterisation of the problem under study. Moreover, it will be shown how the method was able to automatically rediscover known solutions along with new ones of practical interest for future Mars exploration...|$|R
40|$|Combustion and rupture of {{a liquid}} oxygen tank during the Apollo 13 mission {{provides}} lessons and insights for future spacecraft designers and operations personnel who may never, during their careers, {{have participated in}} saving a vehicle and crew during a spacecraft emergency. Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) challenges were the reestablishment of attitude control after the oxygen tank incident, re-establishment of a <b>free</b> <b>return</b> <b>trajectory,</b> resolution of a ground tracking conflict between the LM and the Saturn V S-IVB stage, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) alignments, maneuvering to burn attitudes, attitude control during burns, and performing manual GNC tasks with most vehicle systems powered down. Debris illuminated by the Sun and gaseous venting from the Service Module (SM) complicated crew attempts to identify stars and prevented execution of nominal IMU alignment procedures. Sightings on the Sun, Moon, and Earth were used instead. Near continuous communications with Mission Control enabled the crew to quickly perform time critical procedures. Overcoming these challenges required the modification of existing contingency procedures...|$|R
