40|$|Contact (allergic) {{dermatitis}} is a {{skin disorder}} related to natural exposure to various allergens. Systemic contact dermatitis (SCD) describes a cutaneous eruption {{in response to}} systemic exposure to an allergen. The exact pathologic mechanism remains uncertain. Herein we describe a 36 -year-old woman with symmetric systemic allergic contact dermatitis, unresponsive to conventional treatment, associated with dental alloy-contact hypersensitivity. We did skin patch testing and the blood lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) from the dental allergen series to assess contact allergy to restorative dental materials. On patch testing, positive allergic contact dermatitis reactions to metals occurred (<b>nickel,</b> potassium <b>dichromate,</b> and gold). <b>Nickel</b> hypersensitivity was confirmed by LTT, which also revealed silver-amalgam sensitization. Our case report highlights the need to consider adverse reactions to base-metal dental alloys in the differential diagnosis of cases of systemic allergic contact dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hand eczema {{is one of}} the commonest eczemas {{encountered}} in dermatology practice. Contact allergens responsible for causing hand eczema vary from one geographical area of the world to another. Aim: The study tries to identify the commonest allergens causing hand eczema in ethnic Kashmiri population. Material and Methods: A total of 800 patients were patch tested at a sole patch testing facility for the local population over a 7 -year period out of which 278 were diagnosed with hand eczema. The morphological type of hand eczema was noted and the patch testing results were analyzed. Past or present relevance of the patch-test result to the clinical diagnosis was also analyzed. Results: Hand eczema was {{the most common type of}} eczema patch tested over the 7 -year period, constituting 34. 75 % of the patch-tested population. A positive patch-test result was obtained in 135 patients (48. 5 %) out of which it was found to be clinically relevant in about 65 % cases. <b>Nickel</b> and potassium <b>dichromate</b> were found to be the two commonest allergens causing hand eczema in our population with positive patch test reactions in 45 and 27 patients respectively. Females showed a much higher incidence of hand eczema as well as higher patch test positivity than males (54. 1 % vs. 38. 1 %). Conclusions: Hand eczema with a positive patch-test report was found to be much more common in females than males and <b>nickel</b> and potassium <b>dichromate</b> were seen to be the commonest allergens causing hand eczema in ethnic Kashmiri population...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report a}} study of {{allergic}} contact dermatitis in 329 Portuguese children of 14 years or younger. 170 children (64 male and 106 female) reacted to 1 or more allergens. Most of these were in the 11 - 14 years group. The main allergens were nickel, thimerosal, cobalt, mercury, fragrance-mix and potassium <b>dichromate.</b> <b>Nickel</b> reactivity predominated in females over the whole group, but {{a greater number of}} males younger than 5 years reacted to nickel. The number of positive reactions increased with age, but this was not accompained by an increase in the % of relevant tests. 12 children, all of them 13 or 14 years-old, had an occupational allergic contact dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|Guinea pigs were {{sensitized}} to potassium <b>dichromate,</b> <b>nickel</b> sulfate {{and sodium}} zirconium lactate by three methods of immunization in Freund's complete adjuvant; Polak, split adjuvant, and maximization (modified Magnusson and Kligman. These were followed after 2 weeks by weekly intradermal injections of 25 μg {{of the metal}} salt. Delayed hypersensitivity-like reactions developed 3 to 12 weeks after initial injection. Reactivity, although strong {{with an increase in}} thickness of over 0. 7 mm and/or diameter of erythema of over 8 × 8 mm, was frequently transient, the animal losing reactivity on subsequent skin test or after 2 or 3 skin tests. In two-thirds of the experiments using sodium zirconium lactate, delayed hypersensitivity-like reactions at 24 hr developed into nodular lesions which reached peak intensity at 8 days and histologically contained histiocytes with an epithelioid cell appearance and giant cells. In some experiments, sodium zirconium lactate-sensitive animals showed cross reactivity with potassium dichromate, but not with nickel sulfate...|$|R
40|$|The {{patch test}} results from 1, 000 {{patients}} tested with the ICDRG standard series are analyzed for positive reactions to potassium <b>dichromate,</b> <b>nickel</b> sulphate, and cobalt chloride. Nickel {{appears to be}} the most common sensitizer, especially among women, although false-negative reactions may occur if it is tested with a 2. 5 % concentration in yellow petrolatum. Chromate dermatitis is generally of occupational origin among men. It is also quite common among Belgian women, probably because of the widespread use of Javel (liquid bleach), containing sodium dichromate as a colouring and stabilizing agent. Positive patch test reactions to cobalt are generally accompanied by allergic reactions to nickel or chromate. Its role as a primary allergen, however, must never be overlooked. The relationship between these metals and hand and foot eczema is evaluated. The results of a follow-up questionnaire are given. More than 70 % of the patients allergic to chromates or nickel continued to suffer from contact eczema after the diagnosis had been made and therapeutic measures taken. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Epicutaneous (patch) test is a {{standard}} test to confirm contact allergy. During a six-year period (1998 - 2003), contact allergic dermati tis was di ag nosed in 4132 (65 %) of 6341 pa tients us ing stan dard patch test with a Croatian series of al lergens according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG). The most common clinical diagnoses related to contact allergy (male; female) were contact allergic dermatitis (65. 4 %; 72. 2 %); atopic dermatitis (15. 9 %; 11. 7 %); contact irritant dermatitis (7. 0 %; 6. 6 %) and nummular eczematoid dermatitis (4. 2 %; 2. 4 %).

40|$|Porous anodic alumina films {{grown in}} sulfuric acid and similar {{specimens}} ealed in <b>nickel</b> acetate and <b>dichromate</b> sealing baths {{were subjected to}} a number of surface and bulk analytical techniques (XPS, RBS, SIMS, and XRD). All the oxide films were found to be amorphous- l ike in nature, to contain significant amounts of H, and have a S content of 1. 5 - 3 atomic percent (a/o) uniformly distr ibuted throughout the oxide matrices. For the sealed oxide films, surface enr ichment of Ni and Cr species was observed, being particularly significant in the case of Ni. Uni form bulk concentrat ions for Ni and Cr were found to be of the order of 0. 5 and 1 a/o, respectively. The S, Ni, and Cr species present in the oxide films were identif ied as sulfate-like, nickel hydroxide and dichromate-l ike in nature. Ion beam-induced reduction of incorporated S, Ni, Cr, and C species was observed.

40|$|Background/Aim. It is {{necessary}} {{to decide whether the}} newly improved methods are better than the standard or reference test or not. To decide whether the new diagnostics test is better than the gold standard test/imperfect standard test, the differences of estimated sensitivity/specificity are calculated with the help of information obtained from samples. However, to generalize this value to the population, it should be given with the confidence intervals. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the confidence interval methods developed for the differences between the two dependent sensitivity/specificity values on a clinical application. Materials and Methods. In this study, confidence interval methods like Asymptotic Intervals, Conditional Intervals, Unconditional Interval, Score Intervals, and Nonparametric Methods Based on Relative Effects Intervals are used. Besides, as clinical application, data used in diagnostics study by Dickel et al. (2010) has been taken as a sample. Results. The results belonging to the alternative confidence interval methods for <b>Nickel</b> Sulfate, Potassium <b>Dichromate,</b> and Lanolin Alcohol are given as a table. Conclusion. While preferring the confidence interval methods, the researchers have to consider whether the case to be compared is single ratio or dependent binary ratio differences, the correlation coefficient between the rates in two dependent ratios and the sample sizes...|$|R
40|$|The {{immune system}} is called into action by alarm signals {{generate}} from injured tissues. We examined {{the nature of these}} alarm signals after exposure of skin residential cells to contact allergens (nickel sulfate and potassium dichromate) and a contact irritant [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) ]. <b>Nickel</b> sulfate, potassium <b>dichromate,</b> and SDS were applied topically to the stratum corneum of human skin equivalents. A similar concentration-dependent increase in chemokine (CCL 20, CCL 27, and CXCL 8) secretion was observed for all three chemicals. Exposure to nickel sulfate and SDS was investigated in more detail: similar to chemokine secretion, no difference was observed in the time- and concentration-dependent increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine [interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) ] secretion. Maximal increase in IL- 1 α secretion occurred within 2 h after exposure to both nickel sulfate and SDS and prior to increased chemokine secretion. TNF-α secretion was detectable 8 h after chemical exposure. After allergen or irritant exposure, increased CCL 20 and CXCL 8, but not CCL 27, secretion was inhibited by neutralizing human antibodies to either IL- 1 α or TNF-α. Our data show that alarm signals consist of primary and secondary signals. IL- 1 α and TNF-α are released as primary alarm signals, which trigger the release of secondary chemokine (CCL 20 and CXCL 8) alarm signals. However, some chemokines, for example, CCL 27 can be secreted in an IL- 1 α and TNF-α independent manner. Our data suggest that skin residential cells respond to both allergen and irritant exposure by releasing mediators that initiate infiltration of immune responsive cells into the skin. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The daily {{increase}} of using chemical, aromatic and cosmetic products {{has been associated}} with significant increase in frequency of skin diseases such as eczemas and contact dermatitis (CD). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the use of patch testing (PT) for the diagnosis of CD and provide current data on the frequency of sensitization to various contact allergens among patients with CD in the Albanian population. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive patients clinically suspected for CD during the period February 2010 – February 2011, in the outpatient setting. PT was done using Baseline European Series consisting of 31 allergens. Risk factors (age, gender, occupation and place of residence) and sensitization to various contact allergens were evaluated.  Results: In total, 193 patients clinically suspected for CD were included in the study and underwent PT. The highest prevalence of CD was found in the age-group of 31 - 40 years (32. 6 %), with a statistically significant difference between other age-groups (X 2 = 141. 2, p< 0. 01). Positive PT results with at least one allergen were seen in 144 (74. 6 %) patients suspected for CD. The two most common allergens were <b>nickel</b> and potassium <b>dichromate.</b> Construction worker and hairdresser were the most affected professions. Females had a chance of 1. 8 times higher for having a positive patch test result compare to males (OR = 1. 8; 95 % CI 0. 91 – 3. 39). Conclusion: Determination of allergens that cause contact dermatitis is a necessity not only to confirm the correct diagnosis, but also for the qualitative treatment and prevention of the disease. Patch testing, even though an old method, still remain a valuable and non-invasive approach to determine the causes of contact dermatitis...|$|R
