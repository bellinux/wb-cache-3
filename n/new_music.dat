5|$|Szigeti {{was an avid}} {{champion}} of <b>new</b> <b>music,</b> and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics.

5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated <b>new</b> <b>music</b> for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely <b>new</b> <b>music</b> to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

5|$|After {{its last}} {{performance}} at the Gaiety in 1872, Thespis appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, although an attempted reconstruction from the 1940s has been discovered. Tillett and Spencer, who discovered the ballet music, identified twenty separate reconstructions of Thespis between 1953 and 2002. About half of these use music adapted from Sullivan's other works; the others use <b>new</b> <b>music</b> {{for all but the}} surviving songs, or, in a few cases, re-compose those as well. No version has become predominant in recent productions.|$|E

5|$|For , {{a planned}} {{expansion}} to Halo 3 {{that became a}} full game, O'Donnell and Salvatori abandoned all previous Halo themes and started anew. Due to ODSTs shift to a new protagonist, O'Donnell created <b>new</b> <b>music</b> that was evocative of past Halo but branched in a different direction. Since Bungie was aiming for a smaller, detective story feel, O'Donnell felt that a jazz-influenced approach worked best in echoing the film noir atmosphere.|$|E
