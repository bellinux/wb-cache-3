40|$|Serum {{immunoglobulin}} G {{antibodies to}} purified heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) from human (LTh) and porcine (LTp) Escherichia coli strains and cholera enterotoxin (CT) were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sera from patients with LTh E. coli infection showed a prominent response with LTh, an intermediate response with LTp, and a meager response with CT. Of 47 persons with clinical LTh-producing E. coli (herein shortened to LTh E. coli) infections, significant rises in antitoxin were detected against LTh in 36 (77 %), against LTp in 30 (64 %), and against CT in only 13 (28 %) patients; seroconversions also occurred in 11 of 14 (79 %) patients with subclinical LTh E. coli infections. In North Americans with experimental LTh E. coli infection, anti-Lth did not remain {{at high levels}} for more than 3 months. Persons with cholera manifested antitoxin responses that were similarly potent against all three toxin antigens; in fact, <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> values were often slightly higher against LTh than against CT. The ratio of CT/LTh ELISA <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> in convalescent sera {{proved to be a}} sensitive means to differentiate LT E. coli from cholera infection. All 11 cholera patients tested had CT/LTh ratios of greater than 0. 70, whereas in only 1 of 47 LTh E. coli infections did the ratio exceed that value (it was 0. 71) (P less than 0. 0000000001). In single serum specimens, a <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 30 against LTh was shown to be a useful cutoff in screening sera for recent LTh E. coli or past cholera infection. The CT/LTh ratio was then used to differentiate definitively. Sera from healthy 3 - to 5 -year -olds and 15 - to 19 -year-olds in Maryland, Chile, and Bangladesh were tested against LTh and CT. The serological results fit known epidemiological observations. (i) LTh infections are rare in the United States (only 2 of 60 sera had LTh <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> values of >/= 0. 30. (ii) In contrast, evidence of recent LTh E. coli infections was very common in Chilean (69 %) and Bangladeshi (57 %) 3 - to 5 -year-olds and not uncommon in 15 - to 19 -year-olds (38 and 31 %, respectively) in those countries. (iii) Only Bangladeshi sera showed serological evidence of cholera infections (CT/LTh ratios of > 0. 70). The immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measuring antibodies to purified LTh and CT represents a practical and effective tool for the serological study of LTh E. coli and cholera diarrheal infections...|$|E
40|$|With {{new advancements}} in radiochromic film designs and {{sensitivity}} to suit different niche applications, EBT 2 is the latest offering for the megavoltage radiotherapy market. New construction specifications including different physical construction {{and the use of}} a yellow coloured dye has provided the next generation radiochromic film for therapy applications. The film utilises the same active chemical for radiation measurement as its predecessor, EBT Gafchromic. Measurements have been performed using photo spectrometers to analyse the absorption spectra properties of this new EBT 2 Gafchromic, radiochromic film. Results have shown that whilst the physical coloration or absorption spectra of the film, which turns yellow to green as compared to EBT film, (clear to blue) is significantly different due to the added yellow dye, the net change in absorption spectra properties for EBT 2 are similar to the original EBT film. Absorption peaks are still located at 636 nm and 585 nm positions. A <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> change of 0. 590 ± 0. 020 (2 SD) for a 1 Gy radiation absorbed dose using 6 MV x-rays when measured at the 636 nm absorption peak was found. This is compared to 0. 602 ± 0. 025 (2 SD) for the original EBT film (2005 Batch) and 0. 557 ± 0. 027 (2009 Batch) at the same absorption peak. The yellow dye and the new coating material produce a significantly different visible absorption spectra results for the EBT 2 film compared to EBT at wavelengths especially below approximately 550 nm. At wavelengths above 550 nm differences in absolute OD are seen however, when dose analysis is performed at wavelengths above 550 nm using <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> changes, no significant variations are seen. If comparing results of the late production EBT to new production EBT 2 film, <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> variations of approximately 10 % to 15 % are seen. As all new film batches should be calibrated for sensitivity upon arrival this should not be of concern...|$|E
40|$|Commercially {{available}} radiochromic {{films are}} primarily designed for clinical X-ray dosimetry. These films change color upon exposures to radiation {{as a result}} of solid-state polymerization (SSP). Built on a previous model developed for SSP upon exposures to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a new model was developed in the present work for X-ray-induced coloration in Gafchromic EBT 3 films. Monte Carlo simulations using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code were employed to model the transport and interaction of photons and the generated secondary electrons within the film active layer. The films were exposed to continuous-energy photon beams. The dose DE in the external radiation detector (i. e., ionization chamber) was determined and the realistic dose DA in the film active layer was then obtained using the calibration coefficient R (=DA/DE). The finite element method (FEM) was used to solve the classical steady-state Helmholtz equation using the multifrontal massively parallel sparse direct solver (MUMPS). An extensive grid independence test was carried out and the numerical stability of the present model was ensured. The reflected light intensity from the film surface was used to theoretically obtain the <b>net</b> reflective <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of the film exposed to X-ray. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental and theoretical results of the <b>net</b> reflective <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of the film. For X-ray doses >~ 600 cGy, due to the already formed densely cross-linked structure in the active layer of the EBT 3 film so further bond formation was less likely, the reflected light intensity from the film surface increased at a relatively lower rate when compared to those for dose values <~ 600 cGy...|$|R
40|$|To detect Schmallenberg virus (SBV) {{infections in}} {{ruminants}} and to perform SBV epidemiological studies a cost-effective serological test is required. For these purposes an indirect whole virus Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for detection of SBV specific antibodies in ruminant blood samples was developed. Schmallenberg virus antigen {{was produced by}} propagation on Vero cells, partly purified and coated onto ELISA plates. The indirect ELISA procedure included the subsequent incubation of diluted samples, protein-G-HRP conjugate and TMB substrate solution. <b>Net</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Densities</b> (OD) values were calculated and expressed as a sample to positive percentage (S/P%) by comparison of the average net OD with the OD of the positive control. Validation of this assay was performed using 633 samples from SBV-free sheep, goats and cattle, and 141 samples from SBV suspect ruminants. The diagnostic specificity was 98. 8 %. Test results of 86 ruminant serum samples using both the SBV-ELISA and an SBV virus neutralization test (VNT), designated as the gold standard serological test for SBV, showed good correlation: at an S/P cut-off of 15 % only one VNT positive sample tested negative in the SBV ELISA. The diagnostic sensitivity of the ELISA, relative to the VNT, was 98. 8 % (95 % CI: 93. 3 - 100. 0 %). The ELISA showed a high repeatability (cv= 6. 5 %) and reproducibility (100 % agreement).

40|$|A {{standardized}} pool {{of human}} sera that was positive for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) antibody was developed. This positive control serum was used to analyze test differences among eight laboratories, among the HIV- 1 antibody test kits of three different manufacturers, among different lots of the same test kit, and among pipetting devices and techniques. The standardized pool of human sera was tested 327 times by the different laboratories. In terms of positive tests, a reproducibility of 99. 69 % was achieved; however, significant test variance among laboratories, among test kit lots, and among pipetting devices and techniques could be demonstrated if the tests were compared {{on the basis of}} the <b>net</b> positive <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (OD) value. This value was calculated by subtracting the cutoff OD value (i. e., the value below which an OD value was considered negative for HIV- 1 antibody) from the observed OD value of the standardized pool of human sera.

40|$|Purpose - The {{dose-response}} of radiochromic ﬁlm {{has been}} shown to be dependent on the quality of the incident radiation, particularly at low energies. Difficulty there-fore arises when a calibration is required for radiation of uncertain energy. This study investigates the ability of a recently published calibration method [see M. Tamponi et al., “A new form of the calibration curve in radiochromic dosimetry. Properties and results,” Med. Phys. 43, 4435 – 4446 (2016) ] to reduce the energy-dependence of radiochromic ﬁlm. This allows for corrections to be applied that may improve the accuracy and precision of measurements taken in beams of uncertain energy, or where the beam quality is known but calibration doses cannot be delivered. Methods - Gafchromic EBT 3 ﬁlm was irradiated with a range of superﬁcial, orthovoltage, and high-energy photon beams. Calibrations were then applied using a typical <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> approach, and compared with the Tamponi et al. method that instead defines the response as a ratio of two net optical densities. To quantify the energy dependence, the response at each beam quality and dose was then normalised to the response at a preselected reference quality. This resulted in a relative measure that could be used to correct the calibration curve at the reference beam quality to any other quality of interest. Results - The Tamponi et al. calibration method resulted in substantially less energy dependence compared to the standard <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> approach, without compromising the calibration ﬁt.

Methods: Calibrations of EBT and EBT 3 films were performed with identical setups using a 6 MV photon beam of a Siemens Primus linac. Skin dose was measured at different points in the right anterior oblique (RAO) and right posterior oblique (RPO) fields by EBT and EBT 3 films on a RANDO phantom.

40|$|Abstract – Gafchromic XRCT radiochromic {{film is a}} self {{developing}} high sensitivity radiochromic film product {{which can}} be used for assessment of delivered radiation doses which could match applications such as Computed Tomography (CT) dosimetry. The dose response of Gafchromic XRCT radiochromic film has been measured with reflectance spectrophotometry and desktop scanners. The film automatically changes colour upon irradiation, changing from a yellow to a green/brown colour. Results show a high sensitivity to delivered dose compared to other conventional radiochromic films which is well suited to CT applications where lower applied doses are delivered. Sensitivity is found for this film with a 1 cGy applied dose, producing an approximate <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> change of 0. 3 at 636 nm and 0. 2 net OD using broad band white light. This high sensitivity combined with its relatively energy independent nature around the 100 kVp to 150 kVp x-ray energy range provides a unique enhancement in dosimetric measurement capabilities over currently available dosimetry films for CT applications...|$|E
40|$|Radiochromic films {{change color}} upon {{exposures}} to radiation doses {{as a result}} of solid-state polymerization (SSP). Commercially available radiochromic films are primarily designed for, and have become widely used in, clinical X-ray dosimetry. However, many intriguing properties of radiochromic films are not yet fully understood. The present work aimed at developing a theoretical model at both atomic and macroscopic scales to provide a platform for future works to understand these intriguing properties. Despite the fact that radiochromic films were primarily designed for clinical X-ray dosimetry, dose-response curves for the Gafchromic EBT 3 film obtained for ultraviolet (UV) radiation were employed to develop our model in order to avoid complications of ionization, non-uniform energy deposition, as well as dispersed doses caused by secondary electrons set in motion by the indirectly ionizing X-ray photons, which might introduce added uncertainties to the model and overshadow the basic SSP processes. The active layer in the EBT 3 film consisted of diacetylene (DA) pentacosa- 10, 12 -diynoate monomers, which were modelled using molecular dynamics (MD). The degrees of SSP in the atomic scale upon different UV exposures were obtained to determine the absorption coefficients of the active layer, which were then input into the finite element method (FEM). The classical steady-state Helmholtz equation was engaged to model the reflection from the active layer using the FEM technique. The multifrontal massively parallel sparse direct solver (MUMPS) was employed to solve the present numerical problem. Very good agreement between experimentally and theoretically obtained coloration in terms of <b>net</b> reflective <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> was achieved for different UV exposures. In particular, for UV exposures larger than ~ 40 J/cm 2, the reflected light intensity decreased at a lower rate when compared to other UV exposure values, which was explained by the densely cross-linked structure under near-complete polymerization, and thus the lower efficiency for further bond formation between DA monomer strands...|$|R

Normal human eyes were fixed in methacarn and sectioned and immunostained using a specific polyclonal antibody to MMP- 1. Immunoreactivity was visualized using diaminobenzidine. To compare the staining intensity in various tissues, the mean optical density within the ciliary body, mid-iris stroma, iris root, uveal trabecular meshwork, cornea, and sclera was determined using imaging densitometry. To {{determine the}} cellular distribution of MMP- 1 in ciliary muscle, additional sections were double-immunostained using antibodies to MMP- 1 and calponin.

Results show that the RTQA film produces an energy dependant darkening to x-rays which results in x-ray energies of 69 keV photon equivalent (150 kVp) to produce 2. 14 times the optical density to dose ratio of a 6 MV x-ray beam.

Since the measurement uncertainty in Gafchromic film dosimetry {{is thought to be}} significant compared to that of ionization chambers, a rigorous method to evaluate measurement uncertainties is desired. This article provides a method that takes into account the correlation between fit parameters as well as single dose values in order to obtain accurate uncertainties in absolute and relative measurements. A complete portrait of all sources of uncertainty in Gafchromic film dosimetry is given. The parametrization of variance {{as a function of the}} number of averaged pixels is obtained in order to accurately predict the uncertainty as a function of the size of the region of interest. The choice of functional form for the sensitometric curve is based on four criteria and a convergence of global <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> uncertainty to 0. 0013 is demonstrated. A minimum number of 12 points is recommended to characterize the sensitometric curve to a sufficient precision on the uncertainty estimation. Uncertainty levels of 0. 9 % on absolute dose measurements and 0. 45 % on relative measurements are achieved using a 12 -point calibration curve with 220 cGy and repeating measurements five times. Uncertainties of 0. 8 % and 0. 4 % are achievable when using 35 points during film characterization. Ignoring covariance terms is shown to lead to errors in the estimation of uncertainty.

Three of 21 swine had antibodies to M. flocculare five weeks PE, five of 17 had seroconverted at seven to eight weeks and all surviving swine had antibodies to M. flocculare 76 days PE and beyond. <b>Net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of positive sera was {{in the range of}} 0. 201 to 0. 412 (an optical density of 0. 2 regarded as the breakpoint between negative and positive reactions in our ELISA). All of the sera were ELISA-negative when tested against M. hyopneumoniae antigen. This is regarded as a very significant finding. There has been concern that field sera might contain antibodies to M. flocculare and that such antibodies could render serodiagnostic tests for mycoplasmal pneumonia of swine nonspecific. Results of the present study suggest that swine infected with M. flocculare do not develop sufficient levels of antibodies to interfere with enzyme immunoassays for M. hyopneumoniae...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find the most {{accurate}} model for radiochromic film dosimetry by comparing different channel independent perturbation models. A model selection approach based on (algorithmic) information theory was followed, and the results were validated using gamma-index analysis on a set of benchmark test cases. Several questions were addressed: (a) whether incorporating the information of the non-irradiated film, by scanning prior to irradiation, improves the results; (b) whether lateral corrections are necessary when using multichannel models; (c) whether multichannel dosimetry produces better results than single-channel dosimetry; (d) which multichannel perturbation model provides more accurate film doses. It was found that scanning prior to irradiation and applying lateral corrections improved the accuracy of the results. For some perturbation models, increasing the number of color channels did not result in more accurate film doses. Employing Truncated Normal perturbations was found to provide better results than using Micke-Mayer perturbation models. Among the models being compared, the triple-channel model with Truncated Normal perturbations, <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> as the response and subject to the application of lateral corrections was found to be the most accurate model. The scope of this study was circumscribed by the limits under which the models were tested. In this study, the films were irradiated with megavoltage radiotherapy beams, with doses from about 20 cGy to 600 cGy, entire (8 inch × 10 inch) films were scanned, the functional form of the sensitometric curves was a polynomial and the different lots were calibrated using the plane-based method...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Radiochromic EBT 3 {{film is a}} later {{generation}} of radiochromic films. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare EBT and EBT 3 radiochromic films in radiotherapy fields of breast cancer. Methods: A RANDO phantom was irradiated by a 6 MV Siemens Primus linac with medial and lateral fields of radiotherapy of breast cancer. Dosimetry was performed in various points in the fields using EBT and EBT 3 films. Films were scanned by a Microtek color scanner. Dose values from two films in corresponding points were compared. Results: In the investigation of calibration, <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (NOD) of EBT radiochromic is more than the EBT 3 radiochromic film. The highest percentage difference between NODs of two films is related to 0. 75 Gy and equals to 14. 19 %. The lowest value is related to 0. 2 Gy dose and is equal to 3. 31 %. The highest percentage difference between two films on the RANDO phantom in breast cancer fields is 13. 51 % and the minimum value is equal to 0. 33 %. Conclusion: From the comparison between the two films, most of the points show differences in dose in the measurements in fields of breast cancer radiotherapy. These differences are attributed to the thickness of the active layers, the overall thickness of the films, and the difference in the calibration fitted functions. The advantage of EBT film over EBT 3 is a higher sensitivity; on the other hand EBT 3 film allows to use its both sides in the scanning process and it is a new version of this film type...|$|E

30|$|The {{experiment}} {{results showed}} that <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> of oil (Fig.  8) decreases after each subsequent filtration stage because asphaltenes are deposited {{on the surface of}} the pore space and their concentration in oil at outlet from the core is reduced.

In accordance with Eq.  13, concentrations of asphaltenes in oil after filtration stages of 2, 3 and 4 are 0.69 %, 0.59 % and 0.36 %, respectively.

40|$|This review {{compares the}} results of studies that have {{investigated}} the impact of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (MPOD) with those that have investigated the reliability of techniques used to measure macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density.</b> The review will focus on studies that have used heterochromatic flicker photometry for measurement of macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density,</b> as {{this is the only}} technique that is currently available commercially to clinicians. We identified articles that reported on supplementation with lutein and/or zeaxanthin and/or meso-zeaxanthin on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> measurement techniques published in peer-reviewed journals, through a multi-staged, systematic approach. Twenty-four studies have investigated the repeatability of MPOD measurements using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Of these, 10 studies provided a coefficient of repeatability or data from which the coefficient could be calculated, with a range in values of 0. 06 to 0. 58. The lowest coefficient of repeatability assessed on naïve subjects alone was 0. 08. These values tell us that, at best, changes greater than 0. 08 can be considered clinically significant and at worst, only changes greater than 0. 58 can be considered clinically significant. Six studies assessed the effect of supplementation with up to 20 mg/day lutein on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> measured using heterochromatic flicker photometry and the mean increase in macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> ranged from 0. 025 to 0. 09. It seems reasonable to conclude that the chance of eliciting an increase in macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> during six months of daily supplementation with between 10 and 20 mg lutein that is of sufficient magnitude to be detected by using heterochromatic flicker photometry on an individual basis is small. Commercially available heterochromatic flicker photometers for macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> assessment in the clinical environment appear to demonstrate particularly poor coefficient of repeatability values. Clinicians should exercise caution when considering the purchase of these instruments for potential monitoring of macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> in response to supplementation in individual patients...|$|R
40|$|Previously {{described}} GM 1 ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (GM 1 -ELISA) for {{the detection}} of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) showed sensitivity equal to the Y- 1 adrenal cell assay when anti-LT (a reagent not commercially available) was used. However, when antitoxin to immunologically related (commercially available) cholera toxin was substituted, a marked loss in sensitivity occurred. We modified the GM 1 -ELISA that employed anti-cholera toxin to make it comparable in sensitivity to the Y- 1 adrenal cell assay. When five media commonly used for LT production were compared, Mundell's Casamino Acids medium was shown to be significantly superior. Lincomycin (45 micrograms/ml) added to E. coli cultures significantly increased net optical densities in the GM 1 -ELISA, a direct measure of the amount of LT. Treatment of broth cultures or bacterial cell pellets with polymyxin B or extension of culture time to 48 h also significantly increased <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> by allowing enhanced release of periplasmic LT. A major innovation involved the direct culture of E. coli strains in GM 1 -coated wells of microtiter plates followed by ELISA. This direct culture method GM 1 -ELISA (DCM-GM 1 -ELISA) saved not only assay time, but also materials and reagents. The net optical densities that result from this assay allow the test to be read visually without a spectrophotometer. Three independent observers read plates with E. coli tested by DCM-GM 1 -ELISA. Thirty-four of 35 adrenal cell-positive strains (97 % sensitivity) and 30 of 30 LT-negative control E. coli strains (100 % specificity) were identified by all three observers reading coded plates. The DCM-GM 1 -ELISA provides a simple, practical and efficient assay for LT for less sophisticated laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Gafchromic EBT 2, Radiochromic film is {{assessed}} for its change in optical density response to x-ray radiation over a broad energy range, from low energy kilovoltage to megavoltage x-rays. A small energy dependence {{was found with}} variations in the change in optical density when scanned in the red component of a desktop scanner light source per unit dose of 6. 5 % from 50 kVp to 10 MV. This produces a slightly smaller and thus even more energy independent film than its predecessor, EBT film whose response varied by 7. 7 % over the same energy range. The energy response peaked at 100 kVp with a 5 % over response compared to 6 MV x-rays and the minimum response found at both 50 kVp and 250 kVp being a 1. 5 % under response. It {{should be noted that}} the shape of the energy dependence response curve increases from 50 kVp up to 100 kVp followed by a decrease through to higher energies whilst the original EBT was found to increase in response from 50 kVp through to 10 MV. A reflected <b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> change of 0. 215 ± 0. 006 OD for the first Gray of radiation was found for EBT 2 analysed in reflection mode at 6 MV x-ray energy. The minimal energy dependence of the EBT 2 film provides further enhancement compared to EBT for its accuracy with respect to spectral changes in the beam to measure beams such as IMRT where complex field and multileaf collimator configurations exist causing small spectral changes to occur over the treatment field or at depth where spectral changes also occur...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the dependence of the measured optical density on the incident beam energy, field size and depth for {{a new type of}} film, Kodak extended dose range (Kodak EDR). Film measurements have been conducted over a range of field sizes (3 × 3 cm 2 to 25 × 25 cm 2) and depths (dmax to 15 cm), for 6 MV and 15 MV photons within a solid water phantom, and the variation in sensitometric response (<b>net</b> <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> versus dose) has been reported. Kodak EDR film is found to have a linear response with dose, from 0 to 350 cGy, which is much higher than that typically seen for Kodak XV film (0 – 50 cGy). The variation in sensitometric response for Kodak EDR film as a function of field size and depth is observed to be similar to that of Kodak XV film; the optical density varied in the order of 2 – 3 % for field sizes of 3 × 3 cm 2 and 10 × 10 cm 2 at depths of dmax, 5 cm and 15 cm in the phantom. Measurements for a 25 × 25 cm 2 field size showed consistently higher optical densities at depths of dmax, 5 cm and 15 cm, relative to a 10 × 10 cm 2 field size at 5 cm depth, with 4 – 5 % differences noted at a depth of 15 cm. Fractional depth dose and profiles conducted with Kodak EDR film showed good agreement (2 %/ 2 mm) with ion chamber measurements for all field sizes except for the 25 × 25 cm 2 at depths greater than 15 cm, where differences in the order of 3 – 5 % were observed. In addition, Kodak EDR film measurements were found to be consistent with those of Kodak XV film for all fractional depth doses and profiles. The results {{of this study indicate that}} Kodak EDR film may be a useful tool for relative dosimetry at higher dose ranges...|$|E

To check this, MP and melanin <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> were measured in a random population-based sample of subjects 55 years of age or older. Spectral fundus reflectance of the fovea was measured in one eye per subject in a 2. 3 degrees detection field with a fundus reflectometer. The sample consisted of 199 men and 236 women. Analysis with a fundus reflectance model yielded individual estimates for the MP and melanin <b>optical</b> <b>density.</b> Diagnosis of ARM was based on grading of standardized fundus transparencies. Eyes were stratified in four exclusive stages of ARM. MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (at 460 nm) was 0. 33 +/- 0. 15 in eyes without ARM (n = 289) and 0. 33 +/- 0. 16 in eyes at any stage of ARM (n = 146). Melanin <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (at 500 nm) was 1. 18 +/- 0. 19 in eyes without ARM and 1. 20 +/- 0. 21 in eyes at any stage of ARM.
