25|$|To {{prevent the}} risk of {{out-of-phase}} supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station {{to be shut down}} and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers {{may not be able to}} safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent {{the risk of}} an arc being drawn across from one section of wire to earth, when passing through the <b>neutral</b> <b>section,</b> the train must be coasting and the circuit breakers must be open. In many cases, this is done manually by the drivers. To help them, a warning board is provided just before both the <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> and an advance warning some distance before. A further board is then provided after the <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> to tell drivers to re-close the circuit breaker, although drivers must not do this until the rear pantograph has passed this board. In the UK, a system known as Automatic Power Control (APC) automatically opens and closes the circuit breaker, this being achieved by using sets of permanent magnets alongside the track communicating with a detector on the train. The only action needed by the driver is to shut off power and coast and therefore warning boards are still provided at and on the approach to neutral sections.|$|E

50|$|Since {{switching}} stations, like substations, normally separate electrical sections {{with different}} supply sources (and thus different phase or voltage), a <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> always occupies the track {{between the two}} electrical sections.|$|E
40|$|From {{the start}} of the {{electrification}} of the railway in Sweden Banverket has been building <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> in the sections point between two feeding stations. The other 16, 7 Hz countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Norway) does not have as many <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> as Sweden does. This report will evaluate the need for having <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> in the Swedish catenary system. To achieve the wanted 16, 7 Hz and 15 kV Banverket buys power locally and then converts it in converter stations placed throughout the country. There exist two different types of converter stations, static and rotating converters. In the 1980 s when the train’s weight increased the demand for higher current also increased. To handle this Banverket either had to build many new converters stations or do like Germany and build a high voltage grid. Banverket decided to build high voltage grid between Boden in the north and Häggvik and Hallsberg in the southern middle part of Sweden. The advantage with a high voltage grid is that there will not be any phase difference between two neighbouring stations. Banverket however has a problem with the power flow in this system, there are still some test with phase shifting transformers to handle this problem. <b>Neutral</b> <b>sections</b> are used as borders both for reducing the short circuit power and to use the catenary system in island mode. In the same way they are used to securely prevent that a voltage not is transferred to an overhead line that for safety reasons should be kept de-energized. They reduce the risks of creating electric arcs and the damage on section points. However they {{cost a lot of money}} to build and the heavy section isolator that are used in some cases might damage the pantograph. <b>Neutral</b> <b>sections</b> can be removed in some places, where the energizing is done from the high voltage grid or from static converters. The parts of the Swedish railway that are energized from converter stations will however still need <b>neutral</b> <b>sections.</b> The converters stations are connected with the Swedish 50 Hz grid and it does that if a fault happens in the national grid it is transferred into the catenary system. Air isolated <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> effect the pantographs less and will therefore cause less damage on the catenary system...|$|R
25|$|At high speed, {{the driver}} cannot see lineside signals reliably.

Auxiliary signalling information, including the location of <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> in the overhead supply and pantograph adjustment zones, is displayed in cab and by the lineside. The operation of circuit breakers over <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> is handled automatically on TVM-signalled lines only, and pantograph adjustments must always be performed by the driver.|$|R

50|$|On {{overhead}} wires designed for trolley poles {{this is done}} by having a <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> between the wires, requiring an insulator. The driver of the tram or trolleybus must {{turn off the power}} when the trolley pole passes through, to prevent arc damage to the insulator.|$|E
50|$|In {{countries}} such as France, South Africa and the United Kingdom, permanent magnets beside the rails at {{either side of the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> operate a bogie-mounted transducer on the train which causes a large electrical circuit-breaker to open and close when the locomotive or the pantograph vehicle of a multiple unit passes them.|$|E

50|$|APS uses a {{third rail}} placed between the running rails, divided {{electrically}} into ten-metre rail segments with three-metre <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> between.

50|$|The sudden {{loss and}} then {{reconnection}} to the supply over the <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> might cause {{damage to the}} locomotive if it was drawing power, so signs warn the driver.

50|$|Whereas in France {{the various}} Scouting {{associations}} {{were created by}} religious denomination, the FFE was the only large-scale attempt to create an interdenominational movement. In 1921, it consisted of a <b>neutral</b> <b>section,</b> secular, and a unionist Protestant section. 1928, a Jewish section was integrated. From 1938, it also had a free Catholic section and an unofficial Muslim section in French Algeria.|$|E
50|$|A <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> or phase {{break is}} used, {{consisting}} of two section breaks back-to-back with a short section of overhead line that belongs to neither grid. If the two grids are synchronised this stretch of line is energised (by either supply) and trains run through it normally. If the two supplies are not synchronised it is disconnected from the supplies, leaving it electrically dead, ensuring that the two grids cannot be connected to each other.|$|E
50|$|With a view {{to bring}} down the {{maintenance}} cost and improve the reliability of power supply system, Railway Electrification has gone in for state-for-the-art technology as prevalent in the international arena viz., dry cast resin transformers, SF6 or vacuum switchgear, long creep age solid core insulators and PTFE <b>neutral</b> <b>sections.</b> Eight-wheeler self-propelled OHE inspection cars have also been introduced to improve maintenance.

50|$|The trains {{were ordered}} during the {{electrification}} of the KCR British section, {{now known as}} MTR East Rail Line, in 1978. Sets E1-E45 and E46-E61 were delivered to KCRC in 2 batches in 1982-1983, when electrification was completed first between Hung Hom and Sha Tin, and from then to Lo Wu respectively. KCRC also reordered further train sets in 1986 (sets E62-E86) and 1990 (sets E87-E118). These trains may suffer from temporary loss of electricity while passing <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> (or dead zones) {{due to the lack}} of internal batteries.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground-level}} {{power supply}} system known as APS or Alimentation par le sol uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre segments with three-metre <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> in between.

50|$|A {{ground-level}} {{power supply}} system known as Ground-level power supply or APS is {{an updated version of}} the original stud type system. APS uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre powered segments with three metre <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energize the power rail segments as the tram passes over them. Older systems required mechanical switching systems which were susceptible to environmental problems. At any one time no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live. Wireless and solid state switching remove the mechanical problem.|$|R

50|$|As on {{the dual}} voltage Class 19E, the main {{electric}} circuit is automatically selected in either AC or DC mode, {{based on the}} voltage of the overhead contact wire feeding the locomotive. To facilitate automatic trouble-free transition on the run, the locomotive is equipped with onboard voltage detectors, while the overhead wire is equipped with two wooden isolators and a 3 m length of neutral wire to separate the AC and DC feed. The <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> {{is connected to the}} rails which serve as the return conductor on electrified lines.|$|E
50|$|As {{the line}} crossed the canal on a swing bridge, special {{precautions}} {{had to be}} made to ensure that trams did not end up in the canal whilst the bridge was out. Catch points were provided on the southern side of the canal, whilst the current in the vicinity was cut as soon as the bridge swung out of its closed position, leaving a <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> in the overhead wires until the bridge swung back into position. A single-line spur in Stockton Heath provided for the proposed link to Northwich, and in 1906 the WNLR proposed as a first step to lay tracks as far as Stretton, with the proviso that the Corporation would operate this section. The negotiations came to nothing as the WNLR were not prepared to offer a guarantee to the Corporation against any losses. The powers held by the Corporation to build a line between Latchford and Stockton Heath were left to lapse.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Dresden-Schöna section was electrified. The {{electric}} train service began on 29 May 1976. In 1987, electric overhead line was {{installed on the}} section of the line within Czechoslovakia between Děčín hl. n. (Bodenbach) and Děčín vychod (Tetschen). Nevertheless, scheduled electric trains did not begin operating across the border until 1992. The problem was the different electrical systems in use. The German section is electrified at the German standard of 15 kV AC at 16.7 Hz. In the north of the Czech Republic, lines are electrified with the 3000-volt DC system. In order to operate the route continuously using electrical traction, a dual-system locomotive (class 180) was developed. 50 m of the contact wire between Schöna and Dolní Žleb carries no current. In this section of the line the driver lowers the pantograph and coasts through the <b>neutral</b> <b>section</b> while changing the locomotive's electrical setting. Afterwards, the pantograph is raised again.|$|E
30|$|After the {{successful}} implementation of VSC-HVDC transmission systems for conventional power grids, there is increasing interest toward considering the application of this technology {{in the field of}} RES for high-speed railways. A few articles have considered the use of modular multi-level converters (MMCs) for catenary voltage stabilization [7, 8, 9, 10]. Certain fundamental concepts and the framework of the VSC-based medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) RES for high-speed railways are available in [2, 11, 12, 13]. Such MVDC systems consist of several VSC-based traction substations (TSSs) along the catenary line, providing energy to the system according to the requirement of the train loads. The catenary becomes a continuous network without <b>neutral</b> <b>sections.</b> Moreover, the VSC TSSs consume electricity from the main high voltage feeders as well as from renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) stations, and energy storage systems distributed along the traction line. Thereby, the whole RES becomes an MVDC grid in which each VSC-based substation contributes its share of power to the system.|$|R

40|$|The {{advanced}} {{traction power}} supply system (ATPSS) is a new directional development for traction {{power supply system}}s, which can totally remove the <b>neutral</b> <b>sections</b> and effectively promote power quality. However, the existing converters suffer from small substation capacity. In this paper, a new configuration based on a three-level neutral point clamped (3 L-NPC) three-phase to single-phase cascade converter in a substation is proposed for ATPSS, {{which can be used}} to match the capacity of the converter for high voltage and large power applications. The control strategy of the proposed converter is analyzed in depth, and the phase disposition sinusoidal pulse width modulation (PD-SPWM) with phase shift carrier SPWM (PSC-SPWM) is employed in the inverters. Then, the inductance equalizing circuit is applied for the voltage balance on the DC-link. Besides, a LC filter circuit is designed to eliminate the double line-frequency ripple of DC voltage. Afterwards, a simulation model and an experimental prototype are developed, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed converter in this paper can not only meet the requirements of voltage and capacity for the traction network, but also improve power quality. Finally, the experimental results verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy...|$|R
