In order to avoid limitations on the performance reach of the accelerator, and ensure machine protection, it is vital that the beam dynamics are well understood and controlled.

40|$|Land Degradation Neutrality {{is one of}} the Sustainable Development Goal targets, {{requiring}} on-going degradation to {{be balanced}} by restoration and sustainable land management. However, restoration and efforts to prevent degradation have often failed to deliver expected benefits, despite enormous investments.

This paper is the first to link ecological theory of <b>non-linear</b> ecosystem <b>dynamics</b> to Land Degradation Neutrality offering essential insights into appropriate timings, climate-induced windows of opportunities and risks and the financial viability of investments.
