5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less showed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E
5|$|At {{around the}} same time Hamidieh arrived off of Feodosia. Seeing <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> armed opposition, a German and a Turkish officer went ashore to warn the {{civilian}} population before bombarding the port two hours later.|$|E

60|$|A {{beautiful}} {{morning in}} mid-September, {{and yet in}} all this vast immensity of fertile land and ripening fruit there is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> human toil, <b>no</b> sound of beast or creaking waggon, <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> human life around that distant tanya.|$|R
5|$|Since the {{eruption}} of 1932 Quizapu has been quiet. In 1949 and 1967 small ash clouds were reported, while in the 1980s there were <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> activity other than fumaroles.|$|E
5|$|Although it was {{intended}} for Magnus and Olaf to rule the kingdom jointly without division, in practice Olaf ruled over Viken (the south-eastern part of Norway), while Magnus controlled the Uplands and Tr√∏ndelag (the middle parts of Norway) along with Western Norway and Northern Norway. Despite of this division, there are <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> hostility between the brothers, and their relationship {{appears to have been}} peaceful.|$|E
5|$|If <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> an {{allergic}} reaction are present, an ice pack or commercially available sprays are used to relieve the pain. Stingose is also recommended to treat a jack jumper sting. Other treatments include washing the stung area with soap and water, and if continuous pain remains for several days, antihistamine tablets are taken for one to three days.|$|E

60|$|She carried {{herself with}} a brave face, however. To her grandfather, to Miss Baker, and to her betrothed, she showed <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> sorrow, <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> repentance; but though there was, perhaps, no repentance in her heart, there was much sorrow and much remorse, {{and she could not}} keep herself wholly silent.|$|R
5|$|On March 4, {{the autopsy}} {{indicated}} Barker had nothing in her system since some chocolate milk {{the morning of}} her disappearance, and had not eaten since she vanished. There was no indication of foul play; <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> violence or sexual molestation. It was found she must {{have lived in the}} closet for three days without food or drink. An inspection of the closet showed marks from her attempt to escape.|$|E
5|$|That day, MacArthur flew to Walker's {{headquarters}} and he later wrote: MacArthur {{flew over the}} front line himself in his Douglas C-54 Skymaster but saw <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a Chinese build up and therefore decided to wait before ordering an advance or withdrawal. Evidence of the Chinese activity was hidden to MacArthur: the Chinese Army traveled at night and dug in during the day. For his reconnaissance efforts, MacArthur was nonetheless awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and honorary combat pilot's wings.|$|E
5|$|The pre-273 {{walls were}} narrow and while {{encircling}} the whole city, {{they do not}} seem to have provided real protection against an invasion. <b>No</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> towers or fortified gates exist and it cannot be proven that the walls enclosed the city as many gaps appears to have never been defended. The earlier walls seem to have been designed to protect the city against Bedouins and to provide a costume barrier.|$|E

5|$|Acting {{on reports}} from airmen {{that there were}} <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> enemy {{activity}} and the islands might have been evacuated, General Douglas MacArthur accelerated his timetable for capturing the Admiralties and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force. The campaign began on 29February 1944 when a force landed on Los Negros, the third-largest island in the group. By using a small, isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault, the force achieved tactical surprise, but the islands proved to be far from unoccupied. A furious battle over the islands ensued.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{preliminary}} hearing starting on 8 October 1966, during which Lamb reportedly showed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> emotion, the young man's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor. Because of the charge's severity, {{the case was}} heard by a judge and jury {{under the auspices of}} Ontario's Supreme Court, which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside. The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code. Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain, then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb.|$|E
5|$|After {{a futile}} attempt to {{approach}} Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; {{next day she}} encountered Bear, with Bartlett aboard. McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard Bear. Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E

5|$|Although {{partially}} blind from glaucoma {{by the age}} of 109 {{and completely}} blind from cataracts by 111, he nevertheless retained his memory and good health until his final days; his medical history showed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> high blood pressure, heart or kidney trouble or diabetes. He was able to walk without a cane or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he never complained about the segregated nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the War of the First Coalition Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. With {{military}} rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. Suffering from exhaustion, he was hospitalised and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed an eel whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.|$|E

5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} {{the exact location of}} the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E
5|$|Born Kathy Petro, {{she grew}} up in a horse racing family from Massachusetts and married a fellow horseman, Tim Ritvo, in 1990. Kathy and Tim ran a race horse {{training}} operation in Florida, and In 2010 she took it over solo when Tim became part of the management of Gulfstream Park race track. Her accomplishments came against the backdrop of having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001 and receiving a heart transplant in 2008. In spite of the medication regime and immunity issues that transplant recipients face, she lives a normal life as a horse trainer and shows <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> organ rejection.|$|E
5|$|Corpses {{thought to}} be vampires were {{generally}} described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and pressing on people in their sleep.|$|E
