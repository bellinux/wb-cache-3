50|$|Two {{subspecies}} {{are currently}} recognized under Naja nigricincta. The nominate subspecies N. n. nigricincta, {{commonly known as}} the zebra <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra</b> or western barred <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra,</b> is given its name because of the dark crossbars that run the length of the snake's body. The subspecies N. n. woodi, {{commonly known as the}} black <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra,</b> is solid black and is found only in the desert areas of southern Africa. Both subspecies are smaller than N. nigricollis; with average adult lengths of less than 1.5 m.|$|R
50|$|Venom {{from this}} species {{is very similar}} in {{composition}} {{to that of other}} <b>spitting</b> <b>cobras,</b> including the black-necked <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra</b> (N. nigricollis) and the red <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra</b> (N. pallida), which are both found in the same areas. It consists of postsynaptic neurotoxins and cytotoxins. However, this species is capable of injecting a much larger volume of venom in a single bite compared to the others. A single specimen milked at Bio-Ken Snake Farm in 2004 produced a wet venom yield of 6.2 ml, weighed 7.1 g and contained nearly 3 g of toxins.|$|R
40|$|The lethal and enzymatic {{activities}} of venom from Naja sumatrana (Equatorial <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra)</b> were determined and compared to venoms from three other Southeast Asian cobras (Naja sputatrix, Naja siamensis and Naja kaouthia). All four venoms exhibited the common characteristic {{enzymatic activities}} of Asiatic cobra venoms: low protease, phosphodiesterase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase and L-amino acid oxidase activities, moderately high acetylcholinesterase and hyaluronidase activities and high phospholipase A 2. Fractionation of N. sumatrana venom by Resource® S cation exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare, USA) yielded nine major protein peaks, with all except the acidic protein peak being lethal to mice. Most of the protein peaks exhibit enzymatic activities, and L-amino acid oxidase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, acetylcholinesterase, 5 '-nucleotidase and hyaluronidase exist in multiple forms. Comparison of the Resource® S chromatograms {{of the four}} cobra venoms clearly indicates that the protein composition of N. sumatrana venom is distinct from venoms {{of the other two}} <b>spitting</b> <b>cobras,</b> N. sputatrix (Javan <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra)</b> and N. siamensis (Indochinese <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra).</b> The results support the revised systematics of the Asiatic cobra based on multivariate analysis of morphological characters. The three <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra</b> venoms exhibit two common features: the presence of basic, potentially pharmacologically active phospholipases A 2 and a high content of polypeptide cardiotoxin, suggesting that the pathophysiological actions of the three <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra</b> venoms may be similar...|$|R

40|$|Naja sumatrana, the Equatorial <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra,</b> {{is listed}} {{as one of the}} {{medically}} important species in Southeast Asia and is the common <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra</b> in Peninsula Malaysia. The aims of this study are to investigate the toxinology, proteome and pharmacokinetic characteristics of N. sumatrana venom, which will contribute to management of cobra envenomation. The lethality and enzymatic activities of N. sumatrana were compared to venoms from two other regional spitting cobras: Naja sputatrix, Naja siamensis and a non-spitting cobra Naja kaouthia, which also occurs in Malaysia. Previously, the three <b>spitting</b> <b>cobras</b> were considered as belonging to one species, N. sputatrix. Results showed that the three <b>spitting</b> <b>cobra</b> venoms possess different venom composition, but all three contain basic phospholipases A 2 and high content of polypeptide cardiotoxins. The proteome of N. sumatrana venom was investigated using shotgun analysis, combination of multi-dimensional chromatography and 2 DE.
