2500|$|Evolutionary {{psychologists have}} {{addressed}} {{many of their}} critics (see, for example, books by Segerstråle (2000), Defenders of the Truth: The Battle for Science in the Sociobiology Debate and Beyond, Barkow (2005), Missing the Revolution: Darwinism for Social Scientists, and Alcock (2001), The Triumph of Sociobiology). Among their rebuttals are that some criticisms are straw men, are based on an incorrect nature versus nurture dichotomy, are based on misunderstandings of the discipline, etc. Robert Kurzban suggested that [...] "...critics of the field, when they err, are not slightly missing the mark.

2500|$|Additionally, in Disciplining {{investment}} Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis and the Downsizing of [...] "Corporate America", Karen Ho {{states that}} {{as we continue to}} learn more about Wall Street, we learn about each independent banker. As the banker brings their life experiences into the business, we can see the reasons for their actions. Each investor has a unique identity which contributes to the culture of Wall Street. Ideally, they live in the moment. [...] However, job insecurity and the volatile nature of the market creates a constant state of fear within the investor. Therefore, they must organize themselves and follow a pattern to ensure security, profit and prosperity for the long run. Karen Ho wishes for us to see Wall Street through the lens of the everyday investor and banker, as well as understand the experiences and everyday situations that they must endure. Ho also believes that the individuals within the public can counteract the stereotypes and negativity that both the media and society associates with Wall Street by learning more about the personal experiences of the investors and their everyday lives. Similarly to regular wage earners, Wall Street employees are just trying to earn a day's pay. Their work is sometimes undervalued, because the public does not see them in this manner. Thus, Wall Street cannot be understood in black and white terms. One needs to understand that they have a value system which is not only logical to them, but also reflective of North America's values of individual power, prestige, and social practices based on individualism. For example, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s Manhattan was a [...] "white-only" [...] community. [...] Within that time period, {{there was a lot of}} racial segregation. The values of America and the social practices were <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are today, so African Americans were not within the Wall Street community.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But it's very beautiful,' she thought, 'the {{blossoms}} {{are like}} stars. I {{am not going}} to pull it up.

60|$|Their proud {{devotion to}} {{that young man}} {{became clear to me}} in a very short time. Following his {{directions}} they went straight to Switzerland--to Zurich--where they remained the best part of a year. From Zurich, which they did <b>not</b> <b>like,</b> <b>they</b> came to Geneva. A friend of mine in Lausanne, a lecturer in history at the University (he had married a Russian lady, a distant connection of Mrs. Haldin's), wrote to me suggesting I should call on these ladies. It was a very kindly meant business suggestion. Miss Haldin wished to go through a course of reading the best English authors with a competent teacher.|$|E

50|$|For the Melancholic, the {{motivation}} is fear of rejection and/or the unknown. They {{have a low}} self-esteem and, figuring that others do <b>not</b> <b>like</b> them, <b>they</b> reject others first.|$|R

6000|$|There was {{alike in}} France and Germany a craving {{for a return}} to nature among the whole of the young generation.[271] The Social Contract {{supplied}} a dialect for this longing on one side, just as the Emilius supplied it on another. Such parts in it as people did not understand or did <b>not</b> <b>like,</b> <b>they</b> left out. They did not perceive its direction towards that [...] "perfect Hobbism," [...] which the author declared to be the only practical alternative to a democracy so austere as to be intolerable. They grasped phrases about the sovereignty of the people, the freedom for which nature had destined man, the slavery to which tyrants and oppressors had brought him. Above all they were struck by the patriotism which shines so brightly in every page, like the fire on the altar of one of those ancient cities which had inspired the writer's ideal.|$|E
6000|$|I now {{began to}} remark certain changes in myself which I did <b>not</b> <b>like.</b> <b>They</b> caused me much disquiet. I often saw the Golden Lucy {{in the air}} above the boat. I often saw her I have spoken of before, sitting beside me. I saw the Golden Mary go down, as she really had gone down, twenty times in a day. And yet the sea was mostly, to my thinking, not sea neither, but moving country and {{extraordinary}} mountainous regions, the like of which have never been beheld. I felt it time to leave my last words regarding John Steadiman, in case any lips should last out to repeat them to any living ears. I said that John had told me (as he had on deck) that he had sung out [...] "Breakers ahead!" [...] the instant they were audible, and had tried to wear ship, but she struck before it could be done. (His cry, I dare say, had made my dream.) I said that the circumstances were altogether without warning, and out of any course that could have been guarded against; that the same loss would have happened if I had been in charge; and that John was not to blame, but from first to last had done his duty nobly, like the man he was. I tried to write it down in my pocket-book, but could make no words, though I knew what the words were that I wanted to make. When it had come to that, her hands--though she was dead so long--laid me down gently {{in the bottom of the}} boat, and she and the Golden Lucy swung me to sleep.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2007, {{a company}} of 171 Swiss {{soldiers}} mistakenly entered Liechtenstein, after taking a wrong turn in the darkness.

5000|$|Paul Stewart, a {{historian}} {{who has worked}} on the restoration of the house, says the Myerses were very open about what they were doing and hospitable to the fugitives who passed through. [...] "When you say Underground Railroad, you think of a lot of secrecy and people hiding in corners ... But the closer you look at things, the more you learn. They entertained people at their dinner table. They probably had them sleeping in the upstairs bedroom. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were hiding them in the basement."

5000|$|Write up for debut ep:I can't {{say enough}} {{good things about}} Dick Army. Yeah, maybe they were just a cheap, goofy Black Flag knockoff, but damnit, they had that underdog charm and you've just gotta love that. Matt from Dick Army started this band, {{and to say that}} I was looking forward to it would be a huge understatement. It lived up to my expectations. Where Dick Army mostly played simple, sloppy three-chord punk, FOUR DEADLY QUESTIONS sound a lot more oiriginal and hard-to-pin-down. It's still fun and scrappy, to be sure, and it's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> turned into Hawkwind or anything, but the choppy rhythms and female backups make this stand out a whole lot. Me likey.|$|E
5000|$|Freeney {{was fined}} $20,000 by the NFL for his expletive-laced {{interview}} following {{the end of}} the Colts 2008-09 playoff campaign which ended with a 23-17 overtime playoff loss to the San Diego Chargers. The NFL cited Freeney for making [...] "inappropriate comments on officiating," [...] according to the Indianapolis Star. Freeney, frustrated by the three defensive penalties incurred as the Chargers made their game-winning drive, told Yahoo! Sports after the game: [...] "Those were the worst expletive calls I've {{seen in a long time}} ... To have a game of that magnitude taken out of your hands, it's just disgusting. It's <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> made one expletive bad call -- it's three calls, in overtime ... They need to start investigating some other expletive." ...|$|E

50|$|Not much {{is known}} about him, but in his various works he is {{depicted}} as a somewhat overweight man that wears a headband with various pens stuck to it. He likes cats {{and it seems that}} if an assistant does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> cats, <b>they</b> are no good.|$|R
5000|$|The gun {{was based}} on the barrel of the QF 4 inch Mk V and the breech {{mechanism}} of the BL 4 inch Mk VIII [...] and was first introduced in World War I on capital ships as secondary armament in triple-gun mountings, intended to provide rapid concentrated fire. This turned out to be unworkable in practice. Jane's Fighting Ships of 1919 commented, [...] "4-inch triples are clumsy and <b>not</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>They</b> are <b>not</b> mounted in one sleeve; have separate breech mechanism, a gun crew of 23 to each triple". Guns were thereafter used in single-gun mountings, typically on smaller ships as primary armament.|$|R
