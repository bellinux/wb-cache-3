30|$|To our knowledge, {{the present}} study is the first large, <b>noninterventional</b> <b>clinical</b> trial {{assessing}} compliance to treatment as the main outcome parameter in patients with bipolar disorder. According to our analysis and in line with everyday clinical experience, patients with ‘high’ versus ‘low’ compliance showed significant differences in a range of parameters assessed at baseline and throughout the study. Due to the observational and naturalistic study design, conclusions regarding causality between compliance and other parameters cannot be derived. The findings that high baseline compliance is a strong predictor of later compliance and the importance of the patients' attitude towards treatment suggest that compliance might be a rather stable factor in the treatment course of bipolar patients. It is also possible that the strong association between baseline and 2 -year compliance may be due to both variables being secondary to one or more common factors that remained relatively stable during follow-up.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In Japan, only <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> {{related to}} investigational new drug trials must be {{notified}} to regulatory bodies, and {{this lack of}} a uniform standard for <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> has caused a number of difficulties. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the willingness of physicians to participate in <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> and to identify effective methods to promote and enhance <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey by administrating questionnaires to physicians in 31 departments in Kyoto University Hospital from October through November 2007. Results A total of 51. 5 % (310 of 602) of physicians completed the questionnaire. More than two-thirds of them reported currently participating in <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> and nearly all believed that <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> is necessary for physicians. Less than 20 % of respondents had specific training regarding <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> and most reported a need to acquire concepts and skills regarding <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> especially those related to statistics. "Paperwork was complicated and onerous" was the most frequently cited obstacle in conducting <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> followed by "few eligible patients" and "lack of time". Previous participation in and prospective participation in <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> previous writing a research protocol were positively associated with current participation in <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> Conclusions Physicians in university hospitals need more training regarding <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> particularly in biostatistics. They also require administrative assistance. Our findings indicate that the quality of <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> could be improved if training in <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> methodology and biostatistics were provided, and if greater assistance in the preparation of study documents requested by the institutional Independent Ethics Committee were available. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{ability to}} base patient care on {{scientific}} evidence depends {{in part on}} the results of translational and applied research. The shortage of trained clinical researchers identified by several sources limits the availability of <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> studies upon which to base evidence-based therapeutics. This premise suggests that the dental profession needs to train more clinical researchers and faculty to conduct <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> and to teach its applications to practice. Increasing opportunities for <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> training {{in a variety of settings}} should eventually increase the numbers of clinical researchers, raise faculty involvement in <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> and promote science transfer. This paper reports on the current status of <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> in dental schools, specifies the diverse groups involved in the <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> enterprise, and identifies underutilized opportunities and partnerships for <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> training.

40|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>research</b> plays a {{fundamental}} role in establishing new treatments. <b>Clinical</b> <b>research</b> coordinators are considered essential in <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> and medical professionals such as pharmacists often {{take on this}} role. Pharmacy students can be considered future candidates for this task. We used questionnaires to survey the knowledge of and attitudes toward registration trials and <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> of pharmacy students at Tokushima University Hospital. All pharmacy students (103) to whom questionnaires were sent responded. Almost all respondents were aware of registration trials and <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> More than 90 % were aware of the existence of <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> coordinators, and about half (48. 6 %) understood their role. In <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> terminology, most respondents were aware of informed consent and related issues, but fewer than 20 % were aware of more practical things. In total, 29. 1 % and 40. 8 % of the respondents were willing to carry out and coordinate research. These findings suggest that pharmacy students have basic knowledge of <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> and that many students are willing to carry out and coordinate <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> More practical exposure to <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> may help to strengthen their future contribution.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Although {{concerns}} over <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> have been expressed, {{the governance of}} <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> has been little studied. The aim was to describe research policy, volume, funding and {{concerns over}} <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> in Finland. DESIGN: A qualitative study and {{the data were collected}} from various sources, including documents, statistics and semistructured expert interviews. SETTING: Finland. RESULTS: We found no national policy for <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> Many actors were responsible for facilitating, directing, regulating and funding <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> but no actor had the main responsibility. Health professionals were the main drivers for <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> The role of the health ministry was small. The ministry distributed state money for <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> in health services (EVO-money), but did not use it to direct research. Municipalities responsible for health services or national health insurance had little interest in <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> The Academy of Finland had had initiatives to promote <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> but they had not materialised in funding. <b>Clinical</b> <b>research</b> was common and internationally competitive, but its volume had declined relatively in the 2000 s. Industry was an important private funder, mainly supporting drug trials made for licensing purposes. Drug trials without an outside sponsor (academic projects) declined between 2002 and 2010. The funding and its targeting and amount were no one's responsibility. Concerns over <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> were similar as in other countries, but it had appeared late. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest fragmented governance and funding in <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> The unsystematic research environment has not prevented <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> from flourishing, but the public health relevance of the research carried out and its sustainability are unclear...|$|R

40|$|In Peru, {{despite a}} strong <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> {{infrastructure}} in Lima, and Masters degree programs in epidemiology at three universities, few neurologists participate in <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> It was our objective to identify perceived needs {{and opportunities for}} increasing <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> capacity and training opportunities for Peruvian neurologists. We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional survey of Peruvian neurologists in Lima and Arequipa, Peru. Forty-eight neurologists completed written surveys and oral interviews. All neurologists reported interest in <b>clinical</b> <b>research,</b> but noted that lack of time and financial resources limited their ability to participate. Although most neurologists had received some training in epidemiology and research design as medical students or residents, the majority felt these topics were not adequately covered. Neurologists in Arequipa noted international funding for <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> was uncommon outside {{the capital city of}} Lima. We concluded that <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> is important to Peruvian neurologists. The three main barriers to increased participation in <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> identified by neurologists were insufficient training in <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> methodology, meager funding opportunities, and lack of dedicated time to participate in <b>clinical</b> <b>research.</b> Distance learning holds promise as a method for providing additional training in <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> methodology, especially for neurologists who may have difficulty traveling to larger cities for additional training...|$|R

However, the prevalence of TMU among clinicians and researchers has not been explored. Since most physicians will be exposed to <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> over the course of their career, the understanding of <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> procedures is important. In this study we attempted to determine the prevalence of TMU among medical students: future clinicians. Methods: Twenty-two BUSM undergraduate medical students took part in a two-part, survey evaluating the prevalence of therapeutic misunderstanding using "The Therapeutic Misunderstanding Scale". The attitudes of the students towards increasing the exposure to <b>clinical</b> <b>research</b> topics through the medical school curriculum were also determined.
