50|$|Characters in the ISO/IEC 646 Basic Character Set are {{invariant}} characters.

Since universal acceptance of the 8-bit byte did not exist at that time, the national characters had to be made to fit within the constraints of 7 bits, meaning that some characters that appear in ASCII do not appear in other <b>national</b> <b>variants</b> of ISO 646.|$|R

50|$|ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit {{character}} set. It {{does not}} make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries.

50|$|As ASCII did {{not provide}} a number of {{characters}} needed for languages other than English, a number of <b>national</b> <b>variants</b> were made that substituted some less-used characters with needed ones. Due to the incompatibility of the various <b>national</b> <b>variants,</b> an International Reference Version (IRV) of ISO/IEC 646 was introduced, {{in an attempt to}} at least restrict the replaced set to the same characters in all variants. The original version (ISO 646 IRV) differed from ASCII only in that in code point 0x24, ASCII's dollar sign ($) was replaced by the international currency symbol (¤). The final 1991 version of the code ISO 646:1991 is also known as ITU T.50, International Reference Alphabet or IRA, formerly International Alphabet No. 5 (IA5). This standard allows users to exercise the 12 variable characters (i.e., two alternative graphic characters and 10 national defined characters). Among these exercises, ISO 646:1991 IRV (International Reference Version) is explicitly defined and identical to ASCII.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the problem of the {{distinctiveness}} of Russian modernization in connection with a discussion of Boris Mironov’s new monograph, “The Russian Empire: From Tradition to Modernity”. There are different theoretical interpretations of the processes of modernization as the transition from traditional to modern society. According to one point of view, the process of modernization is subject to universal laws and is realized according to the same model. In this context it becomes possible to single out a certain standard, to which <b>national</b> <b>variants</b> of modernization can be compared. According to the other point of view, there are various <b>national</b> <b>variants</b> of modernization, caused by national cultural and other features. In the second case the selection of a standard becomes contentious. Mironov is closer to the first point of view. In comparison with with the standard model of modernization (which is associated with Western civilization), he draws conclusions about the basic identity of the Western and Russian paths of development, and about the normal, successful, and effective course of Russian modernization. Recognizing that Mironov’s interpretation looks more convincing than various versions of Russian pseudo-modernization, the author of the given article turns his attention to the complexity of the first approach in the interpretation of modernization: the underestimation of accident and uniqueness in history; the underestimation of temporal, spatial, and situational variabilities of modernization; underestimation of network effects; and the problematical character of comparison to “the West,” which itself produces its own various <b>national</b> <b>variants</b> of modernization...|$|R
