5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares a weapon in order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, {{it may not be}} expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E

5|$|The {{practical}} construction {{given by}} the state of New York to the federal constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the Indian tribes, and the recognition by the federal authority of their validity, is very strong evidence that the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting the states from entering into treaties does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> a state, having the preemption right to Indian lands, from dealing with the Indian tribes directly, for the extinguishment of the Indian title.|$|E
5|$|A {{search of}} this star by the Hubble Space Telescope {{revealed}} no stellar companions, although this does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> {{the presence of}} smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate {{the lack of a}} debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of this star using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise indicate the presence of an orbiting companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to detect the gravitational perturbations massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> the objective review of executive discretion. Following {{the case of}} Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a {{hypothesis}} was put forth that argued the impactor {{that killed the}} dinosaurs belonged to the Baptistina family of asteroids. Concerns have been raised regarding the reputed link, in part because very few solid observational constraints exist of the asteroid or family. Indeed, it was recently discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the same chemical signature {{as the source of}} the K–Pg impact. Although this finding may make the link between the Baptistina family and K–Pg impactor more difficult to substantiate, it does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> the possibility. A 2011 Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, (WISE), study of reflected light from the asteroids of the family estimated the break-up at 80Ma, giving it insufficient time to shift orbits and impact the Earth by 66Ma.|$|E
5|$|Section116 of the Constitution of Australia precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e., {{the federal}} parliament) from making laws for {{establishing}} any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting {{the free exercise}} of any religion. Section116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a compromise in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions, Section116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution. However, Section116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> the states of Australia from making such laws.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{added that}} there is a need for the {{decision-maker}} to adduce evidence in court to prove that considerations of national security are involved. A mere assertion by the decision-maker that a matter involves national security does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> the court's judicial function of determining whether the decision was in fact based on grounds of national security. In other words, national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all. However, what the court cannot do is decide what action national security requires. This is to be left solely to those responsible for it.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildings}} were abandoned during the 17th century, and their uses, {{which may have}} been varied over the long period of occupation, remain unknown. The east–west orientation and superior workmanship of S1 would <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> religious use, but there is no other evidence, archaeological or documentary, to support that possibility. The limited number of finds, even of material which could not have been reused, have suggested that any medieval habitation must have been very limited in numbers of people and time. Other plausible uses have been suggested, such as a custom house or a warrener's house, but again there is nothing to support these speculations.|$|E
5|$|Articles 41 and 68 of the {{constitution}} empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying {{that he would be}} guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> a retrial.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifestyle}} of Archaeopteryx {{is difficult to}} reconstruct {{and there are several}} theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> Archaeopteryx from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.|$|E
5|$|This mamba preys {{primarily}} on adult birds, eggs and rodents. This species {{has also been}} documented to prey on bats. It is also believed that this species eats arboreal lizards as well, but {{this has not been}} documented. The preliminary evidence suggests that this species displays a sit-and-wait strategy of foraging. However, this evidence does <b>not</b> <b>preclude</b> active foraging by this species. One witness observed a specimen systematically hunt sleeping bats (J. Ashe, pers. comm. 1991). They have also been known to raid the nests of young birds. Sit-and-wait tactics may be successful with highly mobile prey, such as adult birds or rodents. Documented prey include the sombre greenbul, which occur in dense portions of natural and cultivated vegetation along Kenya's coastline. Ionides and Pitman (1965) reported a large Bushveld gerbil in the stomach of a green mamba in Tanzania. Although the Bushveld gerbil does not occur in Kenya, green mambas will prey on any of the seven species of gerbil that inhabit various portions of its range.|$|E
