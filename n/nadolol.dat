The US Headache Consortium lists five drugs as having medium to high efficacy: amitriptyline, divalproex, timolol, propranolol and topiramate. Lower efficacy drugs listed include aspirin, atenolol, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, fluoxetine, gabapentin, ketoprofen, metoprolol, <b>nadolol,</b> naproxen, nimodipine, verapamil and Botulinum A. Additionally, most antidepressants (tricyclic, SSRIs and others such as Bupropion) are listed as [...] "clinically efficacious based on consensus of experience" [...] without scientific support.

(17 patients) and were seen at weekly intervals for a four-week (short-term) period. Upward dosage titration (80 mg o. d. maximum, <b>nadolol</b> and 0. 5 % b. d. maximum, timolol) was permitted if, at any visit, the intraocular pressure (IOP) in either eye was greater than 21 mmHg. At the end of 4 weeks the IOPs of a comparable number of patients were controlled (IOP less than 22 mmHg) with 20 mg <b>nadolol</b> o. d. and 0. 25 % timolol b. d. The 40 mg and 80 mg o. d. <b>nadolol</b> regimens were comparable with each other, superior to the 20 mg regimen, and (at least) equivalent to 0. 5 % timolol. The absolute degree of IOP reduction achieved with oral <b>nadolol</b> was equivalent to that with topical timolol. Alterations in blood pressure and heart rate were predictably greater with the orally administered beta blocker. Long-term therapy (up to 24 months) in 28 <b>nadolol</b> patients and 5 timolol patients indicates no more likelihood of tolerance with <b>nadolol</b> therapy. Patient withdrawals from the study due to adverse reactions occurred with <b>nadolol</b> but not timolol. Since oral <b>nadolol</b> administered once daily is as efficacious as b. d. topical timolol, it can be recommended as first-line therapy for certain subsets of the glaucoma clinic population...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} oral <b>nadolol</b> in supraventricular tachycardia were evaluated prospectively in 27 children (median age 5. 5 years). Fifteen patients had an unsuccessful trial of digoxin therapy. Intravenous <b>nadolol</b> was given to seven patients during electrophysiologic study; five of these had an excellent response and two had a partial response (25 % decrease in tachycardia rate). Six of these patients had a similar response to oral <b>nadolol.</b> Twelve patients received both propranolol and <b>nadolol.</b> Among six patients, intravenous propranolol was successful in four and unsuccessful in two; all six had a similar response to oral <b>nadolol.</b> With oral propranolol, tachycardia was well controlled in four patients and persistent in two; five of five patients had a similar response to oral <b>nadolol.</b> Twenty-six patients were treated with oral nadolol; the ar- rhythmia was well controlled in 23, 2 had recurrent tachycardia and 1 patient had tachycardia at a 25 % slower rate. The effective dose of <b>nadolol</b> ranged between 0. 5 and 2. 5 mg/kg body weight once daily (median dose 1 mg/kg per day). During follow-up (3 to 36 months), compliance and tolerance were excellent; excluding 2 patients with reactive airway disease who developed wheezing, only 3 (12 %) of 24 had side effects necessitating a change in drug therapy.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether therapy with a beta-adrenergic or calcium channel blocking agent can improve the functional capacity and quality of life of patients with mild or moderately symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Background. Both beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers may alleviate symptoms in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but previous studies have been performed in hospitalized patients or have been open studies without control subjects. Methods. A randomized, double-blind crossover trial of <b>nadolol,</b> verapamil and placebo, administered for periods of 4 weeks each, was performed in 18 patients with mild or moderately symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (10 men, 8 women; mean age ± SD 39 ± 17 years). A detailed symptom assessment, bicycle exercise testing, echocardiography and Holter monitoring were performed in each period. Results. Two patients withdrew from the study owing to symptomatic sinus bradycardia during <b>nadolol</b> therapy. Neither drug improved maximal oxygen consumption (placebo 26 ± 8, verapamil 23 ± 6, <b>nadolol</b> 21 ± 7 ml/kg per min; p = 0. 1). Peak exercise work load was reduced by ≥ 10 W in 13 patients (81 %) during <b>nadolol</b> therapy and in 4 patients (25 %) during verapamil therapy (p = 0. 005, <b>nadolol</b> vs. verapamil). Despite the effects on exercise capacity, 13 patients (81 %) preferred drug treatment (8 verapamil, 5 <b>nadolol)</b> over placebo (p = 0. 001). Verapamil improved reported performance at work compared with <b>nadolol</b> (p = 0. 01) and tended to improve other measures of health-related behavior and symptoms compared with <b>nadolol</b> and placebo. Conclusions. In patients with mild or moderately symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, exercise capacity was not improved by <b>nadolol</b> or verapamil, and individuals were more often impaired by <b>nadolol</b> than with verapamil. Nevertheless, many patients derived symptomatic benefit from drug therapy, especially with verapamil...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} oral <b>nadolol</b> 20 mg once daily and topical timolol 0. 25 % twice daily on the intraocular pressures of 22 glaucoma suspects, in a 12 week double-masked crossover study. Both <b>nadolol</b> and timolol reduced intraocular pressure (p less than 0. 001). The reductions in intraocular pressure {{did not differ significantly}} after two weeks and four weeks of treatment. Nine of these subjects underwent treadmill exercise tests in order to compare the effects of <b>nadolol</b> and timolol on the cardiovascular system. The effects of the two treatments on blood pressure were comparable, but <b>nadolol</b> caused a significantly greater reduction in heart rate than timolol at rest (p less than 0. 05). <b>Nadolol</b> reduces intraocular pressure effectively and may prove a useful alternative treatment for chronic simple glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|To assess {{antiarrhythmic}} {{efficacy of}} oral <b>nadolol,</b> 15 patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia were studied. Eight patients had atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia and seven had AV reciprocating tachycardia involving an accessory AV pathway. Electrophysiologic studies were performed {{before and after}} intravenous infusion of propranolol (0. 20 mg/kg), and were repeated 5 to 8 days after oral <b>nadolol</b> therapy at a daily dose of 80 to 160 mg. Both intravenous propranolol and oral <b>nadolol</b> induced significant prolongation of the sinus cycle length from 741 ± 73 ms to 834 ± 97 and 1, 029 ± 95 ms, respectively (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 0001, respectively). Both intravenous propranolol and oral <b>nadolol</b> depressed AV nodal but not accessory AV pathway conduction, and shifted the dual AV nodal pathway conduction curves (A 1 A 2, A 2 H 2; A 1 A 2, H 1 H 2) upward {{and to the right}} by prolonging the conduction time and increasing the refractory period. Ten patients (seven with AV nodal reentry and three with AV reciprocation) who responded to intravenous propranolol also responded to oral <b>nadolol</b> with loss of the inducibility of sustained tachycardia; the remaining five patients (one with AV nodal reentry and four with AV reciprocation) who did not respond to intravenous propranolol also failed to respond to oral <b>nadolol</b> with persistence of the inducibility of sustained tachycardia. Thus, in conclusion, intravenous propranolol testing predicts the therapeutic efficacy of oral <b>nadolol</b> therapy and oral <b>nadolol</b> in once-daily doses may be used for long-term prophylaxis of recurrent supraventricular tachycardia...|$|E
