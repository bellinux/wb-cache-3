5|$|Vice Admiral Scheer became Commander {{in chief}} of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Pohl became too ill to {{continue}} in that post. Upon promotion to the position, Scheer wrote Guiding Principles for Sea Warfare in the North Sea, which outlined his strategic plans. His central idea was that the Grand Fleet should be pressured by higher U-boat activity and zeppelin raids as well as increased fleet sorties. The Grand Fleet would be forced to abandon the distant blockade and would have to attack the German fleet; the Kaiser approved the memorandum on 23 February 1916. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> approval from the Kaiser, Scheer could use the fleet more aggressively.|$|E

McCauley said he first met Corby at her court hearing in May 2005. He said Corby's mother invited him to visit Corby at Kerobokan Prison the following day. Despite claims that the photos had been taken prior to Corby's arrest, McCauley said the photos were taken at an empty fish pond at the prison where the two were permitted by prison guards to sit and talk.|$|E

25|$|The Sultan {{also ordered}} his vassal Muhammad Ali not to {{withdraw}} his army from the Peloponnese. But the Allies despatched envoys to Alexandria {{to demand that}} the Egyptian prince do precisely that. This left Muhammad Ali in a dilemma. On the one hand, as an experienced statesman, he knew that with the Great Powers backing Greek autonomy, the game {{was up in the}} Peloponnese. On the other, he was reluctant to be seen as betraying his overlord, especially <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> declared jihad, and also to inflict on his son Ibrahim the humiliation of a forced withdrawal. So he played for time, engaging the Allies in lengthy but inconclusive negotiations, in the hope that in the meantime the Sultan would himself reach an agreement with the Allies that would permit Ibrahim a face-saving departure.|$|E
25|$|Berthold fought on, scoring {{two more}} {{victories}} in July. However, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> re-equipped his fighter wing, influenza grounded {{all but three}} pilots from Jasta 19 by 6 July. Berthold scored three more victories in early August, raising his tally to 42. On 10 August, he led 12 of his pilots into battle against a vastly superior force of British aircraft. He shot down a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a fighter for his 43rd victory and an Airco DH.9 bomber for his 44th. When he tried {{to pull away from}} the DH.9 at 800 meters altitude, his shotaway controls came loose in his hand. His attempt to use a parachute failed because it required the use of both hands. His Fokker impacted a house in Ablaincourt so hard that its engine fell into the cellar. German infantrymen plucked him from the rubble and rushed him to hospital. His right arm was rebroken at its previous fracture. Rudolf Berthold would never fly again.|$|E
25|$|Henry, who {{had spent}} the winter in Paris, was awakened {{that night at the}} Louvre and by morning had donned his armour. The {{situation}} was now serious as the road now laid open to Paris across the Somme valley. At the time a peace proposal was being made between France and Spain. Taking back Amiens would afford Henry a major bargaining position whilst at the same time making sure peace was his ultimate objective. In effect the siege of Amiens would decide the war between France and Spain. Despite this however money was short in the French war chest and much dissent was caused amongst Henry's old Huguenot allies many of them refused to join and wanted concessions <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become a Catholic. Henry relied heavily on outside resources; money and troops especially from the English. Queen Elizabeth I after much dithering reluctantly agreed to the release of her troops after considering bargaining for Boulogne or an indemnity in money, the latter of which was agreed.|$|E

500|$|In May 1914, the General Board reissued the {{previous}} year's request, albeit for a vessel armed with six 4in guns, hoping to secure funding to build four vessels. Tensions in Central America increased {{the need for}} gunboats, which the Navy lacked in sufficient numbers. In October 1915, the design was finalized for {{what would be the}} gunboat of 1917; suggestions were solicited from Sacramentos commander <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> experience with the vessel in service. He suggested that the new gunboat be lengthened by , which would provide room for two additional boilers. He also requested an increase in displacement of [...] to accommodate a fourth gun.

The Bureau of Steam Engineering argued that four boilers would take up too much room, but three boilers that were slightly larger than those used in Sacramento would be possible. The first vessel, Asheville was authorized under the 1917 program, and a second, Tulsa, followed in 1918.|$|E
500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E

Five weeks later, {{on the afternoon of}} May 14, a 15-year-old named Randall Reffett disappeared while walking home from Senn High School; the youth was gagged with a cloth, causing him to die of asphyxiation. Hours after Reffett had been abducted, a 14-year-old named Samuel Stapleton vanished as he walked to his home from his sister's apartment. Both youths were buried in the same grave in the crawl space.|$|E

2500|$|Sirota is {{a critic}} of {{neoliberal}} economic policies, and has leveled criticism at the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations. Sirota supported John Edwards in the 2008 Democratic party primaries.

2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} once the Roman {{government}} forbade Jews to study the Torah. Pappus ben Judah found Rabbi Akiva publicly gathering people to study Torah and asked Akiva whether he did not fear the government. Akiva replied with a parable: A fox was once walking alongside of a river, and he saw fish swimming {{from one place to}} another. The fox asked the fish from what they fled. The fish replied that they fled from the nets cast by men. The fox invited the fish to come up onto the dry land, so that they could live together as the fox’s ancestors had lived with the fish’s ancestors. The fish replied that for an animal described as the cleverest of animals, the fox was rather foolish. For if the fish were afraid in the element in which they live, how much more would they fear in the element in which they would die. Akiva said that it was the same with Jews. If such was the Jews’ condition when they sat and studied Torah, of which [...] says, [...] "that is your life and the length of your days," [...] how much worse off would Jews be if they neglected the Torah! Soon afterwards, the Romans arrested and imprisoned Rabbi Akiva, and the Romans arrested Pappus ben Judah and imprisoned him next to Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Akiva asked Pappus who had brought him there. Pappus replied that Rabbi Akiva was happy that he had been seized for occupying himself with the Torah. Pappus regretted that he had been seized for occupying himself with idle things. When the Romans took Rabbi Akiva out for execution, it was the hour for the recital of the Shema, and while they combed his flesh with iron combs, he was accepting upon himself the kingship of Heaven by reciting [...] ("Here, O Israel [...] [...] [...] ," [...] Shema Yisrael [...] [...] [...]). His disciples asked him whether his devotion extended even to that point. He replied that all his days, he had been troubled by [...] "with all your soul," [...] which he interpreted to mean, [...] "even if God takes one's soul." [...] Rabbi Akiva questioned when he would have the opportunity to fulfill this. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity, he asked his disciples, should he not fulfill it? He prolonged the word [...] "One" [...] (ehad) in [...] until he expired while saying it. A Heavenly voice went forth and proclaimed: Happy are you, Akiva, that your soul has departed with the word [...] "One"! The ministering angels asked God: Such devotion to Torah, and such a reward? The angels argued that he should have received the reward of [...] "from them that die by Your hand, O Lord."
