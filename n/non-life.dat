5|$|Most {{traditional}} actuarial disciplines {{fall into}} two main categories: life and <b>non-life.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2017, Roy {{was shot}} and {{received}} <b>non-life</b> threatening injuries while attending a party at his grandmother's home in Compton, California. Accounts indicate he was injured as a bystander, and reportedly {{in the act of}} shielding children from the gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and <b>non-life.</b> By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and geology.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, damaged {{buildings}} polluted {{rivers in}} South Korea with chemicals and heavy metals. The country utilized 30,000soldiers {{to assist in}} cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President Kim Dae-jung authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies {{were sent to the}} affected citizens. By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to other residents in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49million in donations (₩58billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680meals to 16,919families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies. Residents in the country raised about $60million (₩72.1billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation. The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm. On September13, the South Korean government declared 203cities and counties as disaster zones, which entitled 8,714families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans. The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002. The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300million deficit for <b>non-life</b> insurance companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon. Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980. In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who lost their homes. However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's Habitat for Humanity built 69houses for storm victims in 2003, although that was only for {{a small portion of the}} overall number of people affected. About a year after Rusa hit, Typhoon Maemi also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74billion in damage and 117deaths. The damage total was less than from Rusa but was more significant to industrial areas.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{insurance}} business had been under-developed with {{low levels of}} insurance penetration. Post liberalisation, the sector has succeeded in raising penetration from 2.3 (life 1.8 and <b>non-life</b> 0.7) in 2000 to 5.1 (life 4.4 and <b>non-life</b> 0.7) in 2010.|$|E

25|$|In the 1940s, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) {{appointed}} INA President John A. Diemand to head {{a committee}} to consider the subject of “multiple-line” underwriting: the idea that <b>non-life</b> insurance companies could write any form of <b>non-life</b> insurance, even combining several kinds of insurance coverage in the same policy. At the Diemand Committee’s recommendation, the NAIC approved the concept of multiple-line underwriting in 1944.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, {{life and}} <b>non-life</b> {{insurers}} {{are subject to}} different regulatory regimes and different tax and accounting rules. The main reason for {{the distinction between the}} two types of company is that life, annuity, and pension business is very long-term in nature – coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many decades. By contrast, <b>non-life</b> insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.|$|E
25|$|Cheques (technically, all {{bills of}} exchange) incur a €0.50 tax, {{generally}} {{collected by the}} bank on issue of each chequebook. <b>Non-life</b> Insurance policies are subject to a 3% levy and Life assurance polices are subject to a 1% levy on premiums from 1 June 2009.|$|E
25|$|Across all the {{financial}} sub-sectors, and with particular {{reference to the}} larger institutions, supervision of Portuguese financial institutions is active, professional and well organized. The insurance sector has performed well, partly reflecting a rapid deepening {{of the market in}} Portugal. While sensitive to various types of market and underwriting risks, both the life and <b>non-life</b> sectors, overall, are estimated to be able to withstand a number of severe shocks, even though the impact on individual insurers varies widely.|$|E
25|$|Contemplation is a {{very old}} and {{important}} meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In agnya vichāya, one contemplates on seven facts life and <b>non-life,</b> the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of karmas, and the final accomplishment of liberation. In apaya vichāya, one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In vipaka vichāya, one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of karma. In sansathan vichāya, one thinks about {{the vastness of the}} universe and the loneliness of the soul.|$|E
25|$|India {{became the}} tenth-largest {{insurance}} {{market in the}} world in 2013, rising from 15th in 2011. At a total market size of US$66.4 billion in 2013, it remains small compared to world's major economies, and the Indian insurance market accounts for 2% of the world's insurance business. India's life and <b>non-life</b> insurance industry has been growing at 20%, and double-digit growth is expected to continue through 2021. The market retains about 360 million active life-insurance policies, the most in the world. Of the 52 insurance companies in India, 24 are active in life-insurance business. The life-insurance industry is projected to increase at double-digit CAGR through 2019, reaching US$1 trillion annual notional values by 2021.|$|E
25|$|Global {{insurance}} premiums grew by 2.7% in inflation-adjusted terms in 2010 to $4.3 trillion, climbing above pre-crisis levels. The return to growth and record premiums generated {{during the year}} followed two years of decline in real terms. Life {{insurance premiums}} increased by 3.2% in 2010 and <b>non-life</b> premiums by 2.1%. While industrialised countries saw an increase in premiums of around 1.4%, insurance markets in emerging economies saw rapid expansion with 11% growth in premium income. The global insurance industry was sufficiently capitalised to withstand the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and most insurance companies restored their capital to pre-crisis levels {{by the end of}} 2010. With the continuation of the gradual recovery of the global economy, it is likely the insurance industry will continue to see growth in premium income both in industrialised countries and emerging markets in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} {{reported a}} {{growth rate of}} around 10% from 1996–97 to 2000–01. After opening the sector, growth rates averaged 15.85% from 2001–02 to 2010–11. Specialised insurers Export Credit Guarantee Corporation and Agriculture Insurance Company (AIC) offer credit guarantee and crop insurance, respectively. AIC, which initially offered coverage under the National Agriculture Insurance Company (NAIS), has now started providing crop insurance on commercial line as well. It has introduced several innovative products such as weather insurance and insurance related to specific crops. The premium underwritten by the <b>non-life</b> insurers during 2010–11 was 42,576crore (425billion) against 34,620crore (346billion) in 2009–10. The growth was satisfactory, particularly given across-the-broad cuts in the tariff rates. The private insurers underwrote premiums of 17,424crore (174billion) against 13,977crore (140billion) in 2009–10. Public sector insurers underwrote premiums of 25,151.8crore (252billion) in 2010–11 against 20,643.5crore (206billion) in 2009–10, a growth of 21.8% against 14.5% in 2009–10.|$|E

He examined protozoa and grew cultured vesicles using grass, sand, iron and animal tissue, boiling them and adding potassium and gelatin. Having heated the materials to incandescence with a heat-torch, he wrote that he had seen bright, glowing, blue vesicles. He called them [...] "bions" [...] and believed they were a rudimentary form of life, halfway between life and <b>non-life.</b> He wrote that when he poured the cooled mixture onto growth media, bacteria were born, dismissing the idea that the bacteria were already present in the air or on other materials.|$|E

2500|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{calculations}} were {{of course}} performed without computers. The calculations of life insurance premiums and reserving requirements are rather complex, and actuaries developed techniques {{to make the}} calculations as easy as possible, for example [...] "commutation functions" [...] (essentially precalculated columns of summations over time of discounted values of survival and death probabilities) [...] Actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and actuarial science, {{and to protect the}} public interest by promoting competency and ethical standards [...] However, calculations remained cumbersome, and actuarial shortcuts were commonplace. <b>Non-life</b> actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life insurance colleagues during the 20th century.
