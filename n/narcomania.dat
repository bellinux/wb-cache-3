40|$|Taking {{into account}} modern {{achievements}} in medicine, psychology and sociology, the attempt at complex research of possible inclinations for psychostimulant, toxic agent {{and drug abuse}} among youths and students was made with the subsequent determination of the possible alternates of primary prevention. It is analysed the basic and additional risk factors promoting smoking, drinking, psychostimulant abuse, toxicomania and <b>narcomania</b> among young people. The dynamics of possible influences of medical, psychological and social factors is studied. The attempt of short-term prognostication and ranking was made...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} material: 60 unlinear he-rats and 109 hemice of the CBA line. The work {{is aimed}} at studying the expression of gene c-fos in the brain of animals with the acute and chronic action of morphine and at studying {{the role of the}} NMDA-receptors through the effects of morphine on the expression of this gene. It has been established, that activation of the genetic apparatus of the nervous cells under the effect of morphine takes place {{with the help of the}} regulator link of the "early genes", similar to that which has been used in the mechanisms of learning and neuronal plasticity. The role of the N-methyl-receptors in the development of the long-time variations to be caused by the morphine, has been determined. The investigation material allows to use new ways of correction of <b>narcomanias</b> through the action on the neuromediator systems, in particular, on the NMDA-receptors.

40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: 670 he-rats of the Wistar line. The {{purpose of the}} work: searching for {{the ways of the}} {{directed}} correction of the morphine effect by acting the inhibitors of the calcium-dependent endopeptidases. The inhibitor Ca* 992 * 99 +-dependent endopeptidase - antipaine reduces the increment of the chromatinetranscription activity, to be induced by the morphine in neurons of the Central Nervous System (CNS) different structures. The density and sensitivity of delta -opiate receptors in the state of rejection of the morphine-dependent rats change; lupeptine prevents from the change of state of the delta -opiate structures. Antipaine and lupeptine intensify the analgetic properties of morphine with the combined introduction, reduce the expression of the morphine rejection syndrome of the morphine-dependent rats. The subject of introduction: the means for elimination of abstinent syndrome with the opia <b>narcomanias,</b> the preparation for analgesia on the base of morphine.

40|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) {{is a serious problem}} to pediatric neurologists. The prevalence of ADHD in developed countries ranges from 1 to 20 %. ADHD is characterized by a triad of symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10 th revision, codes it as F 90) and it is the most common conduct disorder in children. The etiology of ADHD remains disсutable to the present day; there are a few basic concepts of the origin of this disorder. Its manifestations may be a reason for family conflicts, poor peer relationships, social and school maladjustment, learning problems, lower academic performance, accidents and injuries, smoking, psychoactive substance abuse (toxicomania, <b>narcomania),</b> delinquencies, deviant social behavior, thus having a negative impact on all spheres of a patient’s life. The manifestations of ADHD may continue in adulthood, resulting in work and family life problems, low self-evaluation, alcohol and psychoactive substance abuse, and other unfavorable consequences. The authors describe the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic principles (diagnostic scales and tests), differential diagnosis (by setting out a large group of different diseases, the manifestations of which can mimic ADHD), treatment, and prognosis of the disorder. Within its therapeutic correction framework, the authors present the definition and general principles of Montessori therapy, including recommendations for parents and relatives to deal with children with ADHD.   </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{work is the}} {{retrospective}} study of cases of IE in intravenous drug abusers hospitalized at Clinic of infection deseases FN Na Bulovce in years 2000 - 2009. By surviving pacients their consecutive health evolution has been checked. The file includes 45 cases of IE in 40 intravenous drug abusers¨(5 recurrences at 3 pacients). The tricuspidal valve alone or together with the pulmonary valve have been affected in 29 cases (64 %), the valves of the left hearth in 9 cases (20 %), the duplex disability occured 5 times (11 %). Except i. v. <b>narcomania</b> we have found bicuspidal aortal valve (twice), artificial aortal valve (once), and postrevmatical changes in mitral valve (once) as IE predispositions. Etiologicaly predominates Staphylococcus aureus, whereas there was a dual infection in one case. Only at 3 patients (7 %) an other causer has been found. In 11 cases the etiology is not clear. Part of 26 of 29 cases (90 %) at isolated right hearth affects was a pulmoary embolisation. Serious complication was the acute respiratory distress syndrome - ARDS (8 times), multiorgan dysfunction syndrome - MODS (8 times, lethality 12 %) and brain edema (5 times, lethality 40 %). From 57 hospitalizations (some patients were hospitalized twice with the same attack) were 29 patients cured, 17 sent to cardiocenter and 7 went [...] ...|$|E
