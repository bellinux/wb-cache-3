Actor Andrew Buchan said cast members were told little about the plot, except on a <b>need-to-know</b> basis as they prepared for their performances in each episode. Actor Joe Sims said that actors only receive two scripts {{at a time to}} ensure {{that they did not know}} where the plot was headed. Several different endings for series two were filmed, and Chibnall said that even cast members would remain in the dark about the programme's outcome until the final episode aired.|$|E
25|$|Actor Andrew Buchan said {{cast members}} were told {{little about the}} plot, except on a <b>need-to-know</b> basis as they {{prepared}} for their performances in each episode. The actors also received only parts of scripts and only two scripts {{at a time to}} ensure {{that they did not know}} story details too far in advance. Cinematographer John Conroy said the cast and crew did not know how series two ended until three weeks before shooting began on the final two scripts. Two former Coldstream Guards were hired to stand in front of news reporters when they visited the set, to block possible photographs of the filming. Several different endings for series two were filmed, the cast was not permitted to see completed episodes of the series, and Chibnall said that cast members will remain in the dark about the programme's outcome until the final episode airs.|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{was created}} in spring 2009 during a story conference, where {{executive}} producer Diederick Santer, storyliner Dominic Treadwell-Collins, series consultant and lead writer Simon Ashdown, series producer Lorraine Newman, script producer Sharon Batten, and Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke were considering what {{to do for the}} Christmas Day 2009 and 25th anniversary episodes. They discussed the character Archie Mitchell and how everyone hated him, and decided on a storyline with characters' hatred and anger towards Archie building up before Christmas, with a peak on Christmas Day when he is killed and another for the reveal on the 19 February 2010 anniversary. They decided to keep the killer's identity a secret within the small group and decided to reveal it during a live episode so that the secret could be kept for as long as possible, and managed the story on a <b>need-to-know</b> basis. The live episode's director, Clive Arnold, became the seventh person to discover the identity of the murderer. They went through the characters to decide who would create a [...] "shiver" [...] moment, and decided against Janine, even though she could have done it, because she has killed before. The killer was going to be Archie's wife Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), until producers discovered Windsor had planned to leave the show, so they decided on Stacey. Although scripts initially diverted attention away from Stacey, Santer realised that drawing attention away from her too much might make it more apparent.|$|E
2500|$|Also, <b>need-to-know</b> {{principle}} {{needs to}} be in effect when talking about access control.

Within the <b>need-to-know</b> principle, network administrators grant the employee least amount privileges to prevent employees access and doing more than what they are supposed to. <b>Need-to-know</b> helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability (C‑I‑A) triad. <b>Need-to-know</b> directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.|$|E
2500|$|Over 1,000 flood {{warnings}} and statements, {{five times the}} normal, were issued to notify the public and <b>need-to-know</b> officials of river levels. In such places as St. Louis, river levels were nearly 20 feet (6 m) above flood stage, the highest ever recorded there in 228 years. The 52-foot (16 m)-high St. Louis Floodwall, built to handle {{the volume of the}} 1844 flood, was able to keep the 1993 flood out with just over two feet (0.6 m) to spare. [...] This floodwall was built in the 1960s, to great controversy, out of interlocking prefabricated concrete blocks. [...] Had it been breached, the whole of downtown St. Louis would have been submerged.|$|E
2500|$|Porter {{began his}} {{engineering}} career in 1954 at WLAC-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, where {{he wished to}} be a cameraman—nobody wanted to mix sound, though, and that job was assigned to him, {{the guy with the}} least seniority. He mixed up to four microphones for television broadcast for $92 per week, equivalent to $ today. At nearby RCA Records in 1959, the chief engineer was transferred after angering Chet Atkins, and Porter applied for the position. He was told by an RCA executive from New York that the job would ruin his marriage, but Porter said [...] "I can handle that"—he was hired at $148 per week, and given two weeks to learn all the equipment and how to mix up to 12 microphones for music recordings. Shortly after starting with RCA on March 31, 1959, Porter mixed the single [...] "Lonesome Old House" [...] for Don Gibson; it was a crossover success in both the country music and the pop music charts, and Porter began to be requested by name. In June 1959, he mixed [...] "The Three Bells" [...] for the Browns, with Atkins producing and Anita Kerr arranging. While editing the master to be sent to New York for pressing, Porter accidentally hit the wrong controls on the tape recorder and stretched the tape {{at the beginning of the}} song, distorting the pitch. Without telling anyone, he spliced a different take with a good intro onto the beginning, and sent that version instead. Four decades later, Porter recalled his quick fix: [...] "this was a <b>need-to-know</b> situation and I figured nobody needed to know. I had been in the business three months or something like that. You're not a good engineer until you destroy a master and hopefully live to talk about it." [...] In July, the song went to number one on the U.S. country and pop charts, and Porter's reputation rose.|$|E
