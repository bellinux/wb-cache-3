5|$|The {{following}} day, June 28, Union and Confederate soldiers clashed again {{near the}} Golding house. Jones {{suspected that the}} Federals <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> were withdrawing, and authorized Toombs to perform a reconnaissance-in-force to ascertain whether this was true. However, Toombs turned the reconnaissance operation into a full engagement and advanced with some of Anderson's men. Before he could be countermanded, the Confederates had already been repulsed by the VI Corps.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{ancillary}} structures <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> at Valley View, including a smokehouse and a water well, and {{the foundations of}} an ice house and a summer kitchen. Although the smokehouse, the summer kitchen and the ice house {{are believed to have}} been built by the Collinses before Big Jim Parsons built Valley View, the dates of construction are uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Both {{supporters}} and critics of Cheney regard {{him as a}} shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> floor for Cheney {{in addition to his}} office in the West Wing, his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).|$|E

5|$|Domitian firmly {{believed}} in the traditional Roman religion, and personally {{saw to it that}} ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign. In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter, perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter Conservator was also constructed <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to Jupiter Custos.|$|E
5|$|When {{the house}} and gardens were {{inherited}} by Coplestone Warre Bampfylde (1720–91) in the 18th century, a Georgian landscape garden was laid out, containing ponds, a grand cascade, a gothick alcove, a Tuscan temple arbour (1786), and a folly mausoleum. Bampfylde was an amateur architect of talent and a friend and adviser to Henry Hoare who laid out the gardens at Stourhead. Bampfylde also designed a Doric temple for the grounds, which was built around 1786, with an ashlar tetrastyle prostyle fronted by Tuscan columns and a large modillioned pediment. A Victorian formal parterre was added <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> by Henry Hall in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|In 1606 Adam Mort {{bought the}} manor house and land in Astley. He was {{a wealthy man}} who built the first Astley Chapel as a chapel of ease for the parish church in Leigh. The chapel was consecrated in 1631, the year that he died. He built a grammar school that stood for over 200years until 1833, when it was {{demolished}} and rebuilt. Adam Mort's grandson, also Adam, rebuilt Damhouse in 1650 and his initials are carved in the plaque over the front door. The stone and timber structure was named from the stream which was dammed to supply water to a waterwheel powering a corn mill <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> It is possible the hall was once surrounded by a moat.|$|E

5|$|John Struthers {{was the son}} of Dr Alexander Struthers (1767–1853) and {{his wife}} Mary Reid (1793–1859). They lived in Brucefield, a large stone-built 18th century house with spacious grounds, which was then just outside Dunfermline; John was born in the house. Alexander was a wealthy mill owner and linen merchant. He bought Brucefield early in the 19th century, along with Brucefield Mill, a linen {{spinning}} mill built in 1792. Linen was threshed at the nearby threshing mill, and bleached in the open air <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> There were still linen bleachers living in Brucefield House in 1841, but they had gone by 1851, leaving the house as the seat of the Struthers family. Mary's father, Deacon John Reid, was also a linen maker. Alexander and Mary were married in 1818; the marriage, though not warmly affectionate, lasted until Alexander's death despite the large age difference. Both Alexander and Mary are buried at Dunfermline Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Formal gardens {{were laid}} out around the house by W. A. Nesfield in around 1840–50 for Hungerford Crewe. Nesfield's design {{included}} statuary, gravelled walks and elaborate parterres realised using low box hedges and coloured minerals. Balustraded terraces were also constructed on {{the north and south}} sides of the hall, probably designed by E. M. Barry, and incorporating statues of lions, griffins and other heraldic beasts, echoing the interior staircase. Military usage during the Second World War, however, destroyed parts of the gardens; army buildings were erected <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and the area in front of the hall served as a parade ground and later was ploughed up to grow potatoes. The grounds were further neglected while the house was used as offices, and little has survived except the terraces, gates and statues. In 2009, English Heritage placed the hall on the Heritage at Risk Register as highly vulnerable, considering that the historic character of the gardens and park is compromised by recent developments to the hotel complex, in particular the conference centre, spa and associated parking area.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1643 the {{commander}} of the local Parliamentary forces in Cheshire, Colonel Robert Duckenfield, was ordered to seize Wythenshawe Hall and to remove anything of value that could be found. Forewarned, Robert Tatton recruited a group of more than 50 defenders from among his staff and Royalist friends. After ransacking the nearby village of Northenden the Roundheads arrived at Wythenshawe Hall on 21 November 1643, but they did not find the task of taking it as easy as they had imagined. At one point during the siege the attackers almost took possession of the house in a struggle during which six of the defenders were killed. The Parliamentarians refused a truce to allow the bodies to be taken to the local church for proper services to be held, necessitating their burial in the garden behind the house. One of those killed was the fiancé of Mary Webb, a young woman who had been brought up by the Tattons and had remained in the house with the defenders. Towards the end of the siege Mary saw the man who had led the attack, Duckinfield's second-in-command Captain Adams, sitting on a wall <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Borrowing a musket from one of the defenders, she shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|Women in the Middle Ages were officially {{required}} to be subordinate to some male, whether their father, husband, or other kinsman. Widows, who were often allowed much {{control over their own}} lives, were still restricted legally. Women's work generally consisted of household or other domestically inclined tasks. Peasant women were usually responsible for taking care of the household, child-care, as well as gardening and animal husbandry <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> They could supplement the household income by spinning or brewing at home. At harvest-time, they were also expected to help with field-work. Townswomen, like peasant women, were responsible for the household, and could also engage in trade. What trades were open to women varied by country and period. Noblewomen were responsible for running a household, and could occasionally be expected to handle estates in the absence of male relatives, but they were usually restricted from participation in military or government affairs. The only role open to women in the Church was that of nuns, as they were unable to become priests.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{occurrence}} of cases of dermal leishmaniasis in the Municipality of Piçarras, in the East of the Brazilian State of Santa Catarina, collections of Phlebotomine sandflies {{by the use of}} CDC-like light traps were developed <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> of <b>the</b> patients. Three species (Lutzomyia neivai, Lu. fischeri and Lu. ayrozai) were collected. Lu. neivai was predominant <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses,</b> and Lu. ayrozai was collected in a secondary forest in a nearby municipality (Navegantes). The novelty of this focus, the most southern one in the East of Brazil, underscores the need for more complete studies on the sandfly fauna...|$|R
