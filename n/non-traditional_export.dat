Except in Nicaragua and Honduras, the share of such exports in total exports increased, reflecting the general trend towards modernization of the export structure and reduction of the vulnerability of the balance of payments to fluctuations in the prices of traditional exports. The qualitative improvement in the export structure has been only limited, however. On the one hand, the role of <b>non-traditional</b> <b>exports</b> of agricultural origin has been maintained and in many cases has increased, while on the other hand, none of the countries have markedly increased the share of industrial exports that make intensive use of human capital or technology. Among the factors which have most influenced the performance of <b>non-traditional</b> <b>exports</b> are investment, the real exchange rate and, in the case of Costa Rica, fiscal incentives. Non-traditional exporters in Central America and the Dominican Republic have been more sensitive than their traditional counterparts to changes in relative prices.

40|$|The 1997 SAM for Costa Rica {{takes into}} account the new <b>non-traditional</b> <b>export</b> sectors spurred by the export {{promotion}} policies of the past two decades. The existing SAMs for Costa Rica do not include these new sectors and the productive linkages between these {{and the rest of the}} economy. To attend this serious gap,an effort was carried out to compile a 1997 SAM for Costa Rica, the construction of which is explained in this document along the lines of a ‘top-down’ estimation procedure. The entries of the new SAM were first adjusted in a summary set of national accounts and then subsets of estimates were adjusted to the controlling aggregate totals. The elimination of data discrepancies, in particular the reconciliation of national accounts data and survey data, was successfully implemented using the Cross-Entropy (CE) method whereby a comprehensive set of constraints could be imposed using all the prior reliable information available. The macro SAM was disaggregated to arrive at a ‘raw micro SAM’. The activity account was split into the 17 production activity accounts, including but not limited to domestic, traditional and <b>non-traditional</b> <b>export</b> agriculture, food industries, textiles, wood products, oil and chemicals, paper, construction, trade, restaurants and hotels, transport and communucation, electricity, gas and water, financial services and insurance. In consistency with the activity breakdown, the flows in the commodity account were split into 17 accounts. Row-wise these flows included intermediate consumption, private and government consumption, gross fixed capital formation, inventory change,export subsidies, and exports. Column-wise the disaggregation was for sale and consumption taxes, import tariffs, export taxes and imports, using national accounts data at the commodity level.

40|$|Tourism is Fiji's largest industry, earning over F$ 500 {{million in}} foreign {{exchange}} and employing around 40, 000 people. The tourism industry {{over the last}} decade has grown {{at an annual rate of}} 10 - 12 %. The expansion of tourism, which generates more expenditure in the economy, is likely to have implications for other industries. In this paper, the aim is to delineate the long-run impact of a 10 % increase in tourist expenditure on Fiji's economy. To achieve this, the author uses a computable general equilibrium model. Among the key findings are that a 10 % increase in tourist expenditure in Fiji will increase GDP by 0. 5 % and contribute to an improvement in the balance of payments, real consumption will increase by 0. 72 % and real national welfare will increase by 0. 67 %. It is also found that an expansion of tourism will lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate, together with an increase in domestic prices and wage rates, and so traditional export sectors will experience a decline in their export competitiveness.

In a context of severe political-economic structural inequalities and potentially high social and cultural costs, quantitative household survey results demonstrate a modest decrease in concentration of land in favour of Maya smallholders; more gender-egalitarian relations of production than expected; and largely positive local perceptions of economic and social change. Qualitative analysis interprets these findings in light of Maya-affective ties to land, preferences for continuity in traditional labor organization and subsistence maize production, perceptions of risk, and the transfer of traditional marketing skills. We find that Kaqchikeles are shaping alternative modernities as they deal with new sets of political-economic and social constraints.

40|$|In this paper, we {{have two}} main objectives: to {{investigate}} the links between globalization and poverty observed in Zambia during the 1990 s, and to explore the poverty impacts of <b>non-traditional</b> <b>export</b> growth. We look at consumption and income effects separately. On the consumption side, we study the maize marketing reforms {{and the elimination of}} maize subsidies. We find that complementary policies matter: the introduction of competition policies at the milling industry acted as a cushion that benefited consumers but the restriction on maize imports by small-scale mills hurt them. On the income side, we study agricultural export growth to estimate income gains from international trade. The gains are associated with market agriculture activities (such as growing cotton, tobacco, hybrid maize) and rural labor markets and wages. We find that by expanding trade opportunities Zambian households would earn significantly higher income. Securing these higher levels of well-being requires complementary policies, like the provision of infrastructure, credit, and extension services. ...|$|E

Anthropologist Greta Friedemann-Sanchez’s detailed analysis of gender and labor relations in Colombia’s cut-ﬂower industry presents a decidedly different spin on this familiar dichotomy. By tracing the effects of women’s agro-industrial employment on intrahousehold dynamics, she creates a nuanced account of how economic adjustment and neoliberal policies are mediated by on-the-ground cultural and economic processes.

40|$|Unexploited {{agricultural}} {{potential and}} regional trade opportunities {{together with the}} presence of South Africa and other middle-income countries, offer Southern Africa the unique opportunity to foster agricultural growth through regional linkages. In this study a global general equilibrium model that focuses on Southern Africa is used to analyze the implications that these specific characteristics of the regional economy have on growth choices of low-income countries. Three groups of growth scenarios are define to analyze the role of South Africa as a possible engine of growth, the role of own growth engines in low-income countries, and growth linkages between middle- and low-income countries. Results of the simulation scenarios show that larger benefits to low-income countries can be expected from grain and livestock productivity growth as a result of high multiplier effects and the large share of these activities in GDP. Productivity growth in grain and livestock results in higher GDP growth, higher agricultural output and food consumption, and lower agricultural imports than with productivity growth in <b>non-traditional</b> <b>export</b> crops. Unlike other regions where growth in grain production is likely constrained by domestic demand, growing middle-income economies in Southern Africa can provide additional demand to grains and livestock, slowing down the decline in grain prices in the region.

40|$|Prior to the Cuban Revolution of 1959, Cuban {{exports to}} the United States held a privileged {{position}} in the US market. Many of the country’s exports paid at least 20 % less in duties than competitors and after 1934, Cuba’s main export—sugar [...] had a guaranteed quota in the US market. Yet these trade agreements—specifically, the Reciprocity Convention of 1902 and the Reciprocal Trade Agreement of 1934 —have often been criticized by Cuban and US scholars alike as having condemned Cuba to a monoculture economy. Moreover, critics contend that the treaties led to the dominance of US capital in Cuba’s sugar industry, and that those who gained the most from the treaties were US investors in Cuba along with mainland sugar refineries. In addition, the treaties did little to diversify the Cuban economy, reproducing its food dependence while discouraging its industrial development.
