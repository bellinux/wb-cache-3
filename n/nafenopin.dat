The increase in microbody population in acatalasemic mice, although not accompanied by increase in catalase activity, was associated with a twofold increase in the amount of catalase protein. The absence of sex difference in microbody proliferative response in nafenopin-treated rats and wild type mice is of particular significance, since ethyl-α-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate (CPIB) -induced microbody proliferation and increase in catalase activity occurred only in males. <b>Nafenopin</b> can, therefore, be used as an inducer of microbody proliferation and of catalase synthesis in both sexes of rats and mice.

All the above effects of <b>nafenopin</b> were fully reversed when the drug was withdrawn from the diet of male rats. During reversal, several microbody nucleoids were seen free in the hyaloplasm or in the dilated endoplasmic reticulum channels resulting from a rapid reduction in microbody matrix proteins after the withdrawal of <b>nafenopin</b> from the diet.

40|$|As {{previously}} demonstrated, chronic {{administration of}} phenobarbital (0. 05 % in the drinking water) and of <b>nafenopin</b> (0. 1 % in the diet) increases the incidence and the kinetics of appearance of liver cancers. If bile acids {{play a key}} role in liver carcinogenesis, it might thus be expected that treatments like phenobarbital or <b>nafenopin,</b> which positively modulate that process, also modify their hepatic pool. The aim of the present study was to analyze the modifications of the liver bile acid pool during the modulation of liver carcinogenesis by phenobarbital and <b>nafenopin.</b> The animals were submitted to the hepatocarcinogenic initiation-selection (IS) procedure adapted from Solt and Farber. As compared to basal diet, the chronic feeding of phenobarbital significantly increased the total concentrations of liver bile acids both at weeks 9 and 17. That increase was mainly due to a change in the concentration of beta-muricholic acid and hyodeoxycholic acid and, to a lesser extent, of chenodeoxycholic acid and alpha-muricholic acid. In contrast, feeding a diet containing <b>nafenopin</b> led to a significant decrease in the concentration of liver bile acids, due to a complete disappearance of chenodeoxycholic acid and muricholic acid, and a decrease in the concentration of hyodeoxycholic acid. Carcinomas appearing in IS phenobarbital-treated rats contain fewer bile acids than the surrounding parenchyma (because of the decrease in deoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid) whereas the malignant tumors appearing in IS nafenopin-treated rats have essentially the same pattern of bile acids as the surrounding parenchyma.

When hyperplasia was induced by cyproterone acetate and <b>nafenopin,</b> the mitogenic response of the liver was not associated with an increased expression of c-jun or c-fos, {{despite the fact that the}} timing of the cell cycle was similar to that observed after partial hepatectomy.

The acylation patterns observed were time- and dose-dependent, and the acylated residue consisted of the original xenobiotic. The acylation patterns generated by the three xenobiotic carboxylates included common proteins which were acylated by the three xenobiotics (e. g. proteins of 32, 52, 56 and 72 kDa) as well as unique proteins which were specifically acylated by the respective xenobiotics. The acylation of liver proteins by either MEDICA 16 or <b>nafenopin</b> remained unaffected under conditions where protein synthesis was completely inhibited by cycloheximide. Protein acylation thus offers a common mode of action of xenobiotic amphipathic carboxylates, which may, however, result in diverse xenobiotyl-protein adducts.

40|$|Nonenzymatic {{modification}} of proteins by acyl glucuronides is well documented; however, {{little is known}} about their potential to damage DNA.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the mechanisms underlying such DNA damage, and to screen chemically diverse carboxylic acid drugs for their DNA-damaging potential in glucuronidation proficient murine hepatocytes. Cells were incubated with each aglycone for 18 h, followed by assessment of compound cytotoxicity using the MTT assay and evaluation of DNA damage using the Comet assay. Relative cytotoxic potencies were ketoprofen > diclofenac, benoxaprofen, <b>nafenopin</b> >> gemfibrozil, probenecid > bezafibrate > clofibric acid. At a noncytotoxic (0. 1 mM) concentration, only benoxaprofen, <b>nafenopin,</b> clofibric acid, and probenecid significantly increased Comet moments (P < 0. 05 Kruskal-Wallis). Clofibric acid and probenecid exhibited the greatest DNA-damaging potency, producing significant DNA damage at 0. 01 mM concentrations. The two drugs produced maximal increases in Comet moment of 4. 51 x and 2. 57 x control, respectively. The glucuronidation inhibitor borneol (1 mM) abolished the induction of DNA damage by 0. 5 mM concentrations of clofibric acid and probenecid. In an in vitro cell-free system, clofibric acid glucuronide was 10 x more potent than glucuronic acid in causing DNA strand-nicking, although both compounds showed similar rates of autoxidation to generate hydroxyl radicals. In cultured hepatocytes, the glycation inhibitor, aminoguanidine, and the iron chelator, desferrioxamine mesylate, inhibited DNA damage by clofibric acid, whereas the free radical scavengers Trolox and butylated hydroxytoluene, and the superoxide dismutase mimetic bis- 3, 5 -diisopropylsalicylate had no effect. In conclusion, clinically relevant concentrations of two structurally unrelated carboxylic acids, probenecid and clofibric acid, induced DNA damage in isolated hepatocytes via glucuronidation- dependent pathways.

This polypeptide has been designated as PPA- 80 (PPA, for peroxisome-proliferation-associated; 80 for 80000 mol. wt.).

The anti-(polypeptide PPA- 80) antibodies did not cross-react with catalase, a marker enzyme for peroxisomes, or with NADPH–cytochrome P- 450 reductase, which has the same approximate mol. wt., 80000. The intensity of immunoprecipitin bands formed with microsomal, large-particle and postnuclear fractions from livers of animals pretreated with peroxisome proliferators was significantly greater compared with equal amounts of protein from corresponding fractions obtained from control animals, suggesting that these agents all enhance the synthesis of the same 80000 -mol. wt. polypeptide. Although the polypeptide PPA- 80 was increased in the postnuclear, large-particle and microsomal fractions of livers of rats pretreated with peroxisome proliferators, the relative abundance of this peptide in the peroxisome-rich light-mitochondrial fraction and its lack in highly purified mitochondrial fractions suggest the localization of this polypeptide in peroxisomes and/or microsomal fraction. Additional studies are needed to establish unequivocally the subcellular localization of the polypeptide PPA- 80 and to ascertain if this polypeptide is identical with the multi-functional protein displaying enoyl-CoA hydratase and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities that was purified by Osumi & Hashimoto [(1979) Biochem.

Analysis of hepatocytes from animals undergoing regeneration after partial hepatectomy revealed a large increase in tetraploid and octoploid mononucleate cells. The most striking feature was the almost complete disappearance of binucleate cells (from 20 % to < 1 %) at 3 days after partial hepatectomy. On the contrary, when hepatocytes were analyzed after treatment with the mitogen lead nitrate, {{a high number of}} binucleate cells (40 %) was observed. The increase that was maximal at 3 days after treatment occurred mainly in 4 x 2 c and in 8 x 2 c compartments. This resulted in an overall increase in the ratio of binucleate/mononucleate cells {{as well as in the}} ratio (8 c + 16 c) : (2 c + 4 c). The cytological changes induced by lead nitrate were not reversible 2 weeks after treatment. Because a massive elimination of excess liver cells occurred by apoptosis during this time period, it appears that polyploid cells are not preferentially eliminated. The hepatic content of DNA at the end of the regression phase was similar to control values. However, because of the higher ploidy state, the number of cells present in the liver 2 weeks after treatment appears to be lower than that of controls (approximately - 16 %).

40|$|The {{repeated}} {{administration of the}} hypolipidemic agent Su- 13 437 (<b>nafenopin)</b> to neonatal rats roughly doubled the number of peroxisomes in the liver tissue and caused a sixfold volumetric expansion of the peroxisomal compartment. During the proliferative response, the size- distribution of the peroxisomes was reversibly altered, enlarged particles appearing in numbers varying according to the dose given. By means of a new method for quantitative autoradiography, it was shown that (a) the concentration of silver grains over peroxisomes was comparable to that found over the endoplasmic reticulum; (b) the peak incorporation of [3 H]arginine into the peroxisomes was dealyed in comparison with that into the endoplasmic reticulum; (c) the label, once incorporated into the expanding peroxisomal compartment, displayed the same shift to large particles as did the whole population. These results are compatible with the biosynthetic pathway for peroxisomal catalase proposed earlier (cf. reference 12), and {{with the notion that}} the drug-induced size-shift might have resulted from progressive growth of a particular class of peroxisomes formed {{in the presence of the}} agent. Evidence is presented to show that during the recovery period the larger peroxisomes are removed preferentially...|$|E
40|$|Regulation of {{apoptosis}} is {{an important}} component of multistage hepatocarcinogenesis. The objectives of the present study were to characterize apoptosis regulation in primary mouse hepatocytes and to determine whether nongenotoxic carcinogens after apoptosis regulation. Bleomycin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by decreases in bcl- 2 and bcl-xL and increases in p 53, bak, and bax protein levels. Transforming growth factor fI’G 9 -fi-induced apoptosis was accompanied by decreased bcl-xL and increased bak. Bleomycin-induced apoptosis was partially dependent on p 53, whereas TGF [...] induced apoptosis was independent of p 53. Phenobarb’ital inhibited both TGF- 13 and bleomycin-induced apoptosis and the normal regulation of p 53, bcl- 2, and bax. <b>Nafenopin</b> inhibited apoptosis through a mechanism dependent on PPAR-a and inhibited the normal regulation of bcl- 2 and bak. 2, 3, 7, 8 -Tetrachborodibenzo-p-dioxin did not alter apoptosis or its regulation. Apoptosis was increased in hepatocytes from bcl- 2 -null mice, which indicated that the bcl- 2 family contributes to hepatocyte apoptosis regulation. This study demonstrated that apoptosis regulation in mouse hepatocytes involves distinct pathways and that diverse nongenotoxic carcinogens differentially after molecular pathways that represent targets for hepatocarcinogenesis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{examined}} the effects of various peroxisome proliferators (PPs) such as the hypolipidaemic agents clofibric acid (CLO), bezafibrate (BEZA), ciprofibrate (CIPRO) and <b>nafenopin</b> (NAFE) and the plasticizer di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on peroxisomal enzyme activities, apoptosis and DNA synthesis in rat FaO and human HepG 2 hepatoma cell lines. Both growing and confluent cultures were treated with PPs (250 microM) for 48 or 72 h. In accordance with our previous observations in PP-treated primary hepatocyte cultures of rat and human origin, the various PPs increased peroxisomal enzyme activities in rat FaO cells but not in human HepG 2 cells. PPs strongly induced apoptosis in FaO cells. They did not affect TGFbeta-induced apoptosis, with the exception of DEHP and NAFE, respectively blocking and increasing induced apoptosis in confluent cultures. Moreover, PPs produced a minor, but significant, decrease in DNA synthesis in FaO cells. PPs also decreased DNA synthesis in growing HepG 2 cells, and CLO, CIPRO and NAFE induced apoptosis in confluent HepG 2 cultures. This is in opposition with the effects of PPs on primary hepatocyte cultures, i. e. inhibition of both spontaneous and TGFbeta-induced apoptosis and increases in DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes, and unchanged mitosis-apoptosis balance in human hepatocytes...|$|E
40|$|Peroxisome proliferators (PP) {{induce a}} highly {{predictable}} pleiotropic response in rat and mouse liver that {{is characterized by}} hepatomegaly, increase in peroxisome number in hepatocytes, and induction of certain peroxisomal enzymes. The PP-binding protein (PPbP) was purified from rat liver cytosol by a two-step procedure involving affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. Three PP, <b>nafenopin</b> and its structural analogs clofibric acid and ciprofibrate, were used as affinity ligands and eluting agents. This procedure yields a major protein with an apparent Mr of 70, 000 on NaDodSO 4 /PAGE {{in the presence of}} reducing agent and Mr 140, 000 (Mr 140, 000 - 160, 000) on gel filtration and polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, indicating that the active protein is a dimer. This protein has an acidic pI of 4. 2 under nondenaturing conditions, which rises to 5. 6 under denaturing conditions. The isolation of the same Mr 70, 000 protein with three different, but structurally related, agents as affinity ligands and the immunological identity of the isolated proteins constitute strong evidence that this protein is the PPbP capable of recognizing PP that are structurally related to clofibrate. The PPbP probably {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of PP-induced pleiotropic response...|$|E
40|$|Peroxisome proliferators such as clofibric acid, <b>nafenopin,</b> and WY- 14, 643 {{have been}} shown to {{activate}} PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), a member of the steroid nuclear receptor superfamily. We have cloned the cDNA from the rat that is homologous to that from the mouse [Issemann, I. & Green, S. (1990) Nature (London) 347, 645 - 650], which encodes a 97 % similar protein with a particularly well-conserved putative ligand-binding domain. To search for physiologically occurring activators, we established a transcriptional transactivation assay by stably expressing in CHO cells a chimera of rat PPAR and the human glucocorticoid receptor that activates expression of the placental alkaline phosphatase reporter gene {{under the control of the}} mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Testing of compounds related to lipid metabolism or peroxisomal proliferation revealed that 150 microM concentrations of arachidonic or linoleic acid but not of dehydroepiandrosterone, cholesterol, or 25 -hydroxy-cholesterol, activate the receptor chimera. In addition, saturated fatty acids induce the reporter gene. Shortening the chain length to n = 6 or introduction of an omega-terminal carboxylic group abolished the activation potential of the fatty acid. In conclusion, the present results indicate that fatty acids can regulate gene expression mediated by a member of the steroid nuclear receptor superfamily...|$|E
40|$|An acinar cell {{carcinoma}} of the pancreas, which developed in a F- 344 rat after long-term <b>nafenopin</b> administration, was serially transplanted into inbred weanling rats by subcutaneous and intraperitoneal routes. The transplantability rate was 95 % or more by both routes. The tumor implants became palpable in 20 to 30 days after subcutaneous transplantation, increasing in size rapidly thereafter during the next 25 to 30 days. In intraperitoneal recipients the abdomen was markedly distended within 1 month. No metastases were observed in this series of transplantations. Amylase and lipase levels in serum and tumor homogenates increased with tumor size. Morphologically, only a few cells contained zymogen granules immediately after {{the appearance of a}} palpable tumor; at later intervals, however, these granules were observed in many tumor cells. Seventy-two hours after the surgical removal of tumors, the serum amylase and lipase levels returned to control values. This transplantable pancreatic acinar {{cell carcinoma}} can be dissociated into functionally viable single cells by a simplified enzyme digestion and divalent cation chelation procedure. By light microscopic autoradiography, approximately 20 % of these isolated cells were found to incorporate 3 H-thymidine in vitro into nuclear DNA. The data presented in this paper should serve as a baseline for future studies on this transplanted tumor...|$|E
40|$|Non-genotoxic {{carcinogens}} {{can cause}} tumours in experi-mental animals despite their {{apparent lack of}} genotoxic activity or potential (reviewed by Ashby and Tenant, 1991). The hypolipidaemic drug, <b>nafenopin,</b> {{is one of the}} peroxi-some proliferator class of non-genotoxic carcinogens (Staubli et al., 1977), which cause an increase in the size and number of liver peroxisomes in rodents (reviewed by Reddy and Lalwani, 1983). Peroxisome proliferation is accompanied by liver enlargement and elevated transcrip-tion of genes encoding the microsomal enzyme p 450 IVA 1 and the peroxisomal enzymes of-oxidation, which include acyl-CoA oxidase and peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme (Lazarow and De Duve, 1976; Orton and Parker, 1982). The induction of these enzymes is commonly used as a marker for the biological effects of peroxisome prolifera-tors. It is well documented that chronic administration of per-oxisome proliferators to rodents results in the formation of liver tumours (Reddy et al., 1980; Warren et al., 1980). Wh reas the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis have not be n established, a number of theories have been proposed (reviewed by Green, 1991; Moody et al., 1991). Elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide produced as a result of perox-isome roliferation may initiate tumorigenesis by oxidative DNA damage (Reddy and Rao, 1989; Kasai et al., 1989; Lake et al., 1990), while peroxisome proliferators may also act as liver tumour promoters by stimulation of replicativ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{peroxisome}} proliferators on {{the immune system}} of male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice have been investigated. Significant atrophy of the thymus and spleen was observed in animals treated with potent peroxisome proliferators (e. g. perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Wy- 14 643 and <b>nafenopin),</b> whereas {{the effects of a}} moderate peroxisome proliferator (i. e. acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)) were relatively weak. The time course of thymic and splenic atrophy caused by PFOA was found to resemble the time course of the increase in liver weight and of peroxisome proliferation. Analysis of the numbers and phenotypes of thymocytes and splenocytes from PFOA-treated mice revealed the following: (i) the numbers of thymocytes and splenocytes were decreased > 90 % and about 50 %, respectively, by PFOA treatment; (ii) although all populations of thymocytes were decreased, the immature CD 4 +CD 8 + population was decreased most dramatically; (iii) the numbers of both T and B cells in the spleen were decreased by PFOA treatment. Analysis of the cell cycle of thymocytes indicated that the thymic atrophy caused by PFOA in mice results, at least in part, from inhibition of thymocyte proliferation. Interestingly, in vitro exposure to PFOA for up to 24 h did not produce analogous effects in either thymocytes or splenocytes. Thus, the thymic and splenic atrophy caused by PFOA appears to involve an indirect pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypolipidaemic drug}} <b>nafenopin</b> (NAF) {{has been shown}} to enhance the hepatocarcinogenic effect of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine in rats. We have {{investigated}} whether the NAF-induced peroxisome proliferation in hepatocytes interferes with NDMA's metabolism and interaction with DNA. Adult male Wistar rats received a single i. p. injection of [14 C]NDMA (2 mg/kg) and were killed 4 h later. DNA was isolated from liver and kidney, hydrolysed in 0. 1 N HCI and analysed by Sephasorb chromatography. In rats pre-treated with NAF (0. 2 % in the diet over a period of 3 weeks), the concentration of N 7 -methylguanine in hepatic DNA (μmol/mol guanine) was 46 % below control values. This is probably due to the greater amount of target DNA, as NAF caused a marked hepatomegaly with a 50 % increase in total liver DNA content. Concentrations of N 7 -methylguanine in kidney DNA were twice as high in NAF-pre-treated animals when compared to control rats. This is unlikely to result from a shift in the metabolism of NDMA from liver to other rat tissues since the time course and extent of the conversion of [14 C]NDMA to 14 CO 2 and 14 C-labelled urinary metabolites were identical in NAF-treated and control animals. There was no indication that NAF inhibits the activity of the hepatic O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferas...|$|E
