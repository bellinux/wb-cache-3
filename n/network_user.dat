We seek to understand when ownership unbundling leads to lower customer prices, and formalize necessary conditions. In general, legal unbundling implies a less effective regulation, but it reduces the degree of market distortion caused by the difference between marginal costs and average costs (= regulated prices of network usage). We find that the necessary condition is not satisfied for realistic values of the relevant parameters, i. e. legal unbundling leads to lower costumer prices than ownership unbundling in most relevant markets.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} on cyber-insurance has {{stressed the importance}} of discriminating <b>network</b> <b>users</b> on insurance contracts for the following reasons: (i) preventing adverse selection, (ii) partly internalizing the negative externalities of interdependent security, (iii) achieving maximum social welfare, (iv) helping a risk-averse insurer to distribute costs of holding safety capital among its clients, and (v) insurers sustaining a fixed amount of profit per contract. Thus, an important problem is studying ways to appropriately execute the user discrimination process. In this paper we take a network topological perspective and propose a technique (mechanism) to pertinently contract discriminate insured <b>network</b> <b>users.</b> We mathematically show that the Bonacich/Eigenvector centralities of <b>network</b> <b>users</b> is an appropriate parameter for differentiating insurance clients. © 2013 IFIP...|$|R
40|$|Network use-of-system (UoS) tariffs play an {{essential}} role in the deregulated power markets to recover network investment and maintenance costs from <b>network</b> <b>users,</b> and send economic signals to influence the users' behaviors in using systems. The tariffs are essential to the business operation of both <b>network</b> operators and <b>users.</b> They, however, could have great volatility due to the uncertainties from both external and internal factors. Such uncertain tariffs could bring severe adverse impacts to <b>network</b> <b>users,</b> which justifies that there is an urgent need to reduce the tariff volatility and improve its predictability. This paper for the first time investigates the variations in network tariffs that cause great risks to <b>network</b> <b>users</b> and then designs financial tools to reduce the volatility. The causing factors of the variations are categorized into global and local groups according to their different features. After introducing the process from network planning, charging to revenue reconciliation, the paper discusses the benefits of hedging for <b>network</b> <b>users.</b> In order to reduce tariff volatility, it proposes a novel risk management strategy to maintain the consistency of tariffs. It is achieved by designing long-term contracts using financial hedging. The value of hedge contracts is decided by three key factors: hedged load/generation percentage, hedged price, and risk premium. The hedged part is charged at hedged prices and the non-hedged part is charged at actual prices, on top of which customers needs to pay extra for the risk premium. The paper also designs an optimal decision-making tool to assist <b>network</b> <b>users</b> to manage long-term contracts in order to reduce total tariff costs. As demonstrated in the case study, the proposed long-term products can effectively reduce tariff volatility for <b>network</b> <b>users</b> and create a safe environment for their business operation...|$|R

50|$|Cyber-insurance {{is a risk}} {{management}} technique via which <b>network</b> <b>user</b> risks are transferred to an insurance company, {{in return for a}} fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Examples of potential cyber-insurers might include ISP, cloud provider, traditional insurance organizations. Proponents of cyber-insurance believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense liability to the clients, thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here the term ‘self-defense' implies the efforts by a <b>network</b> <b>user</b> to secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus and anti-spam software, firewalls, using secure operating systems, etc. Cyber-insurance has also {{the potential to be a}} market solution that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (individuals/organizations), policy makers, and security software vendors. i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn profit from appropriately pricing premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, policy makers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the security software vendors could experience an increase in their product sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers.|$|E
