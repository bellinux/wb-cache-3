5|$|A garden called <b>Natal</b> Gardens {{was opened}} on Saturday 15 July 2000, at Invergordon which {{contains}} a commemorative plaque remembering <b>Natal.</b> It was opened by celebrity gardener Charlie Dimmock {{and has a}} strong maritime theme, including a water feature and a wooden walkway. It is tended by volunteers.|$|E
5|$|After 55 to 65 days, juveniles reach full adult {{measurements}} and battle among themselves until a dominant juvenile forces its siblings {{to leave the}} <b>natal</b> area. The dominant bird remains with its parents until the following season, while its siblings leave the <b>natal</b> territory to join an unrelated pair who failed to breed. In a study by Dan Strickland, two-thirds of dominant juveniles were male.|$|E
5|$|After completion, {{the four}} sisters were {{assigned}} to the cruiser squadrons of the Channel and Home Fleets. <b>Natal</b> and Cochrane escorted the royal yacht in 1911–12 for the newly crowned King George V's trip to India to attend the Delhi Durbar and <b>Natal</b> carried the body of the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain, Whitelaw Reid, back to New York City in December 1912. Warrior was transferred to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet in 1913.|$|E
5|$|In Central and South America, the {{important}} blue dyes were Añil (Indigofera suffruticosa) and <b>Natal</b> indigo (Indigofera arrecta).|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, Suillus luteus {{has been}} {{occasionally}} recorded under pines in Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and Royal <b>Natal</b> National Park.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids display {{high levels}} of philopatry, exhibiting both <b>natal</b> philopatry and site fidelity. <b>Natal</b> philopatry, the {{tendency}} of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for <b>natal</b> philopatry comes from several sources, {{not the least of}} which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of mitochondrial DNA also provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in fairy prions. Bird ringing also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their <b>natal</b> colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the <b>natal</b> site.|$|E

5|$|Britain annexed the Voortrekkers' {{short-lived}} Natalia Republic in 1843 as the Colony of <b>Natal.</b> Pretorius briefly led Boer {{resistance to}} this, but before long {{most of the}} Boers in <b>Natal</b> had trekked back north-west to {{the area around the}} Orange and Vaal Rivers. In 1845 Kruger was a member of Potgieter's expedition to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique to negotiate a frontier with Portugal; the Lebombo Mountains were settled upon as the border between Boer and Portuguese lands. After Maria and their first child died of fever in January 1846, Kruger married her cousin Gezina du Plessis, from the Colesberg area, in 1847. Their first child, Casper Jan Hendrik, was born on 22 December that year.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton scored 66 for the Australians in an innings {{victory over}} Western Australia before sailing for South Africa. It {{was to be}} the start of a very {{productive}} campaign. In the three matches leading up to the Tests, against <b>Natal,</b> Western Province and Transvaal respectively, Fingleton scored 121, 53, 99 and seven not out. Australia won the latter match by ten wickets and the others by an innings. In the match by <b>Natal,</b> Fingleton and Brown both made centuries and combined in a double century stand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} edition of Mammal Species of the World {{published}} in 2005, R. S. Hoffman and A. T. Smith listed the <b>Natal</b> red rock hare (Pronolagus crassicaudatus) {{as a separate}} species and included its four taxonomic synonyms: P. c. kariegae (Hewitt, 1927); P. c. lebombo (Roberts, 1936); P. c. lebomboensis (Roberts, 1936); and P. c. ruddi (Thomas and Schwann, 1905). They described the taxonomic relationship between the <b>Natal</b> red rock hare and Jameson's red rock hare (P. randensis) as unclear.|$|E

5|$|Organized Scouting {{spread to}} South Africa {{only a few}} months after its birth in Britain in 1907. In 1908, several troops formed in Cape Town, <b>Natal,</b> and Johannesburg and the {{following}} year saw the first official registration of South African troops.|$|E
5|$|Overseas {{service for}} the 1st King's {{included}} a two-year residence in Nova Scotia, beginning in 1893. In January 1895, the battalion provided a 100-man guard of honour when the body of Canadian Prime Minister John Thompson was returned from Britain. The battalion subsequently became stationed in the West Indies, then Cape Colony in 1897. The Second Boer War began two years later. Prior to {{the outbreak of the}} war, as the discord between the British and Boer republics escalated, the 1st King's formed a company of mounted infantry and underwent intensive training at Ladysmith, <b>Natal</b> Colony. War was declared on 11 October and <b>Natal</b> invaded by a Boer force under General Piet Joubert. General George White held authority over 13,000 British personnel dispersed throughout <b>Natal.</b> Heavy losses were incurred by the British in the first major engagements of the war, at Talana Hill and Elandslaagte. Retreat to Ladysmith, where the British concentrated its largest contingent, ensued. Having besieged Kimberley and Mafikeng, Boers converged upon Ladysmith and positioned artillery pieces on surrounding hills overlooking the town.|$|E
5|$|At Kruger's {{suggestion}} Joubert {{was elected}} Commandant-General of the restored republic, {{though he had}} little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at Heidelberg, a strategically placed town {{on the main road}} from <b>Natal,</b> and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he surrender the government offices in Pretoria. Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I, <b>Natal,</b> Achilles and Cochrane {{were assigned to the}} 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet and Warrior was in the Mediterranean. The latter ship was involved in the pursuit of the Goeben and Breslau, but the squadron commander, Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge, declined to engage the German ships.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, she joined the Grand Fleet and in January 1915 was refitted at Cromarty. <b>Natal</b> spent much of 1915 uneventfully patrolling the North Sea until she began a brief refit at the Birkenhead shipyard of Cammell Laird on 22 November. On 5 December the ship rejoined the 2nd Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow. Twelve days later the squadron sailed to Cromarty Firth.|$|E
5|$|Blackader {{joined his}} company in <b>Natal</b> in early October 1899. It saw action with the {{battalion}} {{within a few}} days of the outbreak of the Second Boer War, at the Battle of Talana Hill on 20 October, and again at the Battle of Ladysmith on the 30th. Boer forces surrounded Ladysmith after the battle, and began a four-month siege.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of <b>natal</b> down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{started the}} tour consistently, scoring 148, 58, 31 and 28 not on {{out in the}} three warm-up matches. In the first match of the tour against <b>Natal,</b> both Brown and Fingleton made centuries; the first two matches were won by an innings and the third by ten wickets.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2015 World Cup, McLeod {{was named}} to the {{national}} team roster for the Torneio Internacional de <b>Natal.</b> During her second appearance of the tournament on December 20 – a match against Brazil – McLeod jumped for an incoming ball in the 35th minute and collided with Brazilian player Marta. McLeod landed awkwardly on her right leg, sustaining ligament damage in her right knee. She walked off the field on her own accord.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activities}} such as encroachment of settlements, agriculture, and hunting in rural areas {{poses a threat to}} the <b>Natal</b> red rock hare, due to which its population is decreasing. Since the 1900s, more than 21% to 50% of its habitat has been destroyed, which is predicted to remain between 21% and 50% till 2022, decreasing its population by 20% or more by then.|$|E
5|$|In October 1967 the Patrol Leader Training Unit {{was formed}} to offer formal Leadership Training courses for Scout Patrol Leaders in the then <b>Natal</b> Division. The nine members {{comprising}} the original Unit were Dudley Forde , Fr Ian Laurenson, Lynn Reynolds, Paddy McDowell, Paul and Helen Bezencon, Ian Hoare, Tony Hornby and Bill Sewell.|$|E
5|$|Many seabirds show {{remarkable}} site fidelity, {{returning to}} the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour. This increases breeding success, provides a place for returning mates to reunite, and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site. Young adults breeding {{for the first time}} usually return to their <b>natal</b> colony, and often nest close to where they hatched. This tendency, known as philopatry, is so strong that a study of Laysan albatrosses found that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22m; another study, this time on Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica, found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their <b>natal</b> colony bred in the burrow they were raised in, and two actually bred with their own mother.|$|E
5|$|On 30 December 1915, <b>Natal</b> {{was lying}} in the Cromarty Firth with her squadron, {{under the command of}} Captain Eric Back. The captain was hosting a film party aboard and had invited the wives and {{children}} of his officers, one civilian friend and his family, and nurses from the nearby hospital ship Drina to attend. A total of seven women, one civilian male, and three children were in attendance that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Richard Fetherston had {{established}} a Baby Health Center in Prahran in 1920 that provided post-natal care. His experience soon showed that his workload would be greatly reduced if ante <b>natal</b> care were provided, with mothers being monitored throughout their pregnancies. He asked Mary if she {{would be willing to}} establish such a clinic, which would be open one day a week.|$|E
5|$|Sir Marshal Clarke succeeded Sir Melmoth Osborn as Resident Commissioner and Chief Magistrate in Zululand in June 1893. Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson was {{appointed}} successor to Sir Charles Mitchell as Governor {{of the colony}} in August 1893, as well as Governor of <b>Natal,</b> which was to gain responsible government two months later.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels nest colonially, for {{the most}} part on islands, {{although}} a few species breed on the mainland, particularly Antarctica. Nesting sites are attended nocturnally in order to avoid predators; the wedge-rumped storm petrels nesting in the Galapagos Islands are the exception to this rule and attend their nesting sites during the day. Storm petrels display high levels of philopatry, returning to their <b>natal</b> colonies to breed. In one instance a band-rumped storm petrel was caught as an adult 2m from its <b>natal</b> burrow. Storm petrels nest either in burrows dug into soil or sand, or in small crevices in rocks and scree. Competition for nesting sites is intense in colonies where storm petrels compete with other burrowing petrels, with shearwaters having been recorded killing storm petrels in order to occupy their burrows. Colonies can be extremely large and dense densities as high as 8 pairs/m2 for band-rumped storm petrels in the Galapagos and colonies 3.6 million strong for Leach's storm petrel have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The Abdullah {{case that}} had brought him to South Africa {{concluded}} in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi {{as he prepared to}} return to India. However, a new <b>Natal</b> government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the <b>Natal</b> Indian Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.|$|E
5|$|The Commandoes Mob {{was formed}} in 2004 {{when a group of}} Gattaca females teamed up with a Young Ones roving coalition. Aragorn and Zorilla {{established}} dominance after several disputes. They remained the dominant pair till 2007 when Aragorn died. After the death of Aragorn, his son Ketamine established <b>natal</b> dominance beside his mother. Then five Whiskers males emigrated and all <b>natal</b> adult males had left, Zarathustra became dominant male till he was predated. Then Baker took his position but Miles stole it from him. Throuought their history, the Commandos had been a fast-growing group, unlike their founding group the Gattaca. In January 2009, Zorilla, Miles, Baker Karim and Cody were killed by TB, the group is led by Whiskers male Panthro and Commandos female Celidh. Disease hit the group killing a few members. The Commandos left the monitored area and could no longer be tracked. A few new groups were formed from Commandos members. The Kung Fu was formed by Zorilla's sister. The Geckos and Sequioa were formed by Zorilla and Aragorn's daughters. Benzedrine is the last known surviving Commandos meerkat today.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} {{is depicted}} on the {{coat of arms}} of the Province of <b>Natal</b> in South Africa. Over the years the South African authorities have issued several stamps displaying the animal and the South African Mint has struck a two cent piece with a prancing black wildebeest.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} what was to become the Patrol Leader {{training}} Unit courses was run at Lexden— <b>Natal</b> Gilwell Scout Training Camp in July 1959, under the leadership of Dudley Forde, with 19 Scouts from the 2nd Durban Y.M.C.A. Scout Group in attendance. Courses were offered to boys from the same Group {{over the next five years}} until the 6th Course in October 1964 which was opened to participants from South Durban District.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a plaque}} at Pembroke St Mary Pembrokeshire to Lieut Richard Edward Lewis Treweeks the Navigating Officer of <b>Natal,</b> son of Major R.H. Treweeks {{who was also}} lost on 30 December. One known {{survivor}} was that of Chief Stoker Griffiths of St Anne's Farm Pembroke, Pembrokeshire who had escaped through a port hole.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{indigenous}} to more coastal regions of southern Africa and east Africa. The eastern green mamba's range extends from Kenya south through Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, eastern Zimbabwe, eastern Zambia into South Africa {{as far as}} southern <b>Natal</b> and northern Pondoland. It {{can also be found}} in Zanzibar. The distribution of this species is assumed to be continuous, but reports seem to be scarce in regions within the species' range.|$|E
5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their <b>natal</b> tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents self-pollination. In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of self-pollination, but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
