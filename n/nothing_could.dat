5|$|Male {{students}} and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings, but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> have been done to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> in {{the least}} {{palliate}} this long, this cold, this very distant separation from my dearest wife and children but the certain knowledge that I am preparing for their ease, happiness and prosperity, and when that is the prise, I know no hardships that I would not encounter with, to obtain it.|$|E
5|$|Records showed {{training}} accidents between 1942 and 1945 {{accounted for}} the loss of 95 aviation personnel from NAS Fort Lauderdale In 1992, another expedition located scattered debris on the ocean floor, but <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be identified. In the last decade, searchers have been expanding their area to include farther east, into the Atlantic Ocean, but the remains of Flight 19 have still never been confirmed found.|$|E
50|$|From then on, <b>nothing</b> Democrats <b>could</b> {{do would}} {{overcome}} the appearance {{that they were}} trying to steal the election on technicalities. And <b>nothing</b> Republicans <b>could</b> say would overcome the suspicion that they had planned the whole thing.|$|R

5|$|Shatner's cut ran {{slightly}} over two hours (not including end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was too long. Their target runtime was one hour forty-five minutes, which would guarantee twice-nightly theatrical screenings. Bennett was handed {{the task of}} shortening the film's running time, despite Shatner's view that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> possibly be removed. Shatner was horrified by Bennett's edit, and the two haggled over what parts to restore or cut.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} {{constructed}} from bare reinforced concrete. The primary museum floor is lifted six metres {{above the ground}} on huge piloti and is accessible via a free-standing staircase. The rhythmical facade comprises vertical elements that repeat outwards from the centre. Like the exterior, the interior is finished with rough concrete; {{the idea was to}} keep the surfaces plain so that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> distract the visitor from the contents of the exhibits.|$|E
5|$|This {{was by far}} {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} I have ever taken on in my career, and I could not be more honored {{to be a part of}} such an amazing and historical event. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> ever come close to working with Madonna on this Super Bowl performance, her attention to detail and commitment to all of her projects is truly inspiring and life changing.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if <b>nothing</b> now <b>could</b> save Déroulède and Juliette from an {{immediate}} and horrible death.|$|R

5|$|Hood was {{the closest}} to {{completion}} and her construction was continued in case the Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the lessons of the war.|$|E
5|$|One man, whose {{influence}} {{more than}} any other one thing, succeeded in laying a foundation for Dartmouth's wonderful results, but whose name is seldom mentioned in that connection is Doctor Wurtenberg, who was brought up in the early Yale football school. He had the keenest sense of fundamental football and the greatest intensity of spirit in transmitting his hard earned knowledge. Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with his enthusiasm and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> stop its growth.|$|E
5|$|Some {{say that}} <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be more desperate than the measure, but I answer {{that the state}} of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E
60|$|Still he knew <b>nothing,</b> and he <b>could</b> decide upon <b>nothing.</b> He <b>could</b> not be {{sure that}} one of those vessels was not the yacht which had sailed from Kingston with Mrs. Cliff, and Burke, and Shirley on board, and so the Monterey did not turn back, but steamed on slowly towards the distant steamers.|$|R
60|$|In {{my heart}} I knew that <b>nothing</b> Heatherlegh <b>could</b> do would lighten the burden {{that had been}} laid upon me.|$|R
60|$|Seth {{was silent}} from utter astonishment: he knew <b>nothing</b> that <b>could</b> suggest {{to him a}} reason for Hetty's going away.|$|R
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this power}} allowed Leiva {{to perform a}} {{maneuver}} that Castelli had not anticipated. Although he approved the end of Cisneros' rule as viceroy, Leiva formed a Junta with Cisneros as its president; Cisneros would stay in power. The {{other members of the}} Junta would have been two peninsulars, the priest Juan Nepomuceno Solá and the merchant José Santos Inchaurregui, and two criollos, Saavedra and Castelli. The bulk of the natives rejected the proposal: they did not accept that Cisneros should remain in power, even under a different title. They were suspicious of the intentions of Saavedra, and believed that with Castelli alone in the Junta, little or <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be achieved. Castelli and Saavedra resigned that same day to put pressure on Cisneros and force him to resign, and the Junta never came into power.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E

25|$|When the old gentleman {{asked if}} he could be helped for his fear of riding in an elevator, I told him I could {{probably}} scare the pants off him in another direction. He told me that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> be worse than his fear of an elevator.|$|E

25|$|Before World War I (1914–18) Randle was {{approached}} by Richard Akinwande Savage and Casely Hayford about holding a West African conference. He was enthusiastic about the idea, and was elected chairman of the Lagos committee for the conference in 1915. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> be done during the war.|$|E
25|$|In the Swedish army, {{there was}} a man who was even bigger and {{stronger}} than the sons of Gandalf. The giant man killed both men and horses and <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> defeat him. Sigurd and Gest approached the huge warrior and asked who he was. He answered that he was Starkad the son of Stórvirkr.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> {{surpass the}} undaunted {{resolution}} and intrepid mien which Pirch's Battalions displayed as they advanced against, and entered, Saint-Amand-la-Haye, at a charging pace; they completely swept the French before them; while Major Quadt, who commanded the 28th Regiment, supported by some Detachments of the 2nd Regiment (from Tippelskirch's Brigade) gained {{possession of the}} great building.|$|E
