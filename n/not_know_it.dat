5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the 2001 Rock in Rio show, bassist Nick Oliveri {{was arrested}} after {{performing}} on stage naked, with only his bass guitar covering his genitals. Oliveri apologized to officials, {{saying that he}} did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was a crime in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Howard {{pulls off}} an {{extraordinary}} trick in A Beautiful Mind by seducing the audience into Nash's paranoid world.

60|$|The wind {{continued}} to blow, and the steamer {{continued to}} float and float and float away. A wind {{had come up}} in the night. It had blown Bertha near me; perhaps it had blown her very near me. She had <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>it,</b> and I had <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>it.</b> Mary Phillips had <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>it</b> until it was too late, and now that wind had blown her past me and was blowing her away. For a time there was a flutter of a handkerchief, but only one handkerchief, and then La Fidélité, with Bertha on board, was blown away until she disappeared, and I never saw her again.|$|R

It seems plain now that that Southerner was a spy of Saruman’s; but whether {{he was working with}} the Black Riders, or for Saruman alone, I do <b>not</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> is {{difficult}} with these evil folk to know when they are in league, and when they are cheating one another.|$|E
25|$|In this game, if nature selects t1 as player 1's type, {{the game}} played {{will be like}} the very first game described, except that player 2 does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> (and {{the very fact that}} this cuts through his {{information}} sets disqualify it from subgame status). There is one separating perfect Bayesian equilibrium; i.e. an equilibrium in which different types do different things.|$|E
25|$|The {{same day}} of Prince Roman's baptism on 18 July 1918, {{though they did}} <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> Maria's half-brother, Prince Vladimir Paley, and her aunt, Princess Elizabeth, were murdered by the Bolsheviks. With the {{situation}} quickly deteriorating in Russia for the Romanovs under the Bolshevik regime, Maria Pavlovna decided to leave for exile, leaving her baby {{under the care of}} her in-laws.|$|E

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} developed {{arguments for}} the existence of God, while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of God's attributes. Reconciling some of those attributes generated important philosophical problems and debates. For example, God's omniscience may seem to imply that God knows how free agents will choose to act. If God does know this, their ostensible free will might be illusory, or foreknowledge does not imply predestination, and if God does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> God may not be omniscient.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the leaders}} did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> and {{although}} Albert and Montdidier had fallen, the British defence {{on the ground}} had been solidifying since 25 March. The Germans were experiencing logistical problems after advancing over the ravaged 1916 Somme battlefield, subject to constant attack by the RFC, and with their supplies and equipment pulled by horses in poor shape. A German offensive near Arras ("Mars", 9 German divisions, 28 March), against the junction of First and Third Armies, was predicted exactly by British Intelligence and was repulsed. After this was beaten back, between 29 and 31 March the Germans pushed on Amiens again. A Canadian brigade took part in an action at Moreuil Wood (30 March).|$|E
25|$|Geronimo {{was raised}} with the {{traditional}} religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> but everybody {{will be talking about}} it to everybody else. The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the Australian tour, both Leigh and Olivier were {{exhausted}} and ill, and he told a journalist, [...] "You may <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." [...] Later he would comment that he [...] "lost Vivien" [...] in Australia, a reference to Leigh's affair with the Australian actor Peter Finch, whom the couple met during the tour. Shortly afterwards Finch moved to London, where Olivier auditioned him and put him under a long-term contract with Laurence Olivier Productions. Finch and Leigh's affair continued on and off for several years.|$|E
500|$|Waugh's first biographer, Christopher Sykes, {{records that}} after the divorce friends [...] "saw, or {{believed}} they saw, a new hardness and bitterness" [...] in Waugh's outlook. Nevertheless, despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he [...] "did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was possible to be so miserable and live", he soon resumed his professional and social life. He finished his second novel, Vile Bodies, and wrote articles including (ironically, he thought) one for the Daily Mail {{on the meaning of}} the marriage ceremony. During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends; he was to have no settled home for the next eight years.|$|E

500|$|At {{the heart}} of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is the test of Gawain's {{adherence}} to the code of chivalry. The typical temptation fable of medieval literature presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or [...] "proofs" [...] of moral virtue. The stories often describe several individuals' failures after which the main character is tested. Success in the proofs will often bring immunity or good fortune. Gawain's ability to pass the tests of his host are of utmost importance to his survival, though he does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> It is only by fortuity or [...] "instinctive-courtesy" [...] that Sir Gawain is able to pass his test. Gawain does not realize, however, that these tests are all orchestrated by Sir Bertilak.|$|E
500|$|Sociologist Selvaraj Velayutham {{says in his}} book, Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry, that Manju's {{characterisation}} was [...] "brought out entirely verbally by her". Velayutham {{believes the}} film to be constantly resorting to [...] "existing myths about women and relationships: that a wayward mother destroys her children; that a woman who speaks the 'truth' is always alone; that men are scared of her; that {{the woman who is}} different is confused, not sure of herself and is only seeking love from a man but does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> herself." [...] Velayutham further asserts that the film's only positive aspect is [...] "it does not expose the body of women in the way it is customary" [...] and that Manju could have avoided her unfortunate set of circumstances [...] "if only she had a 'proper' mother!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson Benson {{believes}} Hemingway used autobiographical {{details as}} framing devices {{about life in}} general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E

500|$|As the 2/10th withdrew, the 25th Infantry Battalion, {{which had}} moved forward from Gili Gili {{to relieve the}} 61st, {{deployed}} around the airstrip and at Rabi, Duira Creek and Kilarbo, laying mines in key locations. The airstrip proved a perfect defensive location, offering a wide, clear field of fire, while at its end, thick mud served to prevent the movement of Japanese tanks. Around dawn the advancing Japanese troops reached the airstrip and, {{under the cover of}} field artillery and mortars, they launched an attack. Although the Australians did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> the tanks that were supporting the attack became stuck in the mud and were subsequently abandoned; they would later be discovered by an Australian patrol on 29 August. Meanwhile, troops from the 25th and 61st Infantry Battalions, along with Americans from the 709th Anti-Aircraft Battery turned back the attacking Japanese infantry. Further strafing by Kittyhawks followed, and the Japanese were forced to fall back [...] to the east of Rabi.|$|E
500|$|... 1st Lt. Richard Abbot {{flying a}} FAC O-2 {{had been shot}} down {{offshore}} shortly before Hambleton, and when Abbot {{was picked up by}} the USS Hamner, two Air Force search and rescue Douglas A-1 Skyraiders (Capt. Don Morse in Sandy 07 and his wingman in Sandy 08) from the 1st Special Operations Squadron remained in Hambleton's vicinity. The Sandys immediately scrambled to cover Hambleton's position. When Morse in Sandy 07 first got the call, he thought that, because the aircraft had gone down in South Vietnam, the SAR effort could be accomplished fairly quickly. When he got over Hambelton's position, he was shocked at the amount of ground fire he received. It was more intense than anything he had seen in the war. Some pilots reported that the intensity of the antiaircraft fire was equal to that around Hanoi. Although the U.S. and ARVN forces did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> yet, the offensive was the largest combined arms attack conducted by the North Vietnamese during the war.|$|E
500|$|Though {{her crew}} did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> at the time, West Honaker had been {{selected}} {{to be one of}} the blockships for the Allied invasion of France, then in the planning stages. Blockships dispatched from Boston, like West Honaker, were loaded with [...] "tons of sand and cement" [...] before their final U.S. departures. West Honaker sailed from Boston on 25 March 1944 as a part of Convoy BX-101 to Halifax and, from there, Convoy SC-156 to Cardiff. In his book Beyond the Palisades, Cesar Poropat, West Honakers chief engineer, reports that after the ship's cargo was discharged, the ship was suddenly boarded by shipyard workers who cut holes in [...] "strategic places" [...] and positioned [...] "mysterious packs" [...] around the hull. The crew suspected, correctly, that these packs were explosives and that the ship was being prepared for sinking. Though there is no specific mention of this occurring on West Honaker, other blockships selected for the Normandy beachhead had their existing antiaircraft weapons moved higher on the ship and supplemented by additional guns.|$|E
