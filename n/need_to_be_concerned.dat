With ambient contracts the programmer no longer <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> about con-nectivity state changes during interaction, which leads to cleaner code...|$|R

[...] Carson at that time was at the Baylor College of Medicine.

40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} an assay of pirarubicin in mouse plasma and heart, and {{to conduct the}} pharmacokinetic analysis consequently. Methods: Pathogen-free male mice were intravenously (through tail vein) administrated with pirarubicin injection. Plasma and heat samples were collected at various time-points after injection. Extractions were done by adding a mixture of methanol and chloroform (3 : 1), and the samples were analyzed by HPLC. Results: Extraction recoveries for pirarubicin in the plasma and heart were 85. 1 % and 81. 5 %, respectively. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that pirarubicin could accumulate in the heart. Conclusion: The established method is simple and accurate for plasma as well as heart.
