25|$|The Blenheim {{campaign}} {{dominated the}} war in 1704. For Louis XIV, the defeat was a severe blow to his prestige, {{but there were some}} consolations that year, including the success of Marshals Montrevel and Villars against the Allied-backed Camisard revolt in the Cévennes (although a low-level guerilla war dragged on for several additional years). For Marlborough, the Blenheim campaign secured his reputation and was seen by many as a vindication of the continental strategy, but for England the pressing <b>need</b> <b>now</b> was for the Emperor to make peace in Hungary, and for the Allies to resume the attack against France on all fronts. However, Marlborough's attempt in 1705 to by-pass the Low Countries and invade Louis XIV's kingdom via the Moselle, proved a failure. With Villars entrenched at Sierck, and with the German princes failing to fully support the attack, the Duke was forced to return to the Meuse in mid-June. Little was achieved here, though, beyond forestalling a French offensive and forcing the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim, south of Zoutleeuw (Léau), on 17/18 July.|$|E

2500|$|Many slogans and terms coined {{came to be}} used by Bush's {{political}} opponents, {{or those}} opposed to the war.

2500|$|On April 22, 2009, {{shortly after}} Obama’s visit, Turkish and Armenian {{authorities}} formally announced a provisional roadmap for the normalisation of diplomatic {{ties between the}} two states. The U.S. responded positively with {{a statement from the}} office of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, following a phone conversation with Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan, which stated that, “The Vice President applauded President Sargsyan’s leadership, and underscored the administration’s support for both Armenia and Turkey in this process.” Turkish columnists however criticised the timing of the announcement believing it to have been made to placate the U.S. President in advance of his April 24 speech, with Fikret Bila writing in the Milliyet that, “the Turkish Foreign Ministry made this statement regarding the roadmap before midnight,” as it would allow Obama to go back on his campaign promise, to refer to the incident as genocide, which the Turkish government denies profusely, by pointing out to the Armenian diaspora that, “Turkey reached a consensus with Armenia and set a roadmap,” and, “there is no <b>need</b> <b>now</b> to damage this process.” ...|$|E
