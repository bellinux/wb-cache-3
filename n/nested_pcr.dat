2500|$|The first {{reported}} method of methylation analysis using bisulfite-treated DNA utilized PCR and standard dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing to directly determine the nucleotides resistant to bisulfite conversion.

[...] All sites of unmethylated cytosines are displayed as thymines in the resulting amplified sequence of the sense strand, and as adenines in the amplified antisense strand.

40|$|Aims: Influenza is {{commonly}} spread by infectious aerosols; however, detection of viruses in aerosols is not sensitive enough {{to confirm the}} characteristics of virus aerosols. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an assay for respiratory viruses sufficiently sensitive to be used in epidemiological studies. Method: A two-step, <b>nested</b> real-time <b>PCR</b> assay was developed for MS 2 bacteriophage, and for influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1 and human respiratory syncytial virus. Outer primer pairs were designed to nest each existing real-time PCR assay. The sensitivities of the <b>nested</b> real-time <b>PCR</b> assays were compared to those of existing real-time PCR assays. Both assays were applied in an aerosol study to compare their detection limits in air samples. Conclusions: The <b>nested</b> real-time <b>PCR</b> assays were found to be several logs more sensitive than the real-time PCR assays, with lower levels of virus detected at lower Ct values. The <b>nested</b> real-time <b>PCR</b> assay successfully detected MS 2 in air samples, whereas the real-time assay did not. Significance and Impact of the Study: The sensitive assays for respiratory viruses will permit further research using air samples from naturally generated virus aerosols.

40|$|A nested reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) PCR assay detected mRNA of the salmonid pathogen Renibacterium salmoninarum in samples of RNA extracts of between 1 and 10 cells. Total RNA was extracted from cultured bacteria, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) kidney tissue and ovarian fluid seeded with the pathogen, and kidney tissue from both experimentally challenged and commercially raised fish. Following DNase treatment, extracted RNA was amplified by both RT PCR and PCR by using primers specific for the gene encoding the major protein antigen of R. salmoninarum. A 349 -bp amplicon {{was detected by}} polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver stain. Inactivation of cultured bacteria by rifampin or erythromycin produced a loss of <b>nested</b> RT <b>PCR</b> mRNA detection corresponding {{to a loss of}} bacterial cell viability determined from plate counts but no loss of DNA detection by PCR. In subclinically diseased fish, <b>nested</b> RT <b>PCR</b> identified similar levels of infected fish as determined by viable pathogen culture. Higher percentages of fish testing positive were generated by PCR, particularly in samples from fish previously subjected to antibiotic chemotherapy where 93 % were PCR positive, but only 7 % were <b>nested</b> RT <b>PCR</b> and culture positive. PCR can generate false-positive data from amplification of target DNA from nonviable pathogen cells.

40|$|Abstract Background E. histolytica, a {{pathogenic}} amoeba, is indistinguishable in its cyst and trophozoite stages {{from those}} of non-pathogenic E. moshkovskii and E. dispar by light microscopy. We have developed a <b>nested</b> multiplex <b>PCR</b> targeting a 16 S-like rRNA gene for differential detection of all the three morphologically similar forms of E. histolytica, E. moshkovskii and E. dispar simultaneously in stool samples. Results The species specific product size for E. histolytica, E. moshkovskii and E. dispar was 439, 553 and 174 bp respectively, which was clearly different for all the three Entamoeba species. The <b>nested</b> multiplex <b>PCR</b> showed a sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 100 % for the demonstration of E. histolytica, E. moshkovskii and E. dispar DNA in stool samples. The PCR was positive for E. histolytica, E. moshkovskii and E. dispar {{in a total of}} 190 out of 202 stool specimens (94 % sensitive) that were positive for E. histolytica/E. dispar / E. moshkovskii by examination of stool by microscopy and/or culture. All the 35 negative control stool samples that were negative for E. histolytica/E. dispar / E. moshkovskii by microscopy and culture were also found negative by the <b>nested</b> multiplex <b>PCR</b> (100 % specific). The result from the study shows that only 34. 6 % of the patient stool samples that were positive for E. histolytica/E. dispar / E. moshkovskii by examination of stool by microscopy and/or culture, were actually positive for pathogenic E. histolytica and the remaining majority of the stool samples were positive for non-pathogenic E. dispar or E. moshkovskii as demonstrated by the use of <b>nested</b> multiplex <b>PCR.</b> Conclusion The present study reports a new <b>nested</b> multiplex <b>PCR</b> strategy for species specific detection and differentiation of E. histolytica, E. dispar and E. moshkovskii DNA in stool specimens.
