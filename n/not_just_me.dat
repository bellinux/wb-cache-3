5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' <b>Not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the review}} for Illmatic was {{handled by the}} magazine's {{columnist}} Miss Info (then writing under the nom de plume, [...] "shortie"), who shared Schecter's enthusiasm for Nas' album. In her review of Illmatic, Minyah wrote, [...] "I must maintain {{this is one of}} the best hip-hop albums I have ever heard" [...] and wrote of its content, [...] "Lyrically, the whole shit is on point. No cliched metaphors, no gimmicks. Never too abstract, never superficial." [...] She also commented on the impact of Nas's [...] "poetic realism" [...] writing: “Nas’ images remind me of the personal memories and people, both passed and present… All this may sound like melodrama but it <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me.</b> I've been hearing similar responses all over. While 'Memory Lane' is my shit, my homies claim 'The World Is Yours,' and if you've got peoples doing time, then 'One Love' may hit you the hardest.". With the backing of Schecter and the other editors on the staff, Minya awarded Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating.|$|E
500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take me a while to recoup [...] this album, because we spent a lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E

2500|$|Alan Border {{praised the}} {{contribution}} to the side made by the return of veterans Bright and David Hookes. [...] "Now there's a lot more experience in the side with Hookes and Bright," [...] he said. [...] "It's a lot easier on me. With the side in England {{and even in the}} first Test against New Zealand there was basically only me that would say anything of a stern nature or a congratulatory nature. But we've got Hookesy now walk ing around and really giving Craig McDcrmott a big rocket or a positive word. The way Ray and David keep an eye on things, it's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> any more. The feeling {{over the past few weeks}} has been great but now there's a greater commitment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{activities}} like dumpster diving or gleaning are traditionally seen as subsistence {{strategies for the}} poor, most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and {{have high levels of}} education (even if their present lifestyles make them low-income). Freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive, because freegan's voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a [...] "globally ubiquitous racial construction" [...] that people of color are dirty and polluted. As one freegan of color wrote, [...] "I am extremely embarrassed for people to see me diving, because I can tell that I’m <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me,</b> I’m also a representation of black people in general...I got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus, until my white friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters." [...] In contrast, the portrait of the gender balance of freeganism is more mixed, with some accounts saying groups are majority men and others majority women.|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{process for}} making music is [...] "I'll have a sudden, {{spontaneous}} {{vision of a}} song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and {{do my best to}} record it as quick as I can. I'll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I'll have a whole bunch of them [...] and then I'll just choose which ones to make into full songs." [...] For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, [...] "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." [...] Parker also said [...] "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me." ...|$|E

"I pray daily but <b>not</b> <b>just</b> for <b>me</b> but for Carolyn and Courtney {{that even}} though {{they have the right to}} hate <b>me,</b> I <b>just</b> hope they don't live with hate in their hearts," [...] Chapman said in a last {{statement}} which was released shortly after the execution by prison officials.|$|R
60|$|Dearest Mr. Chorley, {{you have}} <b>not</b> been <b>just</b> to <b>me</b> {{in the matter}} of my 'Poems before Congress.' Why have you <b>not</b> been <b>just</b> to <b>me?</b> You are an honest man and my friend. Those two things might go together. Your opinions, {{critical}} or political, are free from stress of friendship. I never expected from you favor or mercy because you were my friend (it would have been unworthy of us both) but I did expect justice from you, although you were my friend. That is reasonable.|$|R

50|$|I {{prefer it}} because Rossini himself {{preferred}} it. Don't get me wrong. Mosè in Egitto {{is a wonderful}} opera, but it remains very much a mere sketch for Moïse et Pharaon. And it's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> who says that, but the great Rossini himself.|$|E
5000|$|There’s NYP 1988-2002, {{and then}} there’s {{whatever}} it’s been since. And that’s <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> gassing {{about the good}} old days. ...

5000|$|Ms. Dynamite commented, [...] "I don't {{appear in}} the video at all because I {{wanted it to be}} a song related to by everyone, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> about <b>me</b> and my dad... Of course, it is a very {{personal}} song, but by putting all those kids in the video - black, white, disabled, able-bodied - I wanted to make it about more than <b>just</b> <b>me.</b> There are lots of kids growing up without a dad or without a mum or anyone who cares about them. I wanted to make a video for them." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{breakdown}} {{of our marriage}} has been a painful experience for all concerned. Our divorce proceedings started nearly three years ago.

5000|$|My hope is {{that this}} album {{encourages}} people {{to step into the}} fullness of what God has called them to do, and take action. The album is meant to encourage all of us to go out, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me.</b> If we can all work together and be in the same place spiritually, that body of Christ working together can fuel a passion that is truly great. There is power in numbers! Jeremy Camp ...|$|E

5000|$|The album's {{title was}} a {{reflection}} of the success Snaith received after the release of Swim. Describing the inspiration for Our Love, Snaith said [...] "The primary impulse on this record was to make something that was generous {{in the sense that it}} was for everybody, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> for <b>me</b> locked in a studio by myself."

5000|$|In May 2016, the Israeli {{government}} revoked Barghouti's travel permit, limiting {{his ability}} to freely travel abroad. In an email to Haaretz, Barghouti wrote: [...] "Refusing to renew my travel document now is therefore clearly political...It does <b>not</b> <b>just</b> deny <b>me</b> my freedom of movement.

5000|$|After J. J. Abrams {{signed on}} to direct Mission: Impossible III, he brought many of his {{frequent}} collaborators onto the production.

5000|$|He {{said his}} {{sexuality}} should not prevent him becoming leader, saying, [...] "It {{would be very}} sad if people who have always been single or who are homosexual felt that their sexuality prevented them from holding high office.

It is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me.</b> There are lots of people who have tried to keep their private lives private.

5000|$|Westlife was {{recently}} asked by Daily Star about {{the success of}} the song for the band. Egan stated: [...] "It is amazing that after 11 albums we can still do things we haven't done before, or set new records for ourselves. What About Now definitely changed things. It might not have sold millions of copies, but I was on YouTube yesterday and the video has almost two million plays or something. That's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>me</b> watching it either! I think it shows that we can still reach new people and audiences with everything we do." ...|$|E
500|$|Ely {{lived at}} his farm in Terrebonne, Oregon, where he trained horses.

[...] In an interview, he said, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> about <b>me.</b> There are a lot of one-hit wonders out there <b>just</b> like <b>me</b> who deserve compensation when their recorded performances are played and stations get ad revenue from it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Ali Payami met Julius Petersson, then an A&R for Warner/Chappel, {{during the}} time he was DJing in clubs.

5000|$|The {{process of}} {{recording}} the album {{as a group}} lead to Skelly choosing the name James Skelly & The Intenders for the project.
