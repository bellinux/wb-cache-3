5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the {{strategy}} of the Imperial Japanese Navy {{was based on the}} radical Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, as promoted by French military advisor and naval architect Emile Bertin. This emphasised cheap torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive, heavily armoured ships. The acquisition of two German-built s by the Imperial Chinese Beiyang Fleet in 1885 threatened Japan's interests in Korea. A visit by the Chinese warships to Japan in early 1891 forced the Japanese government to acknowledge that the IJN required similarly armed and armoured ships of its own to counter the ironclads; the three lightly armoured s ordered from France would <b>not</b> <b>suffice,</b> despite their powerful guns. The IJN decided to order a pair of the latest battleships from the United Kingdom as Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{initially}} {{came from}} Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted {{that not even}} the Pennsylvanian legislators {{had been able to}} enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state. Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that distillers were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant. Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day and file weekly reports in extensive detail. Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a jury trial with potential offenders. As soon as 1791 locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as they felt the inspection methods were intrusive. Inspectors were also tarred and feathered, blindfolded, and whipped. Hamilton had attempted to appease the opposition with lowered tax rates, but it did <b>not</b> <b>suffice.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Christian Churches {{have indeed}} always affirmed the un-Christian {{character}} of antisemitism, as {{of all forms}} of racial hatred, but this has <b>not</b> <b>sufficed</b> to prevent the manifestation among Christians, in various forms, of an undiscriminating racial hatred of the Jews as a people.|$|R

25|$|The {{demand to}} satisfy the {{judgment}} debt must {{be made of the}} debtor, or of his duly authorised agent. In other words, a personal service is required; a demand made to some other party, such as the debtor’s wife, does <b>not</b> <b>suffice.</b>|$|E
40|$|Eight wood {{species from}} forest {{experimental}} garden in West Java were observed for identification purposes. All wood species {{could be identified}} one from the others, due to their distinguished conspicuous characters. Kecapi (Sandoricum kucape Merr.) on the other hand, showed characters that matched only the previous description of the genus. Such characters, were apparently <b>not</b> <b>sufficed</b> to describe the species...|$|R
60|$|A sudden {{burst of}} {{enthusiastic}} cheering broke {{from the upper}} forms.

They stood upon the forms and cheered until they were hoarse. At last a wave of the doctor's hand restored silence, and he went on.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the note}} of devotion to his cause that I {{had come to}} hear: I felt it {{renewing}} me, as I had hoped.

My sympathy and affection were mingled with the admiration he never failed to inspire.|$|R
25|$|Since the Torah forbids cooking one's meat in milk, {{a parable}} quoting just meat would <b>not</b> <b>suffice</b> as meat has this {{restrictive}} element whereas fish has a lesser restrictive element, thus implying that man has an enhanced level of (sexual) freedom with his wife.|$|E
25|$|Due {{diligence}} {{is required}} in making application for relief, and, {{in the absence of}} a valid excuse for delay, the petition will be denied. The mere naked allegation that a constitutional right has been invaded will <b>not</b> <b>suffice.</b> The application should make a full disclosure of specific facts relied upon and not merely state conclusions as to the nature of such facts.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} testing a {{structure}} for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the cut surface with phenolphthalein indicator solution. This solution turns pink when in contact with alkaline concrete, {{making it possible to}} see the depth of carbonation. Using an existing hole does <b>not</b> <b>suffice</b> because the exposed surface will already be carbonated.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hargreaves {{was perhaps}} forty-five years old, with a {{pleasant}} face, marked by firmness and intelligence. Mrs. Righton was twenty-five or twenty-six, and her pale face showed {{more than that}} of her mother {{the effects of the}} anxiety and confinement of the siege. Edith and Nelly were sixteen and fifteen respectively, and although pale, the siege had <b>not</b> <b>sufficed</b> to mar their bright faces or to crush their spirits.|$|R

25|$|This did <b>not</b> <b>suffice,</b> however. Franklin {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a subscription library, which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read. This was the birth of the Library Company of Philadelphia: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, Louis Timothee. The Library Company is now a great scholarly and research library.|$|E

It is very clear that 2 D imaging gives limited information of the target object which paves the way for the next step of this thesis called three-dimensional imaging.

40|$|The {{question}} whether cognition ever {{extends beyond the}} head is widely {{considered to be an}} empirical issue. And yet, all the evidence amassed in recent years has <b>not</b> <b>sufficed</b> to settle the debate. In this paper we suggest that this is because the debate is not really an empirical one, but rather a matter of definition. Traditional cognitive science can be identified as wedded to the ideals of “smallism” and “localism”. We criticize these ideals and articulate a case in favor of extended cognition by highlighting the historical pedigree and conceptual adequacy of related empirical and theoretical work...|$|R
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the notice is to alert all {{creditors}} of the intended application, in case they should wish to oppose it. It follows that the notice must be published in a newspaper in the usual sense. What if the newspaper was published in Hebrew and was devoted only to Jewish interests, as in Ex parte Goldman? The answer is that this would <b>not</b> <b>suffice.</b> The newspaper must be one which caters to general interests.|$|E
25|$|On 11 July 1996 at 09:00 local time, Bouraq lost another HS 748 (registered PK-IHN) in {{a runway}} {{overshot}} at Pattimura Airport. The pilots had to abort the take-off for a scheduled flight to Manado {{because of an}} engine failure, but the remaining length of the runway did <b>not</b> <b>suffice</b> to bring the aircraft to a halt, so that it collided with a dyke. There were no noteworthy injuries amongst the 43 passengers and five crew members.|$|E
25|$|The Reichstag was {{dissolved}} in June 1878 because it refused Bismarck's Anti-Socialist Law. Chancellor Bismarck {{in the newly}} elected parliament relied on a broad agro-conservative majority with the slogan: Agriculture is owed by the state the same attention as industry; if both do not go hand in hand, the strength of one will <b>not</b> <b>suffice</b> for a lack in the other. Bismarck helped foster support from these conservatives by enacting several tariffs protecting German agriculture, and incidentally industry, from foreign competition.|$|E
60|$|The {{intercourse}} {{of a month}} had <b>not</b> <b>sufficed</b> {{to render}} either party very familiar with {{the language of the}} other. A few of the commoner words of the Indians had been caught by the Spaniards, and perhaps Luis {{was one of the most}} ready in their use; still, it is highly probable, he was oftener wrong than right, even when he felt the most confident of his success. But the language of friendship is not easily mistaken, and our hero had not entertained a feeling of distrust from the time he left the ships, down to the present moment.|$|R

25|$|The Académie française has forty seats, each {{of which}} is {{assigned}} a separate number. Candidates make their applications for a specific seat, not to the Académie in general: if several seats are vacant, a candidate may apply separately for each. Since a newly elected member is required to eulogize his or her predecessor in the installation ceremony, it is not uncommon that potential candidates refuse to apply for particular seats because they dislike the predecessors so much that even an enormous exercise of tact will <b>not</b> <b>suffice.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Hmong general {{called the}} new {{offensive}} operation Kou Kiet (Redeemed Honor). His CIA contacts dubbed it Operation About Face when they approved it. No matter the name, it was patterned on the previous Operation Raindance, planned as a three-week attack with the major firepower being tactical air. Newly arrived Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley messaged his superiors in the U.S. State Department that the military situation on the Plain of Jars was so crucial that if fighter-bombers would <b>not</b> <b>suffice</b> for Kou Kiet, Arc Light strikes by B-52s {{should be considered as}} a followup.|$|E
