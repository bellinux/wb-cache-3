40|$|Changes in {{cellular}} calcium (Ca 2 +) handling {{are thought}} to underlie the altered contraction that occurs during cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Recent work has highlighted the importance of t-tubules in the control of intracellular Ca 2 +. The present study was performed to investigate whether changes {{in the distribution of}} <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> between the surface and t-tubule membranes might contribute to the altered Ca 2 + handling observed during compensated hypertrophy in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Experiments were performed on ventricular myocytes isolated from 5 -month-old SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats. Osmotic shock using formamide was used to disrupt the t-tubular system and the whole-cell patch clamp technique used to monitor <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> in the presence and absence of t-tubules. Membrane capacitance and <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> were greater in control SHR than WKY myocytes; following detubulation, cell capacitance and <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> both decreased and were no longer significantly different in the two cell types. The density of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> was not significantly different in control SHR and WKY cells or in detubulated myocytes from the two species. These data suggest that the distribution of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> is unchanged in SHR myocytes compared to WKY controls; <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> density in the t-tubules was 1. 2 -fold greater than in the sarcolemma in both strains. These data also imply that the increase in surface area in SHR myocytes is due principally to an increase in t-tubular area, which is accompanied by an approximately equivalent increase in <b>I</b> <b>Ca,</b> so that the density of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> at the cell surface and in the t-tubules remains the same. These changes would be expected to retain cell function and synchronicity of Ca 2 + release in the SHR at this stage of compensated hypertrophy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) is {{a hormone}} predominately {{synthesized}} and secreted by intestinal L-cells. GLP- 1 modulates multiple cellular functions and its receptor agonists are now used clinically for diabetic treatment. Interestingly, preclinical and clinical {{evidence suggests that}} GLP- 1 agonists produce beneficial effects on dysfunctional hearts via acting on myocardial GLP- 1 receptors. As the effects of GLP- 1 on myocyte electrophysiology are largely unknown, {{this study was to}} assess if GLP- 1 could affect the cardiac voltage-gated L-type Ca 2 + current (<b>I</b> <b>Ca).</b> Methods The whole-cell patch clamp method was used to record <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> and action potentials in enzymatically isolated cardiomyocytes from adult canine left ventricles. Results Extracellular perfusion of GLP- 1 (7 - 36 amide) at 5 nM increased <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> by 23 ± 8 % (p Ca; however, the increase in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> was abolished if Exendin (9 - 39) was pre-applied 5 min prior to GLP- 1 administration.

40|$|The hormone {{abscisic acid}} (ABA) regulates stress {{responses}} and developmental processes in plants. Calcium-permeable channels activated by {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) have been shown recently to function in the ABA signaling network in Arabidopsis guard cells. Here, we report that ABA activation of these <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> Ca 2 � channels requires the presence of NAD(P) H in the cytosol. The protein phosphatase 2 C (PP 2 C) mutant abi 1 - 1 disrupted ABA activation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> channels. Moreover, in abi 1 - 1, ABA did not induce ROS production. Consistent with these findings, in abi 1 - 1, H 2 O 2 activation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> channels and H 2 O 2 -induced stomatal closing were not disrupted, suggesting that abi 1 - 1 impairs ABA signaling between ABA reception and ROS production. The abi 2 - 1 mutation, which lies in a distinct PP 2 C gene, also disrupted ABA activation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> However, in contrast to abi 1 - 1, abi 2 - 1 impaired both H 2 O 2 activation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> and H 2 O 2 -induced stomatal closing. Furthermore, ABA elicited ROS production in abi 2 - 1.

40|$|The cardiac voltage gated Ca 2 + current (<b>I</b> <b>Ca)</b> is {{critical}} to the electrophysiological properties, excitation-contraction coupling, mitochondrial energetics, and transcriptional regulation in heart. Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} cardiac <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> is regulated by numerous pathways. This review will focus on changes in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> that occur during the cardiac action potential (AP), with particular attention to Ca 2 + -dependent inactivation (CDI), Ca 2 + -dependent facilitation (CDF) and how calmodulin (CaM) and Ca 2 + -CaM dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) participate in the regulation of Ca 2 + current during the cardiac AP. CDI depends on CaM pre-bound to the C-terminal of the L-type Ca 2 + channel, such that Ca 2 + influx and Ca 2 + released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum bind to that CaM and cause CDI. In cardiac myocytes CDI normally pre-dominates over voltage-dependent inactivation. The decrease in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> via CDI provides direct negative feedback on the overall Ca 2 + influx during a single beat, when myocyte Ca 2 + loading is high. CDF builds up over several beats, depends on CaMKII-dependent Ca 2 + channel phosphorylation, and results in a staircase of increasing <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> peak, with progressively slower inactivation. CDF and CDI co-exist and in combination may fine-tune the <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> waveform during the cardiac AP. CDF may partially compensate for the tendency for Ca 2 + channel availability to decrease at higher heart rates because of accumulating inactivation. CDF may also allow some reactivation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> during long duration cardiac APs, and contribute to early afterdepolarizations, a form of triggered arrhythmias. © 2014 Bers and Morotti...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The phosphoinositide 3 -kinases (PI 3 K/Akt) {{dependent}} {{signaling pathway}} {{plays an important}} role in cardiac function, specifically cardiac contractility. We have reported that sepsis decreases myocardial Akt activation, which correlates with cardiac dysfunction in sepsis. We also reported that preventing sepsis induced changes in myocardial Akt activation ameliorates cardiovascular dysfunction. In this study we investigated the role of PI 3 K/Akt on cardiomyocyte function by examining the role of PI 3 K/Akt-dependent signaling on [Ca 2 +] <b>i,</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + transients and membrane Ca 2 + current, <b>I</b> <b>Ca,</b> in cultured murine HL- 1 cardiomyocytes. LY 294002 (1 – 20 [*]μM), a specific PI 3 K inhibitor, dramatically decreased HL- 1 [Ca 2 +] <b>i,</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + transients and <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> We also examined the effect of PI 3 K isoform specific inhibitors, i. e. α (PI 3 -kinase α inhibitor 2; 2 – 8 [*]nM); β (TGX- 221; 100 [*]nM) and γ (AS- 252424; 100 [*]nM), to determine the contribution of specific isoforms to HL- 1 [Ca 2 +] i regulation. Pharmacologic inhibition of each of the individual PI 3 K isoforms significantly decreased [Ca 2 +] <b>i,</b> and inhibited <b>Ca</b> 2 + transients. Triciribine (1 – 20 [*]μM), which inhibits AKT downstream of the PI 3 K pathway, also inhibited [Ca 2 +] <b>i,</b> and <b>Ca</b> 2 + transients and <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> We conclude that the PI 3 K/Akt pathway is required for normal maintenance of [Ca 2 +] i in HL- 1 cardiomyocytes. Thus, myocardial PI 3 K/Akt-PKB signaling sustains [Ca 2 +] i required for excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyoctyes. </p...|$|R

40|$|The ionic {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} negative dromotropic effect of adenosine were studied in calcium-tolerant myocytes {{isolated from the}} region of the rabbit atrioventricular (AV) node. Action potentials and membrane currents were recorded by using the whole cell patch clamp technique. Adenosine (1 to 50 m M) abolished the spontaneous activity of AV node myocytes with hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. Voltage clamp experiments showed that adenosine induced an inwardly rectifying, time-independent potassium current. These effects were antagonized by 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine and produced by ribose 5 -phosphate isomerase A, indicating that they were mediated by the A 1 adenosine receptor. Adenosine also had a small direct inhibitory action on the inward calcium current (<b>I</b> <b>Ca)</b> but had a more marked indirect action following stimulation of the calcium current by isoprenaline. The isoprenaline-induced increase in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> was abolished in the presence of adenosine 10 m M. In cells pretreated with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N w -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the isoprenaline-induced increase in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> was not reduced by the addition of adenosine. Coincubation of the cells with L-NAME plus L-arginine (the endogenous substrate of nitric oxide synthase) restored the adenosine-induced attenuation of <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> A membrane permeable analogue of cGMP, 8 Br cGMP, an inhibitor of cGMP-stimulated phosphodiesterase, prevented the antiadrenergic effect of adenosine. These results suggest that adenosine activates guanylyl cyclase following the production of nitric oxide, and the subsequent stimulation of phosphodiesterase enhances the breakdown of isoprenaline-elevated cAMP leading to a reduction in the stimulated <b>I</b> <b>Ca.</b> In conclusion, the important ionic mechanisms of the actions of adenosine on AV nodal cells are a direct effect, with activation of a potassium conductance and an indirect antiadrenergic effect on <b>I</b> <b>Ca,</b> which is mediated by nitric oxide production and phosphodiesterase stimulation...|$|R
