40|$|The {{ability of}} T. basalis {{to locate and}} parasitize Nezara viridula eggs was {{investigated}} in habitats with different architectures (monocot, broad leaf shrubs, mixed weeds). Trissolcus basalis demonstrated a significant preference for searching in weedy habitats dominated by Crotalaria pallida. Dispersal and host utilization efficiency of T. basalis was quantified in macadamia orchards on trees and weeds, and in weed- infested pastures. Parasitism <b>of</b> N. viridula <b>eggs</b> in macadamia nut orchards on trees and weeds was low. In weedy pasture the effects of predation (42 % <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>destroyed)</b> and parasitism (~ 16 % <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> <b>destroyed)</b> appeared to be greater than in orchards. Quantification {{of the level of}} indispensable mortality contributed by T. basalis and predatory insects is needed. While augmentative release of T. basalis in macadamia nut orchards shows little potential for suppression of N. viridula, releases in weedy habitats adjacent to orchards may contribute to reducing numbers of N. viridula moving into orchards from surrounding habitat by increasing mortality at the egg stage. The economics of implementing augmentative releases of T. basalis in macadamia nut production will likely render augmentative release strategies impractical...|$|R

Four concentrations of DMA (4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 %) in extender were compared with previously optimized cryopreservation protocol based on 20 % glycerol (control) for Indian red jungle fowl. Sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, viability, and acrosome integrity were assessed at the stage of post-dilution, cooling, equilibration, and freeze-thawing. The whole experiment was repeated/replicated for five times independently. Sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, viability and acrosome integrity were recorded highest (P <  0. 05) at post-dilution, cooling, equilibration, and freeze-thawing in extender having 6 % DMA compared to control and other experimental extenders. The highest (P <  0. 05) recovery rates of all aforementioned parameters were also recorded in extender having 6 % DMA; thus, 6 % DMA was further compared with control (20 % glycerol) for fertility after artificial insemination.
