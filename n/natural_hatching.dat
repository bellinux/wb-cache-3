Although the pattern of earlier egg hatching in temporary ponds, as observed in the field monitoring, is adaptive, it was not fully repeatable in the common garden experiment.

For method I, 30 eggs were incubated in square filter paper (5 × 5 cm) and deposited on bovine feces (500 g) where they were kept until hatching and spontaneous penetration of larvae (L 1) into the fecal mass. After 24 h, eggs were analyzed under a stereoscope microscope (40 ×) for the number of larvae that instinctively penetrated the feces.

This incubator was equipped with temperature and humidity sensors to measure and control the condition in the incubator. The incubator body was fabricated by stainless steel that provides less bacterial cross contamination between the incubator and the hatched chicks. It was designed to automatically change the parameters to the suitable condition to fit {{the various types of}} eggs. Direct current geared motor with low speed was used to rotate chained steel mat at the bottom and automatically change the position of egg to avoid the embryo sticks onto the shell. The entire elements were controlled by microcontroller devices to process the data from sensors and execute the control element of the machine. LabVIEW system was applied for temperature and humidity data recording. The evaluation of the shaft for egg turning system was analysed. The safety factor was determined at 5. 88 by manual calculation and 9. 6 by software simulation respectively. This indicated that the safety factor of the shaft has achieved the required standard which must be higher than 0. 99. The test run experiment on quail eggs, showed the stable temperature in incubation chamber of 37. 5 oC and 49. 86 % of relatively humidity (RH) were achieved.

A value chain mapping framework was used to describe types of inputs and outputs from chicken farms, challenges faced by producers and their disease control strategies. Commercial layer farms were defined as farms keeping exotic breeds of chicken, whereas indigenous chicken farms kept different cross breeds of indigenous chicken. Four focus group discussions were held with producers of these chickens in peri-urban area: Dagoretti, and one informal settlement: Kibera. Qualitative data were collected on interactions between farmers, sources of farm inputs and buyers of poultry products, simple ranking of production challenges, farmers' perception on diseases affecting chicken and strategies for management of sick chicken and waste products. Value chain profiles were drawn showing sources of inputs and channels for distribution of chicken products. Production challenges and chicken disease management strategies were presented as qualitative summaries. Commercial layer farms in Dagoretti kept an average of 250 chickens (range 50 – 500); while flock sizes in Kibera were 12 chickens (range 5 – 20). Farms keeping indigenous chicken had an average of 23 chickens (range 8 – 40) in Dagoretti, and 10 chickens (range 5 – 16) in Kibera. Commercial layer farms in Dagoretti obtained chicks from distributors of commercial hatcheries, but farms in Kibera obtained chicks from hawkers who in turn sourced them from distributors of commercial hatcheries. Indigenous chicken farms from Dagoretti relied on <b>natural</b> <b>hatching</b> of fertilised eggs, but indigenous chicken farms in Kibera obtained chicks from their social connection with communities living in rural areas. Outlets for eggs from commercial layer farms included local shops, brokers, restaurants and hawkers, while eggs from indigenous chicken farms were sold to neighbours and restaurants. Sieved chicken manure from Dagoretti area was fed to dairy cattle; whereas non-sieved manure was used as fertilizer on crops. Production challenges included poor feed quality, lack of space for expansion, insecurity, occurrence of diseases and lack of sources of information on chicken management. In Kibera, sick and dead chickens were slaughtered and consumed by households; this practice was not reported in Dagoretti.

40|$|Plant {{resistance}} to the feeding by herbivorous insects has recently {{been found to be}} positively or negatively influenced by prior egg deposition. Here we show how crucial it is to conduct experiments on plant responses to herbivory under conditions that simulate natural insect behaviour. We used a well-studied plant – herbivore system, Arabidopsis thaliana and the cabbage white butterfly Pieris brassicae, testing the effects of naturally laid eggs (rather than egg extracts) and allowing larvae to feed gregariously as they do naturally (rather than placing single larvae on plants). Under <b>natural</b> conditions, newly <b>hatched</b> larvae start feeding on their egg shells before they consume leaf tissue, but access to egg shells had no effect on subsequent larval performance in our experiments. However, young larvae feeding gregariously on leaves previously laden with eggs caused less feeding damage, gained less weight during the first 2 days, and suffered twice as high a mortality until pupation compared to larvae feeding on plants that had never had eggs. The concentration of the major anti-herbivore defences of A. thaliana, the glucosinolates, was not significantly increased by oviposition, but the amount of the most abundant member of this class, 4 -methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate was 1. 8 -fold lower in larval-damaged leaves with prior egg deposition compared to damaged leaves that had never had eggs. There were also few significant changes in the transcript levels of glucosinolate metabolic genes, except that egg deposition suppressed the feeding-induced up-regulation of FMOGS-OX 2, a gene encoding a flavin monooxygenase involved in the last step of 4 -methylsulfinylbuty...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the Oslo fjord has been made {{the subject of a}} more intense study as regards the hydrographical and {{biological}} conditions. The fjord is 55 naut. miles long, and is divided into several basins by narrows and submerged barriers. (Fig. 6 and 7). The entrance to the fjord from the Skagerack is comparatively open. In the outer part fresh water from the rivers, the Drammenselv and the Glomma, affects the salinity of the surface layers especially during the spring. The inner part is affected by sewage water from Oslo. Owing to the submerged bariers and the stability of the water the intermediate and lower layers inside the Drøbak sound are often stagnant and their content of oxygen is low (fig. 7). The seasonal temperature variations are also small (fig. 8. Ramtongrunnen). The salinity near the surface varies greatly according to the rainfall and the direction of the wind. A southerly wind keeps the fresh water inside the fjord, a northerly wind carries it out. It {{is an integral part of}} the present investigations to ascertain the amount of fish eggs and larvae in the fjord. The report gives the results of this part of the work up to the spring of 1940, when operations had to be discontinued owing to the war. In 9 localities (see fig. 6) the hydrographical conditions were examined and ascertained. As a rule 4 horizontal hauls of 10 mins. duration at deptht of 0, 10, 20 and 30 m below the surface were carried out with the egg net (1 m in diameter), and 2 hauls of 20 minutes at 10 and 30 m with the young-fish net (2 m in diameter). These operations were performed in the course of three cruises each spring. In the summer and autumn three cruises were made for the purpose of examining the hydrographical conditions, The following results were ascertained. The quantaties of spawn show that spawning must be intense in the outer fjord from the beginning of March. In the inner fjord spawning is generally less intense until April, when there is an abundance, especially of sprat spawn. It would seem, however, that the eggs do not develop at a normal rate in the inner fjord, the percentage of eggs with advanced embryos being extremely low inside Drøbak, but normal outside. With regard to the eggs of cod and haddock see fig. 25. Table 15 on page 60 shows the total number of fish larvae & young. The number accords with the occurrences of eggs at later stages, being high in the outer and low in the inner fjord, except during the month of May. The poor results of the <b>natural</b> <b>hatching</b> of eggs in the inner fjord during early spring are probably due to the effects of sewage water from Oslo. In late spring the higher temperature and increased intensity of light may have a natural purifying effect on the sea water. As has been pointed out by Wiborg (1940), crustacean plankton also develop very late in the inner fjord. This naturally provides poorer nourishment for the early hatched larvae. From table 16 it will be seen that in 1936 we caught less than 25 % of the amount of larvae taken in the subsequent years. In 1937 there was an abundance of sprat larvae, in 1938 of cod larvae, and in 1939 of herring and haddock larvae. No attempt has been made to indicate the cause or causes of this variation, as we lack the material for estimating the amount of spawners of the different species. A special aspect which is dealt with is the effect of releasing artificially hatched cod fry into the inner fjord. This was done only in one year - 1938, but it is the intention to continue the experiment. Not much can be said on the basis of the results of a single year, owing to the great variation in the natural breeding...|$|E
40|$|To {{generate}} {{information essential}} {{for the implementation of}} breeding schemes suitable for village poultry producers in Ethiopia, a survey was conducted aimed at defining the socioeconomic characteristics of the production environments in different geographic regions, understanding the important functions of chickens, identifying farmers’ choice of chicken breeds and the underlying factors that determine the choice of genetic stock used. The survey included both questionnaire survey and a participatory group discussion. A total of 225 households (45 households from each of five Woredas) were interviewed. The questionnaire was designed to collect data covering general information on village poultry production such as socio-management characteristics, production objectives, population structure, breed choice and trait preferences, market preferences of specific traits, and farmers’ selection practices. The participatory farmers’ discussions were designed to involve stakeholders in defining the breeding objective “traits” and deriving their relative importance in the production environment based on the different functions of chickens and “traits” identified in the interviews. The results showed that production of eggs for consumption is the principal function of chickens in most regions followed by the use as source of income and meat for home consumption. The production system in all geographic regions studied revealed similar features generally characterized by extensive scavenging management, absence of immunization programs, increased risk of exposure of birds to disease and predators, and reproduction entirely based on uncontrolled <b>natural</b> mating and <b>hatching</b> of eggs using broody hens. Farmers’ ratings of indigenous chickens with respect to modern breeds showed the highest significance of the adaptive traits in general, and the superior merits of indigenous chickens to high yielding exotic breeds in particular. Adaptation to the production environment was the most important attribute of chickens in all the study areas. The high significance attributed to reproduction traits indicates the need for maintaining broody behavior and high level of hatchability while breeding for improved productivity of indigenous chickens for village conditions. The market price of chickens is primarily dictated by weight, but farmers rated growth (males) and number of eggs followed by growth (females) as the production traits they would like the most to be improved. Therefore, the ultimate breeding goal should be to develop a dual-purpose breed based on indigenous chicken genetic resources with any of the comb types other than single for all the regions studied having the most preferred white body plumage for farmers in the Amhara region and red body plumage for those in Oromia, Benshangul-Gumuz, and Southern region...|$|R
40|$|Nesting {{success is}} an {{important}} vital rate affecting the reproductive fitness of birds, and predation typically {{is the single most}} important factor affecting nesting success. Presumably, birds should nest in locations that maximize nest survival. If specific nest characteristics increase the probability that a nest will <b>hatch,</b> <b>natural</b> (phenotypic) selection could favour use of sites with these features, producing nonrandom patterns of nest site use. Alternatively, birds that are highly selective in nest site choices might be at a disadvantage if predators learn to forage preferentially in these locations and improve their efficiency in depredating nests; in this case, random nesting patterns could be favoured. Finally, it has been hypothesized that predation pressure can influence nest site selection patterns of entire bird communities. If predators develop a search image to hunt for bird nests, then nests that are most similar to each other, irrespective of species, should sustain higher mortality. To evaluate these hypotheses, I quantified nest site selection patterns of multiple species of ground-nesting dabbling ducks in areas where predation pressure was normally high, and compared these patterns to those on areas where predation was relaxed. Predation pressure was experimentally reduced by removing common predators of duck nests and females (mainly red foxes, coyotes, skunks and raccoons) on some study areas and not on others (controls). Predator removal and natural causes produced a 10 -fold difference in duck nesting across study sites, allowing for investigation of effects of predation pressure on nest site selection of ducks. Coarse scale habitat selection patterns were similar to results reported in previous studies; blue-winged teal and northern shoveler were found more often in native grassland than in other habitat types, while gadwall and mallard nests occurred more frequently in shrub patches when compared with other habitat patches. A difference in nest site characteristics was observed between hatched and depredated nests for gadwall and northern shoveler but not for blue-winged teal and mallard. However, in all species, the nest site selection patterns were non-random. Thus, the process of nest predation did not shape patterns of nest site choice. Contrary to predictions, inter-specific overlap in nest site features was not related to predation pressure: nests that overlapped most with features of other species did not suffer higher predation, nor did inter-specific overlap in nest characteristics decrease during the nesting season. These findings were inconsistent with the hypothesis that community-level patterns of nest site use are differentiated as a result of predation pressure. Long-term work on nest site use by individually marked females of numerous ground-nesting bird species would be informative, as would experimental studies of other hypotheses about factors affecting nest site choices in birds...|$|R
40|$|Herbivory is {{discussed}} {{as a key}} agent in maintaining dynamics and stability of tropical forested ecosystems. Accordingly increasing {{attention has been paid}} to the factors that structure tropical herbivore communities. The aim of this study was (1) to describe diversity, density, distribution and host range of the phasmid community (Phasmatodea) of a moist neotropical forest in Panamá, and (2) to experimentally assess bottom-up and top-down factors that may regulate populations of the phasmid Metriophasma diocles. The phasmid community of Barro Colorado Island was poor in species and low in density. Phasmids mainly occurred along forest edges and restricted host ranges of phasmid species reflected the successional status of their host plants. Only M. diocles that fed on early and late successional plants occurred regularly in the forest understory. A long generation time with a comparably low fecundity converted into a low biotic potential of M. diocles. However, modeled potential population density increased exponentially and exceeded the realized densities of this species already after one generation indicating that control factors continuously affect M. diocles <b>natural</b> populations. Egg <b>hatching</b> failure decreased potential population growth by 10 % but was of no marked effect at larger temporal scale. Interspecific differences in defensive physical and chemical leaf traits of M. diocles host plants, amongst them leaf toughness the supposedly most effective anti-herbivore defense, seemed not to affect adult female preference and nymph performance. Alternatively to these defenses, I suggest that the pattern of differential preference and performance may be based on interspecific differences in qualitative toxic compounds or in nutritive quality of leaves. The significant rejection of leaf tissue with a low artificial increase of natural phenol contents by nymphs indicated a qualitative defensive pathway in Piper evolution. In M. diocles, oviposition may not be linked to nymph performance, because the evolutionary prediction of a relation between female adult preference and nymph performance was missing. Consequently, the recruitment of nymphs into the reproductive adult phase may be crucially affected by differential performance of nymphs. Neonate M. diocles nymphs suffered strong predation pressure when exposed to natural levels of predation. Concluding from significantly increased predation-related mortality at night, I argue that arthropods may be the main predators of this nocturnal herbivore. Migratory behavior of nymphs seemed not to reflect predation avoidance. Instead, I provided first evidence that host plant quality may trigger off-plant migration. In conclusion, I suggest that predation pressure with its direct effects on nymph survival may be a stronger factor regulating M. diocles populations, compared to direct and indirect effects of host plant quality, particularly because slow growth and off-host migration both may feed back into an increase of predation related mortality.
