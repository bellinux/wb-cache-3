40|$|Background: Lysosomal storage {{disorders}} are a heterogeneous group of approximately 50 monogenically inherited orphan conditions. A defect {{leads to the}} storage of complex molecules in the lysosome, and patients develop a complex multisystemic phenotype of high morbidity often associated with premature death. More than 30  years ago the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 passed the United States legislation intended to facilitate the development of drugs for rare disorders. We directed our efforts in assessing which lysosomal diseases had drug development pressure and what distinguished those with successful development and approvals from diseases not treated or without orphan drug designation. Methods: Analysis of the FDA database for orphan drug designations through descriptive and comparative statistics. Results: Between 1983 and 2013, fourteen drugs for seven conditions received FDA approval. Overall, orphan drug status was designated 70 times for 20 conditions. Approved therapies were enzyme replacement therapies (N = 10), substrate reduction therapies (N = 1), small molecules facilitating lysosomal substrate transportation (N = 3). FDA approval {{was significantly associated with}} a disease prevalence higher than 0. 5 / 100, 000 (p = 0. 00742) and clinical development programs that did not require a primary <b>neurological</b> <b>endpoint</b> (p = 0. 00059). Orphan drug status was designated for enzymes, modified enzymes, fusion proteins, chemical chaperones, small molecules leading to substrate reduction, or facilitating subcellular substrate transport, stem cells as well as gene therapies. Conclusions: Drug development focused on more common diseases. Primarily neurological diseases were neglected. Small clinical trials with either somatic or biomarker endpoints were successful. Enzyme replacement therapy was the most successful technology. Four factors {{played a key role in}} successful orphan drug development or orphan drug designations: 1) prevalence of disease 2) endpoints 3) regulatory precedent, and 4) technology platform.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{neurotoxic}} {{effects of}} methylmercury (MeHg) {{have been demonstrated}} in both human and animal studies. Both adult and fetal brains are susceptible {{to the effects of}} MeHg toxicity. However, the specific effects of adult exposures have been less well-documented than those of children with prenatal exposures. This is largely because few studies of MeHg exposures in adults have used sensitive <b>neurological</b> <b>endpoints.</b> The present study reports on the results of neuropsychological testing and hair mercury concentrations in adults (> 17 yrs) living in fishing communities of Baixada Cuiabana (Mato Grosso) in the Pantanal region of Brazil. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in six villages on the Cuiaba River. Participants included 129 men and women older than 17 years of age. They were randomly selected in proportion to the age range and number of inhabitants in each village. Questionnaire information was collected on demographic variables, including education, occupation, and residence history. Mercury exposure was determined by analysis of hair using flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The neurocognitive screening battery included tests from the Wechsler Memory Scale and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Concentrated Attention Test of the Toulouse-Pierron Factorial Battery, the Manual Ability Subtests of the Tests of Mechanical Ability, and the Profile of Mood States. Results Mercury exposures in this population were associated with fish consumption. The hair mercury concentration in the 129 subjects ranged from 0. 56 to 13. 6 μg/g; the mean concentration was 4. 2 ± 2. 4 micrograms/g and the median was 3. 7 μg/g. Hair mercury levels were associated with detectable alterations in performance on tests of fine motor speed and dexterity, and concentration. Some aspects of verbal learning and memory were also disrupted by mercury exposure. The magnitude of the effects increased with hair mercury concentration, consistent with a dose-dependent effect. Conclusions This study suggests that adults exposed to MeHg may be at risk for deficits in neurocognitive function. The functions disrupted in adults, namely attention, fine-motor function and verbal memory, are similar to some of those previously reported in children with prenatal exposures. </p...|$|R
40|$|Manganese (Mn) is a {{nutrient}} and neurotoxicant sometimes {{associated with}} mood, motor and neurological effects. Reports of health effects from occupational exposure to Mn are well known, but the reported links to environmental airborne Mn (Mn-Air) are less conclusive. Marietta, OH (USA) is a previously identified community with elevated Mn-Air from industrial emissions. Households {{were randomly selected}} in Marietta and the comparison town (Mount Vernon, OH). The responders were used to recruit {{on a voluntary basis}} 30 - to 75 -year-old residents, i. e. 100 in Marietta and 90 in Mount Vernon. They were administered the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), motor efficiency, and mood tests, along with a comprehensive questionnaire including demographics, health and work history. Blood Mn (MnB), serum ferritin, and hepatic enzymes were measured. Results were compared with those of 90 residents from a demographically similar comparison town, Mount Vernon, OH, where Mn-Air from industrial emissions was not of concern. Mn-Air exposure indices were modeled for Marietta residents. The Mn-exposed participants resided on average 4. 75 miles (range 1 - 11) from the Mn point source. Their modeled residential Mn-Air estimate ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 96 μg/m(3) and was on average 0. 18 μg/m(3). The group means of MnB were similar for the Mn-exposed (9. 65 μg/L) and comparison (9. 48 μg/L) participants. The Marietta group reported more generalized anxiety on the Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R) than the comparison group (p= 0. 035). Generalized anxiety in Marietta was related to a cumulative exposure index (p= 0. 002), based on modeled Mn-Air concentration and length of residence. Higher generalized anxiety scores were related to poorer performance on UPDRS tests [adjusted relative risk (95 %CI) : 2. 18 (1. 46 - 3. 25) for motor-related activities of daily living, 3. 44 (1. 48 - 7. 98) for bradykinesia, and 1. 63 (1. 06 - 2. 53) for motor/movement]. Group differences in SCL- 90 -R generalized anxiety between the two towns and the observed relationship between exposure indices and generalized anxiety suggest an association between environmental Mn exposure and anxiety states. Whether this association is due to direct neurotoxic effects of Mn-Air or concern about the health effects of air pollution remains an open question. The results highlight the importance of measuring anxiety in relation to neuropsychological and <b>neurological</b> <b>endpoints,</b> and should be validated in other studies of Mn-exposed communities...|$|R
40|$|About 50 % {{of humans}} with aneurysmal subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} (SAH) die and many survivors have neurological and neurobehavioral dysfunction. Animal studies usually focused on cerebral vasospasm and sometimes neuronal injury. The difference in endpoints {{may contribute to}} lack of translation of treatments effective in animals to humans. We reviewed prior animal studies of SAH to determine what <b>neurological</b> and neurobehavioral <b>endpoints</b> had been used, whether they differentiated between appropriate controls and animals with SAH, whether treatment effects were reported and whether they correlated with vasospasm.

40|$|Effective {{treatment}} after cervical {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) is imperative as so many {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) are dependent on functional recovery of arm and hand actions. We focus on defining and comparing <b>neurological</b> and functional <b>endpoints</b> that might be used during acute or subacute Phase 2 clinical trials involving subjects with cervical sensorimotor complete SCI (ASIA Impairment Scale [AIS-A]). For the purposes of this review, the trial would examine the effects of a pharmaceutical small molecule, drug, biologic, or cell transplant on spinal tissue. Thus, neurological improvement is the intended consequence and is most directly measured by assessing neurological impairment (eg, motor aspects of the International Standards Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury [ISNCSCI]). However, changes in neurological function, even if statistically significant, may not be associated with a clear functional impact (ie, a meaningful improvement in individual activity, such as independent self-care ADLs). The challenge is to measure improvement as precisely as possible (change in impairment), but to define a clinically meaningful response in the context of functional improvement (impact on activity limitations). The principal comparisons focused on elements of the ISNCSCI assessment, including upper extremity motor score and motor level. Personal activity capabilities were also examined at various time points. The data suggest that an improvement of 2 or more motor levels after cervical sensorimotor complete SCI may be a clinically meaningful endpoint threshold {{that could be used for}} acute and subacute Phase 2 trials with subjects having sensorimotor complete cervical SCI...|$|R
40|$|Background: Disease flares of {{established}} atopic dermatitis (AD) are generally {{associated with a}} low-diversity skin microbiota and Staphylococcus aureus dominance. The temporal transition of the skin microbiome between early infancy and the dysbiosis {{of established}} AD is unknown. Methods: We randomly selected 50 children from the Cork Babies After SCOPE: Evaluating the Longitudinal Impact Using <b>Neurological</b> and Nutritional <b>Endpoints</b> (BASELINE) longitudinal birth cohort for microbiome sampling at 3 {{points in the first}} 6 months of life at 4 skin sites relevant to AD: the antecubital and popliteal fossae, nasal tip, and cheek. We identified 10 infants with AD and compared them with 10 randomly selected control infants with no AD. We performed bacterial 16 S ribosomal RNA sequencing and analysis directly from clinical samples. Results: Bacterial community structures and diversity shifted over time, suggesting that age strongly affects the skin microbiome in infants. Unlike established AD, these patients with infantile AD did not have noticeably dysbiotic communities before or with disease and were not colonized by S aureus. In comparing patients and control subjects, infants who had affected skin at month 12 had statistically significant differences in bacterial communities on the antecubital fossa at month 2 compared with infants who were unaffected at month 12. In particular, commensal staphylococci were significantly less abundant in infants affected at month 12, suggesting that this genus might protect against the later development of AD. Conclusions: This study suggests that 12 -month-old infants with AD were not colonized with S aureus before having AD. Additional studies are needed to confirm whether colonization with commensal staphylococci modulates skin immunity and attenuates development of AD...|$|R
40|$|Infants {{and young}} {{children}} are at particular risk of iron deficiency and its associated consequences for growth and development. The main objectives of this thesis were to quantify iron intakes, status and determinants of status in two year olds; explore determinants of neonatal iron stores; investigate associations between iron status at birth and two years with neurodevelopmental outcomes at two years and {{explore the influence of}} growth on iron status in early childhood, using data from the Cork BASELINE (Babies after SCOPE: Evaluating Longitudinal Impact using <b>Neurological</b> and Nutritional <b>Endpoints)</b> Birth Cohort Study (n= 2137). Participants were followed prospectively with interviewer-led questionnaires and clinical assessments at day 2 and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months. At two years, there was a low prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in this cohort, representing the largest study of iron status in toddlers in Europe, to date. The increased consumption of iron-fortified products and compliance with recommendations to limit unmodified cows’ milk intakes in toddlers has contributed to the observed improvements in status. Low serum ferritin concentrations at birth, which reflect neonatal iron stores, were shown to track through to two years of age; delivery by Caesarean section, being born small-for-gestational age and maternal obesity and smoking in pregnancy were all associated with significantly lower neonatal iron stores. Despite a low prevalence of iron deficiency in this cohort, both a mean corpuscular volume < 74 fl and ferritin concentrations < 20 μg/l were associated with lower neurodevelopmental outcomes at two years. An inverse association between growth in the second year of life and iron status at two years was also observed. This thesis has presented data from one of the largest, extensively-characterised cohorts of young children, to date, to explore iron and its associations with growth and development...|$|R
40|$|Eczema {{prevalence}} rates among Irish infants are unreported, despite eczema {{being the most}} common inflammatory condition of infancy. Maternal and infant nutritional status including vitamin D and other fat-soluble vitamins as well as early infant feeding have been linked with eczema initiation and development. Therefore, early nutrition could be a potential modifiable risk factor. The objective of this thesis was to prospectively describe early infant feeding and complementary feeding practices, to evaluate infant vitamin D supplementation practice, to quantify cord serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] and propose reference intervals for vitamin D metabolites, to report eczema prevalence and explore the potential role of infant nutrition and eczema. These research needs were investigated through the Cork BASELINE (Babies After SCOPE: Evaluating the Longitudinal Impact with <b>Neurological</b> and Nutritional <b>Endpoints)</b> Birth Cohort Study (n 2137). This thesis was the first comprehensive report from the birth cohort, therefore {{it was important to}} describe the cohort sociodemographic profile. Although socio-demographic characteristics compared well with national data, there was an over-representation of educated mothers which may limit the generalizability of the results. From August 2008 through November 2011, comprehensive postnatal assessments were completed at day 2 and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months. Breastfeeding rates were low, while complementary feeding practices were broadly compliant with national guidelines. The implementation of a national infant vitamin D supplementation policy had a major impact on supplementation practice. Low levels of serum 25 (OH) D were universal among Irish neonates. Eczema is a complex and multifaceted disease, which is increasing globally. This was the first report of eczema prevalence data among Irish infants which compared with international reports. Given the high prevalence and considerable burden eczema has on the lives of sufferers, intensive research efforts to identify a cause and therapeutic strategies to prevent/reduce eczema was re-emphasized in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{presented}} in two parts. Data for this research is from the Cork BASELINE (Babies after SCOPE, Evaluating Longitudinal Impact using <b>Neurological</b> and Nutritional <b>Endpoints)</b> Birth Cohort Study (n = 2137). In this prospective birth cohort study, pediatric follow-up with in-person appointments were repeated from the time of birth through to 2, 6 and 12 months, and at 2 years. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography at birth and at 2 months using the PEA POD Infant Body Composition Tracking System. This thesis provides the first extensive report on the study’s 2 year assessment. In part one, the aims were to investigate potential early-life risk factors for childhood overweight and obesity, including rapid growth and body composition in infancy and umbilical cord concentrations of leptin and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin. This research is the first to describe rapid growth in early infancy in terms of changes in direct measures of body composition. These are also the first data to examine associations between umbilical cord leptin and HMW adiponectin concentrations and changes in fat and lean mass in early infancy. These data provide additional insight into characterising the growth trajectory in infancy and into the role of perinatal factors in determining infant growth and subsequent overweight/obesity risk. In part two of this thesis, the aims were to quantify vitamin D intake and status at 2 years and to investigate whether 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] concentrations in early pregnancy and in umbilical cord blood are associated with infant growth and body composition. There was a low prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Irish 2 year olds (n = 742) despite a high prevalence of inadequate intakes and high latitude (51 °N). Maternal 25 (OH) D concentrations at 15 weeks gestation and cord 25 (OH) D concentrations at delivery were not associated with infant growth or adiposity...|$|R
40|$|Fe {{deficiency}} {{in early childhood}} is associated with long-term consequences for cognitive, motor and behavioural development; however explorations in healthy children from low risk, high-resource settings have been limited. We aimed to explore associations between Fe status and neurodevelopmental outcomes in low risk, healthy 2 -year-olds. This study was a secondary analysis of a nested case–control subgroup from the prospective, maternal-infant Cork Babies after Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints: Evaluating the Longitudinal Impact using <b>Neurological</b> and Nutritional <b>Endpoints</b> (BASELINE) Birth Cohort Study. At 2 years, serum ferritin, Hb and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) were measured and neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (n 87). Five children had Fe deficiency (ferritin < 12 µg/l) and no child had Fe deficiency anaemia (Hb< 110 g/l+ferritin< 12 µg/l). Children with microcytosis (MCV< 74 fl, n 13) had significantly lower mean cognitive composite scores (88 · 5 (sd 13 · 3) v. 97 · 0 (sd 7 · 8), P= 0 · 04, Cohen’s d effect size= 0 · 8) than those without microcytosis. The ferritin concentration which best predicted microcytosis was calculated as 18 · 4 µg/l (AUC= 0 · 87 (95 % CI 0 · 75, 0 · 98), P< 0 · 0001, sensitivity 92 %, specificity 75 %). Using 18 · 5 µg/l as a threshold, children with concentrations < 18 · 5 µg/l had significantly lower mean cognitive composite scores (92 · 3 (sd 10 · 5) v. 97 · 8 (sd 8 · 1), P= 0 · 012, Cohen’s d effect size= 0 · 6) compared with those with ferritin ≥ 18 · 5 µg/l. All associations were robust after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Despite a low prevalence of Fe deficiency using current diagnostic criteria in this healthy cohort, microcytosis was associated with lower cognitive outcomes at 2 years. This exploratory study emphasises the need for re-evaluation of the diagnostic criteria for Fe {{deficiency in}} young children, with further research in adequately powered studies warranted...|$|R

40|$|Loss-of-function {{mutations}} {{in the skin}} barrier protein filaggrin (FLG) are a major risk for atopic dermatitis (AD). The pathogenic sequence of disturbances in skin barrier function before or during the early development of AD is not fully understood. A more detailed understanding of these events is needed to develop {{a clearer picture of}} disease pathogenesis. A robust, noninvasive test to identify babies at high risk of AD would be important in planning early intervention and/or prevention studies. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain whether a noninvasive measurement of skin barrier function at day 2 after birth and at 2 months predicts the development of AD at 1 year. Furthermore, to determine whether increases in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) predate the development of clinical AD. METHODS: A total of 1903 infants were enrolled in the Cork Babies After Scope: Evaluating the Longitudinal Impact Using <b>Neurological</b> and Nutritional <b>Endpoints</b> Birth Cohort study from July 2009 to October 2011. Measurements of TEWL were made at birth (day 2) and at 2 and 6 months. The presence of AD was ascertained at 6 and 12 months, and disease severity was assessed by using the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis clinical tool at 6 months and by using both the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis clinical tool and Nottingham Severity Score at 12 months. A total of 1300 infants were genotyped for FLG mutations. RESULTS: At 6 months, 18. 7 % of the children had AD, and at 12 months, 15. 53 %. In a logistic regression model, day 2 upper quartile TEWL measurement was significantly predictive of AD at 12 months (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0. 81; P <. 05). Lowest quartile day 2 TEWL was protective against AD at 12 months.

40|$|Background: Only 2 - 5 % of {{patients}} who have a stroke receive thrombolytic treatment, mainly because of delay in reaching the hospital. We aimed to assess the efficacy of a new approach of diagnosis and treatment starting at the emergency site, rather than after hospital arrival, in reducing delay in stroke therapy. Methods: We did a randomised single-centre controlled trial to compare the time from alarm (emergency call) to therapy decision between mobile stroke unit (MSU) and hospital intervention. For inclusion in our study patients needed to be aged 18 - 80 years and have one or more stroke symptoms that started within the previous 2 · 5 h. In accordance with our week-wise randomisation plan, patients received either prehospital stroke treatment in a specialised ambulance (equipped with a CT scanner, point-of-care laboratory, and telemedicine connection) or optimised conventional hospital-based stroke treatment (control group) with a 7 day follow-up. Allocation was not masked from patients and investigators. Our primary endpoint was time from alarm to therapy decision, which was analysed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Our secondary endpoints included times from alarm to end of CT and to end of laboratory analysis, number {{of patients}} receiving intravenous thrombolysis, time from alarm to intravenous thrombolysis, and neurological outcome. We also assessed safety endpoints. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00153036. Findings: We stopped the trial after our planned interim analysis at 100 of 200 planned patients (53 in the prehospital stroke treatment group, 47 in the control group), because we had met our prespecified criteria for study termination. Prehospital stroke treatment reduced the median time from alarm to therapy decision substantially: 35 min (IQR 31 - 39) versus 76 min (63 - 94), p< 0 · 0001; median difference 41 min (95 % CI 36 - 48 min). We also detected similar gains regarding times from alarm to end of CT, and alarm to end of laboratory analysis, and to intravenous thrombolysis for eligible ischaemic stroke patients, {{although there was no}} substantial difference in number {{of patients who}} received intravenous thrombolysis or in <b>neurological</b> outcome. Safety <b>endpoints</b> seemed similar across the groups. Interpretation: For patients with suspected stroke, treatment by the MSU substantially reduced median time from alarm to therapy decision. The MSU strategy offers a potential solution to the medical problem of the arrival of most stroke patients at the hospital too late for treatment.
