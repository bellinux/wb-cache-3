5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore {{less important than the}} risk of having an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The France's 1971-1974 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 24 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1971-1974. These tests followed the 1966-70 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1975-78 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R
50|$|The France's 1975-1978 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 29 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1975-1978. These tests followed the 1971-74 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1979-80 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R
50|$|The France's 1979-1980 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 22 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1979-1980. These tests followed the 1975-78 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1981-82 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R
5|$|Following the McClelland Royal Commission, a large {{clean-up}} {{was completed}} in outback South Australia in 2000, after <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> at Maralinga during the 1950s contaminated the region. The cleanup lasted three years, and cost over A$100million, but there was controversy over the methods used and success of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear weapons testing, {{uranium mining}} and export, {{and nuclear power}} have often {{been the subject of}} public debate in Australia, and the anti-nuclear {{movement}} in Australia has a long history. Its origins date back to the 1972–73 debate over French <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> in the Pacific and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> in the Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice {{in a case}} launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E
50|$|The France's 1983-1985 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 25 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1983-1985. These tests followed the 1981-82 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1986-88 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R
50|$|The 1986-1988 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> were a {{group of}} 24 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} between 1986 and 1988. These tests followed the 1983-85 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1989-91 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Union's 1953 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 5 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1953. These tests followed the 1949-51 Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1954 Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Bethe {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, though he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).|$|E
5|$|Fallout from {{atmospheric}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> {{prior to}} 1980 contributed {{a small amount}} of californium to the environment. Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye premiered on 13 November 1995, at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City, {{and went}} on general release in the USA on 17 November 1995. The UK premiere, {{attended}} by Prince Charles, followed on 22 November at the Odeon Leicester Square, with general release two days later. Brosnan boycotted the French premiere to support Greenpeace's protest against the French <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> program.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Union's 1964 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 9 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1964. These tests followed the 1962 Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1965 Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R
50|$|The France's 1966-1970 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 22 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1966-1970. These tests followed the In Ekker series, French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1971-74 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Union's 1961 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 57 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1961. These tests followed the 1958 Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the Soviet Project K <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R
5|$|In 1956, Christy {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{scientists}} from Caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty that Christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects. He worked with Freeman Dyson on Project Orion, the design of a spacecraft propelled by atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|In spite {{or perhaps}} because of his role in these nuclear tests, Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Gorbachev came {{to power}} in the Soviet Union on March 11, 1985, and the next day {{negotiations}} on nuclear and space-based weapons began in Geneva. A few weeks later, he proposed a moratorium on the development of nuclear and space weapons during the period of negotiations, and in July, he proposed to ban <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> Reagan rejected the proposals.|$|E
5000|$|The Soviet Union's 1965 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 14 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1965. These tests [...] followed the 1964 Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1966 Soviet <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R

5|$|Seaborg {{enjoyed a}} close {{relationship}} with President Lyndon Johnson and influenced the administration to pursue the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Seaborg was called to the White House {{in the first week of}} the Nixon Administration in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the Soviets and <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser John Ehrlichman over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, Zalman Shapiro, whom the Nixon administration suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel.|$|E
5|$|The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with nuclear materials have also featured prominently in Australian anti-nuclear campaigns. This {{has been the case}} worldwide because of accidents like the Chernobyl disaster, but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over the health effects of <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> in Australia and the South Pacific, and the emergence of prominent anti-nuclear campaigners Helen Caldicott and Tilman Ruff, who are medical practitioners.|$|E
5|$|The series {{predominantly}} {{takes place}} in the benthic underwater city of Bikini Bottom which, according to some third-party sources, is located in the Pacific Ocean beneath the real-life coral reef known as Bikini Atoll. In 2015, Tom Kenny confirmed that the fictitious city was named after Bikini Atoll, but denied an Internet fan theory that connected the series' characters to actual <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> that occurred in the atoll.|$|E
50|$|The France's Reggane <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> {{series was}} a group of 4 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} in 1960-1961. These tests preceded the In Ekker series, French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the 1950s, Bainbridge {{remained}} an outspoken proponent {{of civilian control}} of nuclear power and the abandonment of <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> In 1950 {{he was one of}} twelve prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the hydrogen bomb. Bainbridge retired from Harvard in 1975.|$|E
5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Libby {{accepted}} professorship at the University of Chicago's Institute for Nuclear Studies, {{where he}} developed the technique for dating organic compounds using carbon-14. He also discovered that tritium similarly {{could be used for}} dating water, and therefore wine. In 1950, he {{became a member of the}} General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He was appointed a commissioner in 1954, becoming its sole scientist. He sided with Edward Teller on pursuing a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, participated in the Atoms for Peace program, and defended the administration's atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|E
