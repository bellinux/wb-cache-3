5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness.

Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and <b>neurological</b> <b>disease.</b> A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases</b> and disorders remains mostly unknown. Neuroinflammation {{has been}} proposed as a causative factor for <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases.</b> The confirmation that neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain and neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in the adult central nervous system (CNS) of mammals has tremendous implications for {{our understanding of the}} physio- and pathology of the nervous system. The generation of newborn neuronal cells in the adult brain is modulated in <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases</b> and during inflammation. This suggests that adult neurogenesis is involved in the pathogenesis of <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases</b> and disorders, particularly during neuroinflammation. In this manuscript, we will review the modulation of adult neurogenesis in <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases</b> and during neuroinflammation.

40|$|Based upon a {{thorough}} review of published clinical observations regarding the inhibitory system, I hypothesize that this system {{may play a}} key role in the pathogenesis of a variety of neuromuscular and <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases.</b> Specifically, excitatory overstimulation, which is commonly reported in neuromuscular and <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases,</b> may be a homeostatic response to inhibitory overstimulation.

40|$|Historically, small {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (sHSPs) have been extensively {{studied in the}} context of being intracellular molecular chaperones. However, recent studies looking at the role of sHSPs in <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases</b> have demonstrated a near universal upregulation of certain sHSPs in damaged and diseased brains. Initially, it was thought that sHSPs are pathological in these disease states because they are found in the areas of damage. However, transgenic overexpression and exogenous administration of sHSPs in various experimental disease paradigms have shown just the contrary – that sHSPs are protective, not pathological. This review examines sHSPs in <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases</b> and highlights the potential for using these neuroprotective sHSPs as novel therapeutics. It first addresses the endogenous expression of sHSPs in a variety of neurological disorders. Although many studies have examined the expression of sHSPs in <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases,</b> there are no review articles summarizing these data. Furthermore, it focuses on recent studies that have investigated the therapeutic potential of sHSPs for <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases.</b> Finally, it will explain what we think is the function of endogenous sHSPs in <b>neurological</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

25|$|Epilepsy is {{a common}} <b>neurological</b> <b>disease</b> that is {{characterized}} by recurrent and sometimes untreatable seizures. Several clinical and experimental data have implicated the failure of blood–brain barrier function in triggering chronic or acute seizures. Some studies implicate the interactions between a common blood protein (albumin) and astrocytes. These findings suggest that acute seizures are a predictable consequence of disruption of the BBB by either artificial or inflammatory mechanisms. In addition, expression of drug resistance molecules and transporters at the BBB are a significant mechanism of resistance to commonly used anti-epileptic drugs.|$|E

25|$|Myoclonus {{is defined}} as a {{sequence}} of repeated, often nonrhythmic, brief, shock-like jerks due to sudden involuntary contraction or relaxation of one or more muscles. These movements may be asynchronous, in which several muscles contract variably in time, synchronous, in which muscles contract simultaneously, or spreading, in which several muscles contract sequentially. It is characterized by a sudden, unidirectional movement due to muscle contraction, followed by a relaxation period in which the muscle is no longer contracted. However, when this relaxation phase is decreased, as when muscle contractions become faster, a myoclonic tremor results. Myoclonus can often be associated with seizures, delirium, dementia, and other signs of <b>neurological</b> <b>disease</b> and gray matter damage.|$|E

25|$|Inflammation in {{the body}} may lead to effects on the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During {{systemic}} inflammation, whether {{in the form of}} infection or sterile inflammation, the BBB may undergo changes which may be disruptive or non-disruptive.

These BBB changes likely {{play a role in the}} generation of sickness behaviour during systemic infection (why we feel 'unwell' when we have an infection). These changes may also induce or accelerate disease within the brain, for example in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and may be part of the reason why patients with these conditions can deteriorate during an infection. Also, in patients with <b>neurological</b> <b>disease</b> the BBB may be abnormally sensitive to the effects of systemic inflammation.|$|E
