5|$|The Senate, now {{alarmed at}} the {{apparently}} unstoppable rebellion occurring within Italy, gave {{the task of}} putting down the rebellion to Marcus Licinius Crassus. Crassus was <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> to Roman politics, or to military command {{as he had been}} a field commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the second civil war between Sulla and the Marian faction in 82 BC, and had served under Sulla during the dictatorship that followed.|$|E
5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois {{to believe it}} to be strange. Peter then states that it is <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> than when Darth Vader from the film {{franchise}} Star Wars was a parking attendant. Vader is then shown in the contemporary world as a failure, and making minimum wage. This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright. After Stewie takes over Brian's radio show, the two begin playing random sound clips from various films and television shows, including dialogue from the 1993 drama film Philadelphia, which was acknowledged as a mistake by Stewie.|$|E

5|$|Jolin, {{as well as}} Dardel, used a naïve {{style in}} their {{paintings}} before this concept had been introduced into the Swedish art world. Both Jolin and Dardel were inspired by French naïvists, not just by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but also by Séraphine Louis who lived in Sentis and Wilhelm Uhde, a specialist in naïve painting. Matisse, Jolin's and Dardel's mentor, was <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> to naïve art {{but it was not}} prominent in his work. Jolin also appreciated the cultivated and sophisticated, older painting, and was deeply impressed during his visits to the Louvre, where he was inspired by the works of masters such as Rubens, Watteau and Chardin.|$|E
5|$|Near the Canadian {{side of the}} {{restored}} trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins MBE. Watkins was head of Explosive Ordnance Disposal at the Directorate of Land Service Ammunition, Royal Logistic Corps, and a leading British explosive ordnance disposal expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British tunnel system {{on the grounds of}} the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins was <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> to the tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated ammonal explosives located under a road intersection on the site.|$|E
5|$|While {{he worked}} {{extensively}} {{in the tradition of}} earlier Renaissance polyphony, such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the basso continuo technique, distinctive of the Baroque. <b>No</b> <b>stranger</b> to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a seconda pratica, contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the prima pratica. Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.|$|E

5|$|Chris Boucher {{began his}} {{television}} writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as Dave Allen at Large and Romany Jones, {{before moving on}} to write for drama series, including Shoestring, Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. He was <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> to television science fiction, having written three serials for Doctor Who and having acted as script editor on the entire four season run of Blake's 7 as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched Star Cops to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic Earthsearch serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first Star Cops story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how Star Cops was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor on the crime series Bergerac, was also told by Powell he could work on Star Cops or on Bergerac but not on both and so chose to leave Bergerac.|$|E

25|$|<b>No</b> <b>stranger</b> to controversy, Kiernan {{was accused}} of {{tripping}} his opponents in games, an accusation which was first raised by his own teammates following an interstate game. He fell out with the Fitzroy committee and in 1904 attempted to cross to Collingwood but his request was blocked by VFL delegates. Kiernan instead joined Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Brighton, but made a brief comeback at Fitzroy in 1911.|$|E

The asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates can map onto a Cartesian plane, and should be considered <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> than the manner in which, on a Mercator projection of the Earth, the relative sizes of land masses near the poles (Greenland and Antarctica) are highly exaggerated relative to land masses near the Equator.|$|E

The tornado occurred only 12 hours after an F5 struck Tupelo, Mississippi, killing at least 216 (with others being unaccounted for), making it the fourth deadliest tornado on record including storms before 1950. Another tornado hit Gainesville in 1903 killing at least 100.|$|E

Charles Richard Sharpe was injured in the second incident, but he was <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> to fighting the Germans, having been awarded the Victoria Cross in the first conflict of the century.|$|E
25|$|Hajibeyov was <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> to {{the tragic}} chaos of war; he {{lived through the}} Revolutions of 1905 and 1917, {{the fall of the}} Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan in 1920, and both World Wars. The {{political}} repercussions of these military conquests often manifested in other forms of chaos. For example, between 1920 and 1940, the alphabet systems for writing Azeri were changed three times — from Arabic to Latin, and from Latin to Cyrillic — a process which greatly hindered and interrupted the educational and cultural process and may well {{have been one of the}} factors influencing Uzeyir Hajibeyov to present his ideas verbally on the musical stage.|$|E

The quartet's sixth transcontinental tour of the United States and Canada, announced in late 1917, included two performances in New York City and others in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago.|$|E
