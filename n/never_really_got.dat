Whatever the reasons for this hesitancy, the historical trend in OS reveals a tendency to insist on a distinct epistemological separation of the social/cultural from the technological, and the pursuit of an understanding of how these two realms interact at the organisational and societal level. For well over 100 years, the same mantra has been chanted: culture is concerned with people, agency, and desire whilst technology is to do with all things non-human and mechanical.

25|$|Modigliani's {{connection}} with the movement was through Guglielmo Micheli, his first art teacher. Micheli {{was not only a}} Macchiaiolo himself, but had been a pupil of the famous Giovanni Fattori, a founder of the movement. Micheli's work, however, was so fashionable and the genre so commonplace that the young Modigliani reacted against it, preferring to ignore the obsession with landscape that, as with French Impressionism, characterized the movement. Micheli also tried to encourage his pupils to paint en plein air, but Modigliani <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> a taste for this style of working, sketching in cafés, but preferring to paint indoors, and especially in his own studio. Even when compelled to paint landscapes (three are known to exist), Modigliani chose a proto-Cubist palette more akin to Cézanne than to the Macchiaioli.|$|E

25|$|A {{slow start}} by openers Rajin Saleh and Javed Omar cost the Bangladeshis dearly in this warm-up match against {{a side of}} Sri Lankan fringe players at Moratuwa, along with an {{inability}} to take wickets. The pair added 59 for the first wicket, but <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> off the mark, and when Pradeep Jayaprakashdaran dismissed Omar and Aftab Ahmed in quick succession things looked tricky. The other Bangladeshis were forced to hit out quickly, and two run outs followed as a result. In the end, it was the experienced all-rounders Mohammad Rafique and Khaled Mashud who ensured that Bangladesh set a somewhat competitive target of 236. However, Avishka Gunawardene and Upul Tharanga both made centuries, the Bangladeshi bowlers were thoroughly hit around, and the Sri Lankans {{made their way to}} 236 for 0 in just 36.1 overs of the 50 possible. To add injury to insult, Mashrafe Mortaza suffered a back spasm and was ruled out of the first ODI.|$|E
25|$|As {{the tournament}} moved to Sharjah, Zalmi's first game against Quetta Gladiators was {{abandoned}} after repeated showers {{and the two}} teams shared the points from the bout.

After being put in to bat by United, Zalmi could only manage a below-par score of 137 and <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> going. But the team's bowlers bowled exceedingly well to make a contest out of it. In their final game of the Sharjah leg, the Zalmis continued their losing streak after being beaten by Karachi Kings in a thrilling contest. Setting up a target of 175, the Kings had the Zalmis reduced to 69–6 before Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy combined in a 70-run partnership that almost won the game for the Zalmis.

25|$|However, {{despite the}} good start, 2 {{consecutive}} defeats against Australia at Trent Bridge in Nottingham and the West Indies at The Oval in London followed, {{and with other}} results going Australia's and the West Indies' way, India were once again staring at another early exit from the World Cup. Trevor Chappell scored 110 to ensure that Australia scored a mammoth 320/9, with India dishing out a listless bowling performance. Only Kapil bowled well, taking a 5-wicket haul (5/43). Australian medium-pacer Ken MacLeay took 6/39 as India were bowled all out for just 150, losing by 162 runs, {{with none of the}} Indian batsmen contributing. Against the West Indies, India, chasing 283 to win, <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>got</b> going despite Amarnath's patient knock (80 from 139 balls). A combined effort from the West Indian pace attack saw India crash to 216 all out, losing by 66 runs. To add to India's woes, Vengsarkar was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} tournament after a Malcolm Marshall bouncer injured his jaw. To reach the semifinals now, India had to beat Zimbabwe and Australia by huge margins, a daunting prospect. Should India lose even one of the matches, they would be knocked out of the tournament.|$|E

In these works, Wergeland shows the history of Man and God's plan for humanity. The works are clearly platonic-romantic, and is also based on ideals from the enlightenment and the French revolution. Thus, he criticizes abuse of power, and notably evil priests and their manipulation of people's minds. In the end, his credo goes like this: ...|$|R

India crashed to 227 all out, losing by nine runs, with Dermot Reeve (3/38) taking the most wickets for England. Three of India's batsmen: Shastri, Pravin Amre and Kiran More: were run out. India's next match against Sri Lanka at Mackay was {{abandoned}} due to rain after just 2 balls and a run scored by Srikkanth, giving India its first points {{in the tournament}}. India then played co-hosts and defending champions Australia at Brisbane. The match was a thriller. Australia scored 237/9 in its 50 overs, with Dean Jones scoring 90. Kapil and Prabhakar were the pick of the bowlers with identical figures of 3/41. Due to rain, India's target was revised to 235 and the overs reduced to 47. Azharuddin led India's reply with a near-century (93 from 102 balls, 10 fours), {{but the rest of}} India's batsmen were unable to cross 50 and with Prabhakar (1 from 1 ball) and Raju (0 from 1 ball) run out in successive balls, India crashed to 234 all out in the second-last ball of the innings, ensuring that Australia scraped to victory by 1 run.|$|E

500|$|With a game engine already assembled, {{the team}} began honing the concept. Bungie was {{interested}} in bringing changes to the classical Halo format which had remained essentially unchanged over three games. The developers spent weeks considering which characters they wanted to focus on.

In 1980 they released their third album, Hotspell, on their own Red Rock Records label. This album had a soft-rock style, with sophisticated arrangements and featured keyboards. It failed to chart, and the group permanently disbanded in 1981. Although Ayers Rock's first two albums were successful in Australia, none of their six singles charted. During their early years (from 1973 to 1976), the group were praised by local media for their music, stylistic diversity, use of technology, and the energy of their live performances. Ayers Rock received positive reviews in Billboard and Cashbox. Late-1990s music historians recognised the band's talent but considered their music over-indulgent at times, failing {{to bridge the gap}} between artistic and commercial success.
