40|$|Despite growing {{recognition}} that mineral sites restored for nature conservation can enhance local biodiversity, the wider societal benefits provided by {{this type of}} restoration relative to alternative options are not well understood. This study addresses this research gap by quantifying differences in ecosystem services provision under two common mineral site after-uses: nature conservation and agriculture. Using a combination of site-specific primary field data, benefits transfer and modelling, we show that for our sites restoration for nature conservation provides a more diverse array of ecosystem services than would be delivered under an agricultural restoration scenario. We also explore the effects of addressing different conservation targets, which we find alter the provision of ecosystem services on a service-specific basis. Highly species-focused intervention areas are associated with increased carbon storage and livestock grazing provision, whereas <b>non-intervention</b> <b>areas</b> are important for carbon sequestration, fishing, recreation and flood risk mitigation. The {{results of this study}} highlight the wider societal importance of restored mineral sites and may help conservation managers and planners to develop future restoration strategies that provide benefits for both biodiversity and human well-being...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sought to}} {{determine}} the safety and feasibility of home-based prophylaxis of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) with misoprostol, including assessment {{of the need for}} referrals and additional interventions. In rural Tigray, Ethiopia, traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in intervention areas were trained to administer 600 mcg of oral misoprostol. In <b>non-intervention</b> <b>areas</b> women were referred to the nearest health facility. Of the 966 vaginal deliveries attended by TBAs, only 8. 9 % of those who took misoprostol prophylactically (n= 485) needed additional intervention due to excessive bleeding compared to 18. 9 % of those who did not take misoprostol (n= 481). The experience of symptoms among those who used misoprostol can be considered of minor relevance and self-contained. This study found that prophylactic use of misoprostol in home births is a safe and feasible intervention. Community health care workers trained in its use can correctly and effectively administer misoprostol and be a champion in reducing PPH morbidity and mortality (Afr J Reprod Health 2009; 13 [2]: 87 - 95) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Schistosoma mansoni {{infection}} is a persistent {{public health problem}} in many Kenyan communities. Although praziquantel is available, re-infection after chemotherapy treatment is inevitable, especially among children. Chemotherapy followed by intermittent mollusciciding of habitats of Biomphalaria pfeifferi, the intermediate host snail, may have longer term benefits, especially if timed to coincide with natural fluctuations in snail populations. Methods: In this cohort study, the Kambu River (Intervention area) was molluscicided intermittently for 4 years, after mass chemotherapy with praziquantel in the adjacent community of Darajani in January 1997. The nearby Thange River was selected as a control (<b>Non-intervention</b> <b>area),</b> and its adjacent community of Ulilinzi was treated with praziquantel in December 1996. Snail numbers were recorded monthly at 9 – 10 sites along each river, while rainfall data were collected monthly, and annual parasitological surveys were undertaken in each village. The mollusciciding protocol was adapted to local conditions, and simplified to improve prospects for widespread application. Results: After the initial reduction in prevalence attributable to chemotherapy, there was a gradual increase in the prevalence and intensity of infection in the <b>non-intervention</b> <b>area,</b> and significantly lower levels of re-infection amongst inhabitants of the intervention area. Incidence ratio between areas adjusted for age and gender at the first follow-up survey, 5 weeks after treatment in the <b>non-intervention</b> <b>area</b> and 4 months after treatment in the intervention area was not significant (few people turned positive), while during the following 4 annual surveys these ratios were 0. 58 (0. 39 - 0. 85), 0. 33 (0. 18 - 0. 60), 0. 14 (0. 09 - 0. 21) and 0. 45 (0. 26 - 0. 75), respectively. Snail numbers were consistently low in the intervention area {{as a result of}} the mollusciciding. Following termination of the mollusciciding at the end of 2000, snail populations and infections in snails increased again in the intervention area. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that in the Kenyan setting a combination of chemotherapy followed by intermittent mollusciciding can have longer term benefits than chemotherapy alone...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, {{originates}} {{from the}} tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. Over the recent decades {{it has been}} passively spread across the globe, primarily through the used tyre trade and passive transportation along major traffic routes. A. albopictus is a proven vector for many arboviruses, most notably chikungunya and dengue, with recent outbreaks also in continental Europe. In southern Switzerland, in the Canton of Ticino A. albopictus was spotted {{for the first time}} in 2003. Since then the local authorities have implemented a control programme based on larval source reduction. Despite these efforts, mosquito densities have increased over the last decade, casting doubts on the effectiveness of such larval control programmes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Italian communities just across the Swiss-Italian border lack a control programme. This motivated us to compare the intervention and the <b>non-intervention</b> <b>areas</b> side by side in an attempt to find evidence for, or against, the effectiveness of larval A. albopictus control. Using ovitraps and a randomised sampling scheme, we examined the seasonal and spatial abundance of A. albopictus in sylvatic and urban environments across the Swiss-Italian border in 2012 and 2013.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} documents the adverse relationship between concentrated deprivation and health. Among the evaluations of regeneration initiatives to tackle these spatial inequalities, few have traced the trajectories of individuals over time and fewer still have employed counterfactual comparison. We investigate the impact of one such initiative in England, the New Deal for Communities (NDC), which ran from 1999 to 2011, on socioeconomic inequalities in health trajectories. METHODS: Latent Growth Curve modelling of within-person changes in self-rated health, mental health and life satisfaction between 2002 and 2008 of an analytical cohort of residents of 39 disadvantaged areas of England in which the NDC was implemented, compared with residents of comparator, <b>non-intervention</b> <b>areas,</b> focusing on: (1) whether differences over time in outcomes can be detected between NDC and comparator areas and (2) whether interventions may have altered socioeconomic differences in outcomes. RESULTS: No evidence was found for an overall improvement in the three outcomes, or for significant differences in changes in health between respondents in NDC versus comparator areas. However, we found a weakly significant gap in life satisfaction and mental health {{between high and low}} socioeconomic status individuals in comparator areas which widened over time {{to a greater extent than}} in NDC areas. Change over time in the three outcomes was non-linear: individual improvements among NDC residents were largest before 2006.

40|$|Background: Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS) is a simple, {{inexpensive}} and sustainable means of daily household treatment for drinking and storage of water. Globally, over {{a billion people}} lack access to safe drinking water. As many as half million under five children die annually due to diarrheal illnesses.

Systematic reviews indicate that interventions to improve the microbial quality of drinking water in households are effective at reducing diarrhoea illnesses and thereby contribute significantly in reducing deaths due to communicable diseases in children under 5 years. We evaluated the impact of the SODIS intervention on health outcomes and diarrheal episodes in two districts of Punjab province in Pakistan. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken to assess the impact of solar water disinfection (SODIS) program in two districts of Punjab province, Pakistan. The program was implemented by the Ministry of Health from April 2010 - May 2011 in Faisalabad district. We selected Toba Tek Singh as a comparison district for the survey. Results: Analysis with regression models revealed that children had a lower risk of contracting diarrhoea when they consumed high percentages of safe drinks (SODIS), lived in households with good hygiene, washed hands, and belonged to the richest quintile. Diarrhoea prevalence was 10. 1 episodes per child per year in the <b>non-intervention</b> <b>area</b> compared to 5. 6 episodes per child per year (3 ̆c 0. 0001) in the intervention area.

40|$|Introduction: Water and {{sanitation}} interventions were {{delivered in the}} northern areas of Pakistan as a joint venture of the Aga Khan University and the Aga Khan Health Systems Oshikhandass Diarrhea and Dysentery Project (1989 - 96) followed by the Aga Khan Water, Sanitation, Health and Hygiene Studies Program (WSHHSP). Through these interventions water treatment plants, new pit latrines along with a component of health education were introduced. Objectives: To explore perceptions, knowledge and practices of inhabitants of Oshikhandass village in Gilgit related to water quality, latrine use and hand washing following the intervention. Methods: Through a cross-sectional study during June-July 2012, six focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in various sectors of Oshikhandass supplied by filtered water (intervention area), piped water and mixed water (piped and channel water). The latter two were designated as the non- intervention areas. Participants included mothers (3 FGDs, 26 participants), LHWs (1 FGD, 5 participants) and youth (2 FGDs, 9 participants each). Results: Irrespective of health education by LHWs, residents of both intervention and non- intervention communities had learnt about proper hygienic practices from daily life experiences, parents, teachers and media. LHWs role at best had been that of a positive reinforcement. Despite uniformly good awareness, intervention communities still had relatively better health and hygiene knowledge and practices as compared to <b>non-intervention</b> <b>areas.</b> Conventional practices of water purification such as using gulk as domestic filter cum refrigerator was prevalent.

40|$|Smallholder {{producers}} in marginal and semiarid areas of eastern Kenya have not benefited greatly from research investments made in improvement of crops grown in such environments (sorghum, millet, and legumes, including pigeonpea) {{either by the}} international community or the national agricultural research system because of poorly developed seed systems. However, informal and local market purchases are the major sources of seed for non-maize cereals and legumes. In the absence of any formalized seed system for dryland crops, more and more farmers rely on local markets to supply seed during normal and disaster periods. We determined the factors affecting the quantities of pigeonpea traded by vendors during the 2006 short-rains season using simple OLS estimation. We found that the participation of traders and farmers was higher and traded larger quantities of pigeonpea in weekly markets located in areas where seed-based intervention programs in place than in <b>non-intervention</b> <b>areas.</b> Also agro-ecologically, markets located in slightly wetter regions offered more varieties and handled higher sales compared with marketsheds in dry regions. Among the traders, the grain traders dominated through their sheer volume of sales, higher investment, and storage capacity in these markets though the distinction between seeds and grains was poor. Of the vendor characteristics, young, educated vendors traded higher quantities of pigeonpea during the planting season. The amount of time spent selling by different vendors in the village fairs also had a significant influence on the pigeonpea quantity traded. Certain market infrastructure variables such as distance to the local markets and the access to information sources (mobile phones) also significantly influenced the amount of pigeonpea sold among vendors in these markets. The existing pigeonpea value chain in local markets could be improved further, provided proper synergies exist between different actors in the system. This would enhance local crop diversity levels as well as improve access to quality plant materials for farming communities in the marginal environments of eastern Kenya.

BRAC is the largest non-governmental organisation in Bangladesh. BRAC has been working to reduce maternal, neonatal and under-five children morbidity and mortality of slum dwellers in cities. BRAC has been doing this work for a decade through a programme called MANOSHI. This programme provides door-to-door services to its beneficiaries through community health workers (CHWs) and normal delivery service through its delivery and maternity centres. BRAC started the 'MANOSHI' programme in Narayanganj City Corporation during 2011 to address maternal, neonatal and child health problems facing slum dwellers. We investigated the existing maternal health-service indicators in the slums of Narayanganj City Corporation and compared the findings with a <b>non-intervention</b> <b>area.</b> This cross-sectional study was conducted during 2012, in 47 slums of Narayanganj City Corporation as intervention and 10 slums of Narsingdi Sadar Municipality as comparison area.

Data on socio-demographic characteristics, reproductive and maternal health-care practices like use of contraceptive methods, antenatal care (ANC), delivery care, postnatal care (PNC) were collected through a structured questionnaire. The chi-square test, Student t test, Mann Whitney U-test, factor analysis and log-binominal test were performed by using STATA statistical software for analysing data. The activities of BRAC CHWs significantly improved four or more ANC (47 % vs. 21 %; p< 0. 000) and PNC (48 % vs. 39 %; p< 0. 01) coverage in the intervention slums compared to comparison slums.

Water, sanitation and hygiene related activities were significantly improved after the intervention period in the intervention woredas (P< 0. 05). There was a significant reduction of active trachoma prevalence between the baseline and after the intervention period in the intervention woredas, but not in the non-intervention ones. Improved water, sanitation and hygiene interventions contributed to the reduction of active trachoma. However, the magnitude of active trachoma prevalence observed after the intervention is still very high in the studied areas of North and South Wollo Zones communities. To achieve the global trachoma elimination target by the year 2020 as set by the WHO, continued WaSH interventions and periodic monitoring, evaluation and reporting of the impact of WaSH on active trachoma is warranted...|$|R
