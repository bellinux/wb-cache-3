Modern English translations of both Napier's books on logarithms and their description {{can be found on}} the web, as well as a discussion of Napier's Bones (see below) and Promptuary (another early calculating device). His invention of logarithms was quickly taken up at Gresham College, and prominent English mathematician Henry Briggs visited Napier in 1615. Among the matters they discussed were a re-scaling of Napier's logarithms, in which the presence of the mathematical constant e (more accurately, e times a large power of 10 rounded to an integer) was a practical difficulty. Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table. The computational advance available via logarithms, the converse of powered numbers or exponential notation, was such that it made calculations by hand much quicker. The way was opened to later scientific advances, in astronomy, dynamics, and other areas of physics.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} {{logarithms}} {{is the story}} of a correspondence (in modern terms, a group isomorphism) between multiplication on the positive real numbers and addition on the real number line that was formalized in seventeenth century Europe and was widely used to simplify calculation until the advent of the digital computer. The <b>Napierian</b> <b>logarithms</b> were published first in 1614. Henry Briggs introduced common (base 10) logarithms, which were easier to use. Tables of logarithms were published in many forms over four centuries. The idea of logarithms was also used to construct the slide rule, which became ubiquitous in science and engineering until the 1970s. A breakthrough generating the natural logarithm was the result of a search for an expression of area against a rectangular hyperbola, and required the assimilation of a new function into standard mathematics.|$|R
40|$|My {{decision}} to first read and study The Construction of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms was not motivated by {{an interest in}} logarithms. I was trying {{to learn more about}} the origin of the natural exponential function. I had known Leonhard Euler (1707 − 1783) probably did the most to engender wide spread understanding and acceptance of modern exponential functions (including the natural exponential function), but John Napier had over one hundred years earlier written a couple of papers creating something he called logarithms, which through hindsight, we have learned have a very intimate relationship with the natural exponential function. I wanted to understand this relationship with the hope that it would help me understand the context in which the natural exponential function was born. I also discovered something unexpected. Napier’s Canon is a marvelous example of how engineering problems are solved in practice. Often times engineers are prohibited from directly applying textbook solutions because of the complexity of the problem. They, instead, make simplifying assumptions and estimate quantities of interest. Napier faced a similar situation. He defined logarithms, yet he could not directly compute them. So, he computed their estimates. His ability to do so, I believe, shows the real ingenuity and inspiration of John Napier. Throughout this paper, I have tried to preserve most of Napier’s original proofs and arguments, updating the language and mathematics where necessary. At the end, I added a section hopefully answering some nagging questions a modern reader might have about a 400 year old paper. Such as, why did Napier choose the word logarithm and how do <b>Napierian</b> <b>logarithms</b> relate to ordinary modern logarithms? I enjoy placing mathematics into historical context and I hope the reader gains a new understanding and appreciation of logarithms which goes beyond what is usually gleamed from modern texts.

In this theoretical note, we propose the ratio’s natural logarithm or {{the difference between the}} <b>Napierian</b> <b>logarithms,</b> as a desirable measure of relative differences between two psychophysical quantities. It challenges the more frequently used (x 2 −x 1) /x 1 (x 2 −x 1) /x 1, (x 2 −x 1) /x 2 (x 2 −x 1) /x 2, as well as (x 2 −x 1) /xM(x 2 −x 1) /xM, where x 1,x 2 x 1,x 2, and xMxM are the initial value in a change, the larger value, and a mean value between x 1 x 1 and x 2 x 2, respectively. As for the three aforementioned expressions, it can be conveniently expressed as a percentage. For two physical measures, x 1 x 1 and View the MathML sourcex 2 (x 1 > 0;x 2 > 0), the difference between natural logarithms View the MathML sourceDNL=Ln(x 2) −Ln(x 1) =Ln(x 2 /x 1) sits between (x 2 −x 1) /x 2 (x 2 −x 1) /x 2 and (x 2 −x 1) /x 1 (x 2 −x 1) /x 1; it is actually the mean value of (x 2 −x 1) /x(x 2 −x 1) /x for all xx values between x 1 x 1 and x 2 x 2. Unlike other estimates, it satisfies all three of the following properties: symmetry, i. e. Δ(x 1;x 2) =−Δ(x 2;x 1) Δ(x 1;x 2) =−Δ(x 2;x 1); agreement between inverted units, such as hertz and second, i. e. Δ(x 1;x 2) =−Δ(k/x 1;k/x 2) Δ(x 1;x 2) =−Δ(k/x 1;k/x 2) thus |Δ(x 1;x 2) |=|Δ(k/x 1;k/x 2) ||Δ(x 1;x 2) |=|Δ(k/x 1;k/x 2) |; and additivity “à la Chasles”, i. e. Δ(x 1;x 2) +Δ(x 2;x 3) =Δ(x 1;x 3) Δ(x 1;x 2) +Δ(x 2;x 3) =Δ(x 1;x 3). Finally, it complies with the Weber–Fechner and Stevens laws...|$|R
