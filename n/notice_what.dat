5|$|The {{first to}} realise the mistake was General Dembiński, the {{commanding}} officer of the Reserve Corps tasked with defending the western sector. He immediately asked for reinforcements, but was denied by General Krukowiecki. Forced to fight alone, Dembiński did not reinforce the first line with his reserve 3rd Infantry Division and instead sent forward only a token force: half a battalion to man Fort 58 and support Fort 57. To make things worse for the Poles, General Umiński, {{the commanding officer}} of the southern sector, focused entirely on the skirmishes around Królikarnia and did not <b>notice</b> <b>what</b> was happening in Wola. Around 7:00 he reinforced Królikarnia with almost six battalions of infantry (ca. 2,800 men) and three guns. Forts 54 and 55 received no reinforcements.|$|E

500|$|Thayer's close {{observation}} {{led him to}} <b>notice</b> <b>what</b> scientists such as Edward Bagnall Poulton {{were just}} beginning to describe. This was that many animals were [...] "painted" [...] the opposite way to how painters create the appearance of solidity in figures. A canvas is flat, and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat. To make a body appear to have depth and solidity, the artist paints in shadows on the body itself. The top of an animal's back, facing the sky, remains bright, while it must become darker towards its underside. Thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading, nature could and did make animals appear flat. He was so passionate about this [...] "concealing coloration" [...] theory that he called it his [...] "second child". Poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars, but he had not realized that the phenomenon was widespread, and he championed Thayer's theory in a 1902 article in Nature.|$|E

500|$|Michael Gragg of MusicOMH {{wrote that}} [...] "Though the lyrics are daft [...] it's {{exuberance}} and {{general sense of}} fun is so infectious that when the chorus kicks in you barely <b>notice</b> <b>what</b> she's saying." [...] Jer Fairall of PopMatters wrote, [...] "Look {{no further than the}} wry chorus hook of “Fembot” for proof of Robyn’s deftly subversive sense of humor." [...] Fairall also pointed out that [...] " [...] might hint, at first, in the direction of some Blade Runner-esque sci-fi pathos, but Robyn turns it towards a canny meta-commentary on the fluid sense of authenticity that pervades 21st century pop stardom." [...] Fairall, however, thought that [...] "the verses are nothing more than an inventory of the titular ‘bot’s synthetic virtues." [...] Ben Norman of About.com selected the song as his favorite track on Body Talk Pt. 1, and wrote that [...] "'Fembot' is the incredibly quirky and well-written Robyn-rap track that needs to be heard to be believed." [...] Christopher Muther of The Boston Globe praised the song for having [...] "one of the most entertaining lyrics to emerge this year".|$|E

2500|$|This Logos holds always but humans always prove {{unable to}} {{understand}} it, both before hearing it {{and when they}} have first heard it.

2500|$|However, Watts {{did have}} his {{supporters}} in the Zen community, including Shunryu Suzuki, {{the founder of the}} San Francisco Zen Center. As David Chadwick recounted in his biography of Suzuki, Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki, when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying [...] "we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, [...] "You completely miss the point about Alan Watts!

2500|$|The human {{sense of}} the situation, {{according}} to Dreyfus, is based on our goals, our bodies and our culture—all of our unconscious intuitions, attitudes and knowledge about the world. This “context” or [...] "background" [...] (related to Heidegger's Dasein) {{is a form of}} knowledge that is not stored in our brains symbolically, but intuitively in some way. It affects what we notice and what we don't <b>notice,</b> <b>what</b> we expect and what possibilities we don't consider: we discriminate between what is essential and inessential. The things that are inessential are relegated to our [...] "fringe consciousness" [...] (borrowing a phrase from William James): the millions of things we're aware of, but we're not really thinking about right now.|$|E
2500|$|Out of the Unknown {{made its}} debut on Monday, 4 October 1965 at 8:00pm on BBC2 with Wyndham's “No Place Like Earth” {{selected}} as the opening story. Science fiction and fantasy was popular on television with Doctor Who, The Avengers, Thunderbirds, The Man from UNCLE and Lost in Space all notable hits at the time. Out of the Unknown, however, would offer more adult, cerebral fare. Initial audience and critical reaction was mixed but improved as the series went on with “Andover and the Android” (“It's not until intelligence, humour and gaiety break into television that you <b>notice</b> <b>what</b> tasteless pap we've been living on” - Daily Mail) and “Some Lapse of Time” (“It was not surprising to hear from Late Night Line Up {{that there had been}} many complimentary telephone calls after the play [...] it left the viewer with the disconcerting feeling that there was more than a grain of truth in its fantasy” - Birmingham Evening Mail and Dispatch) proving particularly popular with audiences and critics alike. BBC2 Controller David Attenborough praised the “overall professionalism that has become a hallmark of the series”. By the end of its first run, Out of the Unknown was the most popular drama on BBC2 after the imported Western The Virginian.|$|E

2500|$|The {{intention}} was to give Murphy's character Marcus Graham a cool, yet sophisticated style. [...] "So typically {{when it comes to}} black characters, either {{you have to be a}} successful, smart business person, or you're hip, but you're never both," [...] said Hudlin. [...] "And one of the reasons why the movie has had such enduring popularity is because the character is both. He's much more in the Cary Grant mode of business person." [...] While working on the characterization of the main character, Hudlin came up with the foot gag, which was used as a plot device to show the arc of the character's growth. It originated from a joke between the director and his friends about a man who's so picky about women that he even looks at their back teeth. [...] "So it's like, how do we define that Eddie's a back teeth kind of guy? So I came upon the idea of showing feet. That no matter how beautiful this woman is, if she has messed up feet, he's out of there." [...] Also, Hudlin said that [...] "we know he's evolved into a higher level of consciousness when he doesn't even <b>notice</b> <b>what</b> Halle Berry's feet look like." [...] The character Angela's art class was an idea the filmmakers had to put Murphy in a context where he could interact with kids, which he hadn't done prior to this film.|$|E
