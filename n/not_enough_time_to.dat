5|$|The Defence Forces set strict {{requirements}} for the vehicles to be produced. There was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> develop a new model. Although outdated, {{the best of the}} available options was the Sisu S-21. Yhteissisu and SAT agreed to transfer Sisu S-21 lorry production to Yhteissisu. The Yhteissisu-produced models were named S-22.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significantly}} fewer bughouse openings {{than there are}} chess openings. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns. Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available {{after the first few}} moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there is often <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} found {{that after a}} June 17 replacement of a track circuit component at what became {{the site of the}} June 22 collision, the track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55mph. The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44mph.|$|E
5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of Corfu while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at Corfu was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower made her look unlike any other Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them from the direction of the sun, there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> submerge. As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved their hats and handkerchiefs at the plane. As the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interest}} of time (the striking of the new coin was to begin in January 1964), Roberts modified the existing bust of Kennedy he had created for use on the Kennedy medal in the Mint's Presidential series, while Frank Gasparro began modifications to the reverse he had created for the same medal. Both Roberts' and Gasparro's designs had been approved by Kennedy. Roberts had met with Kennedy in person to show him early models of the design; although the President expressed no opinion regarding the depiction, Roberts decided {{to make some changes}} after meeting him. After the Mint produced trial strikes, Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy were invited to view them. Mrs. Kennedy viewed the designs favorably, but suggested that the hair be altered slightly. It was also suggested that a full or half figure of the president be used instead of the profile, but Roberts noted that there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> produce an entirely new design because of the project's time constraints, and also that he believed the left profile would give a more attractive appearance.|$|E

25|$|A hollow {{plutonium}} pit was {{the original}} plan for the 1945 Fat Man bomb, but there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> develop and test the implosion system for it. A simpler solid-pit design was considered more reliable, given the time constraints, but it required a heavy U-238 tamper, a thick aluminium pusher, and three tons of high explosives.|$|E

While in prison, he formed a connection with Nina Gegechkori (1905–10 June 1991), his cellmate's niece, and they eloped on a train. She was 17, a trained scientist from an aristocratic family.|$|E
25|$|In August 1985, Baker {{was named}} to the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence, and he was elected as the group's {{secretary}} in 1987. Baker was chosen secretary of the newly formed Kentucky Advocates for Higher Education in October 1985. He also considered running for lieutenant governor in 1987 on a ticket with Larry Forgy. After Forgy decided not to make the race for governor, Baker began to consider his own gubernatorial bid, but ultimately, he decided there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> mount a credible campaign and declined to run for any office in 1987.|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} of {{strained}} coexistence, Chief Opchanacanough and his Powhatan Confederacy attempted to eliminate the English colony once and for all. On the morning of March 22, 1622, they attacked outlying plantations and communities {{up and down the}} James River in {{what became known as the}} Indian Massacre of 1622. More than 300 settlers were killed in the attack, about a third of the colony's English-speaking population. Sir Thomas Dale's development at Henricus, which was to feature a college to educate the natives, and Wolstenholme Towne at Martin's Hundred, were both essentially wiped out. Jamestown was spared only through a timely warning by a Virginia Indian employee. There was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> spread the word to the outposts.|$|E

25|$|The Federal Treasury {{was nearly}} out {{of gold in}} 1895, at {{the depths of the}} Panic of 1893. Morgan had put forward a plan for the federal {{government}} to buy gold from his and European banks but it was declined in favor of a plan to sell bonds directly to the general public to overcome the crisis. Morgan, sure there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> implement such a plan, demanded and eventually obtained a meeting with Grover Cleveland where he pointed out the government could default that day if they didn't do something. Morgan came up with a plan to use an old civil war statute that allowed Morgan and the Rothschilds to sell gold directly to the U.S. Treasury, 3.5million ounces, to restore the treasury surplus, in exchange for a 30-year bond issue. The episode saved the Treasury but hurt Cleveland's standing with the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party, and became an issue in the election of 1896 when banks came under a withering attack from William Jennings Bryan. Morgan and Wall Street bankers donated heavily to Republican William McKinley, who was elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1900.|$|E
25|$|The band {{began its}} tour for One Hot Minute in Europe on September 27, 1995 and played 16 shows. A US tour was to follow but was {{postponed}} after Chad Smith broke his wrist. The band considered carrying {{on with the}} tour even at one point considering Jack Irons {{as a replacement for}} Smith but there just was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> rehearse with anyone new and the dates were rescheduled for early 1996. The band spent most of 1996 playing shows in the United States and Europe. By 1997, for the first time, the band cancelled many shows. Most of this was again due to problems within the band. Flea at that point was exhausted, tired of playing the same songs each night and was seriously talking about quitting the band while Kiedis had recently been involved in a motorcycle accident which left one arm in a sling and created yet another drug relapse due to his use of painkillers. Even Navarro was back to using drugs. 1997 saw the band playing just one show. This was at the very first Fuji Rock Festival on July 26, 1997. A massive typhoon hit that day but the band played anyway. They played through an 8-song set before having to cut the show short due to the storm. This would be the final show with Navarro and due to Flea's previous comments left many speculating if {{it was the end of}} the band.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} is a {{painting}} by Betty Swanwick titled The Dream. Swanwick had designed posters for London Transport between the 1930s and 1950s. The original painting did not feature a lawn mower; the band had Swanwick add it later as an allusion to the song [...] "I Know What I Like" [...] as Swanwick told them that she had <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> paint a new picture for their cover.|$|E

500|$|The {{two main}} {{features}} of England's first innings were Scotton's [...] "stonewalling" [...] and Read's (batting at number ten) [...] "hard and rapid hitting". Scotton's 90 in six hours and Read's 117 in two enabled England {{to reach a}} respectable 346 but they still had to follow on, 205 runs behind. But the time taken by Scotton's innings left Australia with <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> bowl England out again {{and the result was}} a draw.|$|E
500|$|Trapier {{was less}} than pleased with the troops and {{artillery}} {{that he had been}} given.

[...] He had also been given fairly light guns; what he wanted was Columbiads, suitable for defending the battery and the bay against incursions by ironclads.|$|E
500|$|In late 1998 {{or early}} 1999, bin Laden gave {{approval}} for Mohammed {{to go forward}} with organizing the plot. A series of meetings occurred in early 1999, involving Mohammed, bin Laden, and his deputy Mohammed Atef. Atef provided operational support for the plot, including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers. Bin Laden overruled Mohammed, rejecting some potential targets such as the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles because, [...] "there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare for such an operation".|$|E
