In this paper we propose to measure {{the importance of a}} given variable within existing composite indicators via Karl Pearson's `correlation ratio'; we call this measure `main effect'. Because socio-economic variables are heteroskedastic and correlated, (relative) <b>nominal</b> <b>weights</b> are hardly ever found to match (relative) main effects; we propose to summarize their discrepancy with a divergence measure. We further discuss to what extent the mapping from <b>nominal</b> <b>weights</b> to main effects can be inverted. This analysis is applied to five composite indicators, including the Human Development Index and two popular league tables of university performance. It is found that in many cases the declared importance of single indicators and their main effect are very different, and that the data correlation structure often prevents developers from obtaining the stated importance, even when modifying the <b>nominal</b> <b>weights</b> in the set of nonnegative numbers with unit sum.

To {{classify}} {{the potential}} {{interference in the}} appropriate category, a value of the potential interference between the SU Tx and Rx is compared with the cumulative probability density function of the average received interference power between the SUs. The cumulative probability density function (cdf) is empirically determined from the previous spectrum sensing measurements in the frequency band under consideration. On {{the basis of this}} comparison, it is identified to which category out of four this potential interference belongs and the characteristic value of the <b>nominal</b> edge <b>weight</b> factor is assigned for the identified interference category. Proposed values for the categorization of the <b>nominal</b> edge <b>weights</b> are calculated by evaluating the cdf of the average received interference power between the SUs. Interference cdf is divided into four non-overlapping areas and a median cumulative probability value for each area is calculated. Channel weights representing each category are calculated as the ceiling round up (rounded off to the higher value) for the edge weight coefficients (0.4; 0.7; 1) and as floor round up for edge weight coefficient (0). Specific weights for four different categories of the interference are chosen in such way that the possible harmful interference between SUs is emphasized.
