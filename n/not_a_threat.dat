Hurricane Hugo passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.|$|E

A 1940 security investigation was begun {{to determine the extent}} of Reich's communist commitments. A board of Alien Enemy Hearing judged that Dr. Reich was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the security of the U.S. In 1947, a security investigation concluded that neither the Orgone Project nor any of its staff were engaged in subversive activities or were in violation of any statute within the jurisdiction of the FBI.|$|E
5|$|Dolores {{continued}} to intensify and it reached a peak windspeed of , a strong Category 1 hurricane, two days later. Meanwhile, Dolores {{became the first}} hurricane in over two years to cross longitude 125°W. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane started losing strength as it moved over cooler waters. The eye dissipated from satellite imagery while the associated thunderstorm activity became sheared. Dolores weakened back into a tropical storm on July 10 and a tropical depression the next day. The cyclone then crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (west of longitude 140°W) while producing minimal shower activity. It dissipated on July 12. The hurricane was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to any land.|$|E

Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, {{have a long}} enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued a warning to the Los Alamos county and the Forest Service performing thinning of trees {{in the area to}} not remove the trees cut {{in various parts of the}} Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials. The worst affected zones are fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects and trees in the surrounding areas. The neighbouring population was not informed about the tests until the mid-1990s, and Los Alamos refused to declassify the documentation.|$|E
5|$|On August22, governments {{across the}} Lesser Antilles issued {{tropical}} storm watches.

These advisories were discontinued following Danny's degradation to a tropical depression on August24. Leeward Islands Air Transport cancelled 40flights across the eastern Caribbean due to the hurricane and cruise ships altered their courses. Although members of the Haiti Office of Civil Protection issued an official statement to residents saying Danny was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the country, they convened to discuss potential preparations {{and the status of}} emergency supplies.

5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} is not aggressive, {{though it}} will defend itself if stepped on or otherwise incited. Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury, and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear. The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life-threatening effects on those with heart or respiratory problems, and {{is the subject of}} biomedical and neurobiological research. This species is popular with ecotourist divers. Abundant and widespread, the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters; these activities are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to its population, as most captured rays are released alive. The impact of fishing in the southern parts of its range is uncertain, but is unlikely to significantly affect the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|In 1409, Jelena {{decided to}} travel to Venice to {{negotiate}} peace in person. At the end of May, she arrived in Dubrovnik but {{had to wait for}} almost two months because her hosts warned her that there were Napolitan galleys in the Adriatic Sea. On 9 July 1409, while she was still waiting in Dubrovnik, Venice purchased the entire Dalmatian coast from Ladislaus of Naples for 100,000 ducats. The Kingdom of Naples was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Venetians anymore. By gaining the Dalmatian coast, Venetians further increased their influence and power in the region of the Adriatic Sea, which made Jelena's negotiating position difficult. When she finally arrived in Venice at the end of July, she was financially broken because of her long voyage. The Venetians had to support her with three ducats a day during negotiations which lasted for the next three months. On 26 October 1409, a year-long peace agreement with the Venetian doge, Michele Steno, was signed without territorial changes for any of the parties. Jelena traveled back to Zeta through Dubrovnik where she received 100 ducats worth of presents. Although both she and the Venetian representative swore on the Gospel to respect the truce, in reality there was no peace.|$|E

25|$|As some {{of their}} {{potential}} witnesses are attacked and prevented from supporting the Cullens, Carlisle and Edward realize {{they may have to}} fight the Volturi. Their witnesses ultimately agree to stand with them in battle, having realized the Volturi increased the Guard by falsely accusing covens of crimes, destroy them and then recruit vampires with gifts. The Volturi arrive prepared for battle, led by Aro, who is eager to obtain the gifted members of the Cullen coven as part of his guard. Aro is allowed to touch Renesmee, and is convinced that she is not an immortal child. Irina is brought forth and takes full responsibility for her mistake, leading to her immediate death. Aro still insists that Renesmee may pose a risk in the future, validating his claim that battle is necessary. Before any violence, Alice shares with Aro her vision of the battle that is to come, during which both sides sustain heavy casualties, including Aro who would also die. Aro believes her, giving Alice and Jasper an opportunity to reveal their witness, Nahuel (a half mortal half vampire just like Renesmee). The witness proves that he is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat,</b> supporting the notion that Renesmee is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b> The Volturi unhappily walk away, explaining {{that there will be no}} battle today.|$|E

When he was told he could not get on the Virgin flight, Tidswell told Fairfax Media he was shocked when he was told new terrorism laws meant he could not wear the shirt on the plane. But a Virgin Australia spokesman said the T-shirt was simply deemed offensive, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Investigations of the {{aircraft}} wrecks were {{carried out by the}} Armed Forces Museum in 1986, which in cooperation with the NTNU Museum of Natural History and Archaeology succeeded at finding both the Heinkel and the Junkers.

The issue lay at rest until 1994, when Forsvarets Forum questioned weather the wrecks were a threat to the lake as a drinking water source. The authorities concluded that the wrecks were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the water quality. The Norwegian Aviation Museum received permission from the Ministry of Defense in 1995 to raise the wrecks, as they never determined what to do with {{the aircraft}}.|$|E

Regarding the Jews, Luke emphasises the fact that Jesus and all his earliest followers were Jews, although by his time the majority of Christ-followers were gentiles; nevertheless, the Jews had rejected and killed the Messiah, and the Christian mission now lay with the gentiles.|$|E

The Coup of 30 Prairial VII occurred on 18 June which pushed Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès and Paul Barras into leading roles and elevated Jean Baptiste Bernadotte to the post of Minister of War. There were two major forces in Italy, the 19,000-strong Army of the Alps under Jean Étienne Championnet and 40,713 men of the Army of Italy. The French government placed its hopes on Barthélemy Catherine Joubert to retrieve the situation as the new commander of the Army of Italy. Not only was Joubert a talented general, but he {{was believed to be}} lacking political ambitions and thus <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the government. When Joubert arrived in the theater on 4 August, Moreau gracefully stepped aside and offered his assistance.|$|E
25|$|The sand tiger {{is often}} {{associated}} with being vicious or deadly, due to its relatively large size and sharp, protruding teeth that point outward from its jaws; however, these sharks are quite docile, and are <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to humans. Their mouths are not large enough to cause a human fatality. Sand tigers roam the surf, sometimes in close proximity to humans, and there have been only a few instances of unprovoked sand tiger shark attacks on humans, usually associated with spear fishing, line fishing, or shark feeding. As of 2013, the database of Shark Attack Survivors does not list any fatalities due to sand tiger sharks. When the sharks become aggressive, they tend to steal fish or bait from fishing lines rather than attack humans. Owing to its large size and docile temperament, the sand tiger is commonly displayed in aquariums around the world.|$|E
