5|$|Massachusetts {{has avoided}} {{many forms of}} racial strife seen {{elsewhere}} in the US, but examples such as the successful electoral showings of the nativist (mainly anti-Catholic) Know <b>Nothings</b> in the 1850s, the controversial Sacco and Vanzetti executions in the 1920s, and Boston's opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s show that the ethnic history of Massachusetts was not completely harmonious.|$|E
5|$|Pierce and his {{administration}} used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board {{in favor of the}} bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the Know <b>Nothings,</b> and the founding of the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know <b>Nothings</b> captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take {{a more active role in}} the 1856 campaigns.|$|E

5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified {{to see it}} spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to break apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know <b>Nothings,</b> a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Although the Whig Party was on {{its final}} decline nationally, it {{remained}} strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary {{to give him a}} chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series {{of more than a dozen}} vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know <b>Nothings,</b> a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.|$|E
5|$|In {{part due}} to the ongoing violent {{political}} confrontations in the Kansas, opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act remained strong in Illinois and throughout the North. As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln abandoned the defunct Whig Party in favor of the Republicans. He attended the May 1856 Bloomington Convention, which formally established the Illinois Republican Party. The convention platform asserted that Congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union. At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, Lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of John C. Frémont and William Dayton. Lincoln strongly supported the Republican ticket, campaigning for the party throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Ambassador James Buchanan, who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories, while the Know <b>Nothings</b> nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore. In the 1856 elections, Buchanan defeated both his challengers, but Frémont won several Northern states and Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois. Though Lincoln did not himself win office, his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading Republican in Illinois.|$|E

5|$|The voters {{returned}} Sherman {{to office}} for a third term in 1858. After a brief special session in March 1859, the 36th Congress adjourned, and Sherman and his wife went on vacation to Europe. When they returned that December, the situation {{was similar to that}} of four years earlier: no party had an absolute majority. Republicans held 109 seats, Democrats 101, and Know <b>Nothings</b> 27. Again, sectional tension had increased while Congress was in recess, this time due to John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. The election for Speaker of the House promised to be contentious. This time, Sherman was among the leading candidates, receiving the second-largest number of votes on the first ballot, with no candidate receiving a majority. The election for Speaker was sidetracked immediately by a furor over an anti-slavery book, The Impending Crisis of the South, written by Hinton Rowan Helper and endorsed by many Republican members. Southerners accused Sherman of having endorsed the book, while he protested that he only endorsed its use as a campaign tool and had never read it. After two months of balloting, no decision had been reached. After their attempts to adopt a plurality rule failed, Sherman accepted that he could not be elected, and withdrew. Republicans then shifted their support to William Pennington, who was elected on the forty-fourth ballot.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the elections, the Know <b>Nothings</b> met in Philadelphia, where they changed their name to the American Party. With support in both the North and South, the Know <b>Nothings</b> loomed as a potential replacement for the Whigs as the main opposition for the Democrats, but the fledgling party split along sectional lines over a proposed restoration of the Missouri Compromise. As the controversy over Kansas continued, Know <b>Nothings,</b> Whigs, and even Democrats became increasingly attracted to the Republican Party. The election of Nathaniel Banks, who was sympathetic to Republican ideals and opposed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, confirmed the growing national power of the Republicans. Pierce declared his full opposition the new party, decrying what he saw as its anti-southern stance, but his perceived pro-Southern actions in Kansas continued to inflame Northern anger. The Know Nothing National Convention alienated many Northern Know <b>Nothings</b> by nominating former President Fillmore for another term and failing to oppose the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Fillmore also received the presidential nomination at sparsely attended 1856 Whig convention. The 1856 Republican National Convention nominated John C. Frémont, and many Northern Know <b>Nothings</b> came to back Frémont instead of Fillmore. As the 1856 election would show, the Republicans had become the main opposition to the Democratic Party in the North.|$|E
25|$|Nationalism and {{the rise}} of the Know Nothing Party or American Party was a feature of Louisiana {{politics}} in the 1850s. Whig newspapers tried to discredit Hébert by starting rumors of his allegiance with the Know <b>Nothings.</b> He still appointed some Whigs to minor offices and some Know <b>Nothings</b> to lucrative posts. He was considered very independent in his appointments and many Democrats were disenchanted with him toward the end of his administration. Hébert was mentioned as a possible candidate for the U. S. Senate, but John Slidell was not vulnerable to an intraparty challenge.|$|E

25|$|A {{member of}} the Whig Party like his father, Harlan got an early start in politics, when in 1851, he was offered the post of {{adjutant}} general of the state by governor John L. Helm. He served in the post for the next eight years, which gave him a statewide presence and familiarity with many of Kentucky's leading political figures. With the Whig Party's dissolution in the early 1850s, Harlan shifted his affiliation to the Know <b>Nothings,</b> despite his discomfort with their opposition to Catholicism. Harlan's personal popularity within the state was such {{that he was able}} to survive the decline of the Know Nothing movement in the late 1850s, winning election in 1858 as the county judge for Franklin County, Kentucky. The following year, he renounced his allegiance to the Know <b>Nothings</b> and joined the state's Opposition Party, serving as their candidate in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat William E. Simms for the seat in Kentucky's 8th congressional district.|$|E

40|$|This study {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that much of twentieth-century art, literature, and philosophy exhibits a concern with <b>nothing</b> itself. Both Martin Heidegger and Jean Paul Sartre, for example, perceive that <b>nothing</b> is part-and-parcel of (man’s) being. The present study adopts a similar position concerning <b>nothing</b> and its essential relationship to being, but adds a third element: that of writing narrative. This relationship between <b>nothing</b> and narrative is, I argue, established {{in the writings of}} Friedrich Nietzsche, Mikhail Bakhtin, Jacques Derrida, and Julia Kristeva. As Heidegger and Sartre position <b>nothing</b> as essential to the creation of being, so Nietzsche, Bakhtin, Derrida, and Kristeva figure <b>nothing</b> as essential to the production of narrative. The parallels between their theories regarding <b>nothing</b> and being, and <b>nothing</b> and narrative, are particularly telling, especially as the twentieth century deconstructs our notions of reality and fiction, rendering these increasingly indistinguishable from one another. This thesis regarding <b>nothing’s</b> relationship to narrative is further developed through analysis of the literary works of Nikolai Gogol, Herman Melville, Vladimir Nabokov, Samuel Beckett, and Victor Pelevin. These authors compose literature that not only gives narrative form to <b>nothing</b> itself (narratives about <b>nothing),</b> but that also envisions <b>nothing</b> as a generator of narrative (narratives of <b>nothing).</b> My phrase narratives of <b>nothing</b> indicates the symbiotic relationship between <b>nothing</b> and writing, wherein <b>nothing</b> resides at the forever-deferring center of a semiotic system that produces writing, narrative fiction, and thus “reality” as we know it. In each of the texts I have selected, there is a clear relationship established between (1) the act of writing, producing narrative and/or meaning, and (2) <b>nothing</b> or one of its many signifiers (e. g. void, cipher, zero, etc.). My analysis ultimately refigures the transcendental signified as <b>nothing</b> itself. <b>Nothing</b> as the transcendental signified is therefore the ever-deferring generator of a system of signifiers that perpetually recreate their own original transcendental signified. Because of this, <b>nothing</b> as the transcendental signified is an infinite <b>nothing</b> that constantly transforms depending on its own signifiers’ significations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Parmenides {{expelled}} nonbeing {{from the}} realm of knowledge and forbade us to think or talk about it. But still there has been a long tradition of nay-sayings throughout the history of Western and Eastern philosophy. Are those philosophers talking about the same nonbeing or <b>nothing?</b> If not, how do their concepts of <b>nothing</b> differ from each other? Could there be different types of <b>nothing?</b> Surveying the traditional classifications of <b>nothing</b> or nonbeing in the East and West have led me to develop a typology of <b>nothing</b> that consists of three main types: 1) privative <b>nothing,</b> commonly known as absence; 2) negative <b>nothing,</b> the altogether not or absolute nothing; and finally 3) original <b>nothing,</b> the <b>nothing</b> that is equivalent to being. I will test my threefold typology of <b>nothing</b> by comparing the similarities and differences between the conceptions of <b>nothing</b> in Heidegger, Daoism and Buddhism. These are three of the very few philosophical strains that have launched themselves into the wonderland of negativity by developing respectively the concepts of <b>nothing</b> (Nichts), <b>nothing</b> (wu 無) and emptiness (śūnyatā). With this analysis, I hope that I will clarify some confusion in the understanding of <b>nothing</b> in Heidegger, Daoism and Buddhism, and shed light on the central philosophical issue of “what there is not”...|$|R

25|$|The {{number of}} Catholics grew {{from the early}} 19th century through {{immigration}} and the acquisition of the predominantly Catholic former possessions of France, Spain, and Mexico, followed in the mid-19th century by a rapid influx of Irish, German, Italian and Polish immigrants from Europe, making the Catholic Church the largest Christian denomination in the United States. This increase was met by widespread anti-Catholicism in the United States, prejudice and hostility, often resulting in riots and the burning of churches, convents, and seminaries. The Know <b>Nothings,</b> an anti-Catholic nativist movement, was founded in the mid 19th century {{in an attempt to}} restrict Catholic immigration, and was later followed by the Order of United American Mechanics, the Ku Klux Klan, the American Protective Association, and the Junior Order of United American Mechanics.|$|E
25|$|In Maryland, {{large numbers}} of immigrants, largely Irish and German Catholics, had flooded into Baltimore during the Great Famine in Ireland and the 1848 Revolutions in Germany. They took work in the port and {{railroad}} yards. Due to this rapid increase in population density, there was competition with free people of color for housing and jobs; street crime became a problem and relief rolls rose. At the same time, planters were a strong force in the state; many Catholic and Episcopalian planters resided on the Eastern Shore, which continued as primarily agricultural. In 1853, the Maryland Know Nothing party was formed, initially from three nativist groups. Yet beginning in February, it took in {{large numbers of}} striking laborers from the ironwork's factory in Baltimore, whom the Democratic Party had refused to support. In opposing the pro-slavery Democrats, the Know <b>Nothings</b> became a powerful, but divisive, party in the state. They were pro-Union, pro-labor, anti-Catholic, and anti-immigrant.|$|E
