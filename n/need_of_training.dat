The 1st Marine Division completed its last ordered deactivation on April 15, and the IIIAC staff and units were reduced to skeleton strength. At this point, most of the Marines {{who had been in}} China {{since the beginning of the}} occupation had been repatriated, and the remaining 25,000 Americans in China were mostly inexperienced and badly in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> As result, the American commanders set up a school in China, where many of the Marines received [...] "on the job" [...] training. On May 1, the China Theater was deactivated; most of the residual functions were assumed by Lieutenant General Alvin C.

With the exception of security guard for vital coal shipments from the Tangshan area, Marines had accomplished most of their original missions, such as the repatriation of Japanese.

50|$|The book {{highlights}} how {{theories and}} research on crime and delinquency have historically ignored women and girls {{and that they were}} forgotten altogether during the second wave of feminism. Women and girls were an afterthought of a system designed for men. The authors explain that more recent research has shown how women's and girls' victimization narrows their choices and provide the background for their entrance into unemployment, prostitution or survival sex, drug use and abuse, homelessness and other criminal acts. The authors explain that girls' pathways to crime are further affected by the gendered nature of society. The authors also discuss the increased rates of women’s and girls' imprisonment in the 21st century, and ask: “What led these women into criminal behaviour? Are today’s women more violent than their counterparts in the past decades? How could such a change in public policy towards women (that led to their increased imprisonment) have happened with so little fanfare?” They explain that society must stop punishing girls and women based on myths bolstered by bad information and instead seek recourse in the real causes of their offending. As well, the lack of civil rights guaranteed to youth makes their arrest possible and normal, in the case of girls, even when they are fleeing horrific situations. Chesney-Lind and Pasko explain that the answer to the last question, how could the dramatic increase in the prison population of women, lies in the societal anxiety that surrounds women and girl offenders. Furthermore, because the majority of people are arrested and imprisoned are poor and therefore without a voice and the authors argue to counter these challenges we must focus attention on girls and women offender, engage them as persons, listen to their story and ultimately turn the prisoner into a person. The authors claim that to fix these problems we could choose not to imprison marginalized girls and women, as we often do for white women and girls. They posit this would be unlikely to cause a surge in crime as most women and girls are in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> education and support, not punishment. They also suggest society should work to strengthen the bond between women, their communities and their children. The authors support their claims by showing that the increased imprisonment of women is not a result of new crimes and that decreases in the prison population would not only save taxpayers money but could be achieved through policy changes. The authors end the book by explaining that if society can begin to stop relying on imprisonment for women we can begin to consider this approach for men as well. They explain that the majority of male offenders are also marginalized by racism and poverty and furthermore, that they are the brothers, fathers and sons of marginalized women.|$|E

As discussed in Section 3.3, the same requirements could also be estimated as the maximum proficiency level of workers who report feeling the <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> (min_j) and the minimum proficiency of workers who feel they can do a more demanding job (max_j). However, the first set of estimators (min_j and max_j) is preferred because it is more robust to the most common sources of misreporting, such as respondents’ overconfidence and the misinterpretation of the question about needing training.
