5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, <b>nutritional</b> <b>status,</b> social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{body size}} growth pattern {{is one of}} the best ways to find out {{biological}} variation in phenotypic plasticity, health and <b>nutritional</b> <b>statuses,</b> and quality of life. Optimum environment and better nutrition are associated with rapid growth, tall stature, and early puberty. However, poor living condition impacts every stage of development, which results in variation in growth rates, growth periods, and body sizes across populations. Baduy is one of traditional populations who inhabit mountainous area in Kanekes Village, Lebak Regency, Banten Province, Indonesia. The traditional obligatory duties and taboos resulted in genetic, geographic, and cultural isolations. This leads to question whether the biocultural condition affects the growth pattern of their body size. We measured the body height, weight, and mass index of 340 girls and 239 boys aged 4 – 30 years sampled from 39 of 61 hamlets using cross-sectional method. We found that Baduy people had prolonged growth resulting in small body size because of slow rate and low spurt.

Indigenous populations all over the world, whose lifestyle is changing rapidly and drastically, seem to be particularly prone to show an increased {{prevalence of}} overweight and its co-morbidities among adults. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the association between socioeconomic and <b>nutritional</b> <b>statuses</b> in adults of two indigenous populations of the Argentine Gran Chaco: the Toba and Wichí of the province of Formosa. Originally hunter-gatherers, they are now more settled and engage in temporary wage labor and local political positions. A total of 541 adults (> 20 years old) participated in the study. Almost 50 % of the adult Toba and 34 % of the adult Wichí were overweight and 10 % of adults in both populations were obese. Socioeconomic status was positively associated with body mass index in both populations. Furthermore, political connectedness with the non-indigenous sector, as in the case of community leaders, was highly correlated with obesity. Differences within and between groups can be explained by biocultural factors that include gender, diet (foraged vs store-bought), lifestyle (sedentary vs more active), and history of political power. Our study highlights the interactions among social, cultural, and political economic variables, such as political hierarchies within the group or degree of social connectedness with community leaders.

25|$|School meals {{have been}} shown to {{increase}} the <b>nutritional</b> <b>status</b> of school-age children in a variety of ways. For example, there is a notable reduction in malnutrition via diet diversification and an increased absorption of micronutrients. Overall, the amount of kilocalories in a child's diet is expanded when they are given nutritional resources that they would otherwise have little to no access to. By increasing the amount of nutrition a child receives at school, that child's family's nutrition status also increases as their familial demand and requirement for food is decreased. Targeted take-home rations therefore increase the nutrition of the family as a whole, and not just the members of a given family that are of primary-school age. However, criticisms of school meals' impacts on nutrition stem from the idea that increased nutrition through school meals is only a temporary fix and does not target the underlying causes of malnutrition, such as high food prices and poor food distribution systems that prevent food security.|$|E
25|$|Widespread child {{malnutrition}} in slums {{is closely related}} to family income, mothers' food practice, mothers' educational level, and maternal employment or housewifery. Poverty may result in inadequate food intake when people cannot afford to buy and store enough food, which leads to malnutrition. Another common cause is mothers' faulty feeding practices, including inadequate breastfeeding and wrongly preparation of food for children. Tada et al.'s study in Bangkok slums shows that around 64% of the mothers sometimes fed their children instant food instead of a normal meal. And about 70% of the mothers did not provide their children three meals everyday. Mothers' lack of education leads to their faulty feeding practices. Many mothers in slums don't have knowledge on food nutrition for children. Maternal employment also influences children's <b>nutritional</b> <b>status.</b> For the mothers who work outside, their children are prone to be malnourished.
