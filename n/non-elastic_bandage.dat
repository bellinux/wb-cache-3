50|$|An elastic bandage, {{rather than}} a firm plastic bandage (such as zinc-oxide tape) is required. Usage of a tight, <b>non-elastic</b> <b>bandage</b> will result in {{reduction}} of adequate blood flow, potentially causing ischemia. The fit should be snug so as to not move freely, but still allow expansion for when muscles contract and fill with blood.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCompression {{therapy has}} precise {{technical}} characteristics but in vivo pressures exerted by bandages are still poorly understood. ObjectiveTo perform in vivo pressure measurements of different compression bandages bearing different technical characteristics with different application methods. MethodInterface pressure was measured {{on the lower}} limb of 20 healthy women at 3 different points (B 1, C and F) using 6 compression techniques (stockings, <b>non-elastic</b> <b>bandage,</b> elastic bandages with 2 technical characteristics and 3 application methods), and in 3 positions. ResultsAll elastic compression bandages respected the principle of graduated pressure {{along the length of}} the limb (P< 0. 0001), but not the <b>non-elastic</b> <b>bandage.</b> The pressures increase significantly (P< 0. 0001) between the supine position and the sitting or standing position, especially with the non-elastic compression bandage. There is a marked variation in pressures between subjects for some bandages (non-elastic and elastic applied using the figure-of-eight technique). The pressure increases significantly with the number of bandage overlaps (P< 0. 01). ConclusionElastic and non-elastic bandages behave differently from one another, and non-elastic bandages not appearing to comply with medical recommendations concerning graduated pressure. There is a high level of variability between subjects for some compression bandages (non-elastic and figure-of-eight methods) ...|$|E
50|$|Breast binding is {{the act of}} {{flattening}} breasts {{by the use of}} constrictive materials. The term also {{refers to}} the material used in this act. Common binding materials include cloth strips, elastic or <b>non-elastic</b> <b>bandages,</b> purpose-built undergarments (often using Spandex or other synthetic fibre) and shirts layered from tight to loose. The act of breast binding is common for trans men, but is also done by androgynous, genderqueer and gender fluid people, as well as crossdressers and performers. Some women may use binders as alternatives to bras.|$|R

Fourteen studies were identified and reviewed, to assess the efficacy of this treatment modality as either a bandage or skin protectant in the treatment of venous ulcers. The authors of three studies reported improved healing time or success rate in wounds treated with zinc-based products. However, the authors of one study attributed the faster healing rate mainly to the extra compression (that improved venous blood return), delivered by the <b>non-elastic</b> paste <b>bandage,</b> and not by the zinc oxide alone. The quality of evidence is fair, as 50 % of the studies were conducted prior to 2000 and 50 % of the studies utilized fewer than 45 patients randomized to two or more groups. Other treatments have been reported to be more cost-effective than zinc, including hydrocolloids, four-layer compression systems, and CircAid Thera-boots. Finally, zinc was reported to be less comfortable, less easy to use, and caused increased pain, in comparison to other products on the market. This literature review, therefore, demonstrated that current evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of zinc-based products in the treatment of venous wounds. Future research is needed focusing on larger, high-quality trials with an emphasis on quality of life issues and cost-effectiveness of treatment.
