5|$|In {{addition}} to territorial disputes, the League {{also tried to}} intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the <b>Nansen</b> <b>passport,</b> {{which was the first}} internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.|$|E
5|$|Led by Fridtjof Nansen, the Commission for Refugees was {{established}} on 27 June 1921 {{to look after}} the interests of refugees, including overseeing their repatriation and, when necessary, resettlement. At the end of the First World War, there were two to three million ex-prisoners of war from various nations dispersed throughout Russia; within two years of the commission's foundation, it had helped 425,000 of them return home. It established camps in Turkey in 1922 to aid the country with an ongoing refugee crisis, helping to prevent disease and hunger. It also established the <b>Nansen</b> <b>passport</b> as a means of identification for stateless people.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, the Nansen International Office for Refugees (Nansen Office) was {{established}} as a successor agency to the Commission. Its most notable achievement was the <b>Nansen</b> <b>passport,</b> a refugee travel document, {{for which it was}} awarded the 1938 Nobel Peace Prize. The Nansen Office was plagued by problems of financing, an increase in refugee numbers, and a lack of co-operation from some member states, which led to mixed success overall.|$|E

By 1942, they were honoured by governments in 52 countries.

5000|$|While <b>Nansen</b> <b>passports</b> are {{no longer}} issued, {{existing}} national and supranational authorities, including the United Nations, issue travel documents for stateless people and refugees, including certificates of identity (or [...] "alien's passports") and refugee travel documents.|$|R
25|$|Grothendieck {{was born}} in Weimar Germany. In 1938, aged ten, he moved to France as a refugee. Records of his {{nationality}} were destroyed {{in the fall of}} Germany in 1945 and he did not apply for French citizenship after the war. He thus became a stateless person for at least the majority of his working life, traveling on a <b>Nansen</b> <b>passport.</b> Part of this reluctance to hold French nationality is attributed to not wishing to serve in the French military, particularly due to the Algerian War (1954–62). He eventually applied for French citizenship in the early 1980s, well past the age that exempted him from military service.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Maria Pavlovna {{visited her}} son Lennart {{and his family}} in Mainau. They bonded over their shared {{interest}} in photography and she got along with his wife, even though the grand duchess had been disappointed when her son renounced his royal status in order to marry a commoner in 1932. Maria Pavlovna, who had little maternal feelings, took no interest in her two grand daughters: Birgitta, then four years old and Marie Louise age two. She asked Lennart to call her by her name as she felt embarrassed {{to have such a}} grown up son. Thanks to Lennart, the King of Sweden, who sympathized with Maria Pavlovna, arranged a Swedish diplomatic passport for her to replace her old <b>Nansen</b> <b>passport.</b> This gave her a broader freedom of movement.|$|E
2500|$|The International Refugee Organization (IRO) {{was founded}} on 20 April 1946, and took over the {{functions}} of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which was shut down in 1947. While the handover was originally planned to take place at the beginning of 1947, it did not occur until July 1947. The International Refugee Organization was a temporary organization of the United Nations (UN), which itself had been founded in 1945, with a mandate to largely finish the UNRRA's work of repatriating or resettling European refugees. It was dissolved in 1952 after resettling about one million refugees. The definition of a refugee at this time was an individual with either a <b>Nansen</b> <b>passport</b> or a [...] "Certificate of identity" [...] issued by the International Refugee Organization.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dissolution}} of the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires created {{a number of new}} countries in eastern Europe and the Middle East. [...] Some of them, such as Czechoslovakia and Poland, had substantial ethnic minorities who were sometimes not fully satisfied with the new boundaries that cut them off from fellow ethnics. [...] For example, Czechoslovakia had Germans, Poles, Ruthenians and Ukrainians, Slovaks and Hungarians. The League of Nations sponsored various Minority Treaties in an attempt to deal with the problem, but with the decline of the League in the 1930s, these treaties became increasingly unenforceable. One consequence of the massive redrawing of borders and the political changes {{in the aftermath of the}} war was the large number of European refugees. These and the refugees of the Russian Civil War led to the creation of the <b>Nansen</b> <b>passport.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On November 11 of 1939, the Portuguese {{government}} sent Circular 14 to all Portuguese consuls throughout Europe {{stating the}} categories of war refugees whom the PVDE considered to be [...] "inconvenient or dangerous."

At the Yalta Conference, the British committed themselves to return Soviet citizens to the Soviet Union. After consulation with Harold Macmillan Keightley proceeded to hand over these prisoners and their families regardless of their nationality, including people with French, German, Yugoslav, or <b>Nansen</b> <b>passports.</b> The prisoners were delivered by deceit and force to SMERSH at Judenburg; many were executed immediately, the remainder sent to the Gulag.|$|R
25|$|As World War II broke out, Bunin's {{friends in}} New York, anxious {{to help the}} Nobel Prize laureate get out of France, issued officially-endorsed invitations for him {{to travel to the}} USA, and in 1941 they {{received}} their <b>Nansen</b> <b>passports</b> enabling them to make the trip. But the couple chose to remain in Grasse. They spent the war years at Villa Jeanette, high in the mountains. Two young writers became long-term residents in the Bunin household at the time: Leonid Zurov (1902–1971), who had arrived on a visit from Latvia at Bunin's invitation earlier, in late 1929, and remained with them {{for the rest of their}} lives, and Nikolai Roshchin (1896–1956), who returned to the Soviet Union after the war.|$|R
50|$|They {{had made}} five US tours with no {{difficulty}} {{but this time}} they were refused entry. Their <b>Nansen</b> <b>passports</b> were not good enough, apparently. They were ignominiously carted off to Ellis Island in a coal barge. It took frantic string-pulling by Friedberg - involving Mayor La Guardia - {{to get them out}} just in time for their first concert. They weren't in the best state for a concert and thought it wasn't too good. Nevertheless, they got a rave review from the New York Times. This, finally, opened the door to real success in the U.S. Suddenly all the critics were praising them as never before and audiences and bookings flooded in. Considering what soon happened in Europe, the break came just in time.|$|R
2500|$|Between 1916 and 1918, the ICRC {{published}} {{a number of}} postcards with scenes from the POW camps.

After the end of the war, the ICRC organized the return of about 420,000 prisoners to their home countries. In 1920, the task of repatriation was handed over to the newly founded League of Nations, which appointed the Norwegian diplomat and scientist Fridtjof Nansen as its [...] "High Commissioner for Repatriation of the War Prisoners". His legal mandate was later extended to support and care for war refugees and displaced persons when his office became that of the League of Nations [...] "High Commissioner for Refugees". Nansen, who invented the <b>Nansen</b> <b>passport</b> for stateless refugees and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922, appointed two delegates from the ICRC as his deputies.|$|E

5000|$|The first migratory wave of Russians {{began in}} the early 18th century, when Finland was part of Swedish Empire. About 40,000 Russian soldiers, {{civilian}} workers, and about 600 businessmen moved to the Grand Duchy of Finland, which was part of Russian Empire since 1809. When Finland became independent (1917), many soldiers returned to Russia. Many businessmen stayed, including the Sinebrychoff family. During the Russian Revolution many aristocrats and officers fled to Finland as refugees. The biggest refugee wave was in 1922 when about 33,500 persons came to Finland. Many of them had <b>Nansen</b> <b>passports</b> for many years. During the Kronstadt Rebellion about 1,600 officers fled to Finland. Russian citizens who moved in these three waves are called [...] "Old Russians", whose 3-5,000 descendants live in Finland today.|$|R
500|$|A {{major problem}} impeding Nansen's {{work on behalf}} of {{refugees}} was that most of them lacked documentary proof of identity or nationality. Without legal status in their country of refuge, their lack of papers meant they were unable to go anywhere else. To overcome this, Nansen devised a document that became known as the [...] "Nansen passport", a form of identity for stateless persons that was in time recognised by more than 50 governments, and which allowed refugees to cross borders legally. Among the more distinguished holders of <b>Nansen</b> <b>passports</b> were the artist Marc Chagall, the composer Igor Stravinsky, and the dancer Anna Pavlova. Although the passport was created initially for refugees from Russia, it was extended to cover other groups. After the Greco-Turkish wars of 1919–1922 Nansen travelled to Istanbul to negotiate the resettlement {{of hundreds of thousands of}} refugees, mainly ethnic Greeks who had fled from Turkey after the defeat of the Greek Army. The impoverished Greek state was unable to take them in, and so Nansen devised a scheme for a population exchange whereby half a million Turks in Greece were returned to Turkey, with full financial compensation, while further loans facilitated the absorption of the refugee Greeks into their homeland. Despite some controversy over the principle of a population exchange, the plan was implemented successfully over a period of several years. In November 1922, while attending the Conference of Lausanne, Nansen learned that he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1922. The citation referred to [...] "his work for the repatriation of the prisoners of war, his work for the Russian refugees, his work to bring succour to the millions of Russians afflicted by famine, and finally his present work for the refugees in Asia Minor and Thrace". Nansen donated the prize money to international relief efforts.|$|R
5000|$|Anxious {{to limit}} {{immigration}} into the United States {{and to maintain}} {{good relations with the}} Vichy government, the U.S. State Department actively discouraged diplomats from helping refugees. In Marseilles, as elsewhere, foreign service staff usually showed little flexibility or compassion towards the desperate refugees. However, American rescue workers soon noticed that [...] "Harry" [...] Bingham was an exception. Bingham personally toured some of the wretched internment camps and sought American aid to improve conditions. He helped many refugees to avoid internment and prepare for emigration and freely issued <b>Nansen</b> <b>passports,</b> a useful form of identity for stateless persons. An American rescue worker, Martha Sharp, organized a group of children to leave southern France for the US in late 1940. She {{had this to say about}} Bingham, “I am proud that our government is represented in its Foreign Services by a man of your quality,” she wrote. “I feel so deeply about this that I shall take the earliest opportunity to transmit it through the Unitarian Service Committee to the United States State Department, for I believe that such humane and cooperative handling of individuals is what we need most coupled with intelligence and good breeding." [...] Bingham also cooperated a great deal with Varian Fry, the most effective rescue worker based in Vichy France during the early years of the war. Bingham worked with Fry on notable cases, including the emigration of Marc Chagall, political theorist Hannah Arendt, novelist Lion Feuchtwanger, and many other distinguished refugees. In the case of Feuchtwanger, Bingham went so far as to help spirit the novelist out of an internment camp and sheltered him in his own house while plans were made to help the refugee walk over the Pyrenees.|$|R

Nansen donated the prize money to international relief efforts.From 1925 onwards he spent much time trying to help Armenian refugees, victims of Armenian Genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War and further ill-treatment thereafter. His goal was the establishment of a national home for these refugees, within the borders of Soviet Armenia. His main assistant in this endeavour was Vidkun Quisling, the future Nazi collaborator and head of a Norwegian puppet government during the Second World War. After visiting the region, Nansen presented the Assembly with a modest plan for the irrigation of 36,000 hectares (360 km2 or 139 square miles) on which 15,000 refugees could be settled. The plan ultimately failed, because even with Nansen's unremitting advocacy the money to finance the scheme was not forthcoming. Despite this failure, his reputation among the Armenian people remains high. Nansen wrote the book, Armenia and the Near East in 1923 which describes his sympathies to the plight of the Armenians in the wake of losing its independence to the Soviet Union. The book was translated in many languages including Norwegian, English, French, German, Russian and Armenian. After his visit to Armenia, Nansen wrote two additional books called [...] "Gjennem Armenia" [...] ("Across Armenia"), published in 1927 and [...] "Gjennem Kaukasus til Volga" [...] ("Through Caucasus to Volga").|$|R
