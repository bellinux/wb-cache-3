25|$|She {{was born}} Lenuța Petrescu into a peasant family in Petrești commune, Dâmbovița County, in the {{informal}} region of Wallachia. Her father {{worked as a}} ploughman. Her records show she left school with a good mark only in needlework in primary school. After primary school, she moved along with her brother to Bucharest, where {{she worked as a}} laboratory assistant before getting a job at a textile factory. She joined the Romanian Communist Party in 1939 and met 21-year-old Nicolae Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu was instantly attracted to her which, reportedly, made him <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> another woman in a romantic manner. Their relationship was interrupted by Ceaușescu's frequent stints in prison, but they finally married on 23 December 1947.|$|E
500|$|Thirty Flights of Loving {{received}} generally favorable reviews upon release. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the game received an average score of 88 out of 100, based on 10 reviews. Destructoid Patrick Hancock awarded the game 9.5 out of 10, stating that [...] "you'll <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> linear storytelling {{the same way}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it," [...] said Benjy, {{whose eyes}} {{were not yet}} quite dry, [...] "he <b>never</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> anything, or thinks of anything, when he goes sketching." ...|$|R
6000|$|Francie <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{her as she}} had <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> any one in her life, {{and then}} said: [...] "Good-bye, Mr. Probert--good-bye, Susan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have {{surprised}} you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within {{the circle of}} our acquaintance, whose name {{would have given the}} lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who <b>never</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> you in his life! It is admirable!" ...|$|R
500|$|Mark Edwards of Stylus Magazine {{opined that}} [...] "The Holy Bible is easily {{one of the}} best albums of the 90s—ignored by many, but loved {{intensely}} by the few who've lived with it over the years [...] It puts everything the Manics have done since to shame, not to mention nearly everything else [...] ". Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic dubbed it a [...] "classic" [...] and concluded: [...] "Punk, hard rock, indie, and even metal fans owe it to themselves to hear this. Anyone else may be scared off, but may just find they <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> life the same way again. I certainly haven't." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} purpose of MTV {{was to be}} [...] "music television", playing music videos 24 {{hours a day and}} seven days a week, guided by on-air personalities known as VJs, or video jockeys. The original slogans of the channel were [...] "You'll <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> music the same way again", and [...] "On cable. In stereo." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the US {{establishment}} {{celebrated the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} fall of the Berlin Wall in November 2009, Chomsky said this commemoration ignored a forgotten human rights violation that occurred only one week after that event. On November 16, 1989, the US-armed Atlacatl Battalion in El Salvador assassinated six leading Latin American Jesuit priests, he explained. He contrasted the US' [...] "self-congratulation" [...] of the Berlin Wall destruction with the [...] "resounding silence" [...] that surrounds the assassination of these priests, contending that the US sacrifices democratic principles for its own self-interest, and without any self-criticism it tends to [...] "focus a laser light on the crimes of enemies, but crucially we make sure to <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With Maisie." [...] Even now she <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the child, {{who stood}} there equally {{associated}} and disconnected. [...] "For having no moral sense." ...|$|R
6000|$|This again seemed amusing to the Captain. [...] "She mixed him up, {{your old}} governess. He's an awful beast. Your mother <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him." ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}}s, Ringer responded [...] "Honestly, my number-one motivation is my family". While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. I know for a fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, {{professor}} and New York Times writer Jay Dolan critiqued Generations for not talking more about class, race and sex, to which Neil Howe replied that they [...] "are probably generalizations not even {{as effective as}} a generation {{to say something about}} how people think and behave. One of the things to understand is that most historians <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullient and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you would have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Eden faulted the United States for {{forcing him}} to withdraw, but he took credit for United Nations action in patrolling the Israeli-Egyptian borders. Eden said of the invasion, [...] "Peace at any price has never averted war. We must not repeat the {{mistakes}} of the pre-war years, by behaving as though the enemies of peace and order are armed with only good intentions." [...] Recalling the incident in a 1967 interview, he declared, [...] "I am still unrepentant about Suez. People <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{what would have happened if}} we had done nothing. There is a parallel with the 1930s. If you allow people to break agreements with impunity, the appetite grows to feed on such things. I don't see what other we ought to have done. One cannot dodge. It is hard to act rather than dodge." [...] In his 1967 interview (which he stipulated would not be used until after his death), Eden acknowledged secret dealings with the French and [...] "intimations" [...] of the Israeli attack. He insisted, however, that [...] "the joint enterprise and the preparations for it were justified in the light of the wrongs it [...] was designed to prevent." [...] "I have no apologies to offer," [...] Eden declared.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're quite right. I <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{it in that}} way. Baxter wouldn't risk {{a second}} disaster. I'll {{certainly}} make a success of it this time." ...|$|R

2500|$|Once Io {{was given}} to Hera, she tied her to a tree and sent her servant Argus to keep Io {{separated}} from Zeus. [...] Argus was a loyal servant to Hera and he has immense strength and one hundred eyes all over his body. It {{was not possible to}} go past Argus since he never closed more than half his eyes at any time. Zeus was afraid of Hera's wrath could not personally intervene, so to save Io, he commanded Hermes to kill Argus, which he does by lulling all one hundred eyes into eternal sleep. In Ovid's interpolation, when Hera learned of Argus' death, she took his eyes and placed them in the plumage of the peacock, her favorite animal, accounting for the eye pattern in its tail and making it the vainest of all animals. Hera, furious about Io being free and the death of Argus, sent a gadfly (Greek oistros, compare oestrus) to sting Io as she wandered the earth. [...] Eventually Io made it to Egypt, the Egyptians worshiped the snow-white heifer and named her the Egyptian goddess Isis. [...] Hera permitted Zeus to change Io back into her human form, under the condition that he <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her again. [...] Io, the goddess-queen of Egypt, then bore Zeus' son as the next King.|$|E

6000|$|... "I daresay it is!" [...] my {{companion}} exclaimed {{as if this}} were a very happy suggestion. [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> any of those things." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the rich}} ladies <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the poor little king {{squatting}} upon his stool. They gathered at once about the chief counselor, who acted as auctioneer.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{course she}} blushed, {{and of course}} she stammered But {{in spite of her}} {{stammering}} she could say a word. 'I dare say you <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Rather," [...] said Kipps. [...] "What do you think?" [...] and {{wondered}} {{in his heart}} of hearts why he had <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> that sixpence for so long.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I would <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him if {{he should}} let that prevent him!' the old woman cried. 'It isn't for your sister he loves you, I suppose; is it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|She is hideous, more hideous than {{anything}} you can imagine, with owl's eyes, foxy face, and cat's claws. Do you hear? do you hear? Be sure you <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. G.—Sure to be good, {{but not in}} the session. I <b>never</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> [...] Dante unless I {{can have}} a great {{continuous}} draught of him. He’s [...] too big, he seizes and masters you.|$|E
