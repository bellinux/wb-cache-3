500|$|Part of Kavner's {{contract}} {{says that}} she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video and she rarely performs Marge's voice in public because she believes it [...] "destroys the illusion. People feel these are real people." [...] Kavner takes recording sessions seriously, and feels that voice acting is, [...] "a little more limiting than live acting. And I have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> character's movement." [...] Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart Simpson, said in her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that Kavner is [...] "a workhorse of an actor" [...] with [...] "extraordinary professionalism and quiet work ethic", and notes that she is rarely late for recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|Marge's {{voice is}} {{performed}} by Julie Kavner, who also does {{the voices of}} Marge's mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma. Kavner {{had been part of}} the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Kavner and fellow cast member Dan Castellaneta to voice Marge and Homer rather than hire more actors.

500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E

500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
2500|$|On his website, he {{discussed}} the false allegation, saying, [...] "The accusation that I {{do not speak}} or interact with ladies who are not veiled is an absurdity.... It's true that I have asked my manager to respectfully request that lady presenters refrain from embracing me when giving awards or during public appearances, but that has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> feelings or respect for them. Islam simply requires me to honour the dignity of ladies or young girls who are not closely related to me, and avoid physical intimacy, however innocent it may be." [...] He added, [...] "My four daughters all follow the basic wearing of clothes which modestly cover their God-given beauty. They're extremely well educated; they do not cover their faces and interact perfectly well with friends and society." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first test}} flight {{coincided with a}} visit by United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to China, and was {{initially}} interpreted by the Pentagon as a possible signal to the visiting U.S. delegation. Speaking to reporters in Beijing, secretary Gates said [...] "I asked President Hu about it directly, {{and he said that}} the test had absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> visit and there had been a pre-planned test." [...] Hu seemed surprised by Gates' inquiry, prompting speculations that the test might have been a signal sent unilaterally by the Chinese military. [...] Abraham M. Denmark of the Center for New American Security in Washington, along with Michael Swaine, an expert on the PLA and United States–China military relations, explained that senior officials are not involved in day-to-day management of aircraft development and were unaware of the test.|$|E

2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} this past week, where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E

5000|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in September 1997, when a {{group of}} youths {{reportedly}} gathered at Yeomans's home on several consecutive nights, on each occasion throwing eggs, margarine, butter, cakes, and mud at the house and shouting taunts aimed at Yeomans. Her mother later said that the incident prompted Yeomans to tell her family, [...] "It is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Daddy, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Mummy, and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Sarah (her sister).
