50|$|At the {{microwave}} frequencies {{used in many}} parabolic antennas, waveguide is required to conduct {{the microwave}}s between the feed antenna and transmitter or receiver. Because of {{the high cost of}} waveguide runs, in many parabolic antennas the RF front end electronics of the receiver is located at the feed antenna, and the received signal is converted to a lower intermediate frequency (IF) so it can be conducted to the receiver through cheaper coaxial cable. This is generally called a low <b>noise</b> <b>amplifier</b> (LNA). Similarly, in transmitting dishes, the microwave transmitter may be located at the feed point.|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the horizontal bar of the T {{is based on the}} rigid coaxial cable with air as dielectric. The radius is chosen to be as large as possible without allowing higher modes.The design of a bias [...] "T" [...] is based upon power going out to the remote device, but not being seen by the base station or receiver. It does this by using a capacitor on the RF output terminal, effectively creating an open circuit for the DC current. [...] The incoming RF signal, or the one from the antenna, is the output for the DC power. This front-end of a bias [...] "T" [...] typically consists of a bandpass filter, a low <b>noise</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and a mixer coupled to a local oscillator.|$|E
5000|$|An MWA antenna {{comprises}} {{four by four}} regular grid of dual-polarisation dipole elements {{arranged on}} a 4m x 4m steel mesh ground plane. Each antenna (with its 16 dipoles) {{is known as a}} [...] "tile". Signals from each dipole pass through a low <b>noise</b> <b>amplifier</b> (LNA) and are combined in an analogue beamformer to produce tile beams on the sky. Beamformers sit next to the tiles in the field. The radio frequency (RF) signals for the tile-beams are transmitted to a receiver, each receiver being able to process the signals from a group of eight tiles. Receivers therefore sit in the field, close to groups of eight tiles; cables between receivers and beamformers carry data, power and control signals. Power for the receivers is provided from a central generator. The receiver contains analogue elements to condition the signals in preparation for sampling and digitisation. The frequency range 80-300 MHz is Nyquist-sampled at high precision. Digital elements in the receiver (after the digitiser) are used to transform the time-series data to the frequency domain with a 1.28 MHz resolution - 5 bits real and 5 bits imaginary for each resolution element. Sets of 1.28 MHz coarse frequency channels are transmitted via an optical fibre connection to the correlator subsystem, located in the CSIRO Data Processing Facility near the MWA site. MWA shares the CSIRO facility with the ASKAP program.|$|E
