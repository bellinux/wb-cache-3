5|$|Widgiemoolthalite {{was first}} found at 132 North, a <b>nickel</b> <b>deposit</b> near Widgiemooltha, Western Australia. Blair J. Gartrell {{collected}} the holotype widgiemoolthalite specimen from a stockpile of secondary minerals at the site. The mineral {{was discovered in}} 1992 and was first reported in American Mineralogist in 1993 by Ernest H. Nickel, Bruce W. Robinson, and William G. Mumme, when it received its name for its type locality. Widgiemoolthalite's existence was confirmed and name {{was approved by the}} Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names of the International Mineralogical Association the same year. The holotype specimen was stored in Perth's Western Australian Museum.|$|E
25|$|In June 2002, Inco {{announced}} {{an agreement with}} the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador on a three phase plan to develop the Voisey's Bay <b>nickel</b> <b>deposit.</b> The $1 billion initial phase of the Voisey's Bay agreement provided for mine and mill infrastructure development at Voisey's Bay, and a research and development program in hydrometallurgical processing which would include a demonstration plant to be built at Argentia. the demonstration plant at Argentia was constructed and operated from 2004 to 2007. The demonstration plant was an initial step toward the ultimate development of a commercial hydrometallurgical processing facility to be constructed and operated in Long Harbour, Newfoundland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Spherical {{abrasives}} {{were employed}} to polish the growing <b>deposited</b> layer during <b>nickel</b> electroforming process. On a translational flat cathode, <b>nickel</b> <b>deposits</b> with distinct polishing mark were obtained. It {{was found that the}} abrasive polishing can help to improve the microstructure and increase the mechanical properties of the <b>nickel</b> <b>deposits.</b> Compared with the deposits prepared with traditional method, the microstructure became more homogeneous and the microhardness increased nearly two times. The increase of current density led to coarse structure and lower microhardness...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{magnesium}} salts {{was measured in}} Watts-type and Wesley all-chloride type nickel plating baths. The deposition potential of nickel was low-ered (metal became more noble), polarization was reduced, and results on de-composition potentials were inconclusive. <b>Nickel</b> <b>deposited</b> from all baths under test had a face-centered cubic lattice, and magnesium was present only in spectroscopic traces. It was found that addition of magnesium salts increased cathode current efficiency, improved throwing power, and reduced porosity of the nickel, as revealed by the ferroxyl test. At low concentrations of mag-nesium salts the mechanical properties of <b>nickel</b> <b>deposits</b> were not changed materially, but at high concentrations deposits were harder, more brittle, and had a higher tensile strength. The effect on residual stress in <b>nickel</b> <b>deposits</b> was not measured. It {{has been shown that}} properties of electrode-posited nickel are dependent on a number of factors...|$|R

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of <b>nickel</b> <b>deposits</b> {{are known to}} be related to their crystallographic textures. Although there has been significant work investigating the relationship between crystallographic textures and {{magnetic properties}} of sputtered ferro-magnetic films, relatively less effort has been spent on studying electroformed nickels. Orientation distribution functions and coercivity of the <b>nickel</b> <b>deposits,</b> electroformed by using a nickel sulphamate bath and pulse-reverse currents, have been determined and their relationship examined. It was found that the [1 0 0] fibre texture with different orientation densities was formed at different on-times and off-times, and that at the same deposition thickness the coercivity increased with increase in the orientation density of the [1 0 0] fibre texture. This findings are of high significance as they can serve as guidelines for the production of <b>nickel</b> <b>deposits</b> with defined magnetic properties through the control of crystallographic texture by varying the pulse parameters in pulse-reverse current electroforming.
