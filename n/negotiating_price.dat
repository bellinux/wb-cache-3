30|$|Management {{practices}} {{refer to}} methods farmers use to impact productivity, {{with or without}} the use of a specific technology. Management practices included in our analysis are Regularly Scheduled Veterinary Services, Use of a Nutritionist to Design Feed Mixes or Purchase Feed, Keeping Individual Cow Production Records, Forward Purchasing of Inputs, and <b>Negotiating</b> <b>Price</b> Discounts for Dairy Inputs. Production systems differ if switching from one to another involves a fundamental change in the way the farm is managed on a daily basis. Production systems included in our analysis are Milk Cows Three or More Times per Day, Use of a Dairy Parlor, Pasture-based Milk Production, Organic Milk Production, and Controlling the Breeding and/or Calving Season. Note that use of our selected TMPPS does not necessarily increase production or efficiency. For example, pasture-based systems generally require more land and less variable input per unit of milk relative to conventional systems, while producing less milk per cow. Pruitt et al. ([2012]) similarly categorized TMPPS for U.S. cow-calf farms, without separating the technologies into subcategories.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the EU government’s {{choice of a}} proper policy instrument given the cost structure of the foreign firms that are present at the EU market. The empirical model {{which is based on}} a 2 -digit Combined Nomenclature (CN) level sector data and information on the EU anti-dumping (AD) and production subsidy investigations from 1985 - 1995 supports the theoretical findings that the EU maximizes its social welfare if it imposes definitive AD measures on the foreign firm which enjoy location-specific and thus nontransferable cost advantage, and subsidizes domestic production if the foreign firm with transferable cost advantage can avoid AD duties by undertaking FDI. The overview of AD and production subsidy cases in the EU shows important changes in targeting sectors and countries in the observed period. Most of the AD cases that ended in imposition of definitive duties or <b>negotiating</b> <b>price</b> undertakings affected low-wage developing East-Asian countries and non-market economies. On a sectoral level, chemical products followed by capital-intensive sectors accounted for more than 70 percent of all affirmative cases. So called strategically important sectors that were highly privileged in the early 1980 s switched to an alternative form of protection: production subsidies. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{simultaneous}} model of consumer brand choice and <b>negotiated</b> <b>price</b> {{in the highly}} relevant marketing context of automobile transactions. Consumer brand choice is modeled as a multinomial probabilistic outcome, and the individual consumer-level transaction price is modeled {{to be consistent with}} the Nash bargaining solution. Our simultaneous model introduces a natural way to account for price endogeneity in a microlevel choice setting when the price paid is individual specific and correlated with the idiosyncratic preference of a buyer. It also accounts for the potential selectivity bias in studying the <b>negotiated</b> <b>price</b> by integrating consumer brand choice modeling. We apply the proposed model to a data set of 4, 795 consumer automobile purchases. The empirical results show that the proposed approach not only better fits the data of consumer choice and <b>negotiated</b> <b>price,</b> but it also provides additional insights into buyers' and sellers' behaviors in comparison with models that study only consumer choice or the <b>negotiated</b> <b>price,</b> but not both simultaneously. choice models, negotiation, simulation-based estimation methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of suppliers {{who do not}} deliver materials in the quality, quantity and delivery time requested is a common phenomenon {{that has been the}} heart of many problems in purchasing management. If the supply problem continues, the company will find difficulties in carrying out its supply chain management and simultaneously, fail in serving its market. This paper emphasizes the global purchasing where the complexities of global purchasing have leveraged supply risks and accordingly, require special attention from the company. Basically, the continuous success in procuring globally lays on the company?s ability in select the right suppliers, continued with managing its relationship with its suppliers and unforgettably, leveraging its bargaining power. To select the right global suppliers, the purchasing company initially has to decide from what country it wants to source according to the assessment in the country environment that afterwards followed by analysis on the company?s internal environment in comparison to the purchasing company?s condition. Meanwhile, Supplier Relationship Management becomes the backbone in managing global suppliers, in which the SRM system characterized by the employment of exclusive purchasing professionals, constant communication, and coordination with the suppliers and meticulous evaluation system that aims to develop closer relationship with suppliers.

40|$|South Africa {{provides}} a useful country case study for financing vaccinations. It has been an early adopter of new vaccinations and has financed these almost exclusively from domestic resources, largely through general taxation. National vaccination policy {{is determined by the}} Department of Health, based on advice from a national advisory group on immunisation. Standard health economic criteria of effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, affordability and burden of disease are used to assess whether new vaccinations should be introduced. Global guidelines and the advice of local and international experts are also helpful in making the determination to introduce new vaccines. In terms of recent decisions to introduce new vaccines against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus diarrhoea in children, the evidence has proved unequivocal. Universal rollout has been implemented even though this has led to a fivefold increase in national spending on vaccines. The total cost to government remains below 1 - 1. 5 % of public expenditures for health, which is viewed by the South African authorities as affordable and necessary given the number of lives saved and morbidity averted. To manage the rapid increase in domestic spending, efforts have been made to scale up coverage over several years, give greater attention to <b>negotiating</b> <b>price</b> reductions and, in some cases, obtain initial donations or frontloaded deliveries to facilitate earlier universal rollout.

40|$|Financial {{pressures}} on healthcare {{industry in the}} United States and elsewhere have forced the industry to address their supply costs, their fastest growing cost sector currently comprising over 40 % of their total spend. In the USA, the healthcare supplies market is dominated by a few large distributors and significant barriers to entry. Cost reducing measures to date have relied on Group Purchasing Organizations to leverage economies of scale in <b>negotiating</b> <b>price</b> reductions. Recently, the healthcare industry has been deemphasizing this practice. In doing so, healthcare organizations have merged to form large Integrated Delivery Networks, leveraging their collective purchasing capacity to negotiate price reductions. These organizations have essentially created their own internal Group Purchasing Organizations to compete with external suppliers. Although these ventures have been publicized to be “successful”, their overall success cannot be independently validated. Furthermore, the operational details of creating these ventures, financial analyses, and operations are not publically available. Our ultimate objective is to model the creation of ventures in which healthcare organizations enter price competitions with their external vendors using the currently prevalent market parameters and practices. Specifically, the models would identify and quantitate the parameters that determine venture success, here referred to as Venture Success Metrics. Such models would comprise multiple external suppliers of different products that belong to different categories. This thesis is our first step towards that objective. It represents a simplified venture in which the hospital runs its own warehouse as a profit center that competes with one external vendor on a single supply item. The model is based on currently prevalent healthcare industry practices. In particular, it incorporates discount schedules that accurately account for the unique healthcare industry practice of offering year- 2 volume-based discounts based on year- 1 volumes, restricted only to the contract period. Modeling a simplified venture enabled us to identify and quantitate the parameters that determine venture success. These parameters comprise the vendor and warehouse year- 1 profit objectives {{as well as the}} bias of the hospital’s purchases from its own warehouse. Pursuing the models of the thesis induced the development of healthcare-relevant sigmoidal discount schedules. These functions accurately represent the tabular step-function discount schedules while averting the infinite and discontinuous derivatives of the latter. Their “continuous derivatives” advantage renders the sigmoidal discounts readily useable in computing price equilibria, a feat that was not easily achievable with the rigid step-function discounts. The thesis also introduces novel demand split functions in which a customer’s total demand can be equitably apportioned across all suppliers subject to diverse business objectives such as price constraints or biasing purchases in favor of one or more suppliers while retaining equitability. The ultimate economic goal for achieving equitability is to conserve supply source. The demand split methodology introduced in this thesis can be characterized as “achieving equitability under business constraints”. A series of examples are provided to illustrate the methods developed in this research. Finally, the thesis concludes with a synopsis of the findings and future extensions. 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|Large scale, distributed, digital environments offer vast potential. Within these environments, {{software}} {{systems will}} provide unprecedented support for daily life. Offering access to {{vast amounts of}} knowledge and resources, these systems will enable wider participation of society, at large. An example is the Smart Energy Grid that increases sustainability and decreases reliance on fossil fuels. Such systems require technology {{that is capable of}} negotiating Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and providers. Multi Agent Systems (MAS) is one such technology that offers a straightforward analog for complex systems of autonomous parties. MAS is based on the notion of autonomous agents that represent human actors (i. e. owners) and are capable of negotiating SLAs and coordinating processes with other agents. They know their owner’s preferences and needs. They are capable of <b>negotiating</b> <b>price,</b> Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics and penalties. They also monitor provisioning of services to detect and penalize service violations. This dissertation presents a MAS framework for automated negotiation and monitoring of SLAs in open environments. In this context, an open environment is a large-scale, distributed environment that is also dynamic and untrusted. This framework enables secure discovery, negotiation and access to distributed resources. Through a process of exchanging messages (e. g. offers, counter-offers), agents together search for a mutually acceptable agreement (e. g. service, price, quality). A negotiation protocol defines the negotiation objects (i. e. offers), language and rules governing interaction. This dissertation presents the WS-Agreement Negotiation protocol with extensions for open environments. This protocol is experimentally validated in the AgentScape middleware. Open environments also present challenges regarding security, trust and privacy. No single authority has complete control over an open environment and no single authority governs the actions of all participants (i. e. agents). Therefore, additional mechanisms are required to ensure security, privacy and promote trust between participants. Automated monitoring mechanisms using a Trusted Third Party (TTP) address issues of security and thus support negotiation in open environments. This dissertation presents a self-adaptive monitoring approach that (1) offers monitoring assurance that agreements are honored, (2) builds a secure audit log of agreement compliance, (3) performs measurements while safeguarding privacy of (sensitive) data, (4) dynamically reacts to changes in risk and (5) enables trust-building between consumers and providers. This monitoring approach is experimentally validated in the AgentScape middleware. Automation of complex tasks, such as negotiation, can increase efficiency. To illustrate these benefits, the framework is applied to two complex systems, including the Smart Energy Grid. In this case, the looming complexity crisis of intermittent generation, real-time pricing and consumer demand shifting requires immediate attention. This domain presents not only technical (e. g. smart-meters) but also social challenges (e. g. user acceptance). The MAS automation framework presented in this dissertation addresses technical challenges by reducing manual labor and increasing efficiency. Automation even enables higher utilization of green resources and reduction of waste (e. g. produced, but unconsumed energy). Transparent, trusted monitoring mechanisms address social challenges by ensuring privacy of (sensitive) data and encouraging user acceptance. Software systems, such as those presented in this dissertation, enable wider participation of society, at large, and offer vast potential. Multi Actor SystemsTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|E
