5|$|Trew {{contends that}} the capture of {{northern}} Caen had a psychological impact on the French population, convincing them the Allies were there to stay and that the liberation of France could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> off. By Operation Charnwood's conclusion, Allied losses since 6 June had amounted to over 30,000 men, excluding {{those who had been}} evacuated due to sickness and those suffering from battle exhaustion. Buckley believes Charnwood to have been a good idea but one that proved better in concept than in execution, influenced as it was by the mounting political pressure on 21st Army Group to produce results. Copp wrote that the broad-based assault plan across the entire front worked, preventing the Germans bringing to bear superior firepower on any one formation.|$|E
25|$|As already mentioned, the Spanish {{version of}} the Halakot Gedolot, {{probably}} made about 1000, adopted these four sections as a complete treatise; hence one would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> wrong in setting the 9th century as the date of composition. The first four sections date from a much earlier period. From their contents they may even have been an independent collection already in existence {{at the time of}} the Tannaim. At any rate this collection contains much that is old, even if it can not be proved that the Megillat Ḥasidim, which is cited in Abot de-Rabbi Natan (ed. Schechter, xxvi. 52), is identical with the treatise under discussion.|$|E
25|$|With a licence in place, {{from late}} 1955 all Alvis bodies became based on Graber designs however few chassis and few bodies were {{built over the}} next two years. Around 15 or 16 TC108/Gs were built by Willowbrook Limited of Loughborough and Willowbrook was {{subsequently}} taken over by Duple Coachbuilders. Over the same two years Graber built 22 TC 108Gs and complained that if he had received chassis he would have committed himself to buying 20 a year. Only after late 1958 with the launch of the TD 21 did something resembling full-scale production resume as Rolls-Royce subsidiary Park Ward began to build the new bodies now modified in many small ways. These cars, the TD 21 and its later variants, the TE 21 and finally the TF 21 are well built, attractive and fast cars. However it was clear by the mid-1960s that with a price tag of nearly double that of the mass-produced Jaguar, the end could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> off.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the defeated strike, Gene Debs was incarcerated for six months at Woodstock Jail in Chicago, where he was turned to the doctrine of socialism by the jailhouse visits of Milwaukee newspaper editor Victor L. Berger. Stedman would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> behind the union leader, following a brief stint in the People's Party as a radical populist. He was an early booster of Debs for President of the United States, helping to establish the [...] "Central E.V. Debs Club" [...] in Chicago on May 20, 1896, and being elected president of the new booster organization by the gathering.|$|E
2500|$|Frans Luidinga, who in 1995 {{published}} {{a book about his}} father Tjalling Luidinga, points out that had Slamat left on time, the convoy would have been only [...] further south {{at the time of the}} attack. This was still in range from Jg 77's base at Almyros and unlikely to have given enough advantage to the RAF's diminished fighter cover. The Germans knew the convoy would spend the night of 26–27 April evacuating troops from Nauplia and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> beyond the Argolic Gulf by daybreak. Frans Luidinga blames the Royal Navy for including troop ships in the evacuation, asserting that only warships had the speed, manoeuvrability and firepower to return from Nauplia under fire.|$|E

2500|$|Transhumanists {{and other}} {{supporters}} of human genetic engineering do not dismiss practical concerns out of hand, insofar {{as there is}} a high degree of uncertainty about the timelines and likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans. However, bioethicist James Hughes suggests that one possible ethical route to the genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages is the building of computer models of the human genome, the proteins it specifies and the tissue engineering he argues that it also codes for. With the exponential progress in bioinformatics, Hughes believes that a virtual model of genetic expression in the human body will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> behind and that it will soon be possible to accelerate approval of genetic modifications by simulating their effects on virtual humans. Public health professor Gregory Stock points to artificial chromosomes as an alleged safer alternative to existing genetic engineering techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Harlan {{was also}} the most stridently anti-imperialist justice on the Supreme Court, arguing {{consistently}} in the Insular Cases (from 1901 to 1905) that the Constitution did not permit the demarcation of different rights between citizens of {{the states and the}} residents of newly acquired territories in the Philippines, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico, a view that was consistently in the minority. In Hawaii v. Mankichi (1903) his opinion stated: [...] "If the principles now announced should become firmly established, the time may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> distant when, under the exactions of trade and commerce, and to gratify an ambition to become the dominant power in all the earth, the United States will acquire territories in every direction... whose inhabitants will be regarded as 'subjects' or 'dependent peoples,' to be controlled as Congress may see fit... which will engraft on our republican institutions a colonial system entirely foreign to the genius of our Government and abhorrent to the principles that underlie and pervade our Constitution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Le Griffon {{may have}} been found by the Great Lakes Exploration Group but the {{potential}} remains were the subject of lawsuits involving the discoverers, the state of Michigan, the U.S. federal government, and the Government of France. [...] Originally discovered in 2001 near Poverty Island, Michigan sonar has shown an object approximately [...] (similar to the dimensions of Le Griffon) located under several feet of sediment. [...] In July, 2010 the Great Lakes Exploration Group issued a press release stating that they, the state of Michigan and France had reached agreement to co-operate in {{the next phase of}} an archaeological site assessment for identifying the shipwreck. [...] After years of legal squabbles the Michigan Department of Natural Resources issued a permit, and on June 16, 2013, an underwater pit was dug allowing US and French archeologists to examine the object for the first time. [...] They discovered a 15-inch slab of blackened wood that might have been a human-fashioned cultural artifact. On June 19, 2013, teams of scientists determined the wood pole discovered was not attached to a ship, after it came loose and was placed on the lake bed during an excavation. They concluded it was likely a bowsprit dating from a ship hundreds of years old, although some think it was a common pound net stake used for fishing nets in the 19th century. At the time, no other wreckage was found, but scientists noted other wreckage may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> away.|$|E

2500|$|Sorge {{arrived in}} Yokohama on 6 September 1933. After landing in Japan, Sorge became the Japan {{correspondent}} for the Frankfurter Zeitung. As the Frankfurter Zeitung was the most prestigious newspaper in Germany, Sorge's status as the Tokyo {{correspondent for the}} Frankfurter Zeitung made him {{in many ways the}} most senior German reporter in Japan. Sorge's reputation as a Nazi journalist who detested the Soviet Union served as an excellent [...] "cover" [...] for his espionage work. Sorge was told by his GRU superiors that his mission in Japan was to [...] "give very careful study {{to the question of whether}} or not Japan was planning to attack the USSR". After his arrest in 1941, Sorge told his captors: [...] "This was for many years the most important duty assigned to me and my group; it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> wrong to say that it was the sole object of my mission in Japan...The USSR, as it viewed the prominent role and attitude taken by the Japanese military in foreign policy after the Manchurian incident, had come to harbor a deeply implanted suspicion that Japan was planning to attack the Soviet Union, a suspicion so strong that my frequently expressed opinions to the contrary were not always fully appreciated in Moscow..." [...] He was warned by his commanders not to have contact with the underground Japanese Communist Party or with the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo. His intelligence network in Japan included Red Army officer and radio operator Max Clausen, Hotsumi Ozaki, and two other Comintern agents, Branko Vukelić, a journalist working for the French magazine, Vu, and a Japanese journalist, Miyagi Yotoku, who was employed by the English-language newspaper, the Japan Advertiser. Max Clausen's wife Anna acted as ring courier from time to time. From summer 1937, Clausen operated under cover of his business, M Clausen Shokai, suppliers of blueprint machinery and reproduction services. The business had been set up with Soviet funds but in time became a commercial success. Ozaki was a Japanese man from an very influential family who had grown up in Taiwan (at the time a Japanese colony) and was an idealistic Sinophile who believed that Japan, which had started its modernization with the Meiji Restoration, had much to teach China. However, the Sinophile Ozaki was shocked by the racism of Japanese policy towards China with the Chinese being depicted as a people fit only to be slaves. Ozaki believed that the existing political system of Japan with the emperor being worshipped as a living god had to go, and to save Japan from fascism required that Japan be [...] "reconstructed as a socialist state".|$|E
