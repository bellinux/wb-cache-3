40|$|Steam ejector {{refrigeration}} is {{refrigeration system}} utilize waste heat from combustion engine, power plants, and industrial processes {{to generate the}} useful refrigeration. Steam ejector is used to replace the mechanical compressor as refrigerant pumping for circulation in the refrigeration system. Steam ejector refrigeration is using lower-grade power for pumping refrigerant, but COP (Coefficient Of Performance) is low. The steam ejector performance directly affects the refrigerating system performance, the performance of steam ejector can be represented by entrainment ratio defined by ratio of suction mass flow rate to motive mass flow rate. Entrainment ratio value increase will be the refrigeration system COP value increases, because of that an investigation on characteristic and an efficient design of ejector are important to improve ejector refrigeration system performance. In this study, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to predict the flow phenomena and steam ejector performance. Simulation was done by modifying the <b>nosel</b> distance with constant-area section of steam ejector and by varying the operation condition such as pressure and temperature of motive (boiler) and suction (evaporator). The <b>nosel</b> distance with constant-area (throat) section of steam ejector was varied from 0. 1 to 5 times the constant-area section diameter. The temperatur of motive was varied at 85 oC, 95 oC, dan 115 oC while temperature of suction was varied at 27 oC, 32 oC, dan 35 oC. The results of simulation show optimum performance get in <b>nosel</b> distance between 1. 5 to 4 times constant-area section diameter. The bigger <b>nosel</b> throat the entrainment ratio`s value will decrease. The higher temperature of motive the entrainment ratio`s value will decrease while the higher temperature of suction the entrainment ratio`s value will increase...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of different air-polishing powders on the color stability of different types of composite resin restorative materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty cylindrical specimens (15 × 2 mm) were prepared for each of 7 composite resin restorative materials. All specimens were polished with a series of aluminum oxide polishing discs (Sof-Lex). The prepared specimens of each composite resin were randomly divided into 3 groups of 10 specimens each, for control (Group-C) and two air-powder applications (Group-CP: Cavitron Prophy-Jet; Group-PS: Sirona ProSmile prophylaxis powder). A standard air-polishing unit (ProSmile Handly) was used. All specimens were air-powdered for 10 s at 4 -bar pressure. The distance of the spray <b>nosel</b> from the specimens was approximately 10 mm and angulation of the <b>nosel</b> was 90 °. Specimens were stored in 100 mL of coffee (Nescafe Classic) for 24 h at 37 °C. Color measurement of all specimens was recorded before and after exposure to staining agent with a colorimeter (Minolta CR- 300). Color differences (&# 8710;E*) between the 2 color measurements (baseline and after 24 h storage) were calculated. The data were analyzed with a 2 -way ANOVA test, and mean values were compared by the Tukey HSD test (p. 05) and these groups demonstrated the highest &# 8710;E* values. For Filtek Silorane and IntenS, the highest &# 8710;E* values were observed in Group-PS. The lowest &# 8710;E* values for all composite resin groups were observed in Group-C. When comparing the 7 composite resin restorative materials, Aelite Aesthetic Enemal demonstrated significantly less &# 8710;E* values than the other composite resins tested. The highest &# 8710;E* values were observed in Quixfil. CONCLUSION: Except for Quixfil, all control groups of composite resins that were polished Sof-Lex exhibited clinically acceptable &# 8710;E values (< 3. 7). Air-polishing applications increased the color change for all composite resin restorative materials tested. Composite restorations may require re-polishing after air-polishing...|$|E
40|$|The {{fluctuation}} in {{the supply}} {{and the price of}} fuel oil (FUEL OIL) ought to make us realise that the number of available reserves in the earth increasingly diminished. The development of technology biokonversi to produce the vegetable fuel (biofuel) from resources could be renewed now was the main priority. The government announced the plan to reduce the Indonesian dependence on fuel oil (FUEL OIL) by publishing PP Nomor 5 in 2006 about the policy of Nasional Energy. Several researches showed that the sum cetana (CN) biodiesel higher than diesel oil (diesel fuel). The figure cetana in general diesel oil 45, whereas biodiesel 62 to that was based on the oil palm, 51 for the distance of the fence and 62. 7 to that was based on the vegetables coconut [Soerawidjaja, 2003]. His difference that is coconut oil had more oxygen and the value calorie him was lower than diesel fuel, so as to make the process of the burning to coconut oil more perfect and clean. Beside the surplus on coconut oil also had the weakness that is in the use of coconut oil could come closer together so as menyumbat the pipe channel, the filter and especially to the sprayer or <b>nosel.</b> The burning of oil also was able to be not burnt perfect, so as to cause many smokes and to enable the occurrence of carbon sediment on the end the oil sprayer. The success parameter of early of the research pembakaan diffusion of coconut oil was miyak the coconut could be burnt, from results of the research menunjukan that in the pressure 25 C coconut oil could have been burnt but just a few coconut oil that was burnt, that was caused because the low temperature will result in oil that dikabutkan by <b>nosel</b> too few and finally seldom also oil that reacted with oxygen from air that was the condition for the occurrence of the burning. From results of the research could be concluded that coconut oil could be burnt in the temperature of space or the temperature of 25 C. Dan in the temperature 100 C this perfect burning happened dtandai with the colour of the clearest flame. The key word: coconut oil, the Burning of diffusion, the colour of the flam...|$|E

40|$|Btn 2 p, a novel coiled-coil protein, is up-regulated in btn 1 yeast strains, {{and this}} up-regulation {{is thought to}} {{contribute}} to maintaining a stable vacuolar pH in btn 1 strains (D. A. Pearce, T. Ferea, S. A. <b>Nosel,</b> B. Das, and F. Sherman, Nat. Genet. 22 : 55 - 58, 1999). We now report that Btn 2 p interacts biochemically and function-ally with Rsg 1 p, a down-regulator of the Can 1 p arginine and lysine permease. Rsg 1 p localizes to a distinct structure toward the cell periphery, and strains lacking Btn 2 p (btn 2 strains) fail to correctly localize Rsg 1 p. btn 2 strains, like rsg 1 strains, are sensitive for growth {{in the presence of}} the arginine analog canavanine. Furthermore, btn 2 strains, like rsg 1 strains, demonstrate an elevated rate of uptake of [14 C]arginine, which leads to increased intracellular levels of arginine. Overexpression of BTN 2 results in a decreased rate of arginine uptake. Collectively, these results indicate that altered levels of Btn 2 p can modulate arginine uptake through localization of the Can 1 p-arginine permease regulatory protein, Rsg 1 p. Our original identification of Btn 2 p was that it is up-regulated in the btn 1 strain which serves as a model for the lysosomal storage disorder Batten disease. Btn 1 p is a vacuolar/lysosomal membrane protein, and btn 1 suppresses both the canavanine sensitivity and the elevated rate of uptake of arginine displayed by btn 2 rsg 1 strains. We conclude that Btn 2 p interacts with Rsg 1 p and modulates arginine uptake. Up-regulation of BTN 2 expression in btn 1 strains may facilitate either a direct or indirect effect on intracellular arginine levels...|$|E
