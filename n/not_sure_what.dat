5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E
5|$|Unexpectedly, this weak push by Młokosiewicz {{and his men}} {{probably}} {{forced the}} Russians to reconsider their plans and postpone any further attacks until the following day. At that moment Paskevich was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> the Poles would do. He feared a Polish counter-attack would retake the forts of Wola, or strike a wedge between his I and II Corps. He ordered all offensive actions in Wola halted. His artillery continued to duel with the Poles, but infantry was withdrawn and Paskevich himself left his forces {{to look for the}} Corps of General Muraviev to the south, somewhere between Szczęśliwice and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E

25|$|By 1952, as {{the funding}} ended, {{the economy of}} every {{participant}} state had surpassed pre-war levels; for all Marshall Plan recipients, output in 1951 was at least 35% higher than in 1938. Over the next two decades, Western Europe enjoyed unprecedented growth and prosperity, but economists are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> proportion was due directly to the ERP, what proportion indirectly, and how much would have happened without it.|$|E
25|$|Michael realizes Hanna's secret: she is {{illiterate}} and has concealed it {{her whole}} life. The other guards who claim {{she wrote the}} report are lying to place responsibility on Hanna. Michael informs the professor that he has information favourable {{to one of the}} defendants but is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to do since the defendant herself chose not to disclose the information. Michael arranges a visit with Hanna in prison, but once there he leaves without seeing her.|$|E
25|$|M94, also {{classified}} as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms {{and a bright}} core. The outskirts of the galaxy are incredibly luminous in the ultraviolet because of a ring of new stars surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though astronomers are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a bar that is thus far invisible.|$|E

Or whether it’s regressive and stupid and joyless and monotonous and silly and pointless. In fact, let’s call Kaabil {{for what it}} is: a B-movie with well-known actors. Worse, it’s exacerbated by shoddy CG, fake earnestness and a needless item number." ...|$|R

25|$|The Somerville Circle {{is located}} on the border between Bridgewater Township and Raritan, New Jersey, just {{slightly}} northwest of Somerville. The border runs down Route 28 with Raritan having a slightly larger portion of the circle within its borders. The border bisecting the circle usually causes minor confusion when accidents are reported as drivers are often <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> side of the border they are on and which town's police department has jurisdiction. More traffic accidents occur on the Raritan side of the circle than the Bridgewater side.|$|E

After the guilty verdict Roy's father stated publicly that the family were pleased with the verdict but that they wanted privacy and time to process the events they have experienced; Lynn Roy appeared on the CBS '48 Hours' show saying she didn't believe Carter had a conscience and that she knew exactly what she was doing.|$|E
25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could do that, and <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to do in the future. At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E

500|$|The final symphony, the Ninth, was {{completed}} in late 1957 and premiered in April 1958, four months before the composer's death. It is scored for a large orchestra, including three saxophones, a flugelhorn, and an enlarged percussion section. The mood is more sombre {{than that of the}} Eighth; Grove calls its mood [...] "at once heroic and contemplative, defiant and wistfully absorbed". The work received an ovation at its premiere, but at first the critics were <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to make of it, and it took some years for it to be generally ranked alongside its eight predecessors.|$|E
500|$|A Game Boy Color {{version of}} Jet Force Gemini was in {{development}} in 2000, but was ultimately cancelled.

In an October 2012 interview, former Rare designer and producer Martin Wakeley commented: [...] "Jet Force Gemini on the Gameboy was the only occasion I can remember Rare outsourcing anything.

500|$|The soundtrack {{is a mix}} of {{rock and}} roll and rhythm and blues with the {{original}} score created by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who had been a Landis family friend since John Landis was a child. Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to make of it. Similar to his preferring dramatic actors for the comedy, Landis asked Bernstein to score it as though it were serious. He adapted the [...] "Faber College Theme" [...] from the Academic Festival Overture by Brahms, and said that the film opened yet another door in his diverse career, to scoring comedies.|$|E

Jackson's father Joseph also approved of the project and allowed him to record it on the condition that it didn't interfere with group business. Despite his brothers' desire to work with him, Jackson wanted to make the album independently of his family. Nevertheless, his brother Randy still contributed percussion to [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".|$|E

Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has [...] "put a lot of work" [...] into improving it. It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons. She has said that she only feels nervous performing [...] "if I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> the audience thinks of me, like at award shows".|$|E

She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted Coca-Cola from her nose in astonishment. The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: [...] "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast.
