25|$|At school, {{as well as}} in church, Francisco's claimed paranormal power {{constantly}} {{would put}} him into trouble. Once, while in his fourth year of primary school, he claimed to have seen a man who had dictated all his school essays, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to have given him any credits; and not even the teacher seemed to have cared about it. One of his memorial school compositions on the centenary of the independence of Brazil won an honorable mention in a state contest. In 1922 he faced skepticism from colleagues and friends, who accused him of plagiarism, such accusation lasted all his life. Challenged to prove his gifts, Francisco was submitted to the challenge of improvising an essay (with the help of a spirit) about sand grain, the topic was chosen at that very moment, in which, he succeeded.|$|E
500|$|The {{new plan}} drew {{extensive}} criticism. [...] Southside legislators feared that only all-white schools would close. Stanley asserted that his plan would permit him to close black schools {{as well as}} white ones if an all-white school was forced to integrate (although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> able to find this provision in his newly introduced bills). Attorney General Almond voiced his opinion that the new plan would not stop integrationist lawsuits, and that making the governor {{an agent of the}} legislature was clearly unconstitutional. When Speaker Moore later in the day proposed a pupil assignment plan that did not permit local integration, Stanley abandoned his new plan and supported Moore's proposal.|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} special a grade of C, criticizing it {{as a mere}} promotional vehicle for Gaga with the Muppets a last-minute addition. The {{production}} was unable to balance Gaga's album promotion with a Muppets holiday special: [...] "Nothing in Lady Gaga & The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular destroys {{the sanctity of the}} Muppets ... However, the potential for a Muppets holiday special was never given room to materialize amidst a Lady Gaga concert special designed to sell her new album. The choice to combine the two may have reached out to a broader audience, but the incongruence of the special's various parts... was bound to frustrate a sizable portion of that audience." [...] Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times agreed, criticizing the special's commercial nature; he also said its songs were [...] "less fit for a Muppet-like music special, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> willing to stray too far from the show's message of selling a product. Rather than aim for holiday timelessness, this was self-promotion, with the Muppets often coming to Gaga's world than the other way around." [...] Billboards Chris Willman also gave it a negative review, citing the show's palpably-low budget and its dialogue, guest appearances, Gaga's lip-syncing and production: [...] "There was a familiar 'why is this happening?' question hovering over the star-crossed proceedings, albeit without the benefit of any guest stars as seriously wacky as that ones to show up and redeem the incongruousness." ...|$|E

2500|$|During 1820, the New Israelite Temple {{established}} an affiliated prayer {{group in the}} Leipzig Trade Fair. Services where held annually, and knowledge of them spread across Europe via the Jewish merchants. Another short-lived association which attempted to emulate the Berlin-Hamburg model was active in Karlsruhe between 1820 and 1823. But although many synagogues gradually began to adopt aesthetic reforms, those were limited and strictly in the external sphere. The prayerbook, especially the ideology behind it, and even the organ on Saturday remained confined to Congregation New House. [...] "Here alone during the 1820's and 1830's {{there had been a}} clearly nonorthodox Jewish religious service... Everyone agreed that it stood 'isolated'," [...] concluded Meyer, [...] "a beacon whose light <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> eager to welcome." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other reasons {{include the}} passage not being {{something}} a devout Jew such as Josephus would write (especially, [...] "if it be lawful {{to call him}} a man" [...] and [...] "doer of incredible deeds"), as his writing was usually sophisticated and would have explained {{anything out of the}} ordinary to his Gentile audience, such as explaining what the word [...] "Christ" [...] means, why Jesus was called that and further explanations such as how he won over many Jews and Greeks, as he did for every other group (see [...] ), or why he would mention Jesus [...] "appearing" [...] in the [...] "third day"—a Christian creed—without explaining it and how <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to notice this passage until the 4th century, not even Origen who quotes Josephus extensively in his works, thus leading mythicists to think that the Testimonium Flavianum is a forgery of the 4th century, perhaps written by Eusebius in order to provide an outside Jewish authority for the life of Jesus.|$|E

2500|$|The lead {{character}} of Dan Waziri posed a challenge; a Northerner {{is needed to}} play the role, and Afolayan stated {{that there is a}} particular [...] "look" [...] that has been associated with people of the sixties. He also pointed out that he needed an actor who could not only speak Hausa, but would represent the ethnic group as well. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to tick these essential boxes, until Sadiq Daba came to mind. However, his whereabouts were not known at the time as {{the last time he had}} been seen was in the 1998 Mahmood Ali-Balogun's short film A Place Called Home, produced by MNet Eventually, Afolayan was able to find a recent interview he granted, thereby getting connected to Daba through the interviewer. Sadiq Daba was prepared for Waziri's character for a period of 8 months before filming commenced. On a day of shoot, a serious disagreement occurred between Daba and Afolayan that Daba walked out on set; the dispute however was eventually settled and shooting was resumed. Daba in an interview expressed enthusiastically that Kunle Afolayan is a filmmaker he was glad to be associated with.|$|E
2500|$|The initial run {{lasted for}} 14 performances, {{making a profit}} for the Opéra-Comique. It became a staple part in the {{repertory}} of the theatre, reaching its hundredth performance there on 25January 1913. In 1908, Maggie Teyte took {{over the role of}} Mélisande from Mary Garden. She described Debussy's reaction on learning her nationality: [...] "Une autre anglaiseMon Dieu" [...] ("Another Englishwomanmy God"). Teyte also wrote about the composer's perfectionist character and his relations with the cast:As a teacher he was pedanticthat's the only word. Really pedantic [...] There was a core of anger and bitterness in himI often think he was rather like Golaud in Pelléas and yet he wasn't. He wasit's in all his musica very sensual man. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to like him. Jean Périer, who played Pelléas to my Mélisande, went white with anger if you mentioned the name of Debussy...Debussy's perfectionismplus his dislike of the attendant publicitywas {{one of the reasons why}} he rarely attended performances of Pelléas et Mélisande. However, he did supervise the first foreign production of the opera, which appeared at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels on 9 January 1907. This was followed by foreign premieres in Frankfurt on 19 April of the same year, New York City at the Manhattan Opera House on 19February 1908, and at La Scala, Milan with Arturo Toscanini conducting on 2 April 1908. It first appeared in the United Kingdom at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 21 May 1909.|$|E
2500|$|Ryun {{participated in}} the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Summer Olympics. At age 17 years, 137 days in 1964, he remains the {{youngest}} American male track athlete to ever qualify for the Olympics. In 1968, he won the silver medal in the 1,500 meters in Mexico City, losing to Kip Keino from Kenya, whose remarkable race remained the Olympic 1,500-meter record for 16 years. Before the race, Ryun had thought that a time of 3:39 would {{be good enough to}} win in the high altitude of Mexico City. He ended up running faster than that with a 3:37.8, but Keino's 3:34.9 was too tough to beat at that altitude. Keino moved into the first position with two laps to go (800 meters) at world record pace. Ryun continued to move up during the last two laps from eighth to second but was never closer than about 30 yards from Keino. Years later, in 1981, he told Tex Maule in an interview for The Runner magazine, [...] "We had thought that 3:39 would win and I ran under that. I considered it like winning a gold medal; I had done my very best and I still believe I would have won at sea level." [...] Ryun was attacked by some writers who believed he had let his nation down. [...] "Some even said I had let down the whole world. I didn't get any credit for running my best and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to realize that Keino had performed brilliantly." [...] In the 1972 Munich, Germany, Games, he was tripped and fell down during a 1,500-meter qualifying heat. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) acknowledged that a foul had occurred, U.S. appeals to have Ryun reinstated in the competition were denied by the IOC.|$|E

2500|$|Orbison {{continued}} recording albums in the 1970s, {{but none}} of them sold {{more than a handful of}} copies, and by 1976, he had gone an entire decade without a charting album. Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the '60s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his '70s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records. Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: [...] "Since it was never clear where he had come from, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone." [...] His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of [...] "Love Hurts", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, again by hard rock band Nazareth, and by blues adept Jim Capaldi. Sonny James sent [...] "Only the Lonely" [...] to No. 1 on the country music charts. Bruce Springsteen ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and Glen Campbell had a minor hit with a remake of [...] "Dream Baby". A compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the Eagles, who started as Linda Ronstadt's backup band. Ronstadt herself covered [...] "Blue Bayou" [...] in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the Billboard charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career. He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded [...] "Regeneration" [...] with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.|$|E
