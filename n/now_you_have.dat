25|$|In March 1918, {{during the}} German Spring Offensive, he was {{stationed}} near La Fere on the Oise, opposite Adolf Hitler, as he learned {{at a conference}} in 1935. At one point, when brigade HQ was bombed by German aircraft, his companion told him “There <b>now,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> had your first taste of the next war.” On 26 May 1918 he was appointed brigade major of the 198th Infantry Brigade. At the age of twenty-one, he was the youngest brigade-major in the British Army.|$|E
25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E

Early in 2002, Angie Stone revealed that Timberlake [...] "loves the Mahogany Soul album" [...] with him further saying to her [...] "your CD's in my car right <b>now,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to work on my}} solo project". These assertions were later partially denied by a Jive spokesperson who announced that the material produced from the collaboration would not appear on the finalized record.|$|E

500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Jedi Mind Tricks {{released}} their seventh studio album Violence Begets Violence.

Paz stated; [...] "By <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> heard that this {{is the first}} Jedi Mind Tricks album we've made without Stoupe handling the production. The bottom line is that at some point after making our last album, A History of Violence, Stoupe lost his passion for making Hip Hop and wanted to try new things. Through our career, we've always waited on him to get inspired to make a new album, but this time around we got tired of waiting out his creative drought. He tried to produce some things for this new album, but we could tell early on that his heart wasn't in making JMT records anymore. He's moved on as a producer to work in other genres with his side-projects, Dutch and Vespertina, and we've moved on with a new crop of talented producers to make the hardcore Hip Hop we've always been known for." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 31 March 2005 {{following}} a urinary tract infection, he developed septic shock, {{a form of}} infection with a high fever and low blood pressure, but was not hospitalised. Instead, he was monitored {{by a team of}} consultants at his private residence. This was taken as an indication by the pope, and those close to him, that he was nearing death; it would have been in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican. Later that day, Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the Anointing of the Sick by his friend and secretary Stanisław Dziwisz. The day before his death, one of his closest personal friends, Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka visited him at his bedside. During {{the final days of the}} pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace. Tens of thousands of people assembled and held vigil in St. Peter's Square and the surrounding streets for two days. Upon hearing of this, the dying pope was said to have stated: [...] "I have searched for you, and <b>now</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come to me, and I thank you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kobolds bring {{good luck}} and help their hosts {{as long as the}} hosts take care of them. The kobold Heinzelmann found things that had been lost. He had a rhyme he liked to sing: [...] "If thou here wilt let me stay, / Good luck shalt thou have alway; / But if hence thou wilt me chase, / Luck will ne'er come near the place." [...] Three famous kobolds, King Goldemar, Heinzelmann, and Hödekin, all gave {{warnings}} about danger to the owners of the home in which they lived. Heinzelmann once warned a colonel to be careful on his daily hunt. The man ignored the advice, only to have his gun backfire and shoot off his thumb. Heinzelman appeared to him and said, [...] "See, <b>now,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got what I warned you of! If you had refrained from shooting this time, this mischance would not have befallen you." [...] The kobold Hödekin, who lived with the bishop of Hildesheim in the 12th century, once warned the bishop of a murder. When the bishop acted on the information, he was able to take over the murderer's lands and add them to his bishopric.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Unesco Courier, anthropologist and social theorist Mark Anspach (editor of the René Girard issue of Les Cahiers de l'Herne) explains that Aglietta and Orléan (who were very critical of economic rationality) see the classical theory of economics as a myth. According to Anspach, the vicious circle of violence and vengeance generated by mimetic rivalry gives rise to the gift economy, as a means to overcome it and achieve a peaceful reciprocity: [...] "Instead of waiting for your neighbour to come steal your yams, you offer them to him today, and it is up to him {{to do the same for}} you tomorrow. Once you have made a gift, he is obliged to make a return gift. <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> set in motion a positive circularity." [...] Since the gift may be so large as to be humiliating, a second stage of development—"economic rationality"—is required: this liberates the seller and the buyer of any other obligations than to give money. Thus reciprocal violence is eliminated by the sacrifice, obligations of vengeance by the gift, and finally the possibly dangerous gift by [...] "economic rationality." [...] This rationality, however, creates new victims, as globalization is increasingly revealing.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{limited number}} of appearances, the {{character}} of Darius has an important moral influence in the show. Horvath remarks, [...] "When he joined the show {{it was the first}} time that someone started talking about peace." [...] She explains, [...] "The arrival of Darius, aside from bringing in a great character, represented the first time that someone questioned the basic premise of the show. The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. <b>Now</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> this character in Darius who shows up and says, 'Yes, but is it actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad guys, you set up this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys makes you a good guy or whether you should be a man of peace. (...) That underlying question shaped the whole rest of the series." [...] Abramowitz says further, [...] "It was a major moment for MacLeod. And {{it was the first time}} for him when he believed that the way of the warrior may not be the only way." [...] Abramowitz summarizes, [...] "Darius was the voice of God on the show, and then God died." ...|$|E
