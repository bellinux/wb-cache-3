25|$|Months pass, and Bill {{develops}} a mutual attraction {{to a student}} named Heather, who has a defect that makes it look like there is a star in her eye. Heather asks her to inspect a mysterious puddle, asking her if she can see what's wrong with her reflection, but Bill does not <b>notice</b> <b>anything</b> except that her face seems wrong somehow. Bill turns around and Heather has left. Within the puddle, a voice proclaims that {{a search for a}} pilot has begun.|$|E

500|$|I didn't want to {{make the}} movie 3D because when you have things that big… the thing that happens naturally, you're looking at two {{buildings}} lets say at 300 feet , if you move there is no parallax.

500|$|Thanks to {{developments}} in technology {{over the past}} few decades, consciousness has become a significant topic of interdisciplinary research in cognitive science, with significant contributions from fields such as psychology, anthropology, neuropsychology and neuroscience. The primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for information to be present in consciousness—that is, on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness. [...] The majority of experimental studies assess consciousness in humans by asking subjects for a verbal report of their experiences (e.g., [...] "tell me if you <b>notice</b> <b>anything</b> when I do this"). [...] Issues of interest include phenomena such as subliminal perception, blindsight, denial of impairment, and altered states of consciousness produced by alcohol and other drugs, or spiritual or meditative techniques.|$|E
500|$|The BBC purposefully {{searched for}} an actress with Asperger {{syndrome}} {{to play the}} part of Poppy. Lizzy Clark auditioned for the part after her mother saw an advert on an autism website. Clark was selected to play Poppy, and the role in Dustbin Baby was {{her first experience of}} professional acting. Clark was the first actress with Asperger syndrome to portray a fictional character with the condition. Clark, who has since campaigned with her mother against characters with conditions such as Asperger syndrome being played by actors without the condition, said [...] "My Asperger's made some things on the film set difficult at first, like dealing with the sudden noise of the storyboard, but I was soon so focused on acting that I didn't <b>notice</b> <b>anything</b> else." ...|$|E

500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{during a}} show in Fort Worth, Texas Chevelle's trailer {{containing}} all of the band's equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying.

[...] A month later in an interview, Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "Of the 14 guitars, we got two of 'em, {{and then we got}} some amplifiers back and our monitor system. So it's really, I mean it's cool because it's kind of like Christmas, only really weird. People have been calling us and saying, 'Hey, I bought this or that', and you know, we're just doing our best to buy it back from them. And certainly the issue is not a money issue, it's about having the pieces of gear that you did all your records with." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press {{believes}} Ellis' {{version of}} events that day, {{although he did not}} witness the game in person. Smizik was the reporter who first broke the story in 1984. Bill Christine, also of the Pittsburgh Press, does not believe Ellis' claim and was at the game that day. Christine was a beat reporter who [...] "practically lived with the team that year". Christine said that he did not <b>notice</b> <b>anything</b> unusual, and says that if Ellis had reported to the stadium only 90 minutes before his scheduled start, reporters would have been told. John Mehno, a reporter who had [...] "extensive interactions" [...] with Ellis over his career, was skeptical about many stories told by Ellis, including the LSD no-hitter. Mehno said that he has not found a teammate who would corroborate the story. However, one of his close friends, Scipio Spinks, a pitcher for the Astros, has said he has no doubt Ellis was telling the truth about his LSD use as he was very familiar with Dock's drug habits, including the use of LSD.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} to use different scales of models together effectively, especially to create {{a false sense of}} depth (referred to as [...] "forced perspective"). Scales close to each other are also hard to tell apart with the naked eye.

2500|$|As counterpoint, Twain's {{essay on}} [...] "The Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper" [...] offers a much kinder view of Indians. [...] "No, other Indians {{would have noticed}} these things, but Cooper's Indians never <b>notice</b> <b>anything.</b> Cooper thinks they are {{marvelous}} creatures for noticing, but he was almost always in error about his Indians. There was seldom a sane one among them." [...] In his later travelogue Following the Equator (1897), Twain observes that in colonized lands all over the world, [...] "savages" [...] have always been wronged by [...] "whites" [...] in the most merciless ways, such as [...] "robbery, humiliation, and slow, slow murder, through poverty and the white man's whiskey"; his conclusion is that [...] "there are many humorous things in this world; among them the white man's notion that he is less savage than the other savages". In an expression that captures his Indian experiences, he wrote, [...] "So far as I am able to judge nothing has been left undone, either by man or Nature, to make India the most extraordinary country that the sun visits on his rounds. Where every prospect pleases, and only man is vile." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{who live}} abroad are {{accustomed}} to believe that almost all Eretz Yisrael is now uninhabited desert and whoever wishes can buy land there as he pleases. [...] But this is not true. [...] It {{is very difficult to}} find in the land [...] cultivated fields that are not used for planting. [...] Only those sand fields or stone mountains that would require the investment of hard labour and great expense to make them good for planting remain uncultivated and that's because the Arabs do not like working too much in the present for a distant future. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} find good land for cattle. [...] And not only peasants, but also rich landowners, are not selling good land so easily...We who live abroad {{are accustomed to}} believing that the Arabs are all wild desert people who, like donkeys, neither see nor understand what is happening around them. [...] But this is a grave mistake. [...] The Arab, like all the Semites, is sharp minded and shrewd. [...] All the townships of Syria and Eretz Yisrael are full of Arab merchants who know how to exploit the masses and keep track of everyone with whom they deal – the same as in Europe. [...] The Arabs, especially the urban elite, see and understand what we are doing and what we wish to do on the land, but they keep quiet and pretend not to <b>notice</b> <b>anything.</b> [...] For now, they do not consider our actions as presenting a future danger to them. … But, if the time comes that our people's life in Eretz Yisrael will develop to a point where we are taking their place, either slightly or significantly, the natives are not going to just step aside so easily.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{the match}} began, Hart and Michaels brought their {{performance}} outside {{the ring and}} into the crowd, while being followed by McMahon and WWF officials. As {{the climax of the}} match approached, the two wrestlers returned to the ring while WWF officials continued to order more personnel to ringside. Hart first became suspicious as to why Vince McMahon was not at the announcers' table to perform commentary, and why the on-screen commissioner Sgt. Slaughter was also standing at ringside with Vince McMahon. Nevertheless, the match continued. As planned, Michaels pushed Hebner in front of him as Hart jumped from the top turnbuckle, sending all three men to the canvas. Michaels and Hart both got up, but Michaels performed a rake on Hart's eye, sending Hart back to the mat. Michaels then proceeded to grab Hart's legs to execute the Sharpshooter maneuver. At this point, the match director was heard shouting instructions into his headset for Hebner to get up, but Hart did not <b>notice</b> <b>anything</b> amiss. Mike Chioda, the referee who was supposed to run in after Hebner went down, began yelling back that Hebner was not supposed to be up yet. Pat Patterson reacted in a similar way, and Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith, who were waiting for their cues to run in, remained backstage in a state of confusion. Michaels was then seen by many viewers as having glanced at Hebner as he put Hart in the sharpshooter, which some saw as proof that he was in on the scheme. Contrary to their agreed plan, Michaels tightened the hold and refused to offer his own leg to Hart for the latter {{to break out of the}} hold. At that moment, Hebner got to his feet, looked toward timekeeper Mark Yeaton, and shouted, [...] "Ring the bell!" [...] McMahon then elbowed Yeaton hard and yelled, [...] "Ring the fucking bell!" [...] Yeaton rang the bell just as Hart reached forward and grabbed Michaels' leg, which broke the hold and caused Michaels to fall. Michaels' theme music then began playing and the ring announcer declared him the winner and the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hebner had already exited the ring and was on his way out of the arena. After an initial moment of shock, Hart got to his feet, approached the apron where McMahon was standing and spat directly in his face, while Michaels feigned confusion. Michaels was ordered by McMahon to [...] "pick up the damn belt and get the hell out of here!" [...] Michaels left the arena with Brisco and Triple H and the broadcast signal cut off almost immediately after Michaels exited, with the last shot being a tight closeup of the Survivor Series logo above the entranceway. McMahon and most other WWF officials also quickly made their way backstage as an angry Hart smashed cameras, monitors, and ringside equipment. Fans in attendance also began to vent their fury on McMahon and WWF officials; a few even heaped garbage on them and some who were close enough pushed Michaels as he hurried backstage. Owen Hart, Neidhart and Davey Boy came out to the ring and had a conversation with Bret calming him down. Hart proceeded to finger trace [...] "W-C-W" [...] and [...] "I love you" [...] to the cheering fans before returning backstage.|$|E
