In all normal mouse cells tested, the cellular set of M-MSV-specific <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> was present in DNA as one to a few copies per cell. The rate of base substitution of M-MSV <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> was compared with the rate of evolution of both unique sequences and the hemoglobin gene of various species.

5000|$|The {{alternate}} {{hypothesis is}} that opsin polymorphism arose in platyrrhines after they diverged from catarrhines. By this hypothesis, a single X-opsin allele was duplicated in catarrhines and catarrhine M and L opsins diverged later by mutations affecting one gene duplicate but not the other. Platyrrhine M and L opsins would have evolved by a parallel process, acting on the single opsin gene present to create multiple alleles. Geneticists use the [...] "molecular clocks" [...] technique to determine an evolutionary sequence of events. It deduces elapsed time {{from a number of}} minor differences in DNA sequences. <b>Nucleotide</b> <b>sequencing</b> of opsin genes suggests that the genetic divergence between New World primate opsin alleles (2.6%) is considerably smaller than the divergence between Old World primate genes (6.1%). Hence, the New World primate color vision alleles are likely to have arisen after Old World gene duplication. [...] It is also proposed that the polymorphism in the opsin gene might have arisen independently through point mutation on one or more occasions, and that the spectral tuning similarities are due to convergent evolution. Despite the [...] of genes in the New World monkeys, there has been a preservation of trichromacy in the heterozygous females suggesting that the critical amino acid that define these alleles have been maintained.|$|E
40|$|Recombination between viral and {{cellular}} genes can {{give rise to}} new strains of retroviruses. For example, Rous-associated virus 61 (RAV- 61) is a recombinant between the Bryan high-titer strain of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and normal pheasant DNA. Nucleic acid hybridization techniques were used to study the genome of RAV- 61 and another RAV with subgroup F specificity (RAV-F) obtained by passage of RSV-RAV- 0 in cells from a ring-necked pheasant embryo. The <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> acquired by these two independent isolates of RAV-F that were not shared with the parental virus comprised 20 to 25 % of the RAV-F genomes and were indistinguishable by nucleic acid hybridization. (In addition, RAV-F genomes had another set of <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> that were homologous to some pheasant <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> and also {{were present in the}} parental viruses.) A specific complementary DNA, containing only <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> complementary to those acquired by RAV- 61 through recombination, was prepared. These <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> were pheasant derived and were not present in the genomes of reticuloendotheliosis viruses, pheasant viruses, and avian leukosis-sarcoma viruses of subgroups A, B, C, D, and E. They were partially endogenous, however, to avian DNA other than pheasant. The fraction of these <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> present in other avian DNAs generally paralleled the genetic relatedness of these avian species to pheasants.

5000|$|In genetics, a sense strand, or coding strand, is {{the segment}} within {{double-stranded}} DNA {{that runs from}} 5' to 3', and which is complementary to the antisense strand of DNA, which runs from 3' to 5'. The sense strand is the strand of DNA that has the same sequence as the mRNA, which takes the antisense strand as its template during transcription, and eventually undergoes (typically, not always) translation into a protein. The antisense strand is thus responsible for the RNA that is later translated to protein, while the sense strand possesses a nearly identical makeup {{to that of the}} mRNA. Note that for each segment of dsDNA, there will possibly be two sets of sense and antisense, depending on which direction one reads (since sense and antisense is relative to perspective). It is ultimately the gene product, or mRNA, that dictates which strand of one segment of dsDNA we call sense or antisense. But keep in mind that sometimes, such as in prokaryotes, overlapping genes on opposite strands means the sense for one mRNA can be the antisense for another mRNA. [...] The immediate product of this transcription is a resultant initial RNA transcript, which contains a sequence of nucleotides that is identical to that of the sense strand. The exception to this is that uracil is used for <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequencing</b> of RNA molecules rather than thymine.|$|E
50|$|From 1971 onward Gottlieb {{used all}} {{traditional}} cytogenetic, ecological, morphological, and molecular techniques techniques as they became available to solve systematics problems, primarily within Clarkia and the Onagraceae {{as well as}} Stephanomeria and the Cichorieae. Isozymes were used during most of his career. It wasn't until 1986 that he applied a newer molecular technique: chloroplast DNA variation using Restriction fragment length polymorphism in determining the origin of Heterogaura from Clarkia, as well as clarifying species relationships in Clarkia. In these two papers Gottlieb and Systma confirmed previous phylogenic results found with earlier isozyme work, as well as exposing limitations of earlier phylogenetic models that only used morphology and reproductive isolation. Post 1986 he continued working with others using gene duplication of PGM in Clarkia and IDH in Layia (references above), including flavonoids in Stephanomeria. In this latter work he showed that the two progenitor-derivative species S. exigua ssp. coronaria and S. malheurensis were also nearly identical, concordant with earlier genetic studies. He continued work on the phylogeny of Clarkia, using restriction site mapping of chloroplast DNA and then in 1996 Ford and Gottlieb using <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequencing</b> of the duplicated PGI genes further clarified Sections within Clarkia. In 2002 he used an analysis of 18S-26S nuclear rDNA and its ITS and ETS sequences to further examine the phylogeny of Stephanomeria; in this he concluded that the annuals probably evolved more recently than the perennials, and further confirmed the progenitor-derived status of S. malheurensis. In 2006 he and others examined sequences of PgiC in Stephanomeria, and showed that it had more resolution for determining species differences than the earlier ITS/ETS results. In 2003 using 18S-26S nuclear rDNA ITS and ETS sequences he expanded his examination of the phylogeny of Stephanomeria to include all 24 North American genera within the tribe Cichorieae, and produced the first modern comprehensive phylogeny of the group. This work gave him the background for his contributions to the 2006 Flora of North America {{as well as his}} contributions to the The Jepson Manual in 2012, his last publication.|$|E
