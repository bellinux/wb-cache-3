40|$|With the {{continued}} {{advance in the}} design and production of small solid state lasers and associated optics, future systems designed to achieve very-high-density storage of digital information are likely to become increasingly dependent on sophisticated optical technology. <b>Non-erasable</b> <b>storage</b> systems that have been accepted for many years (WORM, CD-ROM and so on) show a continuous growth of applications and sales. The first erasable storage systems, produced and marketed to an agreed world standard, are firmly based on magneto-optic recording technology. This review is intended to summarize the systems and materials that have made this technology possible...|$|E

The purpose of the project was to survey mass storage devices and systems and to select several devices for detailed analysis. Representative devices were analyzed in order to determine their suitability for various file management functions. The major conclusions of the study are the following: 1. Mass storage devices have high potential for those applications which have a requirement to store a large data base (10 ﾹ- 10 ﾹﾲ bits) on-line. 2. Mass storage devices should be considered as supplements to conventional storage devices for large data base applications, and used as part of a hierarchical storage system, rather than as replacements for conventional storage quipment. 3. Mass storage devices are not competitive with conventional storage equipment for direct access processing. 4. Erasable mass storage devices are competitive with conventional storage equipment for sequential file processing. 5. <b>Non-erasable</b> mass <b>storage</b> devices are inappropriate for high activity file processing but can be employed to advantage in archival storage applications. 6. As in the case of conventional storage units, the file activity ratio is a prime consideration in the selection of a file processing technique for mass storage. Low activity ratios favor address look-up or calculation and direct file access. High file activity ratios favor batched input and sequential file[URL] military activity: Fleet Material Support Office...|$|R
