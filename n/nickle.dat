25|$|Unlike {{the federal}} viceroy, the Canadian {{lieutenant}} governors have been since 1867, if not Canadian-born, at least long-time residents of Canada {{and not of}} the peerage, though a number, up until the <b>Nickle</b> Resolution in 1919, were knighted. While required by the tenets of constitutional monarchy to be nonpartisan during their time in office, lieutenant governors have frequently been former politicians and some have returned to politics following their viceregal service. Canadian lieutenant governorships have also been used to promote women and minorities into a prominent position: The first female viceroy in Canada was Pauline Mills McGibbon, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1974 to 1980, and many women have since served in both that province and others. There have been two Black (Lincoln Alexander and Mayann E. Francis) and several Aboriginal lieutenant governors. Norman Kwong, Lieutenant Governor of Alberta from 2005 to 2010, was Chinese-Canadian and David Lam, the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia from 1988 to 1995, was Hong Kong-Canadian. Former Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Lise Thibault used a wheelchair, while David Onley, the former Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, had polio {{as a child and}} used crutches or a scooter.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1952, all Governors General of Canada {{were members}} of the peerage. Typically, {{individuals}} appointed as federal viceroy were already a peer, either by inheriting the title, such as the Duke of Devonshire, or by prior elevation by the sovereign in their own right, {{as was the case with}} the Viscount Alexander of Tunis. None were life peers, the Life Peerages Act 1958 postdating the beginning of the tradition of appointing Canadian citizens as governor general. John Buchan was, in preparation for his appointment as governor general, made the Baron Tweedsmuir of Elsfield in the County of Oxford by King George V, six months before Buchan was sworn in as viceroy. The Leader of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition at the time, William Lyon Mackenzie King, felt Buchan should serve as governor general as a commoner; however, George V insisted he be represented by a peer. With the appointment of Vincent Massey as governor general in 1952, governors general ceased to be members of the peerage; successive governments since that date have held to the non-binding and defeated (in 1934) principles of the 1919 <b>Nickle</b> Resolution.|$|E
25|$|Governor General the Viscount Monck had {{originally}} {{pushed for a}} distinct Canadian order of knighthood in 1867, {{to be called the}} Order of St. Lawrence. The idea was revived by Vincent Massey in 1935 and again in 1951, in between which he also suggested in 1940 a Royal Order of Canada. The Canadian Cabinet, however, never accepted these proposals, generally wishing instead to steer clear of the controversial topic of orders. Still, the beginnings of a distinct Canadian honours system came in March 1934, with the creation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal by royal warrant of King George V, issued on the advice of the Cabinet of R. B. Bennett; {{this was the first time}} an honour specific to Canada and for service in Canada had been established by the monarch of Canada (as opposed to earlier campaign and service medals that had been issued to Canadians and British personnel alike by the British monarch). There was uncertainty amongst officials in Canada and Britain alike around how to go about creating such an honour, and delays were incurred not only as Canadian bureaucrats interpreted the <b>Nickle</b> Resolution as applying to medals, but also because the King himself was widening the project to consider all the Commonwealth and Empire police forces.|$|E
25|$|After the {{creation}} of British North America, Canadians were entitled to receive British imperial honours, though the awarding of these was not consistently allowed. From Confederation until the <b>Nickle</b> Resolution in 1919, the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George served as the equivalent of today's Order of Canada, being the highest non-peerage honour available to Canadian politicians, judges, and civil servants. Appointments into the Order of the British Empire, into grades below those that carried a title, were also commonly made. Besides knighthoods, peerage titles (both hereditary and life) were also bestowed on Canadians, sometimes with uniquely Canadian designations—such as Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe and Baron Beaverbrook of Beaverbrook in the Province of New Brunswick and of Cherkley in the County of Surrey—and permitted those so honoured {{to sit in the}} House of Lords at Westminster. Such acts of recognition were carried out by the reigning British monarch. Prior to Confederation, the sovereign did so on the advice of the British prime minister, the names of those to be honoured either selected by the colonial governor or governor general in British North America and passed on to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and then the prime minister, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and passed on to the prime minister, or by the prime minister himself. The British government felt no obligation to consult any government in British North America before bestowing an honour upon any resident of the colonies. Following Confederation, the Prime Minister of Canada submitted a list of names to the monarch via the governor general, though the governor general also continued to recommend individuals for honours without the Canadian prime minister's knowledge.|$|E

25|$|This {{practice}} {{came into}} question in 1901, when Governor General the Earl of Minto nominated Thomas Shaughnessy for a knighthood, even after Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier (an opponent of Shaughnessy) expressed {{his opposition to}} the idea, leading Laurier in the following year to draft a policy whereby all nominees for honours be approved by the prime minister before being forwarded to Westminster. Later, the public began to suspect the worthiness of those receiving the knighthoods and elevations to the peerage; the controversy that surrounded the appointment of Sam Hughes as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1915 {{marked the beginning of the}} end of such honours in Canada. After it was revealed in 1917 that British Prime Minister David Lloyd George had been selling peerage titles and knighthoods to raise money for his political party (Montreal Star owner Hugh Graham's elevation as the Baron Atholstan being granted seemingly without merit and against the advice of both Canadian Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden and Governor General the Duke of Devonshire), the awarding of such distinctions in Canada immediately ceased. Thereafter, the Canadian House of Commons in 1917 and 1919 passed the <b>Nickle</b> Resolutions, which, though never legally binding, generally cemented the cease of titular awards to Canadians. The end of the conferment of imperial honours on Canadians came in 1955. Awards for gallantry and bravery, such as the Victoria Cross, however, remained available and knighthoods were still conferred: on Sir Frederick Banting in 1934, Sir Edwin Leather in 1964, and Sir Terry Matthews in 2002. Further, some pre-existing Canadian peerages continued to be recognised—the Baron de Longueuil and Baron of Fleet, for example—and still others were granted after 1919 by the sovereign of Canada, such as the Viscount Bennett of Mickleham, Hopewell, and Calgary.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1999, the Anglo-Canadian {{media magnate}} Conrad Black {{was due to}} receive a British peerage. Two days before Black was to receive his title, Chrétien advised Elizabeth II not to accord Black a title of nobility, citing the 1917 <b>Nickle</b> Resolution, where the Canadian House of Commons asked King George V not to grant any titles of nobility or knighthoods to Canadians, and thereby ensured that Black was not raised to the peerage as he was expecting to be. However, the <b>Nickle</b> {{resolution}} like all parliamentary resolutions was only symbolic, {{was in no way}} legally binding on Chrétien and several Canadians had been either knighted or raised to the House of Lords after 1917. Chrétien's biographer Lawrence Martin wrote that Chrétien's argument that he had no choice, but to prevent Black from given a title because of the <b>Nickle</b> resolution was [...] "shaky". Many saw Chrétien's blocking Black from a peerage not as a case of the prime minister merely enforcing the <b>Nickle</b> resolution as Chrétien claimed, but rather as an act of revenge for the often critical coverage that Chrétien received from The National Post newspaper, which was owned by Black at that time. The columnist Mark Steyn wrote in The National Post that Chrétien blocking Black from created a nobleman was [...] "an exquisite embodiment of psychologically crippled small-mindedness". By contrast, Chrétien's close associate Eddie Goldenberg was later to claim that Chrétien cared deeply about the <b>Nickle</b> resolution, and would have had blocked Black from being raised to the peerage even if The National Post were more friendly to him. Black-who felt humiliated by this episode-sued Chrétien for what he alleged to be an abuse of power, leading to the legal case of Black v. Chrétien. In 2001, the court ruled in favor of Chrétien, stating it was the prime minister's prerogative to advise the Queen not to raise Canadians to the British peerage if he felt so inclined, and thereforth this was not an abuse of power as Black had claimed.|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, British Prime Minister Tony Blair advised Queen Elizabeth II {{to confer}} on Black a life peerage {{with the title}} of Baron Black of Crossharbour. He would sit as a {{conservative}} peer, and his name had been put forward by the then conservative leader, William Hague. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien advised the Queen not to appoint Black a peer, citing the <b>Nickle</b> Resolution of 1919 and a long history since then of objections to Canadian citizens accepting British peerages. Black at the time held both Canadian and British citizenship. Black {{pointed out that the}} <b>Nickle</b> Resolution referred to Canadian resident citizens, not dual citizens living in the U.K and was not binding, but when Prime Minister Blair said the Queen would prefer not to choose between the conflicting recommendations of two prime ministers of countries of which she was the monarch, Black asked that the matter be deferred. He litigated in Canada, claiming that Chrétien had no jurisdiction to create a class of citizen in another country, consisting of one person (as there were other dual citizens in the House of Lords), ineligible to receive an honour in that country for services deemed to have been rendered in that country, because of the personal objections of the Canadian Prime Minister of the day. Later in 2001, after the Ontario Superior Court and Court of Appeal had ruled that they had no jurisdiction in this area, Black renounced his Canadian citizenship, remaining a United Kingdom citizen, which allowed him to accept the peerage without further controversy.|$|E

On the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad the new units delivered over [...] a year, compared with about [...] for a mainline steam locomotive. World War II delayed dieselisation in the US. In 1949 the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad became the first large mainline railroad to convert completely to diesel locomotives, and Life Magazine ran an article on 5 December 1949 titled [...] "The GM puts all its steam engines to torch, becomes first major US railroad to dieselize 100%". The Susquehanna was one of the earliest railroads in America to fully dieselize by 1947 and retiring their steam locomotives by 1949. The final 2-8-4 Berkshire built in the world was <b>Nickle</b> Plate Road's 779 built in 1949. [...] The last steam locomotive manufactured for general service was a Norfolk and Western 0-8-0, built in its Roanoke shops in December, 1953. In Spring of 1960, Norfolk and Western Y6b 2190 and S1 290 doused their fires for the last time in a Williamson, West Virginia roundhouse. The Age of Steam was over that ended steam locomotive common carrier service in the United States. 1960 is normally considered the final year of regular Class 1 main line standard gauge steam operation in the United States, with operations on the Grand Trunk Western, Illinois Central, Norfolk and Western and Duluth Missabe and Iron Range Railroads, as well as Canadian Pacific operations in Maine. Union Pacific did not retire their final steam locomotives however, until 1963 and 1964 respectively. Within the 10 year period between 1960 and 1970, 47,000 common carrier steam locomotives were replaced by over 30,000 more modern, sleek-looking diesels. Full USA dieselization was finally achieved by 1971 starting a new chapter in American Railroading.|$|E
