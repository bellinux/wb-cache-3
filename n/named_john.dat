5|$|Adams {{appointed}} two U.S. Supreme Court associate justices {{during his}} term in office: Bushrod Washington, {{the nephew of}} American founding father and President George Washington, to succeed James Wilson; and Alfred Moore, who succeeded James Iredell.

Marshall's long tenure represents the most lasting influence of the Federalists, as he infused the Constitution with a judicious and carefully reasoned nationalistic interpretation and established the Judicial Branch as the equal of the Executive and Legislative branches.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man <b>named</b> <b>John</b> Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E

5|$|In late July, a boy <b>named</b> <b>John</b> Billington became {{lost for}} {{some time in the}} woods around the colony.

The English organized a party to return Billington to Plymouth. The Pilgrims agreed to reimburse the Nauset for the corn which they had taken in return for the Billington boy. This negotiation did much to secure further peace with the Native Americans in the area.|$|E
5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for Time After Time, Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive. Bennett and Meyer wanted the music for the film to go in a different direction, but had not decided on a composer by the time filming began. Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate <b>named</b> <b>John</b> Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which would have troubled the studio.|$|E
5|$|Nikephoros Melissenos was {{probably}} born circa 1045 at Dorylaeum, where {{his family had}} extensive estates.

5|$|The {{proximate}} {{cause of the}} conflict was {{the death of a}} Praying Indian <b>named</b> <b>John</b> Sassamon in 1675. Sassamon had been an advisor and friend to King Philip; however, Sassamon's conversion to Christianity had driven the two apart. Accused in the murder of Sassamon were some of Philip's most senior lieutenants. A jury of twelve Englishmen and six Praying Indians found the Native Americans guilty of murder and sentenced them to death. To this day, some debate exists whether King Philip's men actually committed the murder.|$|E
5|$|Theodore Synadenos was {{a son of}} the megas stratopedarches John Synadenos and Theodora Palaiologina, the niece of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), {{and hence}} {{a member of the}} Byzantine Empire's highest aristocracy. He had a {{probably}} older brother also <b>named</b> <b>John,</b> and at least one sister, Euphrosyne.

5|$|A further {{testament}} to this devotion included Hasan-Jalal's commissioning of the Gandzasar Monastery. Construction {{of the monastery}} began in 1216 and lasted until 1238. On July 22, 1240, amid great celebration during Vardavar celebrations and {{in the presence of}} nearly 700 priests including Nerses, the Catholicos of Albania, the church was consecrated. The monastery {{went on to become the}} residence and sepulcher of the family as well as the house of the catholicos; beginning in the 15th century, the family also monopolized control over the seat of Catholicos itself, which would from thereon in pass down from uncle to nephew. Hasan-Jalal's son John VII is considered to be the first to have established this practice when he became the Catholicos whereas his nephew, also <b>named</b> <b>John,</b> became the second.|$|E
