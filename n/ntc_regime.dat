It was found that for in the <b>NTC</b> <b>regime,</b> fuel stratification {{is more effective than}} thermal stratification in controlling the ignition delay and mitigating the heat release rate (HRR). One of the key finding in this study is that for the intermediate, the overall combustion becomes more advanced and mean heat release rate (HRR) is temporally more distributed with increasing regardless of the negatively-correlated relations. It is primarily because the deflagrative mode prevails at the reaction fronts for large and hence the combustion occurs subsequently, rendering mean HRR more distributed over time...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the effect of air inlet temperature and boost pressure on the auto-ignition of fuels that have different CNs and volatilities in a single cylinder diesel engine. The inlet air temperature is varied over a range of 30 °C to 110 °C at a constant intake pressure of 1. 1 bar. The boost pressure is varied from 1. 1 bar to 1. 5 bar at a constant intake temperature of 60 °C. All engine tests are run at steady-state conditions. The fuels used are ultra-low-sulfur-diesel (ULSD), JP- 8 (two blends with CN 50 2 ̆ 6 31) and F-T SPK. Detailed analysis is made of the rate of heat release during the ignition delay period, to determine the effect of fuel volatility and CN on the auto-ignition process. A STAR-CD CFD model is applied to track the effect of intake temperature and pressure on fuel evaporation, start of exothermic reactions, formation of different species and their significance in the auto-ignition process. CHEMKIN is used to study the chemical reactions under different equivalence ratio, pressure and temperatures. Special attention has been given to LT (low-temperature) and <b>NTC</b> (negative-temperature coefficient) <b>regimes</b> during the ignition delay period.

40|$|With the {{concerns}} growing regarding {{the need to}} reduce NOx emissions and improve combustion efficiency, HCCI technology has been developed. In spite of its benefits, it presents challenges which are mainly concerned with controlling the auto-ignition timing and limiting {{the rate of heat}} release. Numerical simulations have become useful tools to provide a detailed understanding of the combustion process leading to overcome these challenges. This thesis focuses on developing a model based on the first-order CMC approach for modelling the ignition of lean mixtures under HCCI conditions. The premixed CMC equations are derived with the choice of enthalpy as a conditioning variable. The performance of the CMC model is examined for different fuels under various conditions. Three DNS data-sets are employed. The first DNS data-set modelled the ignition of n-heptane/air mixture with mean temperatures in <b>NTC</b> <b>regime</b> whereas the second and third sets of DNS data modelled the ignition of thermally stratified n-heptane/air and iso-octane/air mixtures, respectively, with mean temperatures outside the <b>NTC</b> <b>regime.</b> The CMC results are in excellent agreement with the DNS for the cases with small-to-medium temperature inhomogeneities whereas the CMC under-predicts the ignition delay in the cases with large temperature inhomogeneities. Further investigation using the DNS data shows that the conditional fluctuations are significant in the cases with large thermal stratifications which in turn cause a breakdown of the first-order closure hypothesis. In these cases where a mixed mode of deflagration and spontaneous ignition exists and the dissipation fluctuations generate conditional fluctuations. An assessment of the conditional variance equations, derived for premixed flames, shows correlations between dissipation and conditional fluctuations and correlations between reaction and conditional fluctuations are the dominant sources of conditional fluctuations. The performance of the CFD-CMC solver is also evaluated for modelling the effects of compression heating and expansion cooling. For this purpose, a DNS of a lean thermally stratified ethanol/air mixture is used. The results show the inclusion of compression heating and expansion cooling suppresses the deflagration mode and hence the CMC model predicts the ignition process very well for all cases even for those with large thermal stratification...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{modeling}} and simulation of reactive flows, especially for those with detonation, are further investigated. From the theoretical side, {{a new set of}} hydrodynamic equations are deduced, where the viscous stress tensor and heat flux are replaced by two non-equilibrium quantities that have been defined in our previous work. The two non-equilibrium quantities are referred to as NonOrganized Momentum Flux (NOMF) and Non-Organized Energy Flux (NOEF), respectively, here. The numerical results of viscous stress (heat flux) have a good agreement with those of NOMF (NOEF) near equilibrium state. Around sharp interfaces, the values of NOMF (NOEF) deviate reasonably from those of viscous stress (heat flux). Based on this hydrodynamic model, the relations between the two non-equilibrium quantities and entropy productions are established. Based on the discrete Boltzmann model, four kinds of detonation phenomena with different reaction rates, including Negative Temperature Coefficient (<b>NTC)</b> <b>regime,</b> are simulated and investigated. The differences of the four kinds of detonations are studied from three aspects: hydrodynamic quantities, non-equilibrium quantities and entropy productions. Comment: 30 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

The TPRFs were formulated to match the research octane number (RON) and motor octane number (MON) of two high-octane gasolines and two prospective low-octane naphtha fuels. The experiments were carried out {{over a wide range}} of temperatures (650 – 1250  K), at pressures of 10, 20 and 40  bar, and at equivalence ratios of 0. 5 and 1. 0. It was observed that the ignition delay times of these TPRFs exhibit negligible octane dependence at high temperatures (T >  1000  K), weak octane dependence at low temperatures (T <  700  K), and strong octane dependence in the negative temperature coefficient (<b>NTC)</b> <b>regime.</b> A detailed chemical kinetic model was used to simulate and interpret the measured data.

Although the technology scaling enables extreme volumes of computational power, power budget violations will permit only a limited portion to be actually exploited, leading to the so called dark silicon. Near-Threshold voltage Computing (NTC) {{has emerged as a}} promising approach to overcome the manycore power-wall, at the expenses of reduced performance values and higher sensitivity to process variations. Given that several application domains operate over specific performance constraints, the performance sustainability is considered a major issue for the wide adoption of NTC.

A modified version of the single cylinder Leeds University Ported Optical Engine Version 2 (LUPOE- 2) engine was designed to completely eliminate retained residual gas and so allow unambiguous definition of the composition of the in-cylinder charge. The engine was alternately operated on stoichiometric mixtures of iso-octane, two Primary Reference Fuels (PRF), a Toluene Reference Fuel (TRF), and a commercially available Unleaded Gasoline (ULG) and air. These mixtures were diluted with sEGR (products of the complete stoichiometric combustion of the given fuel/air mixture) in mass fractions ranging from 0 - 15 %; with and without 5000 ppm NO (0. 52 % by mass) within that sEGR. For those fuels exhibiting little or no Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) behaviour, NO addition to the sEGR resulted in increased rate of reaction in the end gas and advanced autoignition and thus knock onset. Conversely, autoignition (and thus knock onset) was suppressed with the addition of NO for fuels exhibiting strong NTC characteristics if the cycle unburned pressure/temperature history spent a significant period of time to autoignition in the <b>NTC</b> <b>regime.</b> Ideas relating to the effects of residual gas NO concentration on autoignition, and thus knock onset are subsequently discussed...|$|E

Alternative fuels like jet fuels can be substitute to them for improved efficiencies. The Department Of Defense uses JP 8 for their combat vehicles under their Single Fuel Concept for a better logistic supply chain. However, due to the projected age of depletion of crude oil reservoirs, synthetic blends are being considered for their abundant availability. One such blend, SASOL IPK, a Coal to Liquid based fuel prepared by the Fisher- Tropsch process is considered in this study. This thesis shows results from experiments conducted on single cylinder PNGV engine to study the effect of intake charge temperature and injection timing on ignition delay of SASOL IPK.

40|$|Closed access. The work {{presented}} in this article investigates the three distinct phases of low temperature diesel combustion (LTC). Diesel LTC followed a cool flame–negative temperature coefficient (NTC) –high temperature thermal reaction (main combustion) process. The in-cylinder parameters, such as the charge temperature, pressure, and composition, had noticeable influences on these combustion stages. The NTC was strongly temperature-dependent, with higher temperatures inducing both an earlier onset of NTC and a more rapid transition from NTC to the main combustion process. An increase in the intake charge temperature led to an earlier occurrence of NTC and a reduction in the heat released during the cool flame regime. A higher fuel injection pressure improved fuel mixing and enhanced the low temperature (pre-combustion) reactions, which in turn led to an earlier appearance of the cool flame regime and more heat release during this phase. This increased the charge temperature and led to earlier onset of the NTCregime. Ahigher exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate reduced the intake charge oxygen concentration and limited the low temperature reaction rates. This reduced the heat release rate during cool flame reaction phase, leading to a slower increase in charge temperature and a longer duration of the <b>NTC</b> <b>regime.</b> This increased the ignition delay for the main combustion event. The injection timing showed a less significant influence on the cool flame reaction rates and NTC phase compared to the other parameters. However, it had a significant influence on the main combustion heat release process in terms of phasing and peak heat release rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nanosecond}} pulsed non-equilibrium plasma discharges on ignition characteristics and low-temperature chemistry or LTC of DME/O 2 /Ar mixtures are numerically investigated in a plane-to-plane geometry at a reduced pressure of 76 Torr. Detailed numerical {{investigations of the}} two-stage ignition process in different temperature regimes of DME have been created through a high-fidelity one-dimensional, multi-timescale plasma-discharge model. Two different initial temperatures are set for comparison: 550 K, the negative temperature coefficient regime, where LTC plays a dominate role; 800 K, the intermediate temperature regime, where LTC normally does not play an important role. The results have shown that, in <b>NTC</b> <b>regime,</b> non-equilibrium plasma discharge improves the overall ignition delay time by 15 times with a significant improvement of approximately 250 times for the first-stage ignition. In Intermediate temperature regime, the two-stage ignition property is reactivated {{by the addition of}} plasma, and the overall ignition delay is shortened by approximately 75 times. This observation suggests that, in the intermediate temperature regime, the plasma discharges can not only enhance DME ignition characteristics but also alter the reaction pathways to a reactive LTC reaction pathway; therefore, the two-stage ignition behavior occurred again. Further investigation suggests that the plasma enhancement on ignition and LTC in the intermediate temperature regime is non-linear. As the accumulative energy input to the system increases, the enhancement from the non-equilibrium plasma discharge reaches a limit. Considering the total amount of heat release, the optimized voltage pulse number appears to be in the range of 35 - 40 to provide the most efficient enhancement for the overall ignition delay time...|$|E

In the DNSs, temperature and velocity fluctuations are superimposed on the initial scalar fields with different PRF compositions. In general, {{it was found that}} the mean heat release rate increases slowly and the overall combustion occurs rapidly with increasing thermal stratification regardless of the fuel composition. In addition, the effect of the fuel composition on the ignition characteristics of PRF/air mixtures was found to be significantly reduced with increasing thermal stratification. Chemical explosive mode (CEM) and displacement speed analyses verified that nascent ignition kernels induced by hot spots due to a high degree of thermal stratification usually develop into deflagration waves rather than spontaneous auto-ignition at reaction fronts and as such, the mean heat release rate becomes more distributed over time. These analyses also revealed that the fuel composition effect vanishes as the degree of thermal stratification is increased because the deflagration mode of combustion, of which propagation characteristics are nearly identical for different PRF/air mixtures, becomes more prevailing with increasing degree of thermal stratification. Ignition Damköhler number was proposed to quantify the successful development of deflagration waves from nascent ignition kernels; for cases with large ignition Damköhler number, turbulence with high intensity and short timescale can advance the overall combustion by increasing the overall turbulent flame area instead of homogenizing initial mixture inhomogeneities. close...|$|E

The 2 -D DNSs of RCCI/SCCI combustion are performed by varying degree of fuel stratification, r, and turbulence intensity, u', at different initial mean temperature, T, with negatively-correlated T-r fields. It is found that in the low- and intermediate-temperature regimes, the overall combustion of RCCI cases occurs earlier and its mean heat release rate (HRR) is more distributed over time {{than those of the}} corresponding SCCI cases. This is because PRF number stratification, PRF', plays a dominant role and T' has a negligible effect on the overall combustion within the negative temperature coefficient (<b>NTC)</b> <b>regime.</b> In the high-temperature regime, however, the difference between RCCI and SCCI combustion becomes marginal because the ignition of the PRF/air mixture is highly-sensitive to T' rather than PRF' and ϕ(symbol) '.

40|$|The {{autoignition}} of {{dimethyl ether}} (DME) with temperature inhomogeneities is investigated by one-dimensional numerical simulations with detailed chemistry at high pressure and a constant volume. The {{primary purpose of}} the study is to provide an understanding of the autoignition of DME in a simplified configuration that is relevant to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines. The ignition structure and the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behaviour are characterised in a homogeneous domain and one-dimensional domains with thermal stratification, at different initial mean temperatures and length scales. The thermal stratification is shown to strongly affect the spatial structure and temporal progress of ignition. The importance of diffusion and conduction on the ignition progress is assessed. It is shown that the effects of molecular diffusion decay relative to those of chemical reaction as the length-scale increases. This is to be expected, however the present study shows that these characteristics also depend on the mean temperature due to NTC behaviour. For the range of conditions studied here, which encompass a range of stratification length scales expected in HCCI engines, the effects of molecular transport are found to be small compared with chemical reaction effects for mean temperatures within the <b>NTC</b> <b>regime.</b> This is in contrast to previous work with fuels with single-stage ignition behaviour where practically realisable temperature gradients can lead to molecular transport effects becoming important. In addition, thermal stratification is demonstrated to result in significant reductions of the pressure-rise rate (PRR), even for the present fuel with two-stage ignition and NTC behaviour. The reduction of PRR is however strongly dependent on the mean initial temperature. The stratification length-scale is also shown to have an important influence on the pressure oscillations, with large-amplitude oscillations possible for larger length scales typical of integral scales in HCCI engines...|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{combustion}} is a {{major contributor}} to global energy production. However, despite major improvements to diesel engine design, substantial gaps exist in the fundamental description of the in-cylinder combustion process. This impedes the development of simple, predictive models which are necessary for designing improved combustion devices. In particular, only an under-resolved description of ignition and lifted flame stabilisation exists, due to physical limitations of experimental measurements. Ignition and flame stabilisation govern the formation of pollutants and combustion efficiency, and so a refined understanding is required. In this thesis, direct numerical simulation (DNS) techniques are applied to idealised configurations that represent facets of diesel combustion. A particular focus is applied to representing the correct thermochemical conditions which result in multi-stage autoignition and a negative temperature coefficient (<b>NTC)</b> <b>regime</b> of ignition delay times. The results were broadly consistent with prior experimental studies, but the well-resolved information also revealed details of several novel combustion features that have not been previously reported. Simulations of lifted laminar flames at NTC conditions with detailed dimethyl ether chemistry observed that edge flame or hybrid edge flame/autoignition structures can exist even at diesel-relevant autoignitive conditions, which raises the possibility that edge flame propagation or a combination of edge flame propagation and autoignition are responsible for diesel flame stabilisation. The ignition of a two-dimensional mixing layer at NTC conditions in isotropic turbulence with detailed dimethyl ether chemistry was conducted. A complex ignition process was observed in which two-stage autoignition, cool flames, and hybrid edge flame/autoignition structures contributed to the overall ignition process. In particular, it was observed that the cool flame influenced the timing and location of the high temperature ignition. A three-dimensional ignition at NTC conditions with global heptane chemistry was conducted. The results were consistent with the two-dimensional mixing layer results.

40|$|Efforts {{have been}} made {{previously}} by researchers to quantify the auto-ignition quality of fuels by calculating global activation energy using Arrhenius plots with data measured for the ignition delay period (ID). Large variation in the activation energy of fuels has been observed even for fuels with closer CN values. More recently, the activation energy values obtained by Kook et al in (2005) on an optical engine {{do not agree with}} data obtained in an identical metallic engine by Jayakumar using fuels of same CN. The disparity in their results {{can be attributed to the}} differences in ignition delay (ID) and effective temperature definitions used. Most researchers agree upon the start of ID time as the start of injection (SOI). The main point of disagreement has been in defining the end of ID period which is considered to be the start of combustion (SOC). As a result, numerous definitions for the ID period have been used by researchers which lead to variation in calculation of activation energy value. In addition, in heterogeneous combustion equipment to account for changes in charge temperature due to fuel evaporation and piston movement (in engines) an effective temperature value is used. Different definitions for the effective temperature have been reported in the literature. This leads to more variations in the activation energy value calculation. Furthermore, it was observed that engine test conditions and the temperature regime in which the tests are done would also affect the calculation of activation energy value. This dissertation examines the effects of ignition delay definitions, effective temperatures, engine conditions and temperature regimes on the global activation energy. Moreover, homogeneous charge test data has shown presence of a <b>NTC</b> <b>regime</b> in which the activation energy value can be either positive, negative or zero.

Two-dimensional DNS are performed in a fixed volume with a two-dimensional isotropic velocity spectrum and temperature fluctuations superimposed on the initial scalar fields. The influence of variations in the initial temperature field, imposed by changing the mean and variance of temperature, and the ratio of turbulence to ignition delay timescale on multi-stage ignition of a lean n-heptane/air mixture is studied. In general, the mean heat release rate increases more slowly with increasing thermal stratification regardless of the mean initial temperature. Ignition delay decreases with increasing thermal stratification for high mean initial temperature relative to the negative temperature coefficient (<b>NTC)</b> <b>regime.</b> It is, however, increased with increasing thermal fluctuations for relatively low mean initial temperature resulting from a longer overall ignition delay of the mixture. Displacement speed and Damköhler number analyses reveal that {{the high degree of}} thermal stratification induces deflagration rather than spontaneous ignition at the reaction fronts, and hence, the mean heat release rate is smoother subsequent to thermal runaway occurring at the highest temperature regions in the domain. Chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) also verifies that mixing counterbalances chemical explosion at the reaction fronts for cases with large temperature fluctuation. It is also found that if the ratio of turbulence to ignition delay timescale is short, resultant diminished scalar fluctuations cause the overall ignition to occur by spontaneous ignition. However, the overall effect of turbulence is small compared to the effect of thermal stratification. These results suggest that the critical degree of thermal stratification for smooth operation of homogeneous charge compression-ignition (HCCI) engines depends on both the mean and fluctuations in initial temperature which should be considered in controlling ignition timing and preventing an overly rapid increase in pressure in HCCI combustion...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and composition stratifications on the ignition of a lean n-heptane/air mixture at three initial mean temperatures under elevated pressure are investigated using direct numerical simulations (DNSs) with a 58 -species reduced mechanism. Two-dimensional DNSs are performed by varying several key parameters: initial mean temperature, T 0, and {{the variance of}} temperature and equivalence ratio (T' and φ') with different T-φcorrelations. It is found that for cases with φ' only, the overall combustion occurs more quickly and the mean heat release rate (HRR) increases more slowly with increasing φ' regardless of T 0. For cases with T' only, however, the overall combustion is retarded/advanced in time with increasing T' for low/high T 0 relative to the negative-temperature coefficient (<b>NTC)</b> <b>regime</b> resulting from a longer/shorter overall ignition delay of the mixture. For cases with uncorrelated T-φfields, the mean HRR is more distributed over time compared to the corresponding cases with T' or φ' only. For negatively-correlated cases, however, the temporal evolution of the overall combustion exhibits quite non-monotonic behavior with increasing T' and φ' depending on T 0. All of these characteristics {{are found to be}} primarily related to the 0 -D ignition delays of initial mixtures, the relative timescales between 0 -D ignition delay and turbulence, and the dominance of the deflagration mode during the ignition. These results suggest that an appropriate combination of T' and φ' together with a well-prepared T-φdistribution can alleviate an excessive pressure-rise rate (PRR) and control ignition-timing in homogeneous charge compression-ignition (HCCI) combustion. In addition, critical species and reactions for the ignition of n-heptane/air mixture through the whole ignition process are estimated by comparing the temporal evolution of the mean mass fractions of important species with the overall reaction pathways of n-heptane oxidation mechanism.

40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression-ignition}} (HCCI) engines {{have been}} considered to hold potential for next generation internal combustion engines with low emissions and low fuel-consumption. However, some technical hurdles, such as low combustion-efficiency at low load and excessive pressure-rise rate (PRR) at high load, significantly challenge its practical application. In this thesis, fundamental studies of fuel ignition response to thermal stratification were first conducted by using direct numerical simulations coupled with a detailed chemistry mechanism. For a two-stage ignition fuel with negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behaviour, dimethyl ether, the auto-ignition regime was found to depend strongly on the initial temperature. Molecular diffusion {{was found to be}} negligible in comparison to chemical reaction when the initial temperature fell inside NTC regime; however, once the initial temperature was outside <b>NTC</b> <b>regime,</b> diffusion became relatively more significant. Diffusion was also observed to decrease with an increase of the length-scale. PRR was found to be reduced with thermal stratification, but this was also dependent on the mean temperature. Then, non-reacting multi-dimensional engine modelling was conducted to investigate the effects of fuel direct injection on the resulting mixture distribution. It was found that as the start of injection was retarded, more fuel was concentrated in the central areas of the cylinder, leading to a potential increase of combustion efficiency and potential reduction of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons, but a potential increase of excessive nitrogen oxides. Droplet-wall interaction and spray-to-spray interaction were observed to play essential roles in fuel distribution. Furthermore, the use of high injection pressure can enhance the mixing, while the use of high swirl ratio and low injection pressure showed negative effects on the global mixing. Finally, reacting engine simulations were carried on to study the effects of thermal stratification on a fully premixed HCCI engine fuelled by ethanol. These studies pointed out many challenges with attempts to model HCCI predictively, owing to strong sensitivities to initial charge temperature and pressure, wall temperatures, residual gas composition, initial turbulence intensity and models for its evolution and wall models. These sensitivities were analysed and used to construct an optimised model that agreed quite well with experimental pressure traces and associated quantities such as the PRR, the indicated mean effective pressure, and the thermal efficiency. Analysis of the optimised model results was used to determine that enhanced thermal stratification demonstrated a significant reduction of the PRR. The degree of the reduction was found to depend on the penetration of thermal stratification into the bulk-gas regions. In addition, turbulence {{played an important role in}} the control combustion phasing primarily by altering the distributions of thermal stratification...|$|E
40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringThis study {{investigates the}} {{ignition}} characteristics of various hydrocarbon fuel/air mixtures under homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) conditions using direct numerical simulations (DNS). The ignition processes {{of various types}} of HCCI combustion including HCCI with thermal stratification (TS), stratified-charge compression ignition (SCCI), and reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI), and direct dual fuel stratification (DDFS) are numerically studied. HCCI engines are designed to operate under low-temperature conditions by utilizing ultra-lean, highly-diluted, well-mixed fuel/air mixture like SI engines while relying on compression ignition by an elevated compression ratio like diesel engines. Accordingly, HCCI combustion can provide high diesel-like thermal efficiency while avoiding excessive NOx and particulate emissions. Therefore, prototypes of the HCCI combustion engines have been developed {{as an alternative to}} conventional gasoline and diesel engines. However, several key issues still remains unresolved in the development of HCCI combustion engines: for instance, how to control the ignition timing and how to mitigate excessive heat release rate (HRR) under a wide range of load conditions. Therefore, several variants of HCCI combustion are developed to overcome these issues. With the help of high-fidelity DNSs, fundamental understanding of the combustion modes, flame speeds, turbulence-chemistry interactions, key species and controlling reactions of the variants of HCCI combustion can be obtained. The main objectives of the study are (1) to provide more insights into the effect of thermal and compositional stratification levels under different temperature regimes, and fuel compositions on the ignition mechanism of HCCI combustion(2) to investigate the relative effect of T/phi/PRF stratifications coupled with the turbulence effect on the ignition process and combustion mode of HCCI/SCCI/RCCI using several different fuels including primary reference fuels (PRFs), n-heptane, and biodiesel(3) to identify the key species and critical reactions of the SCCI and RCCI combustion using chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) and finally (4) to elucidate the effect of the late-direct-injection timing on the DDFS combustion process by developing a pseudo- model. The results of this study can aid {{in the development of the}} next-generation high-efficiency IC engines. By systematically investigating the effects of T, phi and PRF inhomogeneities and their relative roles on the HCCI combustion process at the low-, intermediate-, and high-temperature chemistry regimes, the generalization of their effects on the HCCI combustion is made. It was found that the effect of thermal and compositional stratifications on HCCI combustion, in general, depends on the initial mean temperature, T 0, of the fuel/air mixture. TS is most effective at the high-temperature chemistry (HTC) regime regardless of fuel types (i. e. both single- and two-stage ignition fuels). Similar to the single-stage ignition fuels, with T 0 lying within the HTC regime in which only the HTC governs the ignition, the mean HRR of the two-stage ignition fuels is more distributed over time, and its peak HRR is more reduced with increasing T'. On the contrary, for the two-stage ignition fuels with T 0 lying within the LTC and ITC regime, phi and PRF stratifications play dominant roles in enhancing deflagration mode, and thereby spreading out HRR and reducing the peak HRR. These results suggest that (1) TS is most suitable for single-stage ignition fuels for tailoring the rate and timing of the overall heat release of HCCI combustion (2) while SCCI and RCCI combustion concepts work better if they are operating within/near the negative temperature coefficient (<b>NTC)</b> <b>regime</b> because the ignition delays are more sensitive to phi and PRF than temperature in this regime. It is also found that high turbulence intensity with short-time scale is more likely to homogenize thermally and compositionally stratified mixtures such that the overall combustion becomes similar to the 0 -D ignition with excessive HRR. CEMA shows that at the first ignition delay, the low-temperature chemistry (LTC) represented by the isomerization of RO 2 chain branching reactions of KOOH, and H-atom abstraction of n-heptane is predominant for both RCCI and SCCI combustion. Temperature is identified to be the predominant factor, and HTC represented by H + O 2 -> O + OH is responsible for the thermal ignition. At deflagrations, temperature, CO, and OH are the most important variables while the conversion reaction of CO to CO 2, and high-temperature chain branching reaction of H + O 2 -> O + OH are identified to be important. Finally, a novel pseudo-iso-octane model is developed, which has the capability to reproduce the timing, duration, and cooling effect of the late direct injection timing, tinj. The PC 8 H 18 model was then adopted to explore the effect of DI timing on the DDFS combustion. It is found that regardless of tinj, the DDFS combustion has much lower peak HRR and longer combustion duration than the RCCI combustion. This is primarily attributed to the sequential injection of iso-octane. The combustion phasing of the DDFS combustion exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with increasing tinj due to the different effect of fuel evaporation on the low-, intermediate-, and high-temperature chemistry of the PRF oxidation. ope...|$|E
