25|$|The {{land was}} sold at auction in Sydney and {{attracted}} speculators, {{many of whom}} would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> land they purchased. Only one original buyer, James Simpson, settled on his land. Simpson subdivided his land and marked out two streets, Carmarthon Street (later Albert Street) and Landillo Street (later Victoria Street). Because the land was too marshy he left the area in 1859 {{with much of the}} land unsold.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a little}} bit of drama for the club when in December, Rick Titus left the team without {{permission}} to try out for a team in Hong Kong. Management later quipped that Titus (already in his second stint with the club) would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> inside of a Drillers locker room again, and sold his rights to Philadelphia, where Titus finished out the season after returning from Asia.|$|E
25|$|The {{notebook}} Kid receives {{already has}} writing throughout, {{but only on}} the right hand pages. The left hand pages are blank. Glimpses of the text in the notebook, however, are extremely close to passages in Dhalgren itself, as if the notebook were an alternate draft of the novel. Other passages are verbatim from the final chapter of Dhalgren. It is here in Chapter II that Kid begins using the blank pages of the notebook to compose poems. The novel describes {{the process of creating}} the poems—the emotions and the mechanics of the writing itself—at length and several times. We <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> actual poems, however, in their final form. Kid soon revises or removes any line that does appear in the text.|$|E

Back at home, Briar Rose is thrilled to tell her guardians she met a man and fell in love. The fairies finally tell Aurora the truth about her royalty heritage, {{that she is a}} princess and already betrothed at birth to a prince, and tell her she must <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> man she met again. Heartbroken, she leaves the room. Meanwhile, Phillip tells his father of a peasant girl he met and wishes to marry in spite of his prearranged marriage to Princess Aurora. King Hubert fails to convince him otherwise, leaving Hubert in equal disappointment.|$|E
25|$|Size is not {{the only}} factor in making red dwarfs {{potentially}} unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sun. On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. Photosynthesis as we understand it would be {{complicated by the fact that}} a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the infrared, and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves toward the sun, deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a day-night cycle, including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given radiation level.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} town, the two swindlers then {{impersonate}} brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property. To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke {{pretends to be}} a deaf-mute while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men {{who seem to be}} the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions—"All right, then, I'll go to hell!"—Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.|$|E

500|$|Several {{philosophers}} {{had strong}} {{objections to the}} claims being made by AI researchers. One of the earliest was John Lucas, who argued that Gödel's incompleteness theorem showed that a formal system (such as a computer program) could <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> truth of certain statements, while a human being could. Hubert Dreyfus ridiculed the broken promises of the 60s and critiqued the assumptions of AI, arguing that human reasoning actually involved very little [...] "symbol processing" [...] {{and a great deal}} of embodied, instinctive, unconscious [...] "know how". John Searle's Chinese Room argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program could not be said to [...] "understand" [...] the symbols that it uses (a quality called [...] "intentionality"). If the symbols have no meaning for the machine, Searle argued, then the machine can not be described as [...] "thinking".|$|E
500|$|In 1940, Walt Disney {{released}} Fantasia, {{his third}} animated feature film, consisting of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music. Initially {{he planned to}} have the film on continual release with new segments replacing older ones so audiences would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> same film twice. The idea was dropped following the film's initial low box office receipts and a mixed response from critics. Following preliminary work on new segments, the idea was shelved by 1942 and was not revisited {{for the remainder of}} Disney's life. In 1980, animators Wolfgang Reitherman and Mel Shaw started preliminary work on Musicana, a feature film [...] "mixing jazz, classical music, myths, modern art... following the old Fantasia format" [...] that was to present [...] "ethnic tales from around the world with the music of the various countries". The project was cancelled in favor of Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983).|$|E

500|$|When the Earl of Mar {{returned}} with James' instructions that Anne {{join him in}} the Kingdom of England, she informed James by letter that she refused to do so unless allowed custody of Henry. This [...] "forceful maternal action", as historian Pauline Croft describes it, obliged James to climb down at last, though he reproved Anne for [...] " [...] womanly apprehensions" [...] and described her behaviour {{in a letter to}} Mar as [...] "wilfulness". After a brief convalescence from the miscarriage, Anne duly travelled south with Prince Henry, their progress causing a sensation in England. Lady Anne Clifford recorded that she and her mother killed three horses in their haste to see the Queen, and that when James met Anne near Windsor, [...] "there was such an infinite number of lords and ladies and so great a Court as I think I shall <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> like again." ...|$|E
500|$|Dallas {{was raised}} to {{lieutenant}} colonel and appointed to the command of a wing, but would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> message from headquarters that arrived on 1June 1918 advising him of the promotion and ordering him to cease flying. He disappeared on a solo mission the same day. It was later learned {{that he had been}} killed over Liévin during combat with three Fokker Triplanes from Jagdstaffel 14, probably by its commander, Leutnant Johannes Werner. There are several theories as to how he died. The common elements are that he was on patrol near the front line when he pounced on a German plane flying at a lower level, that there might have been another unknown British pilot in trouble, and that the Germans who shot Dallas down had dived from a still higher altitude. Medics near his crash site at Absalom Trench ventured into no man's land and retrieved his body, while a patrol of eight volunteers salvaged his personal effects from the fallen aircraft. News of Dallas's death was greeted with shock and disbelief by his squadron, one pilot recording: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{gatefold}} {{cover of}} the vinyl LP features the band posing nude in a brook. The shot was original manager Phil Walden's idea, and the brook was on his brother Alan's property. Alan later recalled, [...] "The [...] photo was taken in Round Oak, Georgia, down behind my log cabin there, {{which is also the}} back of Otis Redding's Big O Ranch". Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner was present with Boz Scaggs, whom he was producing at the time. They brought bubbles to cover themselves up, but the bubbles were washed away by the stream. Trucks had sliced his leg open earlier that day, requiring thirteen stitches, and was unable to get in the water; he is standing behind Oakley in the shot. Walden suggested the band take a few shots standing full-frontal; the band was reluctant but he assured them they would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> light of day. At their first performance at the Fillmore East that December, Trucks discovered the full-frontal shots were printed in a broadsheet alternative newspaper.|$|E

[...] She also said Spears performed with [...] "a naughty, free-spirited attitude", as though she [...] "had invited 900 friends to her dirty little dance party, and too bad for you if you couldn't roll with the fun." [...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back.

500|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, the song {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. UKMIX described the song as [...] "quite blissful {{with a smooth}} vocal delivery and some pretty nice lyrics," [...] but despite {{not being able to}} fault the song, the reviewer was unsure that the song was the right choice for the Eurovision Song Contest and predicted that Tyler would suffer the same criticism that Engelbert Humperdinck received the previous year. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the song two stars out of five, stating that the song is a [...] "polar opposite to the slew of Euro-club bangers entering this year's contest," [...] but applaud Tyler for entering the Eurovision Song Contest with the contrasting song. The Guardian held a poll on their website asking the public if they expected Tyler to be successful at Eurovision. The results were fairly even with 46% predicting that Tyler would win and 54% voting that they didn't expect Tyler to win. Ann Gripper from the Daily Mirror described the song as [...] "heartfelt," [...] and {{went on to say that}} Tyler [...] "can still sing." [...] She criticised the songwriters' choice of [...] "above" [...] and [...] "stuff" [...] as the first rhyming lyrics, but noted the line [...] "you <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> rainbow, you just curse the rain" [...] as an improvement, and an opportunity to [...] "have some fun with the staging on finals night in Malmo." [...] Gripper concluded by saying that it [...] "doesn't get into your head like (2012 Sweden winning song) [...] "Euphoria"," [...] and stated that unless the staging is [...] "spectacular", the song won't be remembered by voting time.|$|E
