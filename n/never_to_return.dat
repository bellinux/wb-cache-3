5|$|After the {{invasion}} of Poland {{at the start of}} World War II, Kraków became the capital of Germany's General Government.

5|$|As Rome's power waned, the Picts were emboldened. War bands raided {{south of}} Hadrian's Wall in earnest in 342, 360, and 365 and they participated with the Attacotti in the Great Conspiracy of 367. Rome fought back, {{mounting}} a campaign under CountTheodosius in 369 which reëstablished a province which was renamed Valentia {{in honor of}} the emperor. Its location is unclear, but it is sometimes placed on or beyond Hadrian's Wall. Another campaign was mounted in 384, but both were short-lived successes. Rome had fully withdrawn from Britain by 410, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who {{has come a long}} way from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tamagnino's six Caesars were {{relegated to}} the less frequented areas of the {{building}} - at the back and the south and west. The sixth bust was of poorer quality {{than the rest of}} the cycle, and it is surmised that Tamagnino aimed to taunt his clients who for the second time in Brescia had undervalued his ability and underestimating his work. After these events, Tamagnino abandoned Brescia, probably <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return,</b> leaving Cairano as the main sculptural worker in the city.|$|E

5|$|Adams wrote {{numerous}} {{letters and}} essays {{in opposition to}} the occupation, which he considered a violation of the 1689 Bill of Rights. The occupation was publicized throughout the colonies in the Journal of Occurrences, an unsigned series of newspaper articles that may have been written by Adams in collaboration with others. The Journal presented what it claimed to be a factual daily account of events in Boston during the military occupation, an innovative approach in an era without professional newspaper reporters. It depicted a Boston besieged by unruly British soldiers who assaulted men and raped women with regularity and impunity, drawing upon the traditional Anglo-American distrust of standing armies garrisoned among civilians. The Journal ceased publication on August 1, 1769, which was a day of celebration in Boston: Governor Bernard had left Massachusetts, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Bojić was in his final year at the University of Belgrade and had gotten engaged to his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The war {{put a stop to}} his education, and Bojić decided to postpone the marriage until peace was restored. He remained employed at Pijemont until 1915, when he left Belgrade with his family, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b> While Todorović remained in the city, the Bojićes moved to the town of Aranđelovac in the Serbian interior. Shortly after, they moved to Niš as it was further from the frontlines. There, Bojić worked as a military censor. He wrote articles for the Niš Gazette (Niški glasnik) to pay his family's bills. In early February 1915, Bojić's mother died of cancer, leaving him {{to take care of his}} younger siblings.|$|E
5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarter—Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b> Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it {{was considered to be}} {{only a matter of time}} before they folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe did not want to see the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E

In 1966, Ueshiba sent Kazuo (T. K.) Chiba to the UK to continue the work Abbe had begun. Henry O'Tani (2009) has stated that during Abbe's absence from the UK, a dismissed BJC senior executive and several senior instructors misappropriated his financial and organisational resources and set up their own BJC group. In 1969, Abbe {{returned to}} the UK, but was distraught by the situation with this group that he had not authorised. When he asked former colleagues to help him rebuild the organisation, they refused; he subsequently left the UK, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E
5|$|Richard rewarded Longchamp {{with the}} custody of Eye and an {{appointment}} as Sheriff of Essex and Sheriff of Hertfordshire when the pair returned to England, but Longchamp soon became embroiled in a renewal of his disagreement with Archbishop Geoffrey of York.

Richard continued to use Longchamp in diplomacy—although it was Geoffrey who arranged a truce with King Philip in 1194—as well as retaining the bishop as chancellor, but the main power in England was now Hubert Walter.

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War cost Brown his peak years, which he spent in the Royal Australian Air Force. Cricket resumed in 1945–46 and Brown, in Bradman's absence, captained an Australian eleven in a match that was retrospectively awarded Test status. Brown missed {{the entirety of the}} following season because of injury. Upon his return, he was unable to repeat his previous success and was ousted from the opening positions by Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes. Selected for the Invincibles tour, he performed reasonably well in the tour matches but, with Morris and Barnes entrenched as openers, he batted out of position in the middle order during the first two Tests. He struggled and was dropped from the Test team, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b> Upon returning to Australia, Brown continued playing for Queensland {{until the end of the}} 1949–50 season.|$|E

5|$|Al-Razzaz, Aflaq's {{successor}} as Secretary General, {{came from}} the pro-Aflaq faction. With the defection of al-Hafez, he ordered that the National Command was the de jure ruling body of the Ba'ath Party. He appointed al-Bitar Prime Minister, Umran defence minister, Mansur al-Atrash as Chairman of the National Council of the Revolutionary Command and al-Hafiz retained his post as President of Syria. Salah Jadid, the Military Committee's strongman, responded by arresting several Umran supporters. Umran responded by dismissing a handful of pro-Jadid officials. The {{most important of these}} dismissals was the removal of Ahmad Suwaydani from the post of head of the country's military intelligence to head of the Officer Administration. On 23 February a coup d'état led by Jadid and Hafez al-Assad overthrew the Syrian Government and the Ba'ath Party leadership. Aflaq was exiled from Syria, and ordered <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> his homeland. Members of the party's other factions fled; Aflaq was captured and detained, along with other pro-Aflaq supporters, in a government guest house. When the new rulers launched a purge in August that year, Aflaq managed to make his escape, with the help of Nasim Al Safarjalani and Malek Bashour, both closely trusted friends and colleagues, and hence was able to flee to Beirut, Lebanon, and later to Brazil.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his fame and success, while The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) was still being {{performed}} in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials he was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison, he wrote De Profundis (published posthumously in 1905), a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. Upon his release, he left immediately for France, <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life. He died destitute in Paris at the age of 46.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Harvey {{was facing}} serious setbacks. Harvey's son Hal {{had died in}} 1903 and was interred in a {{mausoleum}} in Monte Ne. His other son, Tom, had left in 1908 <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>return.</b> The next decade would not bring better news for Harvey either. Harvey and his wife, Anna, were now permanently estranged after 25 years of marriage. Harvey's close friend William Jennings Bryan failed {{to find a place}} for him in the new Woodrow Wilson administration. Harvey's 1913 bid for the Third Congressional District of Arkansas also failed. His Monte Ne was also failing. The railway had been sold and would be scrapped after World War I. The Bank of Monte Ne had also gone out of business. Faced with these severe dilemmas, Harvey had begun reasoning that the end of civilization was at hand. In February 1920, he published Common Sense, in which Harvey announced his intention to leave a message for the future {{in the form of a}} pyramid.|$|E
