5|$|For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli {{campaign}} came to symbolise {{an important}} milestone in {{the emergence of}} both <b>nations</b> <b>as</b> independent actors on the world stage {{and the development of a}} sense of national identity.

40|$|Cultural {{cognition}} is {{a multidisciplinary}} concept that links anthropology, linguistics, psychology and sociology. This study {{focuses on the}} culture-specific interpretation of collective, specifically national, identities, constructed through conceptual metaphor. Its data consist of a questionnaire survey, administered in 10 countries to students from 31 linguistic backgrounds who were given the task of applying {{the metaphor of the}} <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> a body to their home nation. The results show systematic variation of four main interpretations, i. e. <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> geobody, as functional whole, as part of self and as part of global structure, plus of a non-primed interpretation <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> person. The two dominant interpretation patterns, i. e. <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> geobody and <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> functional whole, were represented across all cohorts but showed opposite frequency patterns for Chinese versus Western cohorts; in addition, the Chinese <b>nation</b> <b>as</b> person interpretations showed a marked preference for mother-personifications. These findings can be linked to culture-specific conceptualisations and discourse traditions and contribute to a constructivist, non-essentialising definition of cultural cognition as a central issue of Cultural Linguistics...|$|R

40|$|Metaphor use is characterised by {{conceptual}} variation {{that can}} be explained with reference to culture-specific discourse traditions. Cognitively oriented metaphor analyses that are interested in cultural relativity have so far concentrated mainly on the production side of metaphors and their misunderstanding by ESL learners. This study, by contrast, focuses on variation in metaphor interpretation across groups of ESL/EFL users from 31 cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Its data consist of a questionnaire survey, administered in 10 countries, which gave students the task of applying {{the metaphor of the}} “body politic” to one’s home nation. The results show systematic variation between four interpretation models for this metaphor, i. e. <b>NATION</b> <b>AS</b> GEOBODY, <b>NATION</b> <b>AS</b> FUNCTIONAL WHOLE, <b>NATION</b> <b>AS</b> PART OF SELF and <b>NATION</b> <b>AS</b> PART OF INTERNATIONAL/GLOBAL STRUCTURE, as well as some evidence of elaborate polemical and/or political elaboration. The two main versions, i. e. <b>NATION</b> <b>AS</b> GEOBODY and <b>NATION</b> <b>AS</b> FUNCTIONAL WHOLE, were represented across all cohorts but exhibited opposite frequency patterns across Chinese v. Western cohorts, with the former favouring GEOBODY-based, the latter functional interpretations. This finding and the evidence of elaborate metaphor interpretations lead to culture-specific motivations of variation in metaphor interpretation (as well as in metaphor production), specifically with regard to the frequency and distribution patterns of source concepts. Metaphor interpretation analysis can thus contribute to a cognitive metaphor analysis in general and especially to “cultural linguistics” approach to metaphor...|$|R

This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of <b>Nations</b> <b>as</b> the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period.
