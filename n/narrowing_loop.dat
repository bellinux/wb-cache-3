40|$|In {{order to}} track the carrier phases of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals in signal {{degraded}} environments, a dual antenna joint carrier tracking loop is proposed and evaluated. This proposed tracking loop processes inputs from two antennas, namely the master antenna and the slave antenna. The master antenna captures signals in open-sky environments, while the slave antenna capture signals in degraded environments. In this architecture, a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is adopted as a master loop {{to track the}} carrier phase of the open-sky signals. The Doppler frequency estimated by this master loop is utilized to assist weak carrier tracking in the slave loop. As both antennas experience similar signal dynamics due to satellite motion and clock frequency variations, a much <b>narrower</b> <b>loop</b> bandwidth and possibly a longer coherent integration can be adopted to track the weak signals in slave channels, by utilizing the Doppler aid from master channels. PLL tracking performance {{is affected by the}} satellite/user dynamics, clock instability, and thermal noise. In this paper, their impacts on the proposed phase tracking loop are analyzed and verified by both simulation and field data. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed loop structure can track degraded signals (i. e., 18 dB-Hz) with a very <b>narrow</b> <b>loop</b> bandwidth (i. e., 0. 5 Hz) and a TCXO clock...|$|R

Restoration of the estuary to a higher degree of function relies upon the probability of delivering increased benefits to the pelagic web without subsidizing the benthic.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-A significant. {{problem in}} phase-locked loop (PLL) timing and carrier {{extraction}} is the initial acquisition. Very <b>narrow</b> <b>loop</b> bandwidths are generally required to control phase jitter, and acquisition {{may depend on}} an extremely accurate initial VCO frequency (VCXO) or sweeping. We describe two simply implemented frequency detectors which, when added to the traditional phase detector, can effect acquisition even with very small loop bandwidths and large initial frequency offsets. The first is the quadricorrelator, previously applied to timing recovery by Bellisio, while the second is new, and called a rotational frequency detector. The latter, while limited to lower frequencies and higher signal-to-noise ratios, is suitable for many applications and can be implemented with simpler circuitry.

50|$|Laminated {{magnetic}} cores {{are made}} of stacks of thin iron sheets coated with an insulating layer, lying {{as much as possible}} parallel with the lines of flux. The layers of insulation serve as a barrier to eddy currents, so eddy currents can only flow in <b>narrow</b> <b>loops</b> within the thickness of each single lamination. Since the current in an eddy current loop is proportional to the area of the loop, this prevents most of the current from flowing, reducing eddy currents to a very small level. Since power dissipated is proportional to the square of the current, breaking a large core into narrow laminations reduces the power losses drastically. From this, {{it can be seen that}} the thinner the laminations, the lower the eddy current losses.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{suggestion}} that increased QT dispersion (QTD) {{is due to}} increased differences in local action potential durations within the myocardium is wanting. An alternative explanation was sought by relating QTD to vectorcardiographic T-loop morphology. METHODS AND RESULTS: The T loop is characterized by its amplitude and width (defined as the spatial angle between the mean vectors {{of the first and}} second halves of the loop). We reasoned that small, wide ("pathological") T loops produce larger QTD than large, <b>narrow</b> ("normal") <b>loops.</b> To quantify the relationship between QTD and T-loop morphology, we used a program for automated analysis of ECGs and a database of 1220 standard simultaneous 12 -lead ECGs. For each ECG, QT durations, QTD, and T-loop parameters were computed. T-loop amplitude and width were dichotomized, with 250 microV (small versus large amplitudes) and 30 degrees (<b>narrow</b> versus wide <b>loops)</b> taken as thresholds. Over all 1220 ECGs, QTDs were smallest for large, <b>narrow</b> T <b>loops</b> (54. 2 +/- 27. 1 ms) and largest for small, wide loops (69. 5 +/- 33. 5 ms; P< 0. 001).

For example, the ΔM plot of a nucleation-controlled two-domain particle gives the false impression of a positive intergranular interaction. A simple but nontrivial cooperative model, consisting of two interacting but nonequivalent particles, is used to show that cooperative effects are most pronounced for narrow switching-field distributions, i. e., for nearly rectangular loops.

Introduction For passive RFID applications, an interrogator is used to send signal and energy to a tag/transponder attached to the object for identification (ID) [1].

Most passive RF tags require active devices like diodes to convert the incident RF energy to DC power to drive the Integrated Circuit (IC) chip which store the ID code and perform the necessary logic functions. The use of active devices on the tag would increase the cost and thus limit applications which are price sensitive. Therefore, optical tagging like bar code which [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} flux periodicity in superconducting loops is reviewed. Whereas quantization of the {{magnetic flux}} with hc/ 2 e prevails in sufficiently thick loops with current free interior, the supercurrent in <b>narrow</b> <b>loops</b> is either hc/ 2 e or hc/e periodic with the external magnetic flux. The periodicity depends on {{the properties of the}} condensate state, in particular on the Doppler shift of the energy spectrum. For an s-wave superconductor in a loop with diameter larger than the coherence length, the Doppler shift is small with respect to the energy gap, and the hc/ 2 e periodic behavior of its flux dependent thermodynamic properties is maintained. However, for smaller s-wave loops and, more prominently, <b>narrow</b> d-wave <b>loops</b> of any diameter R, the Doppler shift has a strong effect on the supercurrent carrying state; as a consequence, the fundamental flux periodicity is in fact hc/e. It is shown analytically and numerically that the hc/e periodic component in the supercurrent decays only algebraically as 1 /R for large d-wave loops. For nodal superconductors the discrete nature of the eigenergies close to the Fermi energy has to be respected in the evaluation of the Doppler shift. Furthermore, we investigate, whether the Doppler shift modifies the supercurrent through Josephson junctions with d-wave superconductors. For transparent junctions, the Josephson current behaves similar to the persistent supercurrent in a loop. These distinct physical phenomena can be compared, if the magnetic flux in units of hc/e is identified with the phase variation of the order parameter divided by 4 pi.
