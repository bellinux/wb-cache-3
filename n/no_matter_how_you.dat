Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the support}} for the Quantification Settlement Agreement has been {{associated}} with government agencies, on both the state and federal level. Numerous government agencies produced press releases that touted the benefits of the agreement. Many of these releases noted that this was the largest water transfer agreement in American history. Although residents of the Imperial Valley have been the main opponents of this measure, some observers have embraced the agreement, arguing that it is the most realistic and pragmatic solution to the water crisis in the area. Brad Jennings, a tentative supporter of the agreement, notes that [...] "There are things most agree on: The Salton Sea must be saved. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> feel about water transfers you know that a dead Sea would be an environmental disaster for us. And our water rights and water allotment must be protected. That means we may have to give some up, which is what the QSA was designed to do." [...] He also argued that the measure would likely prevent federal intervention, a concern of many residents of the Imperial Valley.|$|E
