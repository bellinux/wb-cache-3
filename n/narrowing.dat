5|$|The plan {{included}} <b>narrowing</b> 3rd Avenue from four-lanes westbound {{towards the}} Robert C.

The road <b>narrowing</b> plan was envisioned as a traffic calming measure.|$|E
5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have <b>narrowing</b> of the transverse sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this <b>narrowing</b> is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous <b>narrowing</b> in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP.|$|E
5|$|Afterload, or {{how much}} {{pressure}} the heart must generate to eject blood at systole, is influenced by vascular resistance. It can be influenced by <b>narrowing</b> of the heart valves (stenosis) or contraction or relaxation of the peripheral blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|Most strokes {{result from}} loss of blood supply, {{typically}} {{because of an}} embolus, rupture of a fatty plaque or <b>narrowing</b> of small arteries. Strokes can also result from bleeding within the brain. Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) are strokes in which symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Investigation into the stroke will involve a medical examination (including a neurological examination) and the taking of a medical history, focusing on {{the duration of the}} symptoms and risk factors (including high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and smoking). Further investigation is needed in younger patients. An ECG and biotelemetry may be conducted to identify atrial fibrillation; an ultrasound can investigate <b>narrowing</b> of the carotid arteries; an echocardiogram can be used to look for clots within the heart, diseases of the heart valves or the presence of a patent foramen ovale. Blood tests are routinely done as part of the workup including diabetes tests and a lipid profile.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary, or pulmonic {{stenosis}} is {{an often}} congenital <b>narrowing</b> of the pulmonary valve; {{it can be}} present in nasodigitoacoustic-affected infants.

50|$|The <b>Narrows</b> in Zion National Park, (near Springdale, Utah) is {{a section}} of canyon on the North Fork of the Virgin River.

The <b>Narrows</b> lies north of, and upstream of, the main Zion Canyon. Hiking the <b>Narrows</b> was rated # 5 in the National Geographic ranking of America's Best 100 Adventures.|$|R
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme <b>narrowing</b> of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming. This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as <b>narrowing</b> and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County Route 507 {{to the south}} of Route 7 and Bergen County Route 130 to the north of Route 7), the road turns NNW, <b>narrowing</b> again to two lanes undivided. In this portion of the route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for about a half mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that point, it meets the southern terminus of State Route 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of Hudson County Route 697 (Kearny Avenue).|$|E

5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or <b>narrowing</b> in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|I-695 widens to nine lanes past {{interchange}} with I-95, {{with five}} lanes in the southbound direction and four lanes in the northbound direction. Running northwest, it crosses over Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor {{and comes to}} a partial interchange with US 1 (Southwestern Boulevard), with a southbound exit and northbound entrance. From here, it continues northwest through residential areas of Catonsville to an interchange with MD 372 (Wilkens Avenue). <b>Narrowing</b> to eight lanes total, with four lanes in each direction, beyond MD 372, the route continues through suburban neighborhoods before coming to an interchange with MD 144 (Frederick Road). At this point, I-695 narrows to seven lanes, with three southbound lanes and four northbound lanes. It continues north and interchanges with Edmondson Avenue before turning northwest and intersects US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) near the defunct Westview Mall, now a big-box complex. Beyond US 40, I-695 continues north through residential areas, <b>narrowing</b> to six lanes, with three lanes in each direction, before coming to a four-level stack interchange with I-70 in Woodlawn.|$|E

40|$|In this letter, we firstly report one unique object SDSS J 0832 + 0643 with {{particular}} features of <b>narrow</b> balmer emission lines: double-peaked <b>narrow</b> Hα but single-peaked <b>narrow</b> Hβ. The particular features {{can not be}} expected by currently proposed kinematic models for double-peaked <b>narrow</b> emission lines, because the proposed kinematic models lead to similar line profiles of <b>narrow</b> balmer emission lines. However, due to radiative transfer effects, the non-kinematic model can be naturally applied to well explain the particular features of <b>narrow</b> balmer emission lines: larger optical depth in Hα than 10 leads to observed double-peaked <b>narrow</b> Hα, but smaller optical depth in Hβ around 2 leads to observed single-peaked <b>narrow</b> Hβ. Therefore, SDSS J 0832 + 0643 can be used as strong evidence to support the non-kinematic model for double-peaked <b>narrow</b> emission lines.
