40|$|The {{demand for}} <b>organic</b> <b>certification</b> is {{gradually}} increasing in Nepal {{although it is}} in early stage. <b>Organic</b> <b>certification</b> is a written assurance given by an independent third party about the production methodology and quality of products to confirm special requirements. Certification brings opportunities for protection of local resources, better market access, improvement of worker and consumer health, and eventually enhancement of living conditions of rural communities. The demanding nature of regulatory requirements makes it difficult as well as expensive for local certification initiatives in developing markets to establish themselves to offer export certification. Certification cost, limited awareness of group certification, small and medium-sized farms and inadequate understanding of how <b>organic</b> <b>certification</b> works {{are some of the}} constraints for <b>organic</b> <b>certification.</b> Certification Alliance (Cert All), a regional collaboration in certification representing national and international <b>organic</b> <b>certification</b> bodies, addresses the aforementioned challenges.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of the new mandatory EU logo for organic food and farming, the various existing <b>organic</b> <b>certification</b> schemes in the European market face a challenge: Producers and retailers might only continue to display the existing organic logos on product packages if the underlying certification schemes offer consumers an added value compared to the mandatory EU logo and its scheme. The present study aims to identify potential added values that <b>organic</b> <b>certification</b> schemes could incorporate to differentiate themselves from the mandatory EU logo. The study explores consumer awareness and perception of different <b>organic</b> <b>certification</b> schemes and the corresponding logos, about which little is known to date. The qualitative approach with focus group discussions in the five European countries Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom revealed that consumer knowledge of <b>organic</b> <b>certification</b> schemes is generally low. In Italy and the United Kingdom, the great majority of participants was not aware of any differences between the schemes that were discussed. In the Czech Republic, Denmark and Germany, several participants preferred a particular <b>organic</b> <b>certification</b> scheme over others. The following aspects could be identified as potential added values for certification schemes to differentiate themselves from the EU logo and the underlying scheme: Stricter production standards, stricter control, domestic origin, and fair prices for farmers...|$|R
