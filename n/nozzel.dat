The objective of this research was to obtain the best design of small scale rice husk gasifier from among geometry scenarios by applying computational fluid dynamics method. The geometry scenarios used in this study were angle of throat 70 O, 80 O, and 90 O, and also angle of <b>nozzel</b> 10 O and 20 O. The softwares used in this study were Gambit 2. 4. 6 (meshing 3 D model) and Ansys Fluent 13. 0 (simulation). The reactions involved in gasification (3 heterogeneous reactions and 6 homogeneous reactions) were solved by finite rate/Eddy dissipation model. Results of simulation showed that gasifier with angle of throat 90 O and angle of <b>nozzel</b> 10 O produced the highest heating value of gas with volume fraction of CO, H 2, and CH 4 is 14. 49 %, 9. 65 %, and 2. 39 % respectively.

40|$|Independent {{control of}} {{particle}} velocity and {{temperature in the}} HVOF process has been achieved in this research, allowing the variables to change by 170 m/s and 200 {degree}C, respectively. The independence was achieved using a specially designed <b>nozzel</b> with multiple axial injection ports, and with an inert diluent added to the oxygen used for combustion. With these changes, notable changes in splat morphology, porosity, and coating oxidation are readily apparent. Increased particle velocity correlates with improved splat deformation, but appears to have little effect on porosity or oxidation. Particle temperature, however, correlates strongly with splat deformation, porosity, and oxidation. In fact, highly dense coatings that have little oxidation can be formed with relatively low velocity particles that have average temperatures {{in the vicinity of}} the melting point of the material. This surprising result suggests particle temperature control is the key to creating dense, low-oxide HVOF-sprayed coatings...|$|E

40|$|As {{economic}} circumstances change and environmental legislation tightens, paper mills {{are forced to}} minimise their energy and water consumption to produce minimum emissions. A competitive product based water treatment concept to Zero Liquid Effluent (ZLE) {{is based on the}} 'five-fraction model'. To remove suspended solids two novel separation technologies are tested with pilot trials at paper mill Niederauer Mühle. The first pre-treatment technology is a Settle Plate Clarifier (SPC). The SPC was installed for seven months at the paper mill and it was running more stable than a DAF-unit under dynamic papermaking conditions. The SPC has an average TSS-removal efficiency of 96. 5 % and a particle-removal efficiency of 94 % for particles between 0. 8 and 100 μm. The best application for SPC would be a pre-treatment followed by a second step dissolved air flotation. This way the clarified process water could be re-used on <b>nozzels</b> of the wire section without risk. As a second pre-treatment technology a Rotating Filter Technology (Rofitec) is tested. The experiments were done with two different pilot units, fist with a non-selfclening Rofitec, which is running as batch process, and second with a continuous selfcleaning Rofitec. The selfcleaning Rofitec can reach a TSS-removal efficiency up to 99. 5 % and a particle removal efficiency of 93 %. The Rofitec is an ideal technology for after treatment of DAF sludge or reject from SPC up to an inlet consistency of 3 % to reduce the waste volume (Reject consistency: 30 - 33 %, Thickening factor: 97 - 99 %) ...|$|R

The flow field was visualized by schlieren photos and the instantaneous velocity field was quantitatively investigated by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The measurements of the velocity field gave an insight into stationary effects, for example the change of shock strength with coolant flow rate, and instationary effects such as the existence of a vortex street in the wake. The PIV technique offers special advantages for the investigation of transonic flow fields, but also yields to special experimental difficulties, which are also describle in this article. Measured losses display a maximum at the downstream Mach number 1. This is strongly related to the behaviour of the base pressure. A loss minimum is achieved at moderate coolant flow rates, showing that an optimum coolant flow rate exists. The loss was analysed and separated into the loss contributions from the profile upstream of the trailing edge and the mixing loss due to the coolant flow...|$|E

The study result indicates that the lamellae structure, and vertical columnar grains, micron-sized pores and rough interlamellar contacts with gaps of sub-micron sizes between lamellaes are found in PSF deposits. The relative density, micro-hardness, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and compressive strength of PSF deposits are 87. 5 %, 321. 4 HV 0. 025, 57. 9 MPa and 390. 2 MPa respectively.

An efficient cathode for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is mainly determined by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the mixed materials. We demonstrate a new microstructure design through a nanofibrous electrode based on an unique corn-cob structure. One-step process to produce a corn-cob ceramic nanofiber of La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 MnO 3 (LSM) and Y 2 O 3 -stabilized ZrO 2 (YSZ) is introduced by an electrospinning equipped with a coaxial <b>nozzel.</b> From the microscope analysis, perfect corn-cob nanofibers are finely produced with the diameter of 350 nm for a core and nanoparticles (30 - 40 nm) stacked on the surface like as a core-shell structure. The cathode fabricated by nanofibers with LSM outside and YSZ inside (YSZ@LSM) shows the best maximum power density of 1. 15 Wcm- 2 at 800 oC with low polarization resistance, which is higher than the reverse core and shell positions (LSM@YSZ) and even the commercial LSM-YSZ. This better outcome is more obvious at the elevated temperature due to the accelerated catalytic activity. Therefore, we could find the insight into the key factors enhancing the ORR activity and single cell performance in terms of not only the nanofibrous core@shell structure but also more reaction active sites from the optimum catalyst position at the designed corn-cob nanofibers based cathodes.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{formation}} of iron oxide nanopatzicles from iron-pentacarbonyl in the gasphase was studied experimentally and was compared to computer simulations. Three gasphase reactors, which are different regarding energy tranfer into the reactive gases, were employed: a low-pressure flame reactor, a microwave reactor and a hot-wall reactor. The effects on the growth processes of the particles were studied with a particle-mass-spectrometer. The {{physical and chemical properties}} were measued by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and SQUID magnetometry. Reasults from the flame reactor have shown that in all cases g -Fe 2 O 3 particles were formed. The single phase particles exhibit superparamagnetic behaviour with a size-depending saturation magnetization and blocking temperature. The flow coordinate was shown to be the most influencing paramter in the flame reactor. A change from the burner exit to the probing <b>nozzel</b> in the ange from 65 to 120 mm revealed a mass growth of about 180 %. Variation of the gas compsition, pressure, and precursor concentration have no distinct influence on the mean particle mass. A comparison with a computer model yield a good agreement to the experimental data. Experiments with the microwave driven reacor showed similar results regarding the phase of the formed particles. The mean particle sizes were between 3 and 5 nm. Besides the precursor concentratrion, the microwave power is the main size determining factor while the reaction chamber pressure has no influence. Between concentrations of 520 ppm and 2060 ppm, the particle size increases by 20 %, with increasing microwave power the particle size decreases. The formation of iron oxide nanoparticles in the hot-wall reactor could be followed by transmission electron microscopy. Below T = 500 °C the particles are a mixture of amorphous and crystallin iron oxide. An increasing precursor concentration leads to an increase in particle size as well as an increasing reaction chamber pressure. The tempereature has only a marginal effect on particle size...|$|E
