In the Rocky Mountains, the slopes have forests of Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and aspen trees at lower elevations.

Recent developments in decision support software are such that the time may have come when information technology will contribute significantly to managerial decision-making. This paper considers these developments alongside the organisational issues involved in decision-making, and the current position of IT in many mature organisations. The conclusion is that the <b>new</b> <b>range</b> of decision <b>support</b> software, whilst opening up further areas for computerised decision support, is unlikely to compete successfully for corporate IT funds.

50|$|Essential to {{the plan}} was close {{integration}} of product and production planning. Volkswagen’s development chief, Werner Holste, having recently left the company, Leiding announced that as chairman he would now himself take direct responsibility for development of the company’s <b>new</b> product <b>range,</b> <b>supported</b> by a <b>new</b> position for the Production Director at Audi, Ludwig Kraus, the man who recently had secretly, and in direct contravention of instructions from Volkswagen’s first autocratic chairman, developed to production readiness the Audi 100, a car which stood apart from the group’s other new models of recent years {{because it was a}} success from both the engineering and the marketing perspectives. In 1973 the European auto-industry stood on the brink of an economic crisis that would prove more challenging than anything experienced for more than two decades. Ludwig Kraus himself was already 62 years old and now faded from prominence, but Leiding’s plan for Volkswagen nevertheless unfolded very much as he had laid out to the press in the early summer of 1973.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Simulations {{have become}} key in many {{scientific}} disciplines {{to better understand}} natural phenomena. Neuroscientists, for example, build and simulate increasingly fine-grained models (including subcellular details, e. g., neurotransmitter) of the neocortex to understand the mechanisms causing brain diseases and to test new treatments in-silico. The sheer size and, more importantly, the level of detail of their models challenges today’s spatial data management techniques. In collaboration with the Blue Brain project (BBP) we develop new approaches that efficiently enable analysis, navigation and discovery in spatial models of the brain. More precisely, we develop an index for the scalable and efficient execution of spatial <b>range</b> queries <b>supporting</b> model <b>building</b> and analysis. Furthermore, we enable navigational access to the brain models, i. e., the execution of of series of range queries where he location of each query depends on the previous ones. To efficiently support navigational access, we develop a method that uses previous query results to prefetch spatial data with high accuracy and therefore speeds up navigation. Finally, to enable discovery based on the range queries, we conceive a novel in-memory spatial join. The methods we develop considerably outperform {{the state of the}} art, but more importantly, they enable the neuroscientists to scale to building, simulating and analyzing massively bigger and more detailed brain models. ...|$|R
