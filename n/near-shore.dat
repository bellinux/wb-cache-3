5|$|The {{specimens}} recovered {{are most}} common in <b>near-shore</b> environments; however, they are never abundant.|$|E
5|$|A fossil site at a {{borrow pit}} in near Cheswold, Delaware created during highway {{construction}} unearthed 11 specimens of fragmentary and unassociated avian fossils, which {{were identified by}} Rasmussen as including a small loon, a small gull-like species and five specimens of a gannet-like seabird, probably Morus loxostylus, a common species in the Miocene. All of these forms were already known from a site in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. The finds suggests that the Delaware site was the <b>near-shore</b> area of a large bay {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy <b>near-shore</b> habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{outcrops}} in north-central Chubut Province, and the mammalian fossils {{come from}} the Mirasol Chico valley. The formation includes fluvial (river), deep-sea, and <b>near-shore</b> deposits, and the mammalian fauna probably comes from an estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain. The La Colonia Formation also contains dryolestoids, such as Coloniatherium and Reigitherium, {{as well as a}} ferugliotheriid and the putative multituberculate Argentodites. In addition, the La Colonia Formation has yielded fossils of a wide array of other animals, including crocodiles, plesiosaurs, lungfish (Ceratodus), and dinosaurs (including Carnotaurus).|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} <b>near-shore</b> sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes. Occasionally squid, octopus, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp, and gastropods are also taken. In Shark Bay, the most important prey are silversides, herring, smelt-whitings, and wrasses; {{this is also the}} only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), found in seagrass beds avoided by other sharks. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, it feeds mainly on halfbeaks, herring, and mullets, and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns. Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans, switching to fish as they grow older.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} 19th and early 20th centuries {{indicate}} that the angelshark was once abundant all around the coasts of Western Europe. Yarrell (1836), Day (1880–04), and Garstang (1903) all noted that the angelshark was common around the British Isles, and Rey (1928) recorded that this species was common around the Iberian Peninsula and in the Mediterranean. However, from {{the latter half of}} the 20th century onwards, the angelshark has come under intense pressure from commercial fisheries operating across much of its range. Due to its benthic, <b>near-shore</b> habits, individuals of all ages are susceptible to incidental capture by bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; the low reproductive rate of this shark limits its capacity to withstand population depletion.|$|E
5|$|Ambulocetus natans, which lived about 49 {{million years}} ago, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. It was probably amphibious, and looked like a crocodile. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Ocean in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in <b>near-shore</b> shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water {{with a range of}} degrees of salinity, some specimens showing no evidence of sea water consumption and others none of fresh water consumption at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking, or freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. Hence, ambulocetids represent the transition phase of cetacean ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} {{that there have been}} at least 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing all the people that lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused <b>near-shore</b> subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in <b>near-shore</b> southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E
5|$|All {{identifiable}} {{fossils of}} Albertosaurus sarcophagus are {{known from the}} upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta. These younger units of this geologic formation date to the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, 70 to 68 Ma (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the Bearpaw Shale, a marine formation representing {{a section of the}} Western Interior Seaway. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided {{towards the end of the}} Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and <b>near-shore</b> marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, estuaries and tidal flats. Numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps. Like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation, Albertosaurus remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times.|$|E
25|$|Land-based and <b>near-shore</b> {{facilities}} offer {{three main}} advantages over those located in deep water. Plants constructed {{on or near}} land do not require sophisticated mooring, lengthy power cables, or the more extensive maintenance associated with open-ocean environments. They can be installed in sheltered areas {{so that they are}} relatively safe from storms and heavy seas. Electricity, desalinated water, and cold, nutrient-rich seawater could be transmitted from <b>near-shore</b> facilities via trestle bridges or causeways. In addition, land-based or <b>near-shore</b> sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as mariculture or those that require desalinated water.|$|E
25|$|Coastal {{sediment}} transport {{takes place in}} <b>near-shore</b> environments due to the motions of waves and currents. At the mouths of rivers, coastal sediment and fluvial {{sediment transport}} processes mesh to create river deltas.|$|E
25|$|Land-based or <b>near-shore</b> sites {{can also}} support {{mariculture}} or chilled water agriculture. Tanks or lagoons built on shore allow workers {{to monitor and}} control miniature marine environments. Mariculture products can be delivered to market via standard transport.|$|E
25|$|Despite these reports, {{however, the}} actual number of fatal shark attacks {{worldwide}} remains uncertain. For the majority of Third World coastal nations, there exists no method of reporting suspected shark attacks; therefore, losses and fatalities <b>near-shore</b> or at sea there often remain unsolved or unpublicized.|$|E
25|$|Sea {{levels in}} the Permian {{remained}} generally low, and <b>near-shore</b> environments were reduced as almost all major landmasses collected into a single continent– Pangaea. This could have in part caused the widespread extinctions of marine species {{at the end of}} the period by severely reducing shallow coastal areas preferred by many marine organisms.|$|E
25|$|Bull sharks can {{thrive in}} both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They {{have been known}} to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, {{although}} few freshwater human-shark interactions have been recorded. Larger sized bull sharks are probably responsible for the majority of <b>near-shore</b> shark attacks, including many bites attributed to other species.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{wind turbine}} cooperatives {{is not limited}} to single turbines. The Middelgrunden {{offshore}} wind farm – with 20turbines the world's largest offshore farm {{at the time it was}} built in 2000 – is 50% owned by the 10,000 investors in the Middelgrunden Wind Turbine Cooperative, and 50% by the municipal utility company, as is the Avedøre <b>near-shore</b> turbines.|$|E
25|$|Boorda {{signed a}} policy for naval {{oceanography}} (the first such revision in 10 years), which emphasized, among other things, that, {{in addition to}} deep-water missions, naval oceanographers must master the complicated tangle of the oceanographic/geographic subject areas {{that make up the}} science of the littorals, or <b>near-shore</b> areas, as well as the complex weather patterns characteristic of any coastal area.|$|E
25|$|Sikuliaq allows up to 26 {{scientists}} {{and students to}} conduct multi-disciplinary studies in high latitude open seas, <b>near-shore</b> regions and single-year sea ice, and facilitates the real-time virtual participation of classroom students via broadband connections. The major research opportunities include the effect of climate change and increased human use of Arctic regions on various issues such as ocean circulation and ecosystem dynamics.|$|E
25|$|Spinner {{dolphins}} in Hawaii receive multiple daily {{visits to}} their <b>near-shore</b> resting grounds, with boats taking people out daily to snorkel {{and interact with}} the local dolphin population. Such activities are increasingly coming under criticism {{on the grounds of}} possible harm to the dolphins, and efforts are being made both to educate the public in order to minimise human impact on the dolphins, and to bring in regulations to govern these activities.|$|E
25|$|The islands {{within the}} prefecture-level city of Zhuhai include {{a number of}} <b>near-shore</b> islands, often {{connected}} to the mainland by bridges or causeways (such as Hengqin, Qi'ao, or Yeli Islands), {{as well as some}} islands in the open South China Sea (the Wanshan Archipelago). Some of the latter are actually geographically closer to Hong Kong than to the Zhuhai mainland. The jurisdiction of Nei Lingding Island, located in the Pearl River estuary was transferred from Zhuhai to Shenzhen in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} rock strata are sandstone, shale, {{bituminous coal}} beds, and limestone {{laid down in}} a <b>near-shore</b> environment from sediments derived from mountains to the east, in a shallow inland sea on the west. Some beds illustrate a coastal swamp environment, some river delta, some shallow water. Sea level rose and fell many times during the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian eras, giving a variety of rock strata. The Appalachian Mountains {{are some of the}} oldest on earth, having formed over 300million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The Hakatai Shale {{consists}} of purple, reddish-purple, reddish-orange, and pale purple or lavender mudstone, sandy siltstone, siltstone, and arkosic sandstone. The brightly colored {{slopes of the}} Hakatai Shale contrasts sharply against the grayish outcrops of the Bass Formation. The sloping exposures of the Hakatai Shale also contrast greatly with the steep cliffs formed by the overlying Shinumo Quartzite. Stromatolites occur in the transitional zone between the Hakatai Shale and Bass Formation. The Hakatai Shale accumulated in low-energy, shallow, <b>near-shore,</b> marine environments.|$|E
25|$|Gobies {{are spread}} {{all over the world}} in {{tropical}} and temperate near shore-marine, brackish and freshwater environments. Their range extends from the Old World coral reefs to the seas of the New World, and includes the rivers and <b>near-shore</b> habitats of Europe and Asia. Gobies are generally bottom-dwellers. Although many live in borrows, a few species (in genera Caecogobius, Glossogobius and Luciogobius) are true cavefish. On coral reefs, gobies constitute 35% {{of the total number of}} fishes and 20% of the species diversity.|$|E
25|$|The Halifax {{class were}} {{fitted with a}} {{modified}} Sea Giraffe SG-150 multi-function search radar. The SG-150 HC will be upgraded and will secure {{a high level of}} operational availability as well improved functions. Thales supplied 13 Smart-S Mk2 S-band radars, including one for training purposes. These radars are optimized for medium-to-long range search and target designation {{with a high degree of}} detection. The Smart-S Mk2 is a 3D multibeam radar which can detect hostile targets in <b>near-shore</b> environments. The deliveries began at the end of 2010 and were completed in 2015.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 {{winter was}} unusually warm, with little ice forming in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in February and March, when harp seals {{give birth to}} their pups on ice floes. Around the Gulf, harp seals arrived in late winter to give birth on <b>near-shore</b> ice and even on beaches rather than on their usual whelping grounds: sturdy sea ice. Also, seal pups born {{elsewhere}} began floating to shore on small, shrinking pieces of ice. Many others stayed too far north, {{out of reach of}} all but the most determined hunters. Environment Canada, the weather forecasting agency, reported the ice was at the lowest level on record.|$|E
25|$|Beach {{nourishment}} {{has significant}} impacts on local ecosystems. Nourishment may cause direct mortality to sessile organisms {{in the target}} area by burying them under the new sand. Seafloor habitat in both source and target areas are disrupted, e.g., when sand is deposited on coral reefs or when deposited sand hardens. Imported sand may differ in character (chemical makeup, grain size, non-native species) {{from that of the}} target environment. Light availability may be reduced, affecting nearby reefs and submerged aquatic vegetation. Imported sand may contain material toxic to local species. Removing material from <b>near-shore</b> environments may destabilize the shoreline, in part by steepening its submerged slope. Related attempts to reduce future erosion may provide {{a false sense of security}} that increases development pressure.|$|E

25|$|The Horseshoe Canyon Formation {{has been}} radiometrically dated as being between 74 and 67 million years old. It was {{deposited}} during the gradual {{withdrawal of the}} Western Interior Seaway, during the Campanian and Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is a terrestrial unit {{which is part of}} the Edmonton Group that includes the Battle Formation and the Whitemud Member, both in Edmonton. The valley where dinosaurs lived included ancient meandering estuary channels, straight channels, peat swamps, river deltas, floodplains, shorelines and wetlands. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and <b>near-shore</b> marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, and tidal flats. The area was wet and warm with a temperate to subtropical climate. Just prior to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, the mean annual temperature and precipitation in this region dropped rapidly. The dinosaurs from this formation form part of the Edmontonian land vertebrate age, and are distinct from those in the formations above and below.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the very}} large fault area, the Cascadia {{subduction}} zone can produce large earthquakes of magnitude 7.0or greater. The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500years. During these periods, stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin. When the plate finally slips, the 500years of stored energy are released in a massive earthquake. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. It also made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened.

25|$|It is {{sometimes}} claimed that as {{with some other}} seabirds (e.g. the flightless Plotopteridae), the evolutionary radiation of cetaceans and pinnipeds outcompeted the pseudotooth birds and drove them into extinction. While this may be correct for the plotopterids, for pelagornithids it is not all too likely for two reasons: First, the Pelagornithidae continued to thrive for 10 million years after modern-type baleen whales evolved, and in the Middle Miocene Pelagornis coexisted with Aglaocetus and Harrison's whale (Eobalaenoptera harrisoni) in the Atlantic off the Eastern Seaboard, while the Pacific Osteodontornis inhabited the same seas as Balaenula and Morenocetus; the ancestral smallish sperm whale genus Aulophyseter (and/or Orycterocetus) occurred in both Northern Hemisphere oceans at that time, while the mid-sized sperm whale Brygmophyseter roamed the North Pacific. As regards Miocene pinnipeds, a diversity of ancient walruses and ancestral fur seals like Thalassoleon inhabited the north-east, while the ancient leopard seal Acrophoca is a remarkable species known from the south-east Pacific. Secondly, pinnipeds are limited to <b>near-shore</b> waters while pseudotooth birds roamed the seas far and wide, like large cetaceans, and like all big carnivores all three groups were K-strategists with moderate to very low population densities.|$|E
500|$|The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area {{includes}} nine formations {{that together}} represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. At various periods {{in that time}} warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry <b>near-shore</b> environments covered the area. Uplift associated {{with the creation of}} the Colorado Plateaus lifted the region [...] starting 13 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|Octopuses live {{in every}} ocean, and {{different}} species {{have adapted to}} different marine habitats. As juveniles, common octopuses inhabit shallow tide pools. The Hawaiian day octopus (Octopus cyanea) lives on coral reefs; argonauts drift in pelagic waters. Abdopus aculeatus mostly lives in <b>near-shore</b> seagrass beds. Some species are adapted to the cold, ocean depths. The spoon-armed octopus (Bathypolypus arcticus) is found in abyssal plains at depths of , and Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis lives near hydrothermal vents at [...] The cirrate species are often free-swimming and live in deep-water habitats. No species are known to live in fresh water.|$|E
500|$|Originally part of {{the ancestral}} {{territory}} of the Snohomish people, the Kayak Point area was settled by American loggers from the 1850s to 1890s. After the <b>near-shore</b> timber had been logged away, Seattle real estate developer Clarence Dayton Hillman bought [...] along Port Susan, from Kayak Point to modern-day Warm Beach, from 1907 to 1909. Hillman platted the area, naming it [...] "Birmingham", and sold [...] parcels for $75 each (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars), advertising in Seattle-area newspapers during the 1909 Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition to prospective buyers. The Kilian family settled {{at the south end}} of Birmingham and later developed their property into a seaside resort in the 1920s, building roads, cabins, and a boat launch. The resort was named [...] "Kayak Point", after a pair of Inuit kayaks brought from King Island, Alaska, and displayed in front of the resort store.|$|E
500|$|Istiodactylus {{is known}} from the Wessex Formation and the younger, {{overlying}} Vectis Formation of the Wealden Group on the Isle of Wight. These formations date from the Barremian to the lower Aptian ages of the Early Cretaceous, about 120 million years ago. It is uncertain from which of these formations the first known specimen was collected, but {{it may have been}} the Wessex Formation, where isolated Istiodactylus teeth have been found. The Wessex Formation consists of fluvial (associated with rivers) strata, and was deposited in a meander-belt river system which flowed from west to east and occupied the Wessex Basin. Hooley's specimens were from the Vectis Formation; these specimens are encrusted in pyrite, which is typical for fossils there. The Vectis Formation consists of coastal and <b>near-shore</b> deposits, which were deposited in an environment dominated by tides. During the Early Cretaceous, southern England would have had a mean temperature in the range of [...] The Wessex Formation would have had a semi-arid climate similar to the modern Mediterranean region.|$|E
