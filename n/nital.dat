50|$|Broke and in despair, Drake {{attempted}} {{to commit suicide}} but was saved by Rachel van Helsing and Taj <b>Nital,</b> two vampire hunters. Through them, Drake met Quincy Harker, the son of Jonathan Harker and Mina Harker whose tale was told in Bram Stoker's novel. Rachel was the granddaughter of Abraham Van Helsing. Drake learned that Dracula had eventually caused the death of Jonathan Harker and Abraham Van Helsing some years after they had defeated him in the book's events. Quincy, Rachel, and Taj (whose family {{had been killed by}} vampires) were dedicated to killing Dracula and his vampiric followers. Frank Drake joined Quincy Harker's band of vampire hunters under the close tutelage of Rachel van Helsing and Quincy Harker.|$|E
50|$|Several years later, Dracula {{encountered}} the X-Men twice. Although Dracula (and all other vampires in the Marvel Universe) were eventually {{destroyed by the}} mystical Montessi Formula {{in the pages of}} Doctor Strange #62 (December 1983), the vampire lord was revived. Marvel published a four-issue Tomb of Dracula miniseries, reuniting Wolfman and Colan, under its Epic Comics imprint in 1991, and revived Dracula and his foes in the short-lived Nightstalkers and Blade series in the 1990s. Some unresolved plot threads from The Tomb of Dracula were addressed in the final three issues of Nightstalkers. These included the fates of Dracula's bride Domini, their son Janus, and vampire-hunter Taj <b>Nital.</b> Dracula took the title role in the miniseries Dracula: Lord of the Undead.|$|E
50|$|In a final battle, Varnae — a {{previous}} Lord of Vampires {{who has already}} returned — takes psychic control of King and directs him to kill his comrades. King stakes himself instead. Drake attempts to sacrifice his own life to kill Varnae, engineering an Exorcist-powered explosion. Blade, in self-defense, has already staked Taj <b>Nital,</b> his old comrade from The Tomb of Dracula (who had been turned vampiric between the two series). Blade survives and attends his teammates' funeral but encounters King again in the subsequent series Blade. There he learns King's plunge into a metal pole (rather than silver or wood) had fortuitously not killed him {{and that he had}} escaped the explosion. King also informs Blade that Drake was left scarred and crippled in both body and mind.|$|E
50|$|The series {{suffered}} {{from lack of}} direction for its first year; most significantly, {{each of the first}} three issues was plotted by a different writer. Though Gerry Conway is credited as sole writer of issue #1, the plot was actually written by Roy Thomas and editor Stan Lee, and Conway had no input into the issue until it had already been fully drawn. Conway was allowed to plot issue #2 by himself, and wrote a story heavily influenced by the British Hammer Films - a striking departure from the first issue, which was derivative of Universal's monster movies. Conway then quit the book due to an overabundance of writing assignments, and was replaced by Archie Goodwin with issue #3. Goodwin quit after only two issues, but also made major changes to the series's direction, including the introduction of cast members Rachel Van Helsing and Taj <b>Nital.</b> New writer Gardner Fox took the series in yet another direction, and introduced a romance between Frank Drake and Rachel Van Helsing, which would remain a subplot {{for the rest of the}} series. However, Thomas (who had by this time succeeded Lee as the editor of The Tomb of Dracula) felt that Fox's take did not work, and took him off the book after only two issues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After sintering, SmCo 5 magnets {{may present}} a surface layer {{depleted}} in Samarium. This happens because Samarium {{is much more}} susceptible for oxidation than cobalt. Besides, samarium has high vapour pressure. This Sm depleted zone is {{of the order of}} ~ 1 mm (in a 10 mm diameter magnet), and present oxygen content 1000 ppm higher than the center of the magnet. This layer is composed by SmCo(5 +x), which presents low coercivity (1 - 2 kOe). The occurrence of the Sm depleted layer is associated with kinks in the 2 nd quadrant of the hysteresis curve. After the removal of this layer, the hysteresis kinks disappear. The efficacy of different chemical etchings (<b>Nital</b> and chromic acid) to reveal microstructural constituents was discussed in detail. <b>Nital</b> is recommended for observation of magnetic domains under polarized light (Kerr effect), whereas chromic acid is more suitable to identify Sm 2 Co 7 and other high Sm phases...|$|E

Further tint etching in SMB resulted in the straw coloured martensite to appear as a band. Retained austenite is appearing as very fine white particles. The bainite is appearing as bluish-black background between the martensite constituents. Coarse dark grains are pearlite. Microhardness measurements and SEM studies further proved the constituents identity.

The reason for the thermal damage is a high local stick removal, which leads to a local overloading of the grinding wheel. The investigations have shown that a slight structural damage of the tooth flank surface layer caused by the grinding process does not necessarily lead to an early gear failure...|$|E

30|$|The {{chemical}} composition and mechanical {{properties of the}} steel plate were supplied by the manufacturer. Microstructural characterizations were carried out using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, EDAX GENESIS). The specimens for the OM and SEM observations were prepared using <b>Nital</b> (2  %) etching solution on the specimen’s surface. Before the chemical attack, the specimens were ground using sandpaper of 100 – 1000 mesh. Then, a polishing process was performed using diamond paste (1  μm) as the abrasive material.

The specimens were prepared with a careful mechanical polishing, using graduated SiC paper of 240, 340, 400, and 600 grades, cooled in all cases with water. The polishing was finished with an alumina solution (Al 2 O 3) in water on soft cloth. The microstructure was revealed by chemical etching by using <b>nital</b> (3 %) for 2 -s intervals. Optical micrographs were performed with an Optika Microscope model XD- 3 MET at 500 × and 1000 ×. Electron microscopy images were taken with a scanning electron microscope JEOL model JSM- 6360 LV, under the standard ASTM E 1508.|$|E
40|$|Plessite textures in the Toluca (Group IA) iron {{meteorite}} {{revealed by}} the selective attack of chlorine THE use of the selective attack by dry chlorine at 350 ~ on iron meteorites to expose high-nickel structures, e. g. schreibersite (rhabdite), {{has been described by}} Easton and Buckley (1979). Chlorine gas has the significant advantage over other con-ventional etchants (e. g. <b>nital</b> solution) of greater differential penetration of the polished specimen surface. The volatilization of ferric chloride from the low-nickel iron phases and the removal of the residual non-volatile chlorides by solution means that this technique can be used to expose residual high-nickel metal in plessite, an intimate inter-growth of low- and high-nickel phases.
