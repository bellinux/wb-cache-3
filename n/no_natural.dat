5|$|Californium that bioaccumulates in {{skeletal}} tissue releases {{radiation that}} disrupts the body's ability to form red blood cells. The element plays <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Although adult lions have <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> predators, {{evidence}} suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries on each other, either members of different prides encountering each other in territorial disputes, or members of the same pride fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.|$|E

5|$|Although gallium has <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with {{processes in the}} body {{in a manner similar}} to iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, {{and have}} noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis have been found as ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive birds {{have been found to}} be susceptible to avian influenza (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E

5|$|For several decades, <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> {{reproduction}} of pallid sturgeon was observed, {{since all the}} fish that had been captured were older specimens. In the late 1990s, young pallid sturgeon were discovered living in a restored riparian area of the lower Missouri River. This was the first documented example of wild spawned pallid sturgeon in 50 years. In 2007, two female pallid sturgeon were also reported to have spawned in the Missouri National Recreational River area located downstream from Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
5|$|If gcd(a,b)=1, then a and b {{are said}} to be coprime (or {{relatively}} prime). This property does not imply that a or b are themselves prime numbers. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6=2×3 and 35=5×7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. <b>No</b> <b>natural</b> number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.|$|E

This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays, but no results have been released, strongly implying that <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> hassium was found. The possible extent of primordial hassium on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, {{meaning that they}} {{themselves}} have <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E
5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} {{form the}} basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient. Molten lead {{has been used as a}} coolant for lead-cooled fast reactors.|$|E

5|$|Mercury (0.4AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the closest}} planet to the Sun and the {{smallest}} planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses). Mercury has <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle {{have not yet been}} adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Glover's pika {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species, and it occurs in remote areas of China which are unlikely to be affected by human activities. The current state of its population trend is unclear, as <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> historic or ecological investigation has been done on this species. However, being locally poisoned and trapped is a major threat to the Glover's pika populations. It is also regionally red listed as a species of least concern in China.|$|E
5|$|Technetium plays <b>no</b> <b>natural</b> {{biological}} {{role and}} is not normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E
