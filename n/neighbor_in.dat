5|$|The {{similarities}} of yttrium to the lanthanides are {{so strong}} that the element has historically been grouped with them as a rare-earth element, and is always found in nature together with them in rare-earth minerals. Chemically, yttrium resembles those elements more closely than its <b>neighbor</b> <b>in</b> the periodic table, scandium, and if physical properties were plotted against atomic number, it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides gadolinium and erbium.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{borders of}} Aquilonia are with Cimmeria. The Cimmerians are {{descendants of the}} people of Atlantis who managed to survive the cataclysm. They are still barbarians but have avoided the cultural stagnation of the Picts. Howard's essay on the nine kingdoms states that they maintained contact with their northern <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> Vanaheim and Asgard, their eastern <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> Hyperborea, their southeast <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> the Border Kingdoms, their southern <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> Aquilonia, and their western <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> the Pictish Wilderness. Through these contacts they become increasingly familiar with the advances of other people and undergo a gradual cultural development themselves.|$|R
30|$|In general, finer {{segmentation}} {{leads to}} fewer <b>neighbors.</b> <b>In</b> the CG_VX analysis, CG {{is a single}} phoneme, and all onset changes yield <b>neighbors.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, in the C_G_V_X analysis, the onset is split into C_G; of the four onset changes (first four lines), just two yield <b>neighbors.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the CG_VX analysis does not split the rime, and all the rime changes yield <b>neighbors.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, the C_G_V_X splits the rime into V_X, and of the three rime changes, just one yields a neighbor.|$|R

5|$|From the beginning, the {{alliance}} {{was much more}} valuable to the Commonwealth than to Prussia. Soon after the treaty was signed, the international situation, and changes within the Commonwealth, made the treaty much less valuable to the Prussian side. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth embarked {{on a series of}} major internal reforms, seeing {{the alliance}} as a guarantee that it had the backing of a powerful <b>neighbor</b> <b>in</b> this process – where in fact Prussia felt those reforms were not in its best interest, and felt threatened by them. When Russia invaded the Commonwealth in May 1792, Prussia refused a request to honor the alliance and intervene, arguing that it was not consulted with regard to the 3rd May Constitution, which invalidated the alliance. A few months later, in 1793, Prussia aided Russia in the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising.|$|E
5|$|A lead atom has 82 electrons, {{arranged}} in an electron configuration of 4f145d106s26p2. The combined {{first and second}} ionization energies—the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons—is close to that of tin, lead's upper <b>neighbor</b> <b>in</b> the carbon group. This is unusual; ionization energies generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer electrons become more distant from the nucleus, and more shielded by smaller orbitals. The similarity of ionization energies {{is caused by the}} lanthanide contraction—the decrease in element radii from lanthanum (atomic number 57) to lutetium (71), and the relatively small radii of the elements after hafnium (72). This is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the lanthanide 4f electrons. The combined first four ionization energies of lead exceed those of tin, contrary to what periodic trends would predict. Relativistic effects, which become significant in heavier atoms, contribute to this behavior. One such effect is the inert pair effect: the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding, making the distance between nearest atoms in crystalline lead unusually long.|$|E
5|$|Hyperion is Titan's nearest <b>neighbor</b> <b>in</b> the Saturn system. The two moons {{are locked}} in a 4:3 mean-motion {{resonance}} with each other, meaning that while Titan makes four revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes exactly three. With an average diameter of about 270km, Hyperion is smaller and lighter than Mimas. It has an extremely irregular shape, and a very odd, tan-colored icy surface resembling a sponge, though its interior may be partially porous as well. The average density of about 0.55g/cm3 indicates that the porosity exceeds 40% even assuming it has a purely icy composition. The surface of Hyperion is covered with numerous impact craters—those with diameters 2–10km are especially abundant. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. While on short timescales the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis {{at a rate of}} 72–75° per day, on longer timescales its axis of rotation (spin vector) wanders chaotically across the sky. This makes the rotational behavior of Hyperion essentially unpredictable.|$|E
30|$|The TTS {{reduces the}} {{synchronization}} messages significantly {{because it makes}} full use of node’s broadcast characteristic. A node’s broadcast range {{can be divided into}} three parts: area that covers <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> the previous layer, area that covers <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> the same layer, and area that covers <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> the next layer. In common protocols, a synchronized node can only synchronize its <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> the next layer. However, the reference node of TTS is able to synchronize all <b>neighbors</b> <b>in</b> the same and next layer. Therefore, the broadcast domain utilization of TTS is higher than that of common protocols. As depicted in Figure 1 a,b, TTS gives a roughly 2 × larger maximum synchronization area compared with other protocols. Moreover, the distributed TTS chooses the most appropriate nodes as the reference nodes. By minimizing reference nodes, TTS significantly reduces the number of timing packets which are heavy overheads in terms of energy consumption.|$|R

5|$|While {{some of the}} {{description}} may have been accurate, many puritanical embellishments were added to better fit the moral story being portrayed by the authorities. The modern medical condition that best fits {{the description}} of the infant is anencephaly, meaning partial or complete absence of a brain. This episode was just the beginning of the attention emanating from Dyer's personal tragedy. The religion of the Puritans demanded a close look at all aspects of one's life for signs of God's approval or disapproval. Even becoming a member of the Puritan church in New England required a public confession of faith, and any behavior that was viewed by the clergy as being unorthodox required a theological examination by the church, followed by a public confession and repentance by the offender. Such microscopic inspection caused even private matters to become looked at publicly for the purpose of instruction, and Dyer's tragedy was widely examined for signs of God's judgment. This led to a highly subjective form of justice, an example of which was the 1656 hanging of Ann Hibbins whose offense was simply being resented by her <b>neighbor.</b> <b>In</b> Winthrop's eyes Dyer's case was unequivocal, and he was convinced that her monstrous birth was a clear signal of God's displeasure with the antinomian heretics. Winthrop felt that it was quite providential that the discovery of the monstrous birth occurred exactly when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated from the local body of believers, and exactly one week before Dyer's husband was questioned in the Boston church for his heretic opinions.|$|E

25|$|Both {{approaches}} use {{the observation}} that in claw-free graphs, no vertex can have more than two neighbors in an independent set, and so the symmetric difference of two independent sets must induce a subgraph of degree at most two; that is, it is a union of paths and cycles. In particular, if I is a non-maximum independent set, it differs from any maximum independent set by even cycles and so called augmenting paths: induced paths which alternate between vertices not in I and vertices in I, and for which both endpoints have only one <b>neighbor</b> <b>in</b> I. As the symmetric difference of I with any augmenting path gives a larger independent set, the task thus reduces to searching for augmenting paths until no more can be found, analogously as in algorithms for finding maximum matchings.|$|E
25|$|In 1963 Bessie's sister Ruchoma visited {{their father}} in Israel and toured a planned Haredi housing {{development}} in northern Jerusalem called Kiryat Mattersdorf, {{which was founded}} by Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, the Mattersdorfer Rav, who was Ruchoma's <b>neighbor</b> <b>in</b> New York. Upon her return, Ruchoma told Bessie about her desire to buy an apartment there, and Bessie also expressed interest in buying an apartment.

25|$|Of {{course the}} above picture is a {{generalization}} {{as it pertains}} to materials with an extended lattice rather than a molecular structure. Molecular structure can also lead to localization of electrons. Although there are usually energetic reasons why a molecular structure results such that it does not exhibit partly filled orbitals (i.e. unpaired spins), some non-closed shell moieties do occur in nature. Molecular oxygen is a good example. Even in the frozen solid it contains di-radical molecules resulting in paramagnetic behavior. The unpaired spins reside in orbitals derived from oxygen p wave functions, but the overlap is limited to the one <b>neighbor</b> <b>in</b> the O2 molecules. The distances to other oxygen atoms in the lattice remain too large to lead to delocalization and the magnetic moments remain unpaired.|$|E
