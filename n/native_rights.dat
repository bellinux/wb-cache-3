25|$|In 1932, artist George Southwell was {{commissioned}} to paint murals in the rotunda depicting scenes from British Columbia history from 1792 to 1843. The work was completed three years later. Decades later, controversy arose over {{the depiction of}} west coast aboriginal people in the murals, which in modern times is now regarded as degrading. One mural, entitled Labour, portrays bare-breasted aboriginal women hauling timber while a white man watches. In another entitled Justice, an aboriginal chief is shown standing before a judge (said to be Matthew Baillie Begbie), suggesting the subjugation of natives to colonial law. However, Southwell's daughter claimed that her father depicted the chief as standing before another judge, one who championed <b>native</b> <b>rights</b> (notwithstanding Begbie's positive record in that regard).|$|E
25|$|New levies {{were imposed}} to finance these {{large-scale}} projects. Lack of manpower, however, caused the Company {{to rely on}} local chieftains as agents for revenue collection. Among those who cooperated with the Company, some abused their authority and overtaxed the natives, exacerbating dissatisfaction among local people already burdened by other new laws imposed by the Company. Mat Salleh viewed the Company’s new rules as an infringement of <b>native</b> <b>rights,</b> refused to acknowledge the Company's authority, and continued to collect taxes from traders traveling via the Sugut River as he had before the rules were imposed, without turning {{them over to the}} Company. Numerous other local chiefs shared Mat Salleh's strong opinions against the Company's new rules. Many of them later joined his cause.|$|E
40|$|An 82 -year-old woman re-presented {{with severe}} angina {{many years after}} {{coronary}} artery bypass surgery. Myocardial perfusion imaging suggested reversible ischaemia in the inferior territory. Diagnostic angiography demonstrated no vein grafts, an occluded right internal mammary artery graft (RIMA), and a patent left internal mammary graft. The <b>native</b> <b>right</b> coronary was stenosed in several sections and she was referred for angioplasty to this artery. After initial balloon inflation in the <b>native</b> <b>right</b> coronary, to our surprise a large arterial graft was revealed–the apparently blocked RIMA. In fact the RIMA was not occluded; the graft {{was assumed to be}} pedicle whereas in fact it had been grafted to the ascending aorta. The interventional strategy was revised and both the RIMA and <b>native</b> <b>right</b> coronary artery were successfully treated...|$|R

500|$|Louis David Riel [...] ( [...] , 22 October 1844 – 16 November 1885) was a Canadian politician, {{a founder}} of the {{province}} of Manitoba, and a political leader of the Métis people of the Canadian Prairies. He led two rebellions against the government of Canada and its first post-Confederation prime minister, John A. Macdonald. Riel sought to preserve Métis rights and culture as their homelands in the Northwest came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence. Over the decades, he has been made a folk hero by the Francophones, the Catholic nationalists, the <b>native</b> <b>rights</b> movement, and the New Left student movement. Riel has received more scholarly attention than practically any other figure in Canadian history.|$|E
500|$|The Catholic bishops had {{originally}} supported the Métis but reversed {{themselves when they}} realized that Riel was leading a heretical movement. They made {{sure that he was}} not honored as a martyr. [...] However the bishops lost their influence during the Quiet Revolution, and activists in Québec found in Riel the perfect hero, with the image now of a freedom fighter who stood up for his people against an oppressive government in the face of widespread racist bigotry. His insanity was ignored and he was made a folk hero by the Francophones, the Catholic nationalists, the <b>native</b> <b>rights</b> movement, and the New Left student movement. Activists who espoused violence embraced his image; in the 1960s, the Quebec terrorist group, the Front de libération du Québec adopted the name [...] "Louis Riel" [...] for one of its terrorist cells. [...] Riel has received more scholarly attention than practically any other figure in Canadian history.|$|E

He later worked to help six aboriginal bands in Northern Ontario gain reserve status, and called for self-government on the Akwesasne Indian Reserve, in part to help the reserve leaders combat smuggling.

2500|$|The New Zealand Parliament {{responded with}} the Maori Lands Act 1862 and the <b>Native</b> <b>Rights</b> Act 1865 which {{established}} the Native Land Court (today the Māori Land Court) to hear aboriginal title claims, andif provenconvert them into freehold interests {{that could be}} sold to Pākehā. That court created the [...] "1840 rule," [...] which converted Māori interests into fee simple if they were sufficiently in existence in 1840, or else disregarded them. Symonds remained the guiding principle, until Wi Parata v the Bishop of Wellington (1877). Wi Parata undid Symonds, advocating the doctrine of terra nullius and declaring the Treaty of Waitangi unenforceable.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Treaty {{has never}} been {{incorporated}} into New Zealand municipal law, its provisions were first incorporated into legislation {{as early as the}} Land Claims Ordinance 1841 and the <b>Native</b> <b>Rights</b> Act 1865. Later the Treaty was incorporated into New Zealand law in the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986. Section 9 of the act said [...] "Nothing in this Act shall permit the Crown to act {{in a manner that is}} inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi". This allowed the courts to consider the Crown's actions in terms of compliance with the Treaty. Contemporary legislation has followed suit, giving the Treaty an increased legal importance.|$|E

25|$|Wik Peoples v The State of Queensland, (commonly {{known as}} the Wik {{decision}}) is a decision of the High Court of Australia delivered on 23 December 1996 on whether statutory leases extinguish <b>native</b> title <b>rights.</b> The court found that the statutory pastoral leases under consideration by {{the court did not}} bestow rights of exclusive possession on the leaseholder. As a result, <b>native</b> title <b>rights</b> could co-exist depending on the terms and nature of the particular pastoral lease. Where there was a conflict of rights, the rights under the pastoral lease would extinguish the remaining <b>native</b> title <b>rights.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Catherine and William were devastated. By 1861 the Indian Department began {{negotiating}} the Manatoulin Treaty for white settlers. [...] Manitoulin Island {{had been promised}} in 1836 to remain forever {{in the hands of}} the Native people. [...] Catherine again stood up for <b>Native</b> <b>Rights</b> and opposed very strongly this purchase. Charles Lindsey, who was the editor of the Toronto Leader, wrote an unfavorable racist article in his newspaper. Catherine responded with her own very powerful letter that criticized Lindsey and the government for their attempt to purchase Manitoulin Island for white settlers. [...] She had seen this happen again and again with the Mississauga, Saugeen and Nawash.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1859 at {{a general}} Council meeting in Rama, Catherine was {{appointed}} to go to England on the Nawash Band’s behalf just as her Uncle Peter Jones had done 22 years before her.

[...] She was carrying letters of introduction from local ministers and Justices of the Peace in Owen Sound that showed her moral character 45 off to New York she went on a speaking tour to promote <b>Native</b> <b>Rights.</b> [...] She was well received by the public.

60|$|Did Tom Canty {{never feel}} troubled {{about the poor}} little {{rightful}} prince who had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot zeal to avenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate? Yes; his first royal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts about the lost prince, and with sincere longings for his return, and happy restoration to his <b>native</b> <b>rights</b> and splendours. But as time wore on, and the prince did not come, Tom's mind {{became more and more}} occupied with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and little the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and finally, when he did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an unwelcome spectre, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed.|$|E
60|$|The Pawnee {{gracefully}} {{threw his}} shield over one shoulder, and placing {{a hand on}} his chest, he bent his head, in deference to the grey locks exhibited by the trapper; after which his eye became more steady, and his countenance less fierce. Still he maintained every appearance of a distrust and watchfulness that were rather tempered and subdued, than forgotten. When this equivocal species of amity was established between the warrior of the prairies and the experienced old trapper, the latter proceeded to give his directions to Paul, concerning the arrangements of the contemplated halt. While Inez and Ellen were dismounting, and Middleton and the bee-hunter were attending to their comforts, the discourse was continued, sometimes {{in the language of the}} natives, but often, as Paul and the Doctor mingled their opinions with the two principal speakers, in the English tongue. There was a keen and subtle trial of skill between the Pawnee and the trapper, in which each endeavoured to discover the objects of the other, without betraying his own interest in the investigation. As might be expected, when the struggle was between adversaries so equal, the result of the encounter answered the expectations of neither. The latter had put all the interrogatories his ingenuity and practice could suggest, concerning the state of the tribe of the Loups, their crops, their store of provisions for the ensuing winter, and their relations with their different warlike neighbours without extorting any answer, which, in the slightest degree, elucidated the cause of his finding a solitary warrior so far from his people. On the other hand, while the questions of the Indian were far more dignified and delicate, they were equally ingenious. He commented on the state of the trade in peltries, spoke of the good or ill success of many white hunters, whom he had either encountered, or heard named, and even alluded to the steady march, which the nation of his great father, as he cautiously termed the government of the States, was making towards the hunting-grounds of his tribe. It was apparent, however, by the singular mixture of interest, contempt, and indignation, that were occasionally gleaming through the reserved manner of this warrior, that he knew the strange people, who were thus trespassing on his <b>native</b> <b>rights,</b> much more by report than by any actual intercourse. This personal ignorance of the whites was as much betrayed by the manner in which he regarded the females, as by the brief, but energetic, expressions which occasionally escaped him.|$|E
