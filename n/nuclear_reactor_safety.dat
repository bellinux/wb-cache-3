40|$|The {{work of the}} {{institute}} is directed to the assessment and enhancement of the safety of technical plants and to the increase of the efficiency and environmental sustainability of those facilities. Subjects of investigation are equally nuclear plants and installations of process industries. To achieve the goals mentioned, {{the institute}} is mainly engaged in the scientific fields of thermal fluid dynamics including magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) and materials sciences. In 2003, the ISR worked on the following main scientific projects. Sub-programme: Plant and Rector Safety. Project: accident analysis of <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> <b>safety</b> of materials and components, particle and radiation transport, safety and efficiency of chemical processes. Sub-programme: Thermal Fluid Dynamics. Project: magneto-hydrodynamics, thermal fluid dynamics of multiphase systems. Considerable progress could also be achieved in the CFD simulation of two-phase flows. New approaches for the forces acting on steam bubbles in a water flow could be developed and implemented into the CFX code in close cooperation with the CFX developer ANSYS/CFX. The qualified models allow to simulate the evolution of bubble size specific radial void distribution profiles along the flow path.

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this work, a new python package, PyRK (Python for Reactor Kinetics), is introduced.

For robustness, this package employs various tools within the scientific python ecosystem. For additional ease of use, it employs a reactor-agnostic, object-oriented data model, allowing nuclear engineers to rapidly prototype <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> control and <b>safety</b> systems {{in the context of their}} novel <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> designs.
