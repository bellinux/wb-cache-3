50|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> {{can also}} be used to produce gray iron. This is {{achieved}} by remelting <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> often along with substantial quantities of steel and scrap iron, removing undesirable contaminants, adding alloys, and adjusting the carbon content. Some <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> grades are suitable for producing ductile iron. These are high purity <b>pig</b> <b>irons</b> and depending on the grade of ductile iron being produced these <b>pig</b> <b>irons</b> may be low in the elements silicon, manganese, sulfur and phosphorus.

25|$|As Allaire's {{business}} grew, {{he found}} {{it increasingly difficult to}} source adequate amounts of quality <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> from which to manufacture his engines.

40|$|The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget {{process was}} {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to the traditional blast furnace process by Kobe Steel. The process aimed to produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets, which have similar chemical and physical properties to blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> in a single step. The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget process utilizes coal instead of coke and self reducing and fluxing dried green balls instead of pellets and sinters. In this process the environmental emissions caused by coke and sinter production, and energy lost between pellet induration (heat hardening) and transportation to the blast furnace can be eliminated. The objectives of this research were to (1) produce <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets in the laboratory, (2) characterize the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget produced and compare them with blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> (3) investigate the furnace temperature and residence time effects on the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nugget production, and (4) optimize the operational furnace temperatures and residence times. The experiments involved heat treatment of self reducing and fluxing dried green balls at various furnace temperatures and residence times. Three chemically and physically different products were produced after the compete reduction of iron oxides to iron depending on the operational furnace temperatures and/or residence times. These products were direct reduced iron (DRI), transition direct reduced <b>iron</b> (TDRI), and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets. The increase in the carbon content of the system as a function of furnace temperature and/or residence time dictated the formation of these products. The direct reduced iron, transition direct reduced <b>iron,</b> and <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced were analyzed for their chemical composition, degree of metallization, apparent density, microstructure and microhardness. In addition, the change in the carbon content of the system with the changing furnace temperature and/or residence time was detected by optical microscopy and Microhardness measurements. The sufficient carbon dissolution required for the production of <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets was determined. It was determined that <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> nuggets produced had a high apparent density (6. 7 - 7. 2 gr/cm 3), highly metallized, slag free structure, high iron content (95 - 97 %), high microhardness values (> 325 HVN) and microstructure similar to white cast iron. These properties made them a competitive alternative to blast furnace <b>pig</b> <b>iron...</b>|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was {{worked into}} wrought iron in finery forges, later {{puddling}} furnaces, {{and more recently}} into steel. In these processes, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is melted and a strong current of air is directed over it while it is stirred or agitated. This causes the dissolved impurities (such as silicon) to be thoroughly oxidized. An intermediate product of puddling is known as refined <b>pig</b> <b>iron,</b> finers metal, or refined iron.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is an {{intermediate}} {{product of the}} <b>iron</b> industry. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> has a very high carbon content, typically 3.5-4.5%, along with silica and other constituents of dross, which makes it very brittle, and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications. <b>Pig</b> <b>iron</b> is made by smelting iron ore into a transportable ingot of impure high carbon-content iron in a blast furnace as an ingredient for further processing steps. The traditional shape of the molds used for <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> ingots was a branching structure formed in sand, with many individual ingots {{at right angles to}} a central channel or runner, resembling a litter of piglets being suckled by a sow. When the metal had cooled and hardened, the smaller ingots (the pigs) were simply broken from the runner (the sow), hence the name <b>pig</b> <b>iron.</b> As <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is intended for remelting, the uneven size of the ingots and the inclusion of small amounts of sand caused only insignificant problems considering the ease of casting and handling them.|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought <b>iron.</b> Because <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the liquid <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to create steel. Puddling was introduced during the 1700s, where molten <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In 1858, Sir Henry Bessemer developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow. Mangalloy, an alloy of steel and manganese exhibiting extreme hardness and toughness, {{was one of the first}} alloy steels, and was created by Robert Hadfield in 1882.|$|R

50|$|Tamahagane, as a raw material, is {{a highly}} impure metal. Formed in a {{bloomery}} process, the bloom of sponge iron begins as an inhomogeneous mixture of wrought <b>iron,</b> steels, and <b>pig</b> <b>iron.</b> The <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> contains more than 2% carbon. The high-carbon steel has about 1 to 1.5% carbon while the low-carbon iron contains about 0.2%. Steel that has a carbon content between {{the high and low}} carbon steel is called bu-kera, which is often resmelted with the <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> to make saga-hagane, containing roughly 0.7% carbon.

5|$|The {{production}} of iron or steel {{is a process}} consisting of two main stages. In the first stage <b>pig</b> <b>iron</b> is produced in a blast furnace.
