Uranium(VI) was supplied as sole terminal electron acceptor to Shewanella putrefaciens (strain 200 R) in defined laboratory media under strictly anaerobic conditions. Media were amended with different multidentate organic acids, and experiments were performed at different U(VI) and ligand concentrations. Organic acids used as complexing agents were oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, maleic, citric, and <b>nitrilotriacetic</b> <b>acids,</b> tiron, EDTA, and Aldrich humic acid. Reductive precipitation of U(VI), resulting in removal of insoluble amorphous UO 2 from solution, was measured as a function of time by determination of total dissolved U. Reductive precipitation was measured, rather than net U(VI) reduction to U(IV), to assess overall U removal rates from solution, which may be used to gauge the influence of chelation on microbial U mineralization. Initial linear rates of U reductive precipitation were found to correlate with stability constants of 1 : 1 aqueous U(VI) :ligand and U(IV) :ligand complexes. In the presence of strongly complexing ligands (e. g., NTA, Tiron, EDTA), UO 2 precipitation did not occur. Our results are consistent with ligand-retarded precipitation of UO 2, which is analogous to ligand-assisted solid phase dissolution but in reverse: ligand exchange with the U 4 + aquo cation acts as a rate-limiting reaction moderating coordination of water molecules with U 4 +, which is a necessary step in UO 2 precipitation. Ligand exchange kinetics governing dissociation rates of ligands from U(VI) -organic complexes may also influence overall UO 2 production rates, although the magnitude of this effect is unclear relative to the effects of U(IV) -organic complexation. Our results indicate that natural microbial-aqueous systems containing abundant organic matter can inhibit the formation of biogenic amorphous UO 2. </p...|$|R
40|$|Biological protein {{assemblies}} are {{the products}} of evolutionary necessity that have arisen to protect the cell, improve reaction rates, and/or compartmentalize biological systems. Belonging to this category of sel-assembling bionano-structures are cage proteins. Cage proteins are composed of multiple protomers (subunits) that self-assemble into many unique structures, all having interior, exterior, and interface surfaces available for controllable modification. Bacterioferritins (Bfr) are a set of cage proteins belonging to the ferritin superfamily of iron storage proteins, are roughly spherical with a 12 nm exterior diameter and an 8 nm interior diameter, are composed of 24 identical protomers, and contain 12 heme cofactors. An important feature of Bfr that was utilized for advancement in platform development was the locality of the N- and C- termini. These termini point towards the exterior and interior of the protein cage, which made them ideal for genetic engineering these two surfaces. Polyhistidine amino acid sequences (His 6 -tags) {{were added to the}} C-termini of the Bfr protein subunits in order to provide new selective affinity interactions on the interior protein surface of this multiprotein cavity. This His 6 -tag affinity interaction allowed for Ni 2 +-dependent complexation between the host Bfr and two guest molecules modified with a <b>nitrilotriacetic</b> (NTA) <b>acid.</b> The two proof of concept guests studied in our laboratory were streptavidin binding a biotin-XNTA functionality, and a gold nanoparticle (GNP) containing NTA functionalities. This approach was designed to make both streptavidin and GNPs addressable to the interior surface of Bfr through the NTA/His 6 -tag affinity interaction. The purpose of these experiments was to explore various methodologies to form controllable interactions between guest molecules and internal protein cavity surfaces. Additionally, the endogenous heme molecules were exchanged for fluorescently-modified hemes as a further approach to engineer this cage protein for host-guest interactions.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the {{scientific}} community {{has been involved in}} the research of new kinds of contaminants generally known as of “emerging concern” (CECs). The harmfulness of CECs, even at small concentrations as well as, property of bioaccumulation and persistence, makes them extremely dangerous for the human health. The scientific community is constantly researching about novel treatments able to achieve the removal of these contaminants. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are {{considered one of the most}} useful treatments to achieve CECs degradation. Among the AOPs, Fenton and photo‐Fenton processes are particularly powerful, cheap and easily managed. Nevertheless, some setting requirements of Fenton processes have limited their application at industrial scale. One of the most important limits is the necessity to operate a tight control of the pH in order to avoid iron precipitation (optimum pH~ 2. 8). Unfortunately, the optimum pH for Fenton reaction is essentially far from the normal values of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Scientific community is then working on the improvement of the operating conditions of Fenton processes in order to improve the applicability in wastewater treatment. These modifications are essentially focused on the possibility to perform the treatment at circumneutral pH (Fenton and photo‐ Fenton like processes). Fenton like processes can be carried out in heterogeneous or homogeneous way according to the phase of the catalyst into the solution. In this study was firstly confirmed the suitability of Fenton based processes in recalcitrant compounds removal. Fenton, UV‐A photo‐Fenton and UV‐C photo‐Fenton were, in fact, applied for atrazine removal from secondary effluent (SE) of municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP). UV‐A and UV‐C photo‐Fenton allowed remove 50 % and 100 % of the initial atrazine content respectively. The main objective of this thesis was then the assessment of photo‐Fenton’s suitability for recalcitrant contaminant at circumneutral pH. Thus, homogeneous photo‐Fenton like at neutral pH was applied for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal. In order to avoid iron precipitation, chelating agents were used to keep soluble the iron at circumneutral pH. The chelating ability of four chelating agents (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid‐EDTA, <b>nitrilotriacetic</b> acid‐NTA, oxalic <b>acid</b> and tartaric acid) was tested. Then, once determined the optimum molar ratio L:Fe for iron chelation (1. 5 : 1 for EDTA and NTA, 10 : 1 for tartaric acid and 20 : 1 for oxalic acid), their catalytic activity was evaluated when employed in photo‐Fenton like for SMX removal. The highest SMX percentage removal, together with the minimum chelating agents required and the better property of biodegradability and low toxicity, demonstrated the suitability of NTA for the purpose. A further study on the stability of the chelates under reaction was carried out. The operating conditions adopted for the treatment significantly influence the stability of the chelate solution. Thus, in order to proper control the parameter set up the behavior of chelates has been study under thermal, oxidative and photochemical stress. It was demonstrated as the temperature control can represent an interesting tool to extend the chelates lifetime under oxidative and photochemical stress. By adopting different H 2 O 2 doses, a linear correlation between doses and chelate decomposition could be identified. The better suitability of UV‐A irradiation, against UV‐C and Xe lamp, to preserve the iron chelate solution was demonstrated. Moreover, the influence of the influent characteristics on the process efficiency needed to be also considered. Thus, different water matrices were used for the experiments. The efficiency of photo‐Fenton like catalyzed by Fe(III) ‐NTA has been compared when applied to different aqueous matrixes (Milli‐Q water, tap water, secondary effluent wastewater and well water). It was demonstrated as the ions content, especially Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, significantly compromise the process of chelation. High alkalinities and organic matter, instead, mainly influenced the phase of process, when acting as radicals scavengers, reduced the amount available for SMX oxidation. Some strategies were then adopted to promote SMX removal. Between them, Mn 2 + mediated photo‐Fenton like showed somehow possibility for improvement. Highest removal rate was in fact exhibited in the first minutes of reaction when adding Mn 2 + to the solution in ratio molar Mn:Fe 0. 5 : 1. The conclusive study of the thesis regarded the assessment of the Br‐ presence on the efficiency achievable in recalcitrant compounds removal when applying UV/PS/Fe 2 + for removal of benzophenone‐ 4 (BZ 4), nitrobenzene (NB), nitrobenzoic acid (NBA), atrazine (ATZ) and ampicilline (AMP).
