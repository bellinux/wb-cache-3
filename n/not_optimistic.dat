5|$|Interest in {{creating}} a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was <b>not</b> <b>optimistic</b> about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used to conceptualise the universe of Tron: Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, {{in and around the}} city's central business district. Most sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom {{in creating}} effects. Daft Punk composed the musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music.|$|E

Supporters of same-sex marriage sought the delay, which the amendment's backers denounced and Romney criticized it. As that date neared, Arline Isaacson, a lobbyist for the Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, was <b>not</b> <b>optimistic</b> about her side's chances and Senate President Robert Travaglini was considering allowing a vote to adjourn without acting on the measure. Instead, on November 9, 2006, the legislators in convention voted 109 to 87 to recess until January 2, {{the last day of the}} legislative session.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the broad}} nature of the law, {{as it would have}} allowed the firing of public school {{employees}} for the way they voted or spoke their opinions in favor of gay rights, conservative Republican politicians spoke out against it. Primarily, former governor Ronald Reagan voiced his opinion, saying [...] "Prop. 6 is not needed to protect our children. We have that legal protection now. It could be very costly to implement and has the potential for causing undue harm to people." [...] Reagan's statement turned public opinion against the proposition almost overnight. Gay activists were <b>not</b> <b>optimistic</b> in light of the record of voter turnout against them in the previous year, but they were overwhelmed to learn that on election day more than a million voters turned out to strike down the proposition.|$|E
500|$|Army {{regulations}} set {{a so-called}} [...] "ticking clock" [...] upon promotion to a three-star general, essentially requiring that Clark be promoted to another post {{within two years}} from his initial promotion or retire. This deadline ended in 1996 and Clark said he was <b>not</b> <b>optimistic</b> about receiving such a promotion because rumors at the time suggested General Dennis Reimer {{did not want to}} recommend him for promotion although [...] "no specific reason was given". According to Clark's book, General Robert Scales said that it was likely Clark's reputation of intelligence was responsible for feelings of resentment from other generals. Clark was named to the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) post despite these rumors. Congress approved his promotion to full general in June 1996, and General John M. Shalikashvili signed the order. Clark said he was not the original nominee, but the first officer chosen [...] "hadn't been accepted for some reason." ...|$|E

The cricketer’s entry into electoral politics came after {{he was involved in}} a debate at a cricket club meeting. A person at the gathering reported his argumentative performance to senior Liberal Party figures, and soon after, Bolte began actively courting the cricketer. On 28 September 1954, Loxton won pre-selection and was endorsed as the Liberal candidate for the electorate of Prahran. At the time, the seat was comfortably held by the ruling Australian Labor Party (ALP), who had captured 61.59% of the vote at the previous election. The Liberals were <b>not</b> <b>optimistic</b> about their chances, and Bolte told his candidate [...] "You won't win , but we'd like you to fly the flag".|$|E
500|$|Planning for {{the raid}} on Kaafjord began in December 1943. Vice Admiral Bruce Fraser, the {{commander}} of the Home Fleet, was <b>not</b> <b>optimistic</b> about the prospects for success, and had to be persuaded to undertake the operation by First Sea Lord Sir Andrew Cunningham. Fraser gave his second in command, Vice Admiral Sir Henry Moore, responsibility for planning and leading the raid. The operation was initially designated [...] "Operational Thrustful", but was later renamed [...] "Operation Tungsten". The attack was originally scheduled for mid-March 1944, shortly before the time Allied intelligence believed Tirpitz would become operational. However, it was delayed by two weeks while Victorious was fitted with new radars. The British considered cancelling Operation Tungsten in February as Victorious was also needed in the Indian Ocean to counter a build-up of Japanese warships at Singapore. To enable the attack to proceed, the United States Navy agreed to temporarily transfer [...] to the Eastern Fleet so that Victorious could be retained in the North Sea.|$|E
500|$|Mau {{first visited}} Hawaii in 1973, and McCoy {{introduced}} him to Ben Finney. Later, Finney suggested to the Polynesian Voyaging Society that they should try to recruit Mau for their Hōkūle‘a project, since no Hawaiian traditional navigators remained. The project goal was {{to test the hypothesis}} that Polynesians made intentional non-instrument voyages across the Pacific. Tevake, a renowned Polynesian navigator, had died in 1970 and only six others were known. Navigators were reluctant to release their sacred knowledge to [...] "outsiders". At the time, Mau was just 41 years old and the youngest navigator out of the group. Mau feared that traditional navigation would die in his own culture, just as it had in Hawaii. He had tried to teach the young men of Satawal the skills passed on to him, but he was <b>not</b> <b>optimistic.</b> The members of the younger generation were too busy with school and too attracted to Western culture to undertake the rigorous course of study and apprenticeship. Further, Mau's people did not seem to care that traditional navigation was dying and could be lost forever.|$|E

500|$|In 1992, Rivera was {{promoted}} to the Class A-Advanced level Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Florida State League (FSL). He started 10games for Fort Lauderdale, compiling a 5–3win–loss record and a 2.28ERA. He attempted to improve the movement on his slider pitch by snapping his wrist during his throwing motion, but he inadvertently caused damage to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his right elbow. Rivera underwent surgery in August 1992 to repair the damage, ending his season and interrupting his minor league career. Contrary to popular belief, {{he did not have}} Tommy John surgery; his surgeon, Dr. Frank Jobe, determined that ligament replacement was not necessary and was instead able to repair the frayed UCL. Rivera's rehabilitation coincided with MLB's 1992 expansion draft to fill the rosters for two expansion teams, the Florida Marlins and Colorado Rockies. Rivera was left unprotected by the Yankees but was not drafted. He successfully rehabilitated his arm in early 1993 and resumed pitching that year. He first joined the Rookie level Yankees to make two abbreviated starts, before returning to the Class A level Hornets to start ten more games. Witnessing him rehabilitate, the Hornets' official scorer Ogi Overman was <b>not</b> <b>optimistic</b> about Rivera's future, saying, [...] "I thought [...] was on a one-way trip to nowhere." ...|$|E

[...] A second request, addressed to [...] "George Washington, Esq., etc." [...] was similarly rejected, although the messenger was told that Washington would receive one of Howe's adjutants.

Electronic Arts did not confirm a new title in the series and allowed the System Shock trademark registration to lapse. Redwood Shores' next release was 2008's Dead Space, a game with noted similarities in theme and presentation to the System Shock series. According to Dead Space designers Ben Wanat and Wright Bagwell, their project was originally intended to be System Shock 3, before the release of Resident Evil 4 inspired them {{to go back to the}} drawing board and develop it into something more along those lines, eventually becoming Dead Space.|$|E
