At {{any given time}} t, every site j ∈ Z can be occupied at most by one particle. Thus a configuration of the TASEP can be described by η = {ηj, j ∈ Z|ηj ∈ { 0, 1 }}. ηj is called the occupation variable of site j, which is defined by ηj = 1 if site j is occupied and ηj = 0 if site j is empty.

The right par-ietal region is primarily involved in basic quantity processing, while the left parietal region is additionally involved in precise number processing and numerical operations. Little is known about how the 2 regions interact during numerical cognition. We hypothesized that functional connectivity between {{the right and left}} parietal cortex is critical for numerical processing that engages both basic number representation and learned numerical operations. To test this hypothesis, we estimated neural activity using functional mag-netic resonance imaging in participants performing numerical and arithmetic processing on dot arrays. We first found task-based func-tional connectivity between a right parietal seed and the left sen-sorimotor cortex in all task conditions. As we hypothesized, we found enhanced functional connectivity between this right parietal seed and both the left parietal cortex and <b>neighboring</b> <b>right</b> parietal cortex, particularly during subtraction. The degree of functional connectivity also correlated with behavioral performance across individual participants, while activity within each region did not. These results highlight the role of parietal functional connectivity in numerical processing.

Drury (1936) later {{discussed}} the at-tractive simplicity of experiments in which changes in heart rate were a major component of the biologic action of any test substance. Many others since then have documented the negative chronotropic action of ATP, but in the intact experimental animal there are a num-ber of equally powerful concomitant actions, such as systemic vasodilatation, pulmonary vasoconstriction and depression of cardiac con-tractiiity, making it difficult to distinguish the primary from the secondary actions on heart rate. In some species there is furthermore a vagal component to the bradycardia from ATP, while in others there is not (Green and Stoner, 1950). With the availability of a technic for direct perfusion of the canine sinus node through its nutrient artery in vivo (James and Nadeau, 1962) it was decided to examine the actions of ATP directly on the sinus node. Special advan-tages of the technic include the preservation of normal innervation and blood supply of the sinus node in situ, the utilization of sufficiently small volumes so no significant concentration of recirculated test substance occurs to stimu-late extracardiac neuroreceptors, and the local perfusion of only sinus node and a small area of <b>neighboring</b> <b>right</b> atrial myocardium, thus avoiding any associated ventricular inotropic action.

40|$|License is a {{commercial}} previllege right, {{it means to}} give a right and authority in exploiting protected-copyright economically by giving permit in written-contract or in document form. Licensee has an authority to reproduce or to announce in exploiting licenced-copyright, and if its exploitation without permit from the licencee, so that activity is a legal infringement. Besides that, License is also a solution, which is taken by Licensor if the copyright holder has not intended in developing his own-copyright. The option that constitutes compromise between self authorization and to release it which makes the process of license becoming very sensitive. Involving parties {{have come from the}} different interest, suddenly, they togetherly should share the rights, obligations and trade risk proportionally in {{a certain period of time}} for the interest that maybe different each other. The proportion of right, obligation and trade risk, finally, bring two parties, those are licensee and licensor inside to the negotiation and long speaking that is contained in the agreement of license contract. By taking the title of "LICENSE IN THE FIELD OF COPYRIGHT", this thesis will do the reasearch on the implementation of license in Copyright whether it is about mechanism of its implementation, the payment of compensation or royalty, obligation in the notification of license contract, and the registration of Copyright, and also the solution of dispute in license of Copyright as refer to the stipulations as regulated in Law No. 19 Year 2002 on Copyright. The consideration that is based on this research to those matters where there is no appropriation the rule licenses in this law, and in that license has a nature of civil law. Besides that, Copyright object which is licensed has anykind of types, where all of those have different characteristic, so it has difficulty in giving the rule of license fully in a certain law. The problem of this research is how the mechanism of copyright license to the copyright object which is different and why the obligation in giving the royalty in the contract of license in Copyright should be guided by the agreement of professional association, why the agreement of Copyright License has an obligation to be notified in order to have a law impact for the third party, whereas that Copyright registration itself is not an obligation in having the right and how the parties accomplish the dispute which is happened in license implementation. Whereas, the objective of research to be achieved is for knowing and understanding the mechanism of implementation in Copyright license, including the mechanism of royalty payment, it is also to know the exist of administration in Copyright including the rule of Copyright registration and sinchronization the rule of obligation in the License notification in the Copyright Law with the contract law and also the legal effort which is burst to the dispute which is happened in the implementation of license. The methodology research is using the combination between normative research and sociological research. The reason of the combination in this two methods are merely based on the nature of problem concept and the objective of research which is different. From the result and the analysis of research are founded the strategic inventions as follow: 1. 	There is any differences in mechanism of Copyright license between one of Copyright object with others. This differences are because of differences in characteristic. The Copyright of song/ music is very close connecting to the <b>Neighboring</b> <b>right</b> (performers, sound recording, and broad casting) and the problem in "publication right"; the book publishing, is more concern to the "reproduction right" beside of the problem in "publication right", whereas in license of computer` program is more concern to the "using" of the computer program itself. Besides that, the license of computer program and license of song/ music are more dominant in using the agreement/ standar contract or crude, whereas the license of book publishing is not always using the standard contract/ crude. The three object of Copyright as mentioned above, is also having a difference in the system of royalty payment; 2. 	Any contradiction of regulation in the obligation of licence notification in the Law of Copyright with the stipulation of agreement in Civil Law. Besides that, in term of "Copyright Registration" deems to the public that the emerge of right is because of the registration, so it gives the opportunity for the devouted parties, and with bad faith to exploit that opportunity. 3. 	it is lack of decisive in regulating of license in the Law of Copyright, is that license constitutes object of commercial court or civil court. So it is lack in giving the guarantee to the public in putting the clause of "the dispute adjudication in civil court or commercial court" in the agreement which they have made. From the result of invention in this strategic research, at the end, there are recommendations as follow: 1. 	To give guideline and facilitation for the licensee and licensor, it is needed to make an Implementation guideline and Technical guideline on the mechanism of license in Copyright, and immediately to be arranged the regulation of implementation on the obligation of license notification; Besides that, it is needed to be detailly arranged one by one the object of Copyright which is licensed; 2. 	It is suggest to revise or delete on the stipulation about "obligation in License notification with the reason in order to have the legal impact to the third party" in the Law of Copyright. Besides that, the term "Copyright registration" as stated in the Copyright Law is changed by the term "the Copyright notification" 3. 	It is needed the assertive arrangement in the Law of Copyright, is the Copyright license is object of commercial court or civil court. In this matter, to give the certainity for the party who will make the license contract especially in making a clause the adjudication of license dispute through the court. Lisensi merupakan hak previllege yang bersifat komersial, dalam arti kata memberikan hak dan kewenangan untuk memanfaatkan hak cipta yang dilindungi secara ekonomis dengan pemberian ijin yang dituangkan dalam perjanjian tertulis atau dalam bentuk dokumen. Penerima lisensi berwenang melakukan perbanyakan atau pengumuman untuk memanfaatkan hak cipta yang dilisensikan dan apabila penggunaan tersebut tanpa ijin, maka hal tersebut merupakan suatu perbuatan yang melanggar hukum. Disamping itu, Lisensi juga merupakan jalan tengah yang diambil pemberi lisensi apabila pemegang hak atas hak cipta tersebut tidak bermaksud mengembangkan sendiri hak. ciptanya. Pilihan yang merupakan kompromi antara menguasai sendiri dan melepaskan sama sekali ini membuat proses lisensi menjadi amat sensitive. Pihak-pihak yang terlibat datang dari kepentingan yang berbeda, tiba-tiba hams bersama-sama membagi hak-hak, kewajiban-kewajiban dan resiko dagang secara proporsional selama jangka waktu tertentu untuk kepentingan yang mungkin sating. berbeda. Proporsi hak, kewajiban dan resiko dagang tersebut akhirnya membawa dua pihak yaitu pemberi lisensi dan penerima lisensi ke dalam suatu negosiasi dan pembicaraan panjang yang tertuang ke dalam perjanjian kontrak lisensi. Dengan mengambil judul "LISENSI DI BIDANG HAK CIPTA", thesis ini akan melakukan pengkajian mengenai pelaksanaan lisensi hak cipta baik itu menyangkut mekanisme pelaksanaan lisensi, pembayaran imbalan atau royalti, kewajiban pencatatan perjanjian lisensi dan pendaftaran hak cipta serta penyelesaian sengketa lisensi dibidang hak cipta terhadap ketentuan-ketentuan sebagaimana diatur di dalam Undang-undang Nomor 19 tahun 2002 tentang Hak Cipta. Pertimbangan yang mendasari pengkajian terhadap hal-hal tersebut adalah belum adanya kesesuaian pengaturan lisensi di dalam undang-undang, di mana lisensi itu mempunyai sifat keperdataan. Di samping itu obyek hak cipta yang dilisensikan terdapat berbagai macam jenis, yang kesemuanya mempunyai karakteristik yang berbeda-beda, sehingga terdapat kesulitan memberikan pengaturan lisensi secara menyeluruh di dalam suatu undang-undang. Masalah yang menjadi fokus dalam thesis ini adalah bagaimanakah mekanisme lisensi hak cipta terhadap obyek hak cipta yang berbeda dan mengapa kewajiban pemberiaan royalty dalam perjanjian lisensi hak cipta hams berpedoman kesepakatan organisasi profesi, mengapa perjanjian lisensi hak cipta wajib dicatatkan agar mempunyai akibat hukum terhadap pihak ketiga, sedangkan pendaftaran hak cipta itu sendiri bukan merupakan suatu kewajiban untuk memperoleh hak dan bagaimana pars pihak menyelesaikan sengketa yang terjadi dalam pelaksanaan lisensi. Sedangkan tujuan penelitian yang hendak dicapai adalah untuk mengetahui dan memahami mekanisme pelaksanaan lisensi hak cipta, termasuk di dalamnya mekanisme pembayaran royalti, untuk mengetahui pula keberadaan administrasi dibidang Hak Cipta termasuk pengaturan pendaftaran hak cipta dan sinkronisasi pengaturan kewajiban pencatatan lisensi di dalam undang-undang hak cipta dengan hukum perjanjian serta upaya-upaya hukum yang ditempuh terhadap sengketa yang terjadi dalam pelaksanaan lisensi. Metode penelitian yang dipergunakan adalah gabungan antara penelitian normatif dan penelitian sosiologis. Alasan penggabungan dua metode ini semata-mata didasarkan pada sifat rumusan permasalahan dan tujuan penelitian yang berbeda. Dari hasil penelitian dan analisis data diperoleh temuan-temuan strategis sebagai berikut : I. Mekanisme lisensi di bidang hak cipta terdapat perbedaan antara obyek hak cipta yang satu dengan obyek hak cipta yang lain. Perbedaan ini, dikarenakan adanya karakteristik yang berbeda-beda. Hak Cipta Lagu/musik sangat erat hubungannya dengan Neightboring right (Pelaku, Produser rekaman dan organisasi siaran) dan masalah "hak mengumumkan", penerbitan buku lebih menonjolkan pada "hak memperbanyak" di samping juga masalah "hak mengumumkan", sedangkan di dalam lisensi program komputer lebih menekankan pada "penggunaan" program komputer itu sendiri. Di samping itu, lisensi program komputer dan lagu/musik lebih dominan menggunakan perjanjian/kontrak standar atau baku, sedangkan lisensi penerbitan buku tidak selalu menggunakan kontrak standar/baku. Ketiga obyek hak cipta tersebut juga mempunyai perbedaan dalam hal sistem pembayaran royalti; 2. 	Adanya pertentangan pengaturan kewajiban pencatatan lisensi di dalam UU Hak Cipta dengan ketentuan perjanjian di dalam hukum perdata. Di samping itu, istilah "pendaftaran hak cipta" memberikan anggapan masyarakat bahwa timbulnya hak atas hak cipta karena adanya pendaftaran, sehingga memberikan peluang bagi pihak-pihak yang tidak jujur dan beritikad tidak baik untuk memanfaatkan kesempatan tersebut. 3. 	Kurang tegasnya pengaturan lisensi di dalam UU Hak Cipta, apakah lisensi itu merupakan obyek pengadilan Niaga atau Pengadilan negeri. Sehingga kurang memberikan kepastian kepada masyarakat dalam mencantumkan klausula "penyelesaiari sengketa di Pengadilan Negeri atau Pengadilan Niaga " dalam perjanjian yang mereka buat. Dari basil temuan strategis penelitian ini, pada akhirnya dapat diberikan rekomendasi sebagai berikut 1. 	Untuk memberikan pedoman dan kemudahan bagi pemberi dan penerima lisensi, perlu dibuatkan suatu Petunjuk Pelaksanaan (Juklak) atau Petunjuk Teknis (Jilaus) tentang Mekanisme Lisensi di bidang Hak Cipta dan segera dibentuk peraturan pelaksanaan tentang kewajiban pencatatan lisensi; Di samping itu perlu diatur secara rind satu persatu obyek hak cipta yang dilisensikan; 2. 	Agar dilakukan revisi atau dihapuskan mengenai ketentuan tentang "kewajiban pencatatan lisensi dengan alasan agar mempunyai akibat hukum terhadap pihak ketiga" dalam UU Hak Cipta. Disamping itu istilah "pendaftaran hak cipta" sebagaimana dianut oleh UU Hak Cipta diganti dengan istilah "pencatatan hak cipta" 3. 	Perlunya pengaturan secara tegas di dalam Undang-undang Hak Cipta, apakah lisensi hak cipta itu merupakan obyek dari Pengadilan Niaga atau Pengadilan Negri. Hal ini, untuk memberikan kepastian bagi para pihak yang akan membuat suatu perjanjian lisensi khususnya dalam membuat suatu klausula penyelesaian sengketa lisensi melalui pengadilan. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{scientific}} research theme aims to deepen a topical issue, i. e. {{to examine the}} legal requirements of performers’ rights from Romania, by collective management, to do a critical analysis of the regulation in our country and to contribute thereby to the correction of the law, to its harmonization with the EU countries. Intellectual creation has some amazing features: it is invisible, it can be passed across borders, it can be multiplied to infinity and its value increases steadily over time. Any country that cares about its traditions and seeks to make progress {{in the field of}} culture, of science and education, must recognize, encourage and protect intellectual creation. The copyright <b>neighboring</b> <b>rights</b> or "les droits voisins" as they were called in doctrine and jurisprudence, have been regulated {{for the first time in}} the Romanian law by the Law no. 8 / 1996 on copyright and <b>neighboring</b> <b>rights.</b> The <b>neighboring</b> <b>rights</b> are intellectual property rights, other than the copyright, granted to performers for their own performances or executions, to sound recordings producers and audiovisual recordings producers for their own recordings, and to broadcasting organizations (radio and television) for their own transmissions and program services. Performers’ rights can be managed mandatory or optionally by the collective management societies. The collective management of copyright and <b>neighboring</b> <b>rights</b> is a necessary step for implementation of certain rights in comparison with various ways of exploitation. Since the beginning, some of performers’ economic rights proved difficult to assess individually. The technical progress and widespread mass exploitation have made individual control virtually impossible.
