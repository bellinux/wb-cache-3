40|$|Computation of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> is {{investigated}} {{under the}} logistic regression model with fixed effects and mixed effects, zero-inflated models, and some mixture models. Under the logistic regression model with fixed effects for binary responses, point-wise and simultaneous tolerance intervals are derived {{for the number}} of positive responses among a specified number of Bernoulli trials. Under the logistic regression model with mixed effects, point-wise <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are derived. The problems were motivated by a ballistic application dealing with testing the ballistic resistance of personal body armor. Methodologies used for the derivation of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> under the logistic regression model include small sample asymptotics and the bootstrap. Numerical results are reported to assess the accuracy of the proposed methodologies, and they are also illustrated using examples on the ballistic response of armor plates, where it is known that the ballistic response depends on covariates such as the velocity of the projectile. A second set of problems investigated include the computation of upper <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> under zero-inflated log-normal and zero-inflated gamma distributions. Models without covariates and with covariates are separately considered, and point-wise upper <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are derived under models with covariates. For the zero-inflated log-normal model, techniques used to calculate the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> include generalized pivotal quantities (GPQs), fiducial quantities, the bootstrap, and the delta method with a bootstrap calibration. Numerical results indicate that the GPQ methodology and the bootstrap calibration of the delta method provide very satisfactory performance. For the zero-inflated gamma model, <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are calculated based on bootstrapping a pivot-like statistic, and based on the bootstrap calibration of the delta method. Once again, numerical results indicate satisfactory performance. The results are applied to a variety of zero-inflated data sets: health expenditure data, rainfall data, and body armor protection data. The final topic investigated is the derivation of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> under some mixture models. The normal-normal and lognormal-normal mixture models are first explored. Models with three and four mixtures of normal distributions and the normal-normal regression model are then investigated. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> under all of these mixture models are obtained based on a bootstrap calibration of the delta method. This approach produced good results for all the models examined. The case of two mixtures was motivated by an application dealing with the evaluation of the safety of nuclear power plants based on data that are outputs of computer codes used to simulate nuclear accidents. Traditionally, <b>non-parametric</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are used for this purpose, but the data clearly indicated a mixture distribution: normal-normal or lognormal-normal. Upper <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> computed under the mixture model turned out to be smaller compared to the <b>non-parametric</b> upper <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit.</b> Extensive numerical results and a variety of examples are also included...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, multi-group {{microscopic}} cross-section uncertainties are propagated through the DRAGON (Version 4. 05) lattice code {{in order to}} perform uncertainty analysis on k(infinity) and 2 -group homogenized macroscopic cross-sections. The test case corresponds to a 17 x 17 PWR fuel assembly segment without poison at full power conditions. A statistical methodology is employed for such purposes, where cross-sections of certain isotopes of various elements belonging to the 172 groups DRAGLIB library format, are considered as normal random variables. This library was based on JENDL- 4 data, because JENDL- 4 contains {{a large amount of}} isotopic covariance matrices among the different major nuclear data libraries. Thus, multi-group uncertainty was computed for the different isotopic reactions by means of ERRORRJ. The preferred sampling strategy for the current study corresponds to the quasi-random Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). This technique allows a much better coverage of the input uncertainties than simple random sampling (SRS) because it densely stratifies across the range of each input probability distribution. In order to prove this, the uncertain input space was re-sampled 10 times, and it is shown that the variability of the replicated mean of the different k(infinity) samples is much less for the LHS case, than for the SRS case. The uncertainty assessment of the output space should be based on the theory of <b>non-parametric</b> multivariate <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits,</b> {{due to the fact that}} k(infinity) and some of the macroscopic cross-sections are correlated. Therefore, for 10 replicated samples each containing 100 elements, the total output sample is composed by 1000 calculations. This sample size is more than enough to infer that the multivariate output population is covered 95 % with a 95 % of confidence. On the other hand, statistical sensitivity analysis was performed in order to know which {{microscopic cross-section}} has the greatest impact on k(infinity) predictions. It was found that the fission cross-section of Uranium 235 is the dominant input parameter for this particular case, because the computed JENDL- 4 variances for such reaction are very high at thermal and resonant regions compared to other variances that for instance, can be computed based on other nuclear libraries such as ENDF/B-VII. ...|$|R

Their mechanical and geometrical parameters have to be identical with those of the treatment machines. Therefore, quality control protocols for the simulators should be comprehensive and the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> as high as those for treatment machines. AimEvaluation of the technical status of radiotherapy simulators involved in clinical trials. Materials/MethodsIn this paper, results of quality control tests conducted in 12 Polish radiotherapy centres are presented. The tests were carried out within the framework of Polish research project KBN No. 6 P 05 C 032 20. 12 radiotherapy simulators installed in Polish radiotherapy centres were thoroughly tested. In order to control technical conditions of the simulators, a set of 24 tests was elaborated. The tests were divided into six thematic groups. The detailed range of the parameters controlled and the accepted ranges of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are given. The values of <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> are based on data found in the available literature. ResultsThe control of 12 simulators revealed the violation of accepted <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> for 13 out of 24 controlled parameters. The most frequent violations of accepted <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits</b> occurred in the case of geometrical parameters of light simulation and mechanical parameters of the couch, both very important for the accuracy of the simulation process. For 2 simulators almost 30 % of controlled parameters were outside the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits.</b> ConclusionsThe control of radiotherapy simulators undertaken within the framework of the clinical trial revealed that in the majority of cases the simulators were in good technical condition. In 2 cases almost 30 % of controlled parameters were outside the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limits.</b> In such cases the manufacturers' service should be called urgently for necessary repairs and regulations. After repeated quality control tests a decision should be taken regarding the accepted range of operations which could be used in clinical practice. A QA and QC system for radiotherapy simulators should be introduced in each radiotherapy centre...|$|R

Mean concentrations of Cd, Cr and Ni did exceed the <b>tolerance</b> <b>limit</b> (the grade- 1 standard) set in China. Single-factor contaminant index data were calculated by taking into account the analytical information obtained from topsoil at each sampling site. Among heavy metals determined, the highest degree of topsoil pollution was found for Cd. The single-factor pollutant index values decreased in the order of PCd>PCr>PNi>PPb>PHg>PAs. Evidently, topsoil of the eastern slope of Mt. Gongga accumulated elevated levels of Cd and Cr and Ni. An integrated assessment of topsoil quality for six heavy metals analyzed indicated that the values of index PN for all sites varied between 0. 92 and 4. 89 and all are considered as ‘slight to pronounced impact’ by heavy metals...|$|R
