Each rotational symmetry of the 600-cell is generated by specific elements of 2IL and 2IR; the pair of opposite elements generate the same element of RSG. The centre of RSG consists of the <b>non-rotation</b> Id and the central inversion -Id. We have the isomorphism RSG ≅ (2IL × 2IR) / {Id, -Id}. The order of RSG equals 120 × 120 / 2 = 7200.|$|E

50|$|A {{fundamental}} {{property of}} such a frame is the employment of the proper time of the accelerated observer {{as the time of}} the frame itself. This is connected with the clock hypothesis (which is experimentally confirmed), according to which the proper time of an accelerated clock is unaffected by acceleration, thus the measured time dilation of the clock only depends on its momentary relative velocity. The related proper reference frames are constructed using concepts like comoving orthonormal tetrads, which can be formulated in terms of spacetime Frenet-Serret formulas, or alternatively using Fermi-Walker transport as a standard of <b>non-rotation.</b> If the coordinates are related to Fermi-Walker transport, the term Fermi coordinates is sometimes used, or proper coordinates in the general case when rotations are also involved. A special class of accelerated observers follow worldlines whose three curvatures are constant. These motions belong to the class of Born rigid motions, i.e., the motions at which the mutual distance of constituents of an accelerated body or congruence remains unchanged in its proper frame. Two examples are Rindler coordinates or Kottler-Møller coordinates for the proper reference frame of hyperbolic motion, and Born or Langevin coordinates in the case of uniform circular motion.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine methods of feints in judo {{throwing}} techniques by being based on movement structures. The participants were 11 national intercollegiate judo players and they gave demonstrations of their own favorite throwing techniques with the feints. A seventh-dan grade judo expert and 10 participants except for a demonstrator evaluated whether 32 demonstrations contained feints or not. By their agreement on each evaluation, 18 kinds of the throwing techniques with the feints were selected for the analysis. The impressionistic analysis by means of other-observation was conducted about the phase structures of the movement process in the throwing techniques with the feints. The results demonstrated that the methods of the feints were divided into two motions, which were Tsukuri and Kake of a certain throwing technique, and that the combination methods of the feints and the throwing techniques were divided into two sorts, which were the connections to either Tsukuri or Kake of the throwing techniques. Sannohe (1999) advanced a theory that judo throwing techniques could be classified into two types : rotation and <b>non-rotation.</b> Binomial tests indicated that when the type of the feints was rotation and the type of the throwing techniques was <b>non-rotation,</b> there was a significant difference between two combination methods : 0 connections to Tsukuri and 7 connections to Kake, and that when the type of the feints was <b>non-rotation</b> and the type of the throwing techniques was rotation, there was a significant difference between two combination methods : 8 connections to Tsukuri and 0 connections to Kake.

40|$|Although much {{research}} has been done on the role of hysteresis in apparent motion displays, no research has investigated the effects of hysteresis for rotary motion. The present experiment sought to determine and quantify the effects of hysteresis on the rotation percept.

One of the displays slowly changed from favoring a percept of rotation to a percept of <b>non-rotation</b> and vice versa. We fit the data using a logistic function and compared {{the point at which the}} direction of motion appeared to switch between chaos and rotation. Our research suggests that hysteresis only had a significant effect on type of motion perceived when the stimulus was moving from “chaos” to rotation.

Moreover, the new AHRS is not affected by magnetic interference. After the rotation, the attitude and heading are almost just oscillating in a range.

40|$|We {{show that}} the quasi-Euclidean {{sections}} of various rotating black holes in different dimensions possess at least one non-conformal negative mode when thermodynamic instabilities are expected. The boundary conditions of fixed induced metric correspond to the partition function of the grand-canonical ensemble. Indeed, in the asymptotically flat cases, we find that a negative mode persists even if the specific heat at constant angular momenta is positive, since the stability in this ensemble also requires the positivity of the isothermal momentum of inertia. We focus in particular on Kerr black holes, on Myers-Perry black holes in five and six dimensions, and on the Emparan-Reall black ring solution. We go on further to consider the richer case of the asymptotically AdS Kerr black hole in four dimensions, where thermodynamic stability is expected for a large enough cosmological constant.

40|$|Finding a known {{object in}} static {{pictures}} or real-time streaming pictures {{is always an}} interesting topic for many applications. A well known and reliable method is Symmetric Phase Only Matched Filter (SPOMF). Regular SPOMF can work well with <b>non-rotation</b> and scaling object but show poor performance for rotated and scaled object. A solution for this problem is to map the absolute value of the spectrum into a polar coordinate system, then detect the rotation angle and scaling factor, and finally compensate for those factors by rotating and scaling the template image. In the SPOMF operation, phase normalization in the frequency domain is required to avoid generating high peaks because of high brightness in images. In this thesis work, a phase normalization algorithm is developed, and experiments indicate that this algorithm can use limited amount of bits (even one bit) to represent phase angles but still show acceptable quality. Also, a self-adaptive peak detection algorithm is developed to detect peaks in various magnitudes.

The rotating effects on outer diameter variation and outer radius error are evaluated in laser dieless drawing. As a result, the outer diameter variation under a condition of <b>non-rotation</b> is higher than that under condition of rotation.

In addition, in case of laser heating irradiated from one direction under non-rotating, the deformation amount of irradiated side is larger than that of non-irradiated side in laser dieless drawing. Meanwhile, the microtube is drawn subequally under condition of rotation due to circumferential uniform temperature distribution. Thus, the distorted radial deformation can be restrained by rotating effect. From these results, the effectiveness of the proposed rotary laser dieless drawing for fabricating metal microtubes can be demonstrated experimentally...|$|E

To this propose, the velocity gradient field is decomposed as the stack of <b>non-rotation</b> field and pure-rotation field. By introducing the Chen S+R decomposition, the rotational flow is redefined. For elastic fluid, the research shows that for Newton fluid, the local average rotation always produces an additional pressure on the rotation plane.

For non-elastic fluid, such as air, the research shows that the rotation will produce an additional stress along the rotation axis direction, that is on the normal direction of rotation plane. This result can be used to explain the lift force connected with vortex. The main purpose of this research is to supply a solvable mathematical model for the calculation of vorticity and pressure when suitable boundary condition is adapted.

Written consent was obtained inclusion in this report. Results Ultrasound identified dilated proximal small bowel and the whirlpool sign, with the superior mesenteric vein and tributaries making one-and-a-half twists around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery. Fluoroscopy demonstrated jejunal beaking with passage of some contrast. Ladd's procedure was performed, repositioning the intestines in a non-rotated position, a grossly dilated segment of jejunum was resected.

Presentation of case: A 53 -year-old male presented with postprandial abdominal discomfort. Colonoscopy showed a 14  mm polyp in the sigmoid colon and endoscopic polypectomy was performed. Pathological evaluation revealed an adenocarcinoma invading the submucosa more than 1000  μm with positive vertical and horizontal margins. A contrast enhanced computed tomography scan showed an anatomic variant of the ileocolic and inferior mesenteric arteries originating from a common channel branching from the abdominal aorta. Laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection was performed. The patient did well post operatively. Discussion: The usual trocar placement for laparoscopic left side colectomy was used, and we found no difficulties intraoperatively. To secure safe ligation, the divisions of the common channel branching from the abdominal aorta were exposed as in a usual D 3 dissection, and the inferior mesenteric artery was ligated after confirmation of the bifurcation of the ileocolic and inferior mesenteric artery.

Differentiation of L 6 cells into myotubes was significantly disturbed in the 3 D-clinorotation culture system, although the 3 D-clinorotation {{had no effect on}} the proliferation. The 3 D-clinorotation also suppressed the expression of myogenesis marker proteins, such as myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MHC), at the mRNA level. In association with this reduced differentiation, we found that the 3 D-clinorotation prevented accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, compared with <b>non-rotation</b> control cells. Based on these findings, we focused on the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB, a myogenesis inhibitory protein, to clarify the mechanism of this impaired differentiation. A decline in the amount of IκB protein in L 6 cells was significantly prevented by the rotation, while the amount of the protein in the non-rotated cells decreased along with the differentiation. Furthermore, the 3 D-clinorotation reduced the NF-κB-binding activity in L 6 cells and prevented the ubiquitination of IκB proteins in the IκB- and ubiquitin-expressing Cos 7 cells. Other myogenic regulatory factors, such as deubiquitinases, cyclin E and oxygen, were not associated with the differentiation impaired by the clinorotation. Our present results suggest that simulated microgravity such as the 3 D-clinorotation may disturb skeletal muscle cell differentiation, at least in part, by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway...|$|E
