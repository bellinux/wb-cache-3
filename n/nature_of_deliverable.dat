40|$|We {{all work}} in {{groups and the}} notions of {{community}} and localism have rarely had higher currency among planners, politicians and leaders. This book is all about how groups work {{and how they can}} be studied and aided to work better. For the first time (as far as we are aware) it sets out the need to understand why groups arrive at the analyses they do. Up to the present the emphasis has been almost exclusively upon what groups have ‘delivered’ within participation. No one seems to have set out to explain how the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deliverable</b> could have been influenced by the make-up of groups and how they have worked together (the group dynamic). Working from research undertaken across the European Union during 2009 – 2010, the authors set out the background to the use of participation in various forms. Participation is shown to be a great idea but one which rarely get the serious treatment it deserves. It affects us all. Great teams capture the imagination, strong community fosters social cohesion, good groups lead and others are quick to follow. By the step by step application of the Triple Task method the authors show how groups can be understood, their issues and problems identified and their functionality improved. Triple Task can be applied rapidly and coherently by many kinds of practitioner and academic but the prize is more than understanding – good thought this is. By use of Triple Task the analyst can start to understand why teams fail and how they can be enhanced. This diagnostic and prescriptive element to Triple Task takes it beyond being a research tool to being an effective means to galvanise social action. ...|$|R
40|$|When CAD (Computer Aided Design) was {{generally}} {{adopted in the}} early 1990 ’s, the hand drawn process was replaced with the CAD drawing but the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the artefacts / deliverables and the exchanges of information between disciplines remained fundamentally the same. The deliverables remained 2 D representations of 3 D forms and Specifications and Bill of Quantities. However, the building industry is under great pressure to provide value for money, sustainable design and construction. This has propelled the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM). BIM is a foundational tool for a team based lean design approach. It can enable the intelligent interrogation of design; provide a quicker and cheaper design production; better co-ordination of documentation; more effective change control; less repetition of processes; a better quality constructed product; and improved communication both for the architectural practice and across the supply chain. As BIM enables a new of working methodology, it entails the change in perceiving artefacts used and deliverables produced {{in the design and}} construction stages. In other words, defining what the informational issues are, who does what and who is responsible for what and the level of detail required at each stage in design and construction is critically important to adopt and implement BIM in the construction sector. This paper presents the key findings through the action research methodology about the change in the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> artefacts and <b>deliverables</b> resulting from the BIM adoption in the KTP (Knowledge Transfer Partnership) project undertaken by the University of Salford and John McCall Architects...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} program correctness within a rich theory of dependent types, the Extended Calculus of Constructions (ECC). This system contains a powerful programming language of higher-order primitive recursion and higher-order intuitionistic logic. It is supported by Pollack's versatile LEGO implementation, which I use extensively to develop the mathematical constructions studied here. I systematically investigate Burstall's notion <b>of</b> <b>deliverable,</b> that is, a program paired with a proof of correctness. This approach separates the concerns of programming and logic, since I want a simple program extraction mechanism. The Sigma-types of the calculus enable us to achieve this. There are many similarities with the subset interpretation of Martin-Löf type theory. I show that deliverables have a rich categorical structure, so that correctness proofs may be decomposed in a principled way. The categorical combinators which I define in the system package up much logical book-keeping, allowing one {{to concentrate on the}} essential structure of algorithms. I demonstrate our methodology with a number of small examples, culminating in a machine-checked proof of the Chinese remainder theorem, showing the utility <b>of</b> the <b>deliverables</b> idea. Some drawbacks are also encountered. I consider also semantic aspects <b>of</b> <b>deliverables,</b> examining the definitions in an abstract setting, again firmly based on category theory. The aim is to overcome the clumsiness of the language of categorical combinators, using dependent type theories and their interpretation in fibrations. I elaborate a concrete instance based on the category of sets, which generalises to an arbitrary topos. In the process, I uncover a subsystem of ECC within which one may speak <b>of</b> <b>deliverables</b> defined over the topos. In the presence of enough extra structure, the interpretation extends to the whole of ECC. The wheel turns full circle...|$|R

30|$|The {{second part}} of the {{evaluation}} matrix concerns the success of project result dissemination (Appendix  2). FP projects typically result in the publication of a wide range <b>of</b> <b>deliverables</b> and outputs, both formal and informal. The dissemination quality matrix enables evaluators to specify the characteristics of specific dissemination activities undertaken during and after the project lifetime. Consequently, it assesses the potential effects of project results and indicates whether estimated impacts upon the objectives are likely to have been achieved in practice. The matrix indicators (list of activities) are selected on the basis that they are comprehensive whilst also feasible to be answered based upon written documents in the public domain. Project dissemination reports, project final reports and websites provide evidence of the scope and <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> dissemination activities conducted. In addition, each completed evaluation should be accompanied by a textual summary of the dissemination information assessment, detailing other relevant and specific dissemination information about projects.|$|R
