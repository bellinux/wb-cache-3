50|$|A large Canadian {{study from}} 2002 (funded by automakers, {{who are against}} its use) {{concluded}} that MMT impairs the effectiveness of automobile emission controls and increases pollution from motor vehicles. However, a later study by the Canadian government found that “no <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defect</b> {{was found to be}} potentially caused by MMT.” Many studies have been undertaken over time that confirmed the use of mmt is compatible with vehicles and safe for human health and the environment. In particular, a 2013 risk assessment on MMT was undertaken by ARCADIS Consulting, following a methodology developed by the European Commission. This risk assessment was verified by an independent panel and found by the EU Commission to be compliant with their methodology. It concluded that “when MMT is used as a fuel additive in petrol, no significant human health or environmental concerns related to exposure to either MMT or its transformation combustion products (manganese phosphate, manganese sulphate and manganese tetroxide) were identified even in locations where mmt is approved for use at levels up to 18 mg Mn/l.” As stated by Health Canada in their risk assessment on the widespread use of MMT in Canadian gasoline, “all analyses indicate that the combustion products of MMT in gasoline do not represent an added health risk to the Canadian population” MMT is manufactured by reduction of bis(methylcyclopentadienyl) manganese using triethylaluminium. The reduction is conducted under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide.MMT is a so-called half-sandwich compound, or more specifically a piano-stool complex (since the three CO ligands are like the legs of a piano stool). The manganese atom in MMT is coordinated with three carbonyl groups {{as well as to the}} methylcyclopentadienyl ring. These hydrophobic organic ligands make MMT highly lipophilic, which may increase bioaccumulation. While the structure of mmt suggests lipophilicity and potential to bioaccumulate, comparison of bioconcentration factors (BCF) reported for plant and animal species in comparison to regulatory-based cutoffs (i.e., US EPA and EU REACH) indicates a low bioaccumulative potential of mmt. Figures 2 and 3 of the study (pages 182 & 184) shows the BCF plotted against time and illustrates the potential BCF of mmt. From these figures, the upper curve (A) demonstrates the 9-day mmt BCF plateauing at approximately 400 in plants and 200 in fish, with both values well below the Bioaccumulative/very Bioaccumulative (B/vB) thresholds of US EPA, EU REACH and Environment & Climate Change Canada. A variety of related complexes are known, including ferrocene, which is also under consideration as an additive to gasoline.|$|E

Although the symbols on the Big Apple maps were not {{designed}} to give <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> every unique <b>defect</b> found on the sidewalks and roads of New York City, each symbol on the map legend represents a general category <b>of</b> potentially hazardous <b>defects</b> (e.g., [...] "Hole or hazardous depression," [...] "Raised or uneven portion of sidewalk," [...] "Pothole or other hazard"). Clearly, if no symbol or a completely different symbol is used on the map, the City does not receive <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> a given <b>defect.</b> It follows that where the defect could reasonably be encompassed by the symbol used on the map, {{the question of whether}} the City received <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> that <b>defect</b> is for the fact finder and not one that can be easily answered as a matter of law.|$|R

40|$|D. R. Horton, Inc. {{built the}} First Light at Boulder Ranch Community in Henderson, Nevada, which {{consists}} of 138 buildings, with three residential units in each building, totaling 414 residences. There are three different floor plans, each with two possible elevations, {{for a total of}} six different types of homes. First Light believed that constructional defects may have existed in each residence, and hired experts to assist it in preparing a NRS 40. 465, 2 pre-litigation <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> constructional <b>defects.</b> In order to prepare this notice, the experts used visual and invasive testing of a small representative sample of homes, and then extrapolated the percentage of homes in which they believed each defect was present throughout the community. The experts failed to provide D. R. Horton with the addresses or the expert report of the homes they had tested. The notice stated that approximately 160 defects may have existed in various combinations; and estimated that anywhere from 2 to 100 percent of the 414 homes had any combination <b>of</b> the 160 <b>defects.</b> Additionally, First Light did not specify the floor plans, elevations, or addresses of the homes in which it alleged that a particular defect may have existed. First Light, unsatisfied with D. R. Horton’s response to its notice, filed a constructional defect action with the district court. D. R. Horton moved for declaratory judgment, arguing that First Light’s notice was unreasonable and, therefore, statutorily insufficient. The district court denied the motion, and refused to declare First Light’s NRS 40. 645 notice statutorily insufficient. 3 D. R. Horton filed a petition challenging the district court’s order on the grounds that First Light’s notice was not given in “reasonable detail” as required by NRS 40. 645 (2), and that the inadequacy <b>of</b> the <b>notice</b> frustrated its opportunity to repair under NRS 40. 647. 4 After concluding that NRS 40. 645 was ambiguous, 5 the Nevada Supreme Court reviewed the legislative history behind the statute. The Court held that {{it was clear that the}} Legislature intended for contractors to have an opportunity to repair defects, and that contractors are entitled to reasonable <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> alleged <b>defects</b> in order to decide whether to verify and repair those defects. 6 The Court noted that there is not an exact formula for determining whether a pre-litigation notice is reasonable, and that the district courts have wide discretion when making that determination. The Court went on to “establish[] a ‘reasonable threshold test,’ which every pre-litigation notice must satisfy, but only if challenged by the contractor. ” 7 The Court also held “that NRS 40. 645 (4) (c) requires a claimant to disclose the expert opinions and reports in his possession that were used to prepare his pre-litigation notice. ” 8 As a result, the Court granted D. R. Horton’s petition in part so that the district court could determine whether First Light’s notice provided the detail necessary to pass the “reasonable threshold test,” and granted the petition to the extent asking the Court to require First Light to disclose the expert reports concerning the alleged defects...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of whisker {{growth on}} pure, electroplated tin layers is known since {{many years and}} common knowledge to industry. This whisker effect is being well described in literature and topics of several published papers. In order to check reliability, in terms of whisker growth, special test methods {{have been used in}} industry (e. g. Bellcore – GR- 78 -CORE/R 13. 2. 7, IPC TM 650 2. 6. 3. 3 and IPC TM 650 2. 3. 14). Common for those tests are environments with increased temperature (40 - 85 °C) to which the specimens are exposed. These common tests are state of the art and industrial standards. As far as seen today, immersion tin layers do meet the actual requirements as a lead-free finish for soldering and for press-fit technology. Since the mid-nineties immersion tin is used in industry with a strong increase in assembly volume. During introduction of immersion tins, OEMs as well as PCB-manufactures and chemical vendors did substantial tests regarding its reliability. Part of these test matrixes was in-depth testing on the formation of whisker growth. According to Bellcore and IPC the tested layers were found to be whisker free. With beginning of the year 2002, European OEMs reported formation of whiskers while inspecting not-assembled PCBs plated with immersion tin. These boards were stored and exposed to ambient temperature for several months. Regardless of the chemistry vendor, all immersion tin coated PCBs showed strong whisker growth. Nevertheless, soldered and assembled PCBs staid whisker free, even after storage of more than 2 years. Getting <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> that <b>defect,</b> a joint project between a European OEM and immersion tin vendors was started to avoid whiskers on PCBs plated with immersion tin. Within this project a substantial development and test program was carried out. As result of this, a modified immersion tin process was released. These modifications are based on additives controlling and inhibiting whisker growth...|$|R

30|$|In (Brito and Barcellos 2016), 108 {{measures}} were cited. Analyzing the set <b>of</b> measures, we <b>noticed</b> that some <b>of</b> them were not normalized. If measures are not normalized, {{it is not}} possible to compare them nor use them to describe process behavior (Barcellos et al. 2013). For instance, the measure number <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> is not suitable for SPC, because {{it is not possible}} to analyze the behavior of the related process (e.g., Coding) considering the number <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> detected in source codes with different sizes. Thus, we eliminated the following measures: maintenance time, number of action items detected in peer reviews, defects delivered, development effort, number <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> injected in coding, number <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> injected in design, number <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> injected in requirements, test development effort, test development internal review effort, test design effort, test design internal review effort, test procedure preparation effort, test procedure preparation internal review effort, number <b>of</b> <b>defects,</b> effort, action items resolution effort, test development peer review effort, defect-fixing effort, amount of time spent responding to problems. However, it is important to notice that if these measures can be normalized they can be useful within the SPC context. For instance, if the measure maintenance time is normalized by product size (e.g., number of KSLOC) or by number <b>of</b> solved <b>defects,</b> it can adequately describe the maintenance process behavior and be used in SPC.|$|R
