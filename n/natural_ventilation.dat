5|$|Termites use {{sophisticated}} {{means to}} control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (stack effect) creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across {{the tops of the}} towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> and passive cooling in modern buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern art}} {{movement}} in the country officially emerged in the 1950s, culminating {{in the establishment of}} an art society. Expressionism and surrealism, as well as calligraphic art are the popular forms of art in the country. Abstract expressionism has gained popularity in recent decades. Pottery-making and textile weaving are also popular products that were widely made in Bahraini villages. Arabic calligraphy grew in popularity as the Bahraini government was an active patron in Islamic art, culminating in the establishment of an Islamic museum, Beit Al Quran. The Bahrain national museum houses a permanent contemporary art exhibition. The architecture of Bahrain {{is similar to that of}} its neighbours in the Persian Gulf. The wind tower, which generates <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> in a house, is a common sight on old buildings, particularly in the old districts of Manama and Muharraq.|$|E
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. <b>Natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: It was {{the aim of}} {{the study}} to analyze the level of {{performance}} of <b>natural</b> air <b>ventilation</b> with a case study of the traditional Malay house in Penang, Malaysia. This study provided information on the architectural design in relation to <b>natural</b> air <b>ventilation.</b> It promoted passive design in contrast to most housing design which has poor <b>natural</b> air <b>ventilation</b> because the design was orientated to energy consumption that slightly more than one third of the electric energy was used for heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems. Approach: This analysis used quantitative method which measured temperature, humidity and wind speed of the traditional house. The result indicated the level of performance of cross air ventilation and stack effect. Results: The analysis showed that the traditional house has a design integrated with <b>natural</b> air <b>ventilation</b> system. The indoor house temperature and relative humidity had slightly lower than its outdoor area. However, the indoor area had lower wind speed level than the outdoor area. Conclusion: The study showed that maximum openings on the building walls created high air intakes outside the house to give poor performance of stack effect. The design had more emphasis to cross air ventilation...|$|R
25|$|A solar chimney often {{referred}} to as a thermal chimney is a way of improving the <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> of buildings by using convection of air heated by passive solar energy. A simple description of a solar chimney is that of a vertical shaft utilizing solar energy to enhance the natural stack ventilation through a building.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the design}} {{challenges}} and sensitivity to a site that are required to efficiently meet the energy needs of a building and occupants with renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.), designers must apply holistic design principles, {{and take advantage of}} the free naturally occurring assets available, such as passive solar orientation, <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation,</b> daylighting, thermal mass, and night time cooling.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, the {{original}} {{doors at the}} wing entrances were replaced with plate-glass windows and concrete panels. That same year, the lower ventilators at the building’s perimeter were removed, and concrete panels, cast in {{the profile of the}} ventilators, were installed. This unfortunately seriously compromised the building’s <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> system. A few minor repairs were made in 1962 and 1965.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{aeraulic}} simulations {{will help}} to assess {{the efficiency of the}} systems set up in order to maximize the <b>natural</b> cross <b>ventilation</b> phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|<b>Natural</b> night <b>ventilation</b> is {{an energy}} {{efficient}} way to improve thermal summer comfort. Coupled thermal and ventilation simulation tools predict the performances. Nevertheless, {{the reliability of the}} simulation results with regard to the assumptions in the input, is still unclear. Uncertainty analysis is chosen to determine the uncertainty on the predicted performances of <b>natural</b> night <b>ventilation.</b> Sensitivity analysis defines the most important input parameters causing this uncertainty. The results for a single-sided and cross ventilation strategy in a single office are discussed and compared...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{solution}} of <b>natural</b> distribution <b>ventilation</b> network {{is the basis}} of ventilation network optimization, The essence of the solution is to calculate nonlinear equations with Newton method at present, The calculating precision or calculating time is influenced heavely by the initial value selection when Newton method is used. In order to solve the limitations of Newton method, a common algorithm to solve non-linear equation system–homotopy method–was discussed and the homotopy equation for solving <b>natural</b> distribution <b>ventilation</b> network was built. A ventilation network case was solved with free software–Octave–in this paper. Based on the discussion above, the relationships among initial value choice, numerical integral step and calculating precision were discussed when this method was used. The results show that homotopy method is an effective way for solving <b>natural</b> distribution <b>ventilation</b> network. In addition, solving ventilation network with Octave can effectively avoid the copyright problem which is often caused when program language such as Matlab and VB are used to solve the ventilation network...|$|R
25|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of Tel Aviv’s town-scape are the pilotis on {{which most of}} the apartment buildings in the residential quarters are raised. This feature was achieved on the part of several avant-garde architects in the early thirties in a fierce struggle against the existing municipal bye-laws. The spacious voids between the pillars created a shaded street-scape, added to the <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> during the hot summer days and connected the pavements with the green areas.|$|E
25|$|The Fullerton Building was {{designed}} for <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{before the age of}} air-conditioning; one of the architectural devices used to provide this was the internal air-wells. There were four air-wells along the central longitudinal axis, divided by three internal bays of offices, linking the front façade with the rear. It was the largest and the last example of this kind of architecture in Singapore. As air-conditioning became increasingly common, the air-wells became redundant.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the design was that it would also be a sustainable building. This commitment to the environment is an increasingly significant part of North Shore City Council's approach to urban development, especially through the Resource Management Act and the Treaty of Waitangi. It aims to lead by example with best practices. The library design incorporated several notable features, including the maximisation of natural light, the use of recyclable material, including reuse of grey water, and a <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> and cooling system to limit energy costs.|$|E

50|$|In addition, a patio will be {{designed}} {{so as to}} provide <b>natural</b> cross <b>ventilation.</b> A chimney principle has been chosen to create the ventilation phenomenon. In order to minimize the solar heat gain, an external wooden cladding consisting of 6 cm of insulation material, will be installed.|$|R
25|$|The {{courtyard}} doughnut {{shape is}} critical to the two main design priorities: daylighting and <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Natural daylighting was achieved through the shallow floor plate depths and high ceilings allowing for light to penetrate the interior of the offices from both the exterior of the building and the core open-air courtyard. Daylighting models were tested at the University of Washington’s Integrated Design Lab to ensure even lighting and minimizing glare to users working on computers. Within the bulk of the building, daylight sensors are on all lighting within 15 feet of the windows and Energy Star equipment is provided to reduce the plug load.|$|E
25|$|By the 1900s, {{the single}} track Zig Zag {{had become a}} bottleneck, and {{duplication}} of the line became essential. By careful alignment of the new line to exploit {{a large number of}} clefts in the terrain, a double track deviation with 10 short tunnels was possible rather than one long one. These tunnels have a relatively gentle gradient of 1 in 90 (1.11%). However, the frequent gaps between the tunnels provide good <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation.</b> In the latter days of steam, a train with 4 locomotives might haul a train to the entrance of the ten tunnels, with only 2 locomotives having to proceed through the tunnels themselves. Thus the fume problems in these tunnels was moderate.|$|E
25|$|Climatic {{influences}} on vernacular architecture are substantial {{and can be}} extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that {{of much of the}} Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by water mist and evaporation is drawn through the building by the <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work.|$|E

40|$|AbstractArchitects {{are confronted}} with the {{priority}} of the early integration of <b>natural</b> smoke <b>ventilation</b> (NSV) and <b>natural</b> thermal <b>ventilation</b> (NTV) objectives in retail building designs due to several reasons including wide range of expertise and lack of fire safety knowledge. This paper presents the perception of fire engineers (FE) and building service engineers (BSE) regarding the conceptual priorities of the early integration for particular design decisions. This was achieved through surveying FE and BSE and conducting an analytical study using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. An experts’ panel was held for each profession for confirmation. The results showed that FE and BSE have agreed on the most and least crucial design decisions that should/shouldn’t require integration of NSV and NTV objectives {{in the early stages}} of the architectural design process...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{evaluate}} cross ventilation by the multi zone network airflow simulation and the CFD. Cross-ventilated {{detached house}} is evaluated. Quantitative {{evaluation of the}} effect of cross ventilation is carried out. The analytic object is a standard residence model. The k-e turbulence model simulates the flow. The purpose of this simulation is to calculate indoor airflow velocity distribution. The muti-zone airflow network model analysis using TRNSYS-COMIS simulates the indoor temperature. Two different analyses are coupled, so that the long-term simulation is realized. This paper proposes to report on the outline of the evaluation index of <b>natural</b> cross <b>ventilation</b> performance. This paper has the point to (1) locality, (2) location, (3) building performance as factors which influenced indoor wind velocity, and show the outline of the evaluation method for <b>natural</b> cross <b>ventilation</b> performance...|$|R
25|$|The High Horse Level {{had been}} started before the mine was {{abandoned}} in the 1810s, from the lowest possible point {{on the floor of}} the upper valley beneath Green Side. It was made wide enough and straight enough to allow horses to pull wagons of ore along it on narrow-gauge wooden rails. The new company drove this level forward, and in 1828 it broke through to a sump (a vertical working) which had been made below Gilgower's Level. This created <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> in the mine, and enabled the work to be expanded. By 1834 92 men were employed underground. The High Horse Level was continued northwards and in 1837 it crossed the northern boundary of the area shared by the two landowners.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{examples}} of this movement appear in Maclaine Pont's design for the ceremonial halls of the Technische Hoogeschool te Bandung (which became Institut Teknologi Bandung). The building features an eclectic synthesis of various Indonesian local forms, including the architecture of Lake Toba, the Mentawai islands, and Sunda. The building is a striking example of innovative tropical architecture. With an elongated elevation aligned on an east-west axis, the building is provided with effective <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation.</b> This orientation also minimizes the effect of solar radiation in that the morning and afternoon sun only strikes the narrow end facades of the building. The external galleries of the building create a double facade which shield the interior from direct sunlight, while cooling towers at either end ensure good ventilation.|$|E
25|$|This <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{process can}} be {{augmented}} by a solar chimney. The chimney has {{to be higher than}} the roof level, and has to be constructed on the wall facing the direction of the sun. Absorption of heat from the sun can be increased by using a glazed surface on the side facing the sun. Heat absorbing material can be used on the opposing side. The size of the heat-absorbing surface {{is more important than the}} diameter of the chimney. A large surface area allows for more effective heat exchange with the air necessary for heating by solar radiation. Heating of the air within the chimney will enhance convection, and hence airflow through the chimney. Openings of the vents in the chimney should face away from the direction of the prevailing wind.|$|E

25|$|The {{deterioration}} of wood occurred at typically vulnerable areas, {{such as the}} exposed end grain of arches and muntins and where wood members intersect. The humidity in the building was a contributing factor to wood deterioration. The level of moisture in the building was exacerbated by two conditions. First, the building’s <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> system had been removed in a past repair. The ventilators, which were originally located in the low wall area, had been filled in, and some ridge ventilators were inoperable. The air flow through the ventilators, which would have assisted in the evaporation of water, was not occurring. Second, the penetration of rain water from {{the exterior of the}} building, because of inadequate or deteriorated waterproofing, had increased the level of moisture in the wood. The copper sheathing that had originally capped the arch exteriors, in addition to acting as a moisture barrier, may have been acting as a biocide through copper oxides inhibiting wood rot.|$|E

500|$|The {{museum is}} housed in a colonial French {{building}} which is a cupola shaped edifice {{in the shape of}} a pagoda. The design of the building is an amalgamation of French and Chinese architecture known as Indochina architecture. The building designed by Hebrard, incorporates double walls and balconies for a <b>natural</b> <b>ventilation</b> system and protection from sunshine. The exhibition area is more than [...] with exhibits arranged chronologically. It is divided into five major sections: Section 1 covers period from the prehistoric period from the Stone Age (30,000–40,000 years [...] ) to 4,000–5,000 years ago; Section 2 has displays from the time of nation building during the Tran Dynasty; Section 3 has exhibits from the period of the Ho Dynasty to the August 1945 Revolution; and Section 4 has artifacts of the Champa stone sculptures. The museum showcases Vietnam's history with very large collection of about 200,000 items, covering the Neolothic age, Bronze age, Sa Hunh, Oc Eo, and Hung periods, Ngyyen dynasty, Cham period, and also northern Vietnam's Dong Son, a culture which existed about 1000 BC-100 AD. These exhibits are in the main building. The exhibits highlight communism and depict the rule of the French colonists as cruel.|$|E
