5|$|In London Smith {{tended to}} <b>neglect</b> <b>the</b> zoological {{parts of the}} collection, he added some {{specimens}} and also gave some specimens away. Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously {{at the hands of}} scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material.|$|E
5|$|Suffering a {{wound on}} the Borodino {{battlefield}} was effectively a death sentence, as French forces did not possess enough {{food for the}} healthy, much less the sick; consequently, equal numbers of wounded soldiers starved to death, died of their injuries, or perished through <b>neglect.</b> <b>The</b> casualties were for a single day of battle, while the Russian figures are for the 5th and the 7th, combined. Using the same accounting method for both armies brings the actual French Army casualty count to 34,000â€“35,000.|$|E

5|$|Shirokogoroff's and Eliade's {{views of}} shamanism were both {{centered}} on individuals {{and on the}} role of shamans in small groups. Shirokogoroff, for instance, considered eighteenth-century Qing shamanism too formalized to be authentic. Historians of northeast Asia have criticized Eliade's and Shirokogoroff's interpretations because they <b>neglect</b> <b>the</b> political roles of shamans and shamanism's relation with the state. Eliade's claim that shamanism is by essence archaic, individualistic, and socially transgressive led him and his followers to neglect historical contexts in which shamanism fulfilled political functions or served the needs of the state, as it did under the Qing.|$|E
5|$|Byzantium {{used the}} peace to focus its energy on wars against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East, where {{a series of}} campaigns under generals John Kourkouas and Nikephoros Phokas greatly {{expanded}} imperial territory. At the same time, military reforms created a much more effective and offensively-oriented army. The Byzantines did not <b>neglect</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, working steadily to improve their contacts with the peoples {{of central and eastern}} Europe, subtly altering {{the balance of power in}} the peninsula. Their Crimean outpost of Cherson maintained trade with the Pechenegs and the emerging power of the Kievan Rus'; Byzantine missionaries led the Christianization of the Magyars; and the Slavic princes of the western Balkans came to once again acknowledge the suzerainty of the Empire, particularly after Caslav Klonimirovic ended Bulgarian control over Serbia. These relationships on the periphery of the Bulgarian Empire were an important asset for Byzantine diplomacy: instigating attacks against Bulgaria by the Pechenegs and the Khazars was a time-honoured method of applying pressure on the Bulgarians.|$|E

25|$|These {{two broad}} {{categories}} may be further subdivided. Patients with egocentric neglect may ignore the stimuli leftward of their trunks, their heads, or their retinae. Those with allocentric neglect may <b>neglect</b> <b>the</b> true left of a presented object, or may first correct in their mind's eye a slanted or inverted object and then <b>neglect</b> <b>the</b> side then interpreted as {{being on the}} left. So, for example, if patients are presented with an upside-down photograph of a face, they may mentally flip the object right side up and then <b>neglect</b> <b>the</b> {{left side of the}} adjusted image. In another example, if patients are presented with a barbell, patients will more significantly <b>neglect</b> <b>the</b> left side of the barbell, as expected with right temporal lobe lesion. If the barbell is rotated such that the left side is now on the right side, patients will more significantly <b>neglect</b> <b>the</b> left side of the object, even though it is now {{on the right side of}} space. This also occurs with slanted or mirror-image presentations. A patient looking at a mirror image of a map of the World may neglect to see the Western Hemisphere despite their inverted placement onto the right side of the map.|$|E
