40|$|Snow cover at the studied {{locations}} in the Eastern Giant Mountains {{in the winter of}} 2010 / 2011 were collected through periodic field measurements of snow cover height. For evaluation and interpretation of measurements was used data from the meteorological station on "Luční bouda" and published the results of previous measurements in the field. In the "Čertova louka" is located <b>nivation</b> <b>hollow,</b> which show an increase in the accumulation of snow, which melted in early June. In the "Modré sedlo" location, which is largely exposed to deflation, the snow lasted until the end of April. The distribution of snow cover at both sites in winter 2010 / 2011 were consistent with previous observations. Maximum height of snow cover was lowest (about 8. 4 to 43. 8 %) from the current observation and were recorded aproximately one month earlier (18. 2.). The main reason for the development of unusual snow was warm front with rainfall, which affected the studied area during March. Winter 2010 / 2011 has been in terms of power and duration of snow cover at the studied locations below average...|$|E

40|$|Recent geomorphological {{research}} in {{eastern part of}} Pohorje Mountains has revealed new information about periglacial and glacial landforms of that area. Based on these findings, similar landforms in western part of Pohorje were studied, especially cryopla­ nation terraces and <b>nivation</b> <b>hollows.</b> Field research has also revealed the existence of ploughing rocks, blockstreams, blockfields and one cirque...|$|R
40|$|Cryoplanation {{terraces}} are step- {{or table}} like residual landforms {{consisting of a}} nearly horizontal bedrock surface covered by a thin veneer of rock debris and bounded by ascending or descending scarps or both. Among examples studied, rubble-covered scarps range in height from 3 to 76 m and slope from 9 deg to 32 deg; nearly vertical scarps exist where bedrock is exposed or thinly buried. Simple transverse <b>nivation</b> <b>hollows,</b> which are occupied by large seasonal snow banks, commonly indent the lower surfaces of sharply angular ascending scarps. Terrace treads slope from 1 deg to 10 deg and commonly cut across bedrock structures such as bedding, rock contacts, foliation, joints, faults, and shear zones. Debris on terrace treads is generally 0. 8 - 2. 5 m thick. Permafrost table is generally present from 0. 5 to 2 m below the tread surface. Permafrost is shallowest in the floors of <b>nivation</b> <b>hollows</b> and deepest in the well-drained margins of terrace treads. Side slopes of cryoplanation terraces are shallowly buried bedrock surfaces that are littered {{with a variety of}} mass-movement deposits...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Hart Mountain is a basaltic fault block {{mountain}} in the semi-desert region of the northern Basin and Range province in south-central Oregon. Geomorphic processes associated with lingering snowpatches have formed <b>nivation</b> <b>hollows,</b> which are small scale depressions in the hillsides. The lingering snow in the hollows prohibits shrub growth. Bedrock scarps, present {{in some of the}} hollows, show indications of chemical alteration. Bills are present below most of the hollows, indicating that surface runoff from these sites occurs. Average hillslope, which controls the shear stress placed on soil particles, is statistically related to morphometric attributes defining the size and angles of the hollows. Simple linear regressions and the nonparametric Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (p-) and Theil's C test for the regression line slope suggest that average hillslope {{is directly related to the}} morphometric attributes of the hollows. Heat transfer controls the areal distribution and duration of snowpatcnes. A relative insolation factor and elevation are taken as surrogates for heat transfer. These surrogates are likewise correlated with the morphometric attributes of the hollows. Both the elevation and the relative insolation factor suggest an inverse relationship between heat transfer and the size of <b>nivation</b> <b>hollows.</b> The hollows on Hart Mountain appear to have been formed by accelerated nivation processes during the Pleistocene and are currently being modified by less intense nivation...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to the well-studied Pleistocene glaciation, {{periglacial}} {{phenomena in}} Slovenia {{have been given}} less scientific attention {{because they are not}} particularly evident in high mountains due to prevailing carbonate rocks. This, however, is not the case in the Pohorje Mountains: built of igneous and metamorphic rocks, it was not glaciated due to its insufficient elevation, but was subject to periglacial processes. In the article, some of the periglacial landforms of the Pohorje Mountains are presented for the first time, especially <b>nivation</b> <b>hollows</b> in the uppermost zone, and the Jezerc cirque where a smaller glacier, unknown until recently, existed {{at the peak of the}} glaciation...|$|R
40|$|The {{territory}} of the Republic of San Marino (central-northern Apennines), despite its limited area, has a peculiar geological and morphostructural setting which favoured the preservation of some geomorphologic indicators of periglacial processes active during the late Quaternary cold phases. Distinctly, glacis deposits and related landforms, stratified slope-waste deposits, limestone migrating boulders, and <b>nivation</b> <b>hollows</b> account for a relict landscape which well integrates {{in the context of}} a periglacial paleo-environment dating back to the middle-upper Pleistocene glacial stages. On the basis of stratigraphic well-log data the lower boundary of glacis deposits, their areal extension, and the depth of clayey slope-waste deposits have been accurately defined. Actually, thanks to such data a preliminary reconstruction of the relict topography was performed, making it possible to correlate it with the fluvial terraces found along the main valley-sides. Eventually, quantitative geomorphologic analyses have been performed leading to a preliminar paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the massif of Mount Titan and the surrounding area...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{knowledge of}} present and past geomorphological processes {{in an area}} of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines near Abetone was achieved in this study, also by elaborating a geomorphological map at a 1 : 10, 000 scale. In this territory, prevalently characterised by arenaceous rock types and, secondarily, by argillaceous and silty ones, the landforms listed below were recognised. - Structural landforms: the most evident are located near the mountain crest, where the slope face corresponds to the stratum surface of the Macigno Sandstones and where there are structural scarps more than 30 m high. - Glacial landforms and deposits: they include cirques, overdeepened hollows, roches moutonnées and moraine ridges. - Cryogenic and nivation landforms and deposits: among these, block fields, <b>nivation</b> <b>hollows,</b> avalanche tracks and cones, protalus ramparts, block streams and gelifluction deposits should be mentioned. - Gravity-induced slope landforms and processes: besides the presence of particularly developed scree slopes, various types of mass movements have been recognised, such as earthflows, falls and topples, translational slides, rotational and roto-translational slides, as well as deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (Dgsd), the latter characterised by a dominant structural control (NW-SE and SW-NE oriented faults). - Landforms, processes and deposits due to running waters: slopes affected by rill wash, colluvial and alluvial fans, related to concentrated running waters, are present together with swampy deposits filling small structural depressions; moreover, two orders of alluvial terraces, badland forms, debris flows and small waterfalls have been surveyed. Since the hydrographic network is in a deepening stage, present alluvial deposits are found only upstream of the numerous wiers that dam the courses of the Pozze and Motte torrents. - Anthropogenetic landforms and deposits: among Man's activities which modify the landscape, the construction of large parking areas and ski pistes should be mentioned; these kinds of activities have produced slope cuts and filling of some small swampy areas. The data acquired allowed geomorphological events to be reconstructed starting from late Upper Pleistocene. In particular, in this sector of the Northern Apennines glacial traces ascribable only to the glaciation known in the Alps as Würm III were found. An attempt to reconstruct a relative chronology of the stadial phases was also carried out, thus identifying forms related to Apennines Stage I, which was characterised by two distinct stages with snow limits respectively of 1, 611 and 1, 663 m a. s. l., and Apennines Stage II, also characterised by two phases with a snow limit ranging between 1, 770 and 1, 836 m. Apennines Stage III did not leave any trace since, according to the previous authors, its permanent snow limit would be found at heights superior to those of the Apennine peaks of this area. In general, the action of the various morphogenetic agents in the evolutive history of these valleys was strictly conditioned by the structural characteristics of the area...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} hydro-morphological {{investigations}} of channel and valley networks {{of the inner}} rims of Newton and Bakhuysen Crater on Mars, while focusing on the northeastern inner rim of Newton Basin. Image data (HRSC, CTX, MOLA, HiRISE, MOC), digital elevation models (MOLA, HRSC), calculation of discharge, runoff and potential thawing rates, and fluvial-statistic methods with qualitative and quantitative reference to the morphology of the fluvial systems {{were used for the}} analyses. The investigated channels and valleys at the northeastern inner rim of Newton Crater are characterized by a high degree of complexity and integration of the tributaries. These dendritic systems reach stream orders of up to 5 and channel/valley densities between 0. 05 km^- 1 and 0. 32 km^- 1 at the Noachian-Hesperian-Boundary up to the Late Hesperian. Their bifurcation ratios vary between 2 to 5 and their stream length ratios yield 1 to 4. As terrestrial river systems show values in the same order, erosive processes on Early Mars can assumed to be quite similar. The unbalanced longitudinal profiles indicate that the channels did not evolve to the maturity level. The lack of balance of erosion, transport, and sedimentation, indicates sporadic drainage. The flood peaks in Newton range between 145 m³/s and 1, 200 m³/s at the mouths. The mean discharge rates are about 10 m³/s to 230 m³/s. This corresponds to runoff rates of some centimeters per day (peak discharge rates) and some millimeters per day (mean discharge rates). River meandering was mainly suppressed. Rather, fluvial sections alternate with single stream channels within well preserved valleys and segments of anastomosing fluvial structures within inner mountain plains. A potential alluvial fan or delta could not be determined unambiguously due to insufficient resolution of the data. In contrast to Newton Crater, stream orders up to 4 have been determined at the inner rim of Bakhuysen Crater. The channel/valley densities vary between 0. 46 km^- 1 and 0. 6 km^- 1. Hence, they are roughly twice as high as those of Newton Crater. The bifurcation ratios vary between 2 and 4 in medium-sized networks (stream order 3) and up to 5 for the largest systems (stream order 4). Their stream length ratios usually range between 1 and 2 and, thus, correspond to the lower field of the Newton Crater measurements. Conclusions can be drawn that erosion processes occurred in a similar way at other locations on Mars and at other times up to Early Amazonian. This is proved by age determinations of fluvial deposits. Longitudinal profiles of the Bakhuysen channels are likewise unbalanced as the Newton ones. Due to the smaller catchments of Bakhuysen Crater (< 400 km²), peak and mean discharge rates reach lower values. Largest catchment areas show peak discharge values of 200 m³/s to 290 m³/s and mean discharge rates of 20 m³/s to 30 m³/s. These runoff rates range in the same dimension as those of Newton Crater. In general, there is hardly evidence for sedimentation of material in inner mountain plains. Thus, the material was transported into the crater which is documented by deposits in the northeast of Bakhuysen. The formation of the channels and valleys is explained by a local thermodynamic circulation model generated by the orography. Snowfall in high altitudes and accumulation of snow and ice in <b>nivation</b> <b>hollows</b> or at elevated areas over long periods cause thawing and melt water runoff during warmer periods (interglacial). The determination of potential thawing rates yields maximum runoff rates of some centimeters per day. They have the same dimension as those runoff values, which were calculated from the discharge rates, deduced from catchment area size. A rapid incision of the channel and valley networks was enabled by the effect of the “eisrinde” and “thermal erosion”. The observations and calculations show that channel and valley networks on Mars can evolve intensively in relative short time periods under cold climate conditions...|$|R
