40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} on the optimization {{of the surface}} roughness when milling mould aluminium alloys (AA 6061 -T 6) with carbide coated inserts with <b>newly</b> <b>develop</b> Genetic Algorithm (GA) software. Optimization of the milling is very useful to reduce cost and time for machining mould. The approach is based on newly development of Genetic Algorithm software. In this work, the objectives were to optimized parameters with <b>newly</b> <b>develop</b> software and compare with statistical software. The optimized value {{has been used to}} develop a blow mould. Results from the <b>newly</b> <b>develop</b> GA software is closer with the statistical software. This software directly reduces in term of machining cost...|$|R

5|$|He {{seemingly}} rejected {{some aspects}} of van Eyckian realism, notably in his depictions of shadows, and his unwillingness to apply transparent glazes. As a colourist, Lochner was more inclined towards the International Gothic style, even if this inhibited realism. He did not utilise the <b>newly</b> <b>developed</b> Netherlandish techniques of representing perspective, but rather indicated distance through the diminution of parallel objects.|$|E

5|$|In April 2001, Bo Hamburger tested {{positive}} with a <b>newly</b> <b>developed</b> method which distinguished natural EPO from synthetic EPO used in doping by determining {{the percentage of}} basic EPO.

Bo Hamburger was released from his contract with CSC-Tiscali in September 2001.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, Nowotny {{was made}} {{commander}} of a specialist unit dubbed Kommando Nowotny, flying the <b>newly</b> <b>developed</b> Messerschmitt Me 262 out of airfields near Osnabrück.

On 7 October, Nowotny downed a B-24 Liberator bomber, his first aerial victory on the Western Front.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} a <b>newly</b> <b>developing</b> synthetic-based hydraulic fluid MOL Farm UTTO Synt, developed by MOL Group, Hungary.

During the test, flow values were statistically evaluated and graphically displayed in the form of flow characteristics and the loss of flow efficiency. On the basis of laboratory test results, it can be concluded that the <b>newly</b> <b>developing</b> fluid meets the specified requirements and it is possible to continue in testing under operating conditions...|$|R

5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a <b>newly</b> <b>developed</b> {{high-performance}} motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass steel casings for the boosters. These had been replaced by a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} the first {{to be able to be}} resupplied by the <b>newly</b> <b>developed</b> {{unmanned}} Progress freighters, although they could only dock at the rear port, as the front port lacked the plumbing used to refuel the propulsion system. The freighters docked automatically to the station via the Igla, and were then opened and emptied by the cosmonauts on board, whilst transfer of fuel to the station took place automatically under supervision from the ground.|$|E

Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power.|$|E

5|$|Attached to US forces, 1 RAR was {{primarily}} employed in search and destroy operations using the <b>newly</b> <b>developed</b> doctrine of airmobile operations, utilising helicopters to insert light infantry and artillery {{into an area}} of operations, and to support them with aerial mobility, fire support, casualty evacuation, and resupply. The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of operations into War Zone D—a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces—as {{well as in the}} Iron Triangle in November.|$|E
5|$|Australias keel {{was laid}} at John Brown & Company's Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was {{assigned}} the yard number 402. The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, {{in a ceremony}} which received extensive media coverage. Australias design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the <b>newly</b> <b>developed</b> nickel-steel armour plate. While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had {{to be used in}} some sections: the delay in sourcing the older armour plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown & Company delivered the ship £295,000 under budget.|$|E
