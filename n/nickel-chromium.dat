50|$|Chromium carbide {{is useful}} in the surface {{treatment}} of metal components. Chromium carbide is used to coat the surface of another metal in a technique known as thermal spraying. Cr3C2 powder is mixed with solid <b>nickel-chromium.</b> This mixture is then heated to very high temperatures and sprayed onto the object being coated where it forms a protective layer. This layer is essentially its own metal matrix composite, consisting of hard ceramic Cr3C2 particles embedded in a <b>nickel-chromium</b> matrix. The matrix itself contributes to the corrosion resistance of the coating because both nickel and chromium are corrosion resistant in their metallic form. After over spraying the coating, the coated part must run through a diffusion heat treatment to reach the best results in matter of coupling strength to the basemetal and also in matter of hardness. Another technique utilizes chromium carbide {{in the form of}} overlay plates. These are prefabricated chromium carbide coated steel plates, which are meant to be welded onto existing structures or machinery in order to improve performance.Chromium carbide is used as an additive in cutting tools made out of cemented carbides, in order to improve toughness by preventing the growth of large grains. The primary constituent in most extremely hard cutting tools is tungsten carbide. The tungsten carbide is combined with other carbides such as titanium carbide, niobium carbide, and chromium carbide and sintered together with a cobalt matrix. Cr3C2 prevents large grains from forming in the composite, which results in a fine-grained structure of superior toughness.|$|E

50|$|The {{bond coat}} adheres the {{thermal barrier coating}} to the {{superalloy}} substrate. Additionally, the bond coat provides oxidation protection and functions as a diffusion barrier against the motion of substrate atoms towards the environment.There are five major types of bond coats, the aluminides, the platinum-aluminides, MCrAlY, cobalt-cermets, and nickel-chromium.For the aluminide bond coatings, the final composition {{and structure of the}} coating depends on the composition of the substrate. Aluminides also lack ductility below 750 °C, and exhibit a limited by thermomechanical fatigue strength. The Pt-aluminides are very similar to the aluminide bond coats except for a layer of Pt (5—10 μm) deposited on the blade. The Pt is believed to aid in oxide adhesion and contributes to hot corrosion. The cost of Pt plating is justified by the increased blade life span. The MCrAlY is the latest generation of bond coat and does not strongly interact with the substrate. Normally applied by plasma spraying, MCrAlY coatings are secondary aluminum oxide formers. This means that the coatings form an outer layer of chromium oxide (chromia), and a secondary aluminum oxide (alumina) layer underneath. These oxide formations occur at high temperatures in the range of those that superalloys usually encounter. The chromia provides oxidation and hot-corrosion resistance. The alumina controls oxidation mechanisms by limiting oxide growth by self-passivating. The yttrium enhances the oxide adherence to the substrate, and limits the growth of grain boundaries (which can lead to flaking of the coating). Investigation indicates that addition of rhenium and tantalum increases oxidation resistance. Cobalt-cermet based coatings consisting of materials such as tungsten carbide/cobalt can be used due to excellent resistance to abrasion, corrosion, erosion, and heat. These cermet coatings perform well in situations where temperature and oxidation damage are significant concerns, such as boilers. One of the unique advantages of cobalt cermet coatings is a minimal loss of coating mass over time, due to the strength of carbides within the mixture. Overall, cermet coatings are useful in situations where mechanical demands are equal to chemical demands for superalloys. <b>Nickel-chromium</b> coatings are used most frequently in boilers fed by fossil fuels, electric furnaces, and waste incineration furnaces, where the danger of oxidizing agents and corrosive compounds in the vapor must be dealt with. The specific method of spray-coating depends on the composition of the coatings. <b>Nickel-chromium</b> coatings that also contain iron or aluminum perform much better (in terms of corrosion resistance) when they are sprayed and laser glazed, while pure <b>nickel-chromium</b> coatings perform better when thermally sprayed exclusively.|$|E
50|$|Alonizing is a {{diffusion}} metallizing {{process in}} that it is a thermochemical treatment that involves enriching the surface layer of an object with one or more metallic elements. Specifically, alonizing is the diffusion of aluminum into the surface of a base metal through high temperature vapors. The types of metals that can be alonized include all types of wrought and cast steels (i.e. plain carbon and low alloy grades, ferritic and austenitic steels, highly alloyed <b>nickel-chromium</b> steels, etc.). This process results in an alloy with the surface properties of aluminum while retaining the base metal’s inherent strength and rigidity. Therefore, alonizing does not change the high-temperature mechanical properties of the base metal, which is the advantage of alonizing over simply creating an aluminum alloy (aluminizing the surface versus aluminum throughout the alloy).|$|E
50|$|For <b>nickel-chromium</b> and iron-chromium alloys, {{short range}} order can be {{designed}} on the nano-scale (<5 nm) that absorbs the interstitial and vacancy's generated by PKA events. This allows materials that mitigate the swelling that normally occurs {{in the presence of}} high DPAs and keep the overall volume percent change under the ten percent range. This occurs through generating a metastable phase that is in constant, dynamic equilibrium with surrounding material. This metastable phase is characterized by having an enthalpy of mixing that is effectively zero with respect to the main lattice. This allows phase transformation to absorb and disperse the point defects that typically accumulate in more rigid lattices. This extends the life of the alloy through making vacancy and interstitial creation less successful as constant neutron excitement in the form of displacement cascades transform the SRO phase, while the SRO reforms in the bulk solid solution.|$|E
