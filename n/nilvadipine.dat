40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Nilvadipine</b> may {{lower rates}} of {{conversion}} from mild-cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD), in hypertensive patients. However, {{it remains to be}} determined whether treatment with <b>nilvadipine</b> is safe in AD patients, given the higher incidence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in this population, who {{may be more likely to}} suffer from symptoms associated with the further exaggeration of a drop in BP. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of <b>nilvadipine</b> in AD patients. METHODS: AD patients in the intervention group (n = 56) received <b>nilvadipine</b> 8 mg daily over 6 -weeks, compared to the control group (n = 30) who received no intervention. Differences in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, before and after intervention, was assessed using automated sphygmomanometer readings and ambulatory BP monitors (ABP), and change in OH using a finometer. Reporting of adverse events was monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the SBP of treated patients compared to non-treated patients but no significant change in DBP. Individuals with higher initial blood pressure (BP) had greater reduction in BP but individuals with normal BP did not experience much change in their BP. While OH was present in 84 % of the patients, there was no further drop in BP recorded on active stand studies. There were no significant differences in adverse event reporting between groups.

40|$|Several large {{population-based}} or {{clinical trial}} {{studies have suggested}} that certain dihydropyridine (DHP) L-type calcium channel blockers (CCBs) used for the treatment of hypertension may confer protection against the development of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, other studies with drugs of the same class have shown no beneficial clinical effects. To determine whether certain DHPs are able to impact underlying disease processes in AD (specifically the accumulation of the Alzheimer Aβ peptide), we investigated the effect of several antihypertensive DHPs and non-DHP CCBs on Aβ production. Among the antihypertensive DHPs tested, a few, including <b>nilvadipine,</b> nitrendipine and amlodipine inhibited Aβ production in vitro, whereas others had no effect or raised Aβ levels. In vivo, <b>nilvadipine</b> and nitrendipine acutely reduced brain Aβ levels in a transgenic mouse model of AD (Tg PS 1 /APPsw) and improved Aβ clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), whereas amlodipine and nifedipine were ineffective showing that the Aβ-lowering activity of the DHPs is independent of their antihypertensive activity. Chronic oral treatment with <b>nilvadipine</b> decreased Aβ burden in the brains of Tg APPsw (Tg 2576) and Tg PS 1 /APPsw mice, and also improved learning abilities and spatial memory.

40|$|Retinopathy {{leads to}} {{irreparable}} vision loss via capillary closure {{and areas of}} nonperfusion. However, the current instillation systems do not allow a sufficient amount of drug required to treat retinopathy to reach the posterior segment (retina); therefore, a new formulation targeting the posterior segment is expected as therapy for retinopathy. We prepared ophthalmic formulations containing <b>nilvadipine</b> nanoparticles (NILnano), and demonstrated whether the instillation of NILnano can prevent retinal dysfunction in rats injected with excessive streptozotocin (STZ rats) in this study. NILnano (mean particle size, 77 nm) was prepared by wet bead mill treatment, with the inclusion of various additives (2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, benzalkonium chloride, d-mannitol, and methylcellulose). Retinal dysfunction was observable two weeks after rats received intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg × 2, consecutive days, STZ rat). Changes in retinal function were evaluated by electroretinogram (ERG) and immunological methods. The retinal thickness, measured as {{the distance between the}} ganglion cell layer and the distal border of the outer nuclear layer, increased two weeks after the injection of streptozotocin, resulting in decreases in the levels of a-waves, b-waves, and oscillatory potential amplitudes in ERG of rats. The instillation of NILnano allowed the topical supplement of <b>nilvadipine</b> into the retina, and repeated instillation of NILnano (2 times/day) attenuated the retinal disorders led by the excessive streptozotocin. In conclusion, we found that retinal dysfunction in rats injected with streptozotocin can be prevented by the NILnano instillation.

Visual acuity, visual field, electroretinogram, and adverse events were used as outcome measures. Results. The 19 RCTs included in this systematic review included trials on hyperbaric oxygen delivery, topical brimonidine tartrate, vitamins, docosahexaenoic acid, gangliosides, lutein, oral <b>nilvadipine,</b> ciliary neurotrophic factor, and valproic acid. All treatments proved safe but did not show significant benefit on visual function. Long term supplementation with vitamin A showed a significantly slower decline rate in electroretinogram amplitude. Conclusions. Although all medical treatments for RP appear safe, evidence emerging from RCTs is limited since they do not present comparable results suitable for quantitative statistical analysis. The limited number of RCTs, the poor clinical results, and the heterogeneity among studies negatively influence the strength of recommendations for the long term management of RP patients...|$|E

Aims. Several treatments have been proposed to slow down progression of Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a hereditary retinal degenerative condition leading to severe visual impairment.

40|$|Angiotensin II {{blockade}} decreases TGF-β 1 and matrix {{proteins in}} cyclosporine nephropathy. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is implicated in fibrosis but the precise mechanism of this effect remains unclear. In {{a model of}} chronic cyclosporine (CsA) nephropathy, we previously showed that TGF-β 1 {{plays a role in}} CsA-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis and arteriolopathy by stimulating extracellular matrix (ECM) protein synthesis and inhibiting ECM degradation through increasing the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) - 1. We hypothesized that Ang II contributes to fibrosis by inducing TGF-β 1. Salt-depleted rats were given placebo, CsA alone, CsA + <b>nilvadipine,</b> CsA + hydralazine/hydrochlorthiazide, CsA + losartan (AT 1 receptor antagonist) or CsA + enalapril (Ang converting enzyme inhibitor) and were sacrificed at 7 and 28 days. All treated groups achieved similar blood pressures and glomerular filtration rates. The lesion of chronic CsA nephropathy was ameliorated by concomitant therapy with losartan or enalapril at 28 days, a phenomenon not observed in the other treatment groups. Similarly, Ang II blockade resulted in decreased expression of TGF-β 1 and PAI- 1 by Northern and ELISA. Similarly, the expression of ECM proteins directly influenced by TGF-β decreased with Ang II blockade. These results suggest that CsA-induced fibrosis in this model is independent of renal hemodynamics and is mediated, at least partly, through Ang II induction of TGF-β 1 expression...|$|E
40|$|Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is {{a genetically}} {{heterogeneous}} set of blinding diseases that affects {{more than a}} million people worldwide. In humans, ~ 5 - 8 % of recessive and dominant RP cases are caused by nonsense mutations in the Pde 6 b gene coding for the ß-subunit of the rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE 6 -ß). The study of the disease has been greatly aided by the Pde 6 brd 1 (rd 1) mouse model of RP carrying a null PDE 6 ß allele. Degenerating rd 1 rods were found to experience a pathological increase in intracellular calcium concentration (‘Ca overload’) when they enter the apoptotic process at postnatal day 10. A 1999 study suggested that the Ca 2 + channel antagonist D-cis diltiazem delays the kinetics of rd 1 rod degeneration, conferring partial rescue on scotopic vision. Subsequent reports were mixed: whereas several studies failed to replicate the original results, others appeared to confirm the neuroprotective effects of Ca 2 + channel antagonists such as diltiazem, <b>nilvadipine</b> and verapamil. We discuss the discordant results and the controversy they caused, and suggest potential causes for the discrepancy. We also discuss potential involvement of recently identified Ca 2 +-dependent mechanisms that include protective calcium ATPase mechanisms, ryanodine and IP 3 calcium stores, and store operated channels in Pde 6 brd 1 neurodegeneration. 1. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Although calcium antagonists exert {{preferential}} vasodilation of renal afferent arterioles, we {{have recently}} demonstrated that <b>nilvadipine</b> and efonidipine, possessing both L-type and T-type calcium channel blocking action, reverse the angiotensin (Ang) II–induced afferent and efferent arteriolar constriction. In the present study, we investigated {{the role of}} T-type calcium channels in mediating the Ang II–induced efferent arteriolar tone using the selective T-type calcium channel blocker mibefradil. Isolated perfused hydronephrotic rat kidneys were used for direct visualization of renal microcirculation. Administration of Ang II (0. 3 nmol/L) caused marked constriction of afferent (from 13. 560. 6 to 9. 260. 6 mm, P, 0. 01, n 56) and efferent (from 11. 561. 0 to 7. 460. 7 mm, P, 0. 01, n 55) arterioles. Mibefradil (1 mmol/L) dilated both vessels, with 82611 % and 7267 % reversal of afferent and efferent arterioles, respectively. Similarly, nickel chloride (100 mmol/L) caused dilation of both arterioles, similar in magnitude in afferent (68610 %, n 57) and efferent (8067 %, n 57) arterioles. To eliminate {{the possibility that the}} mibefradil-induced dilation was mediated by L-type channel blockade, mibefradil was administered in the presence of nifedipine (1 mmol/L). Thus, nifedipine caused modest efferent arteriolar dilation (3066 % reversal, n 59), and subsequent addition of mibefradil elicited further dilation of this vessel (8064 %, P, 0. 01 versus nifedipine). Furthermore, mibefradil reversed the Ang II–induced efferent arteriolar constriction even in the presence of nifedipine and phentolamine. These findings demonstrate that T-type calcium antagonists markedly dilate the Ang II–induced efferent arteriolar constriction, but th...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} several calcium {{antagonistic}} drugs (slow channel blockers), mesudipine, FR- 34235 (<b>nilvadipine),</b> nifedipine, and verapamil, were compared on the naturally-occurring slow action potentials (APs) of the isolated spontaneously-contracting sinoatrial (SA) -node of the rabbit. Mesudipine, at 1 X 10 (- 8) M, {{had little or}} no effect on the AP parameters and beating frequency. At 1 X 10 (- 7) M, mesudipine depressed the amplitude, + Vmax and frequency of the APs. A higher concentration of mesudipine (3 X 10 (- 7) M) completely blocked the slow APs. The concentration of FR- 34235 required for 50 % depression of Vmax was 3 X 10 (- 8) M, and complete block required 1 X 10 (- 7) M. The verapamil and nifedipine concentrations required for complete block were 1 X 10 (- 6) M and 1 X 10 (- 7) M, respectively. The cells blocked by these drugs were depolarized to about - 40 mV. Cells blocked and depolarized by the drugs responded to intensive field stimulation with a transient after-hyperpolarization, followed by damped oscillations. When [Ca]o was elevated from 1. 8 mM to 5. 4 mM, full block required a higher concentration of mesudipine (1 X 10 (- 6) M) and FR- 34235 (1 X 10 (- 6) M). The order of potency of the drugs tested was: nifedipine = FR- 34235 greater than mesudipine greater than verapamil. The effects of mesudipine, FR- 34235, and nifedipine were easily reversible upon washout for 10 min, whereas those of verapamil required longer periods. The results indicate that the slow channel blockers, mesudipine, FR- 34235, nifedipine, and verapamil depress the APs and automaticity of the SA-node...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin II {{regulation}} of vascular endothelial growth factor and receptors Flt- 1 and KDR/Flk- 1 in cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. BackgroundVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{is involved in}} angiogenesis, wound healing and inflammation. VEGF exerts its effect via the tyrosine kinase receptors Flt- 1 and KDR/Flk- 1. We have previously shown that VEGF is up-regulated in a chronic cyclosporine (CsA) nephrotoxicity model. Our current study examined the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) blockade with enalapril (E) or losartan (L) on VEGF in this model. MethodsPair-fed salt-depleted rats were administered vehicle, CsA, CsA + <b>nilvadipine,</b> CsA + hydralazine/hydrochlorthiazide (HCTZ), CsA + E or CsA + L, and were sacrificed at 7 or 28 days. Physiologic and histologic changes were studied {{in addition to the}} mRNA expression of VEGF and its receptors Flt- 1 and KDR/Flk- 1 by Northern blot, and the protein expression of VEGF by Western blot. ResultsWhile all groups achieved similar blood pressures and creatinine clearances, the amelioration in nephrotoxicity was observed only with Ang II blockade. VEGF mRNA and protein expressions increased with CsA and became significantly reduced with Ang II blockade. Flt- 1 expression was similar in all groups; it decreased early and remained low. On the other hand, KDR/Flk- 1 mRNA expression was higher at seven days in all groups, except in the +E and +L groups where it was significantly lower, and then became further down-regulated at 28 days. ConclusionsThe increased VEGF expression in chronic CsA nephrotoxicity seems to be related to up-{{regulation of}} Ang II. In addition, VEGF probably exerted its effect via the KDR/Flk- 1 receptor. The actions of VEGF in this model remain speculative, but may be related to its effect on macrophage infiltration or matrix deposition...|$|E
