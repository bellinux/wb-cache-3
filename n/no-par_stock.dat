50|$|Some U.S. {{states do}} not allow {{corporations}} incorporated {{in the state to}} issue <b>no-par</b> <b>stock.</b> In these states stock's par values are often extremely low relative to the trading value of the shares (e.g., one cent, or fractions of a cent).|$|E
50|$|In most jurisdictions, the {{par value}} of a stock is the lowest {{possible}} price at which a company could issue stock, and amounts equivalent to the aggregate par values of the stock were required to have special treatment as stated capital in accounting. No-par stocks often require {{the board of directors}} of a company to determine a stated value when issuing <b>no-par</b> <b>stock</b> to replace the par-determined capital amounts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>No-par</b> <b>stocks</b> have [...] "no par value" [...] {{printed on}} their certificates. Instead of par value, some U.S. states allow <b>no-par</b> <b>stocks</b> {{to have a}} stated value, set {{by the board of}} {{directors}} of the corporation, which serves the same purpose as par value in setting the minimum legal capital that the corporation must have after paying any dividends or buying back its stock.|$|R

50|$|Allied Paper Mills was {{incorporated}} in Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA during 1921 when three local paper companies merged. These were the Monarch Paper Company in Kalamazoo, the King Paper Company in Kalamazoo and the Bardeen Paper Company in Otsego. The combined output of 10 paper machines and 34 coating machines immediately placed the Allied Paper Mills {{in the top}} producers of book paper in the nation. When operating at full speed and full capacity {{it was expected that}} between 1200 and 1800 people would be given employment. A. L. Pratt was selected as company President, and A. G. Gilman and George H. Gerpheide were the vice presidents. George B. Davis was the secretary and S. B. Monroe the treasurer. The new corporation was capitalized at 5,000,000 preferred shares and 5,000,000 shares of <b>no-par</b> value common <b>stock.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1925 the Allied Paper Mills {{employed}} 1500 {{people and}} had produced 2,725 railroad car loads {{of paper in}} that year. It was stated by vice-president Alex G. Gilman that the various divisions were in splendid physical condition. Improvements in 1924 included a new boiler house at the Bardeen Mill and rebuilding of paper machines in both the Bardeen and King Mills. The <b>no-par</b> <b>stock</b> was changed to a par value of $10 and 400,000 shares were issued in 1924.|$|E
