25|$|In the mid-1960s, {{rubberized}} asphalt {{was used for}} the first time, mixing crumb rubber from used tires with asphalt. While a potential use for tires that would otherwise fill landfills and present a fire hazard, {{rubberized asphalt}} has shown greater incidence of wear in freeze-thaw cycles in temperate zones due to non-homogeneous expansion and contraction with <b>non-rubber</b> <b>components.</b> The application of rubberized asphalt is more temperature-sensitive, and in many locations can only be applied at certain times of the year.|$|E
40|$|Natural {{rubber latex}} (NRL) from Hevea brasiliensis {{was used as}} a matrix to {{synthesize}} gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), leading to an organic-inorganic hybrid latex of NRL-supported AuNPs (AuNPs@NRL). The in situ and environmentally friendly preparation of AuNPs in an NRL matrix was developed by thermal treatment without using any other reducing agents or stabilizers because natural rubber particles and <b>non-rubber</b> <b>components</b> present in serum can serve as supporters for the synthesized AuNPs. As a result, the nanosized and well-dispersed AuNPs not only are decorated on the surface of natural rubber particles, but also {{can be found in the}} serum of NRL. The size of the AuNPs presented in NRL matrix can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of NRL. Furthermore, the flexible surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates made from the AuNPs@NRL through vacuum filtration presented good enhancement of the Raman probe molecule of 4 -mercaptopyridine and outstanding SERS reproducibility. The capability of synthesizing the bio-supported nanohybrid latex provides a novel green and simple approach for the fabrication of flexible and effective SERS substrates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In recent years, highly-dispersible silica {{has become}} the {{preferred}} alternative to carbon-black as reinforcing filler for low rolling-resistance tires. However, the application of this filler system is so far limited to passenger car tires, as their treads contain styrene butadiene rubber (SBR). In contrast to this, truck tires are mainly made from natural rubber (NR); this is the main application of the currently used 11 million tons of natural rubber. Unfortunately, the combination of NR with silica and a coupling agent remains a challenge. Natural rubber is a durable, natural resource, but has the disadvantage of containing a variety of <b>non-rubber</b> <b>components</b> such as proteins. An in-rubber study of the interaction of silica with proteins present in natural rubber shows that the latter compete with the coupling agent during the silanization reaction; the presence of proteins makes the silane less efficient for improving dispersion and filler-polymer coupling, and thus negatively influences the final properties of the rubber material. Furthermore, the protein content influences the rheological properties as well as filler-filler and filler-polymer interactions. Stress strain properties also vary with protein content, as do dynamic properties. With high amounts of proteins present in NR, the interactions between proteins and silica are able to disrupt the silica-silica network and improve silica dispersion. High amounts of proteins reduce the thermal sensitivity of the filler-polymer network formation. The effect of proteins is most pronounced when no silane is used; however, proteins {{are not able to}} replace a coupling agent. In order to achieve a good balance of properties, the presence of a coupling agent is essential...|$|E
