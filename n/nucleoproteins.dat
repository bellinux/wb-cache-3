25|$|Aberrant B cell receptor-mediated {{feedback}} – A {{feature of}} human autoimmune disease {{is that it}} is largely restricted to a small group of antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut agglutinin receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens leads to aberrant signals being fed back to parent B cells through membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B cell receptor (for antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, Toll-like receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and <b>nucleoproteins)</b> and PNAR. More indirect aberrant activation of B cells can also be envisaged with autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-cell-B-cell discordance this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells. Autoreactive B cells in spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both of the T cell help pathway and of the feedback signal through B cell receptor, thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell self-tolerance without necessarily requiring loss of T cell self-tolerance.|$|E

About 80 % of simian virus 40 replicating <b>nucleoprotein</b> complexes {{in various stages of}} replication were immunoprecipitated. In contrast, less than 21 % of mature <b>nucleoprotein</b> complexes were immunoprecipitated. Pulse-chase experiments showed that T antigen was lost from most of the <b>nucleoprotein</b> complexes concurrently with completion of DNA replication. T antigen induced by dl- 940, a mutant with a deletion in the region coding for small T antigen, was also associated with most of the replicating <b>nucleoprotein</b> complexes. Once bound with replicating <b>nucleoprotein</b> complexes at the permissive temperature, thermolabile T antigen induced by tsA 900 remained associated with the complexes during elongation of the replicating DNA chain at the restrictive temperature.

We also find that the recruitment of <b>nucleoprotein</b> to nascent ribonucleoprotein complexes during replication of full-length viral genes is mediated through nucleoprotein-nucleoprotein homo-oligomerization in a 'tail loop-first' orientation and is independent of RNA binding.

40|$|The {{detection}} of proteinaceous antigens generally relies on traditional immunoassays and, more recently, on immuno-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays and their derivatives, {{which do not}} take advantage of the intrinsic function or binding property of a protein. The RNA-binding <b>nucleoprotein</b> {{has been shown to be}} an excellent target for the development of various influenza A diagnostics due to its high antigenicity and the presence of large numbers in the virus.
