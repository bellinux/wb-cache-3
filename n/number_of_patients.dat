5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed that they lacked the resources to deal with large increases in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robert Roswell, a {{previous}} VA Undersecretary of Health and now Professor of Medicine at the University of Oklahoma, said that an appropriate measure of VHA performance was not patient wait times, which were largely outside {{the control of}} the staff, because VHA employees do not control the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> seeking care. A better measure of performance, would for example, measure the efficient use of VHA resources, such as the number of no-show appointments.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2002 F D I World Dental PressAim: To {{investigate}} time {{trends in}} practice activity. Design: Four cross-sectional surveys across a 15 year period. Setting: Australian private general practice. Participants: A {{random sample of}} dentists. Methods: Dentists were surveyed by mailed questionnaire in 1983, 1988, 1993 and 1998 (response rates 71 %- 75 %). Data were weighted to provide representative estimates for the age by sex distribution of private general practitioners in 1983, 1988, 1993 and 1998. Main Outcome Measures: Hours per year worked, patient visits per hour and patient visits per year. Results: The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> visits per year declined across the period, related to parallel decreases in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> visits per hour (ANOVA; P< 0. 05), while {{there was no significant}} difference during the period in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hours per year devoted to work. The interaction of dentist sex by time of survey indicated that while <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> visits per year had remained stable for female dentists, there was a trend for the higher <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> visits per year among male dentists at the beginning of the survey period to decline over time. Conclusions: Male dentists had higher levels of practice activity compared with female dentists, but a decline in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> visits per year reflected a convergence of male practice patterns towards that of female dentists.

5|$|A French edition, {{translated}} by M. L. Carion (or by Louise Swanton-Belloc? (1796–1881)), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris. By 1857, the novel had {{been translated into}} 20 languages, including two independent translations into Slovene just one year after its original publication, which started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers. Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and Amharic (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation). The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with sado-masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.|$|E
5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, the mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> being treated in hospice facilities {{on any given day}} was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E
5|$|In October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an Accident & Emergency {{consultant}} at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton criticised the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> visiting the department for minor ailments without first contacting their GP. Ryan attributed this phenomenon to patients viewing Holby City and American medical drama ER, and falsely perceiving hospitals as glamorous. A three-year Belgian research project, presented at a British Psychological Society meeting in September 2008, claimed that watching Holby City and similar medical dramas such as Casualty and ER had a subliminal influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, {{and those who}} watched more medical dramas {{were found to be}} up to 10% more fearful about their health, with females more affected than males. Dr Jan Van Mierlo of Hasselt University stated that further research was needed into the long-term impact of television.|$|E

5|$|The EMS {{command post}} {{was set up}} almost {{immediately}} following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination.

2500|$|Like all ALS providers, the {{fundamental}} prerequisite is current EMT-Basic certification. [...] Most instructors require {{at least one}} year of active experience at the EMT-Basic level. On average, students receive approximately 300-400 total hours of instruction. [...] This instruction is broken up into 175-225 classroom and practical laboratory hours, 50-75 clinical hours and 75-100 field internship hours. [...] At the end of the class, students must pass the state's practical skills and written exam to obtain certification. [...] However, program requirements to obtain AEMT-CC certification vary by the institution teaching the class. While some require a set <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> contacts rather than a set <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hours, others require tracking of individual performed skills (i.e., x <b>number</b> <b>of</b> IV sticks, x <b>number</b> <b>of</b> medication administrations), along with the tracking <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> populations (i.e., x <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pediatric <b>patients</b> treated, x <b>number</b> <b>of</b> adult <b>patients,</b> x <b>number</b> <b>of</b> geriatric <b>patients),</b> and call types (i.e., x <b>number</b> <b>of</b> OB/GYN <b>patients,</b> x <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Behavioral/Psychiatric, etc.), significantly increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> clinical and field hours needed to meet the requirements to be admitted to take the state exams {{at the end of the}} class.|$|R

25|$|The waiver, {{which can}} be granted after the {{completion}} of an eight-hour course, is required for outpatient treatment of opioid addiction with Subutex and Suboxone. Initially, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> each approved physician could treat was limited to ten. This was eventually modified to allow approved physicians to treat up to a hundred patients with buprenorphine for opioid addiction in an outpatient setting. This limit was recently increased by the Obama administration, raising the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> to which doctors can prescribe to 275. Still, due to this patient limit and the requisite eight-hour training course, many continuing patients can find it very difficult to get a prescription, despite the drug's effectiveness.|$|E
