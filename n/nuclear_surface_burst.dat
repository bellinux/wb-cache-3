Since TNT charges produce roughly double the airburst effect of nuclear weapons, it allowed testing {{the equivalent of a}} [...] <b>nuclear</b> weapon <b>surface</b> <b>burst.</b> It was a continuation of the technical co-operation (Canada, United States, Great Britain) series of tests sponsored jointly by the respective governments. Similar to previous tests, a large number of projects were carried out simultaneously due to the infrequent opportunity and cost of large explosives tests – the United States alone conducted 39 projects. The resulting airblast also allowed testing various targets at a range of overpressures to verify how structures resist effects of nuclear weapons. These included troop field shelters, fiberglass manholes, foxhole overhead covers, blast valves and electrical generators. Debris fracturing and transport were also tested as part of the effort to understand nuclear blast effects on Nike-X anti-ballistic missile sites. An additional goal of the test was to compare the blast with the previous Distant Plain Event 6 that used an equivalent but smaller [...] configuration in order to study scaling factors.|$|R

The occurrence of such a burst was inferred from light signals detected by two Vela bhangmeters −2 min before the TIROS-N event. We found the precipitation to be unusually large but not unique.

Although it may be argued that the segment of the arc sampled by the TIROS-N was intensified by a SNB, we find no evidence to support this thesis or to suggest that the observation was anything but the result of natural magnetospheric processes.|$|R

We wish to accurately extract and classify {{the shapes of}} nuclei from confocal microscopy images, which is a prerequisite to an accurate quantitative intranuclear (genotypic and phenotypic) and internuclear (tissue structure) analysis of tissue and cultured specimens. First, we study {{the use of a}} geometry-driven edge-preserving image smoothing mechanism before nuclear segmentation. We show how this filter outperforms other widely-used filters in that it provides higher edge fidelity. Then we apply the same filter, with a different initial condition, to smooth <b>nuclear</b> <b>surfaces</b> and obtain sub-pixel accuracy.

50|$|The main {{criticisms of}} nuclear bunker busters regard fallout and nuclear proliferation. The purpose of an earth-penetrating nuclear bunker buster {{is to reduce}} the {{required}} yield needed to ensure the destruction of the target by coupling the explosion to the ground, yielding a shock wave similar to an earthquake. For example, the United States retired the B-53 warhead, with a yield of nine megatons, because the B-61 Mod 11 could attack similar targets with much lower yield (400 kilotons), due to the latter's superior ground penetration. By burying itself into the ground before detonation, a much higher proportion of the explosion energy is transferred to seismic shock when compared to the <b>surface</b> <b>burst</b> produced from the B-53's laydown delivery. Moreover, the globally dispersed fallout of an underground B-61 Mod 11 would likely be less than that of a <b>surface</b> <b>burst</b> B-53.
