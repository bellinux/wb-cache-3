The original name for the piece was titled Romanian Folk Dances from Hungary (Magyarországi román népi táncok) but was later changed by Bartók when Romania annexed Transylvania in 1918-1920. It is <b>nowadays</b> <b>available</b> in the 1971 edition which is written with key signatures although Bartók rarely ever wrote key signatures.|$|E

It is <b>nowadays</b> <b>available</b> in many stores across Finland, but is held in {{the position}} of local delicacy and speciality of Tampere. Mustamakkara is at its best when bought and eaten fresh at market stalls, to which it is delivered hot in styrofoam boxes from the factories directly after baking. A typical practice of reheating the sausage is to just fry it in a pan.|$|E

As an opposite example, some scissors are made specifically for use in one hand, and will not cut properly if used in the other hand.

50|$|This kind of pastry {{has been}} known for at least 300 years in the regions of Franconia and Hohenlohe (northeast of Baden-Württemberg) where it is very popular. Served only on special {{occasions}} such as weddings in the past; they are <b>nowadays</b> <b>available</b> throughout the year and can be found around Rothenburg ob der Tauber in bakeries, pastry shops, and cafes. In the town itself there are even companies that specialize in the pastry, constantly coming out with new variations. Beside the classical ones dusted with confectioner's sugar, there are recipes glazed with chocolate and nuts or filled with marzipan. As the pastry is considered the signature dish of the town, it is a very common souvenir.|$|E
5000|$|Pipek and Mezey {{originally}} used Mulliken charges, {{which are}} mathematically ill defined. Recently, Pipek-Mezey style schemes {{based on a}} variety of mathematically well-defined partial charge estimates have been discussed. Some notable choices are Voronoi charges, Becke charges, Hirshfeld or Stockholder charges, intrinsic atomic orbital charges, Bader charges, or [...] "fuzzy atom" [...] charges. Rather surprisingly, despite of the wide variation in the (total) partial charges reproduced by the different estimates, analysis of the resulting Pipek-Mezey orbitals has shown that the localized orbitals are rather insensitive to the partial charge estimation scheme used in the localization process. However, due to the ill-defined mathematical nature of Mulliken charges (and Löwdin charges, which have also been used in some works), as better alternatives are <b>nowadays</b> <b>available</b> it is advisable to use them in favor of the original version.|$|E

30|$|Introduction: Severe {{inflammatory}} conditions, as sepsis {{and acute}} respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are common among critically ill patients. Despite healthcare improvement, mortality still remains high and few therapies are <b>nowadays</b> <b>available.</b> Attenuating inflammation through direct removal of inflammatory mediators from circulation appears to be intuitively.

40|$|Flood {{defense is}} a problem of vital importance, for which {{knowledge}} and advanced scientifi c tools play a paramount important role in the strain of coping with fl ooding problems. In this context, fl ood model-ing represents the basis for effective fl ood mitigation measures. By using models, an attempt is made to replace trial-and-error-based strategies, as practiced in the past, with more physically based measures of fl ood management and control. Mathematical models are the best tools, <b>nowadays</b> <b>available,</b> for the design of effi cient fl ood protection strategies and excellent supporters of decision-makers. With refer-ence to these issues, the paper provides a complete application of the procedures, <b>nowadays</b> <b>available,</b> for risk assessment, from catchment to a very local scale, on the Lambro River in Milano, Italy. It is shown that social and political constraints may force risk managers to fi nd different solutions to solve the problems they have to face, which may be related to non-hydraulic issues...|$|E
