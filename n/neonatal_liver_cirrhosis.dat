Liver biopsy showed the absence of iron overload but strong immunostaining of hepatocytes for the C 5 b- 9 complex, the terminal complement cascade neoantigen occurring specifically during complement activation by the immunoglobulin G-mediated classic pathway, which established the alloimmune nature of the hepatocyte injury. The infant survived with no specific therapy, and follow-up until 36 months showed progressive normalization of all liver parameters.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{liver disease}} is {{responsible}} for over 1. 4 million deaths annually. In the western world this disease is among the top ten of disease-related causes of death. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2002 <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and primary <b>liver</b> cancer caused 783, 000 and 619, 000 deaths, respectively. Taken together, these conditions represented approximately one of every forty deaths (2. 5 %) worldwide.

40|$|<b>Liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> {{mortality}} is {{an indicator of}} harms associated {{with high levels of}} alcohol consumption. There is good evidence that changes in political and economic systems can lead to changing patterns of <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> mortality. Socioeconomic inequalities in <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> mortality have been periodically reported but there are few studies of changes in socioeconomic inequalities in <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> mortality over time. This paper examines changes in socioeconomic inequalities in <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> mortality in Australia for the period 1981 - 2002. Age standardised, <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> mortality rates were calculated for occupational groupings for Australia 1981 - 2002. Occupations were grouped into non-manual and manual categories, and there was imputation for missing data. Despite decreasing overall <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> mortality rates over time, <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> mortality continues to account for about 3 % of all deaths. Manual workers have consistently experienced <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> mortality rates which are twice or more the rate experienced by non-manual workers. These inequalities appear to have increased in recent years and currently appear to be at historic highs (manual workers have mortality rates of about 2. 5 times those of non-manual workers). Increasing socioeconomic inequalities in <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> mortality in Australia suggest that lower SES groups have, over time, increased their level of harmful alcohol consumption relative to middle and higher SES groups.

Patients and Methods Eleven patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and haemorrhoidal disease were included in this study. The blood flow in the haemorrhoids was identified using three-dimensional power Doppler angiography (3 D-PDA). All patients performed ALTA sclerotherapy. Results All patients’ symptoms (prolapse and/or bleeding) improved. However, two cases re-prolapsed during five years. Although two patients experienced slight bleeding after treatment and three patients experienced retention of ascites, there were no serious complications. 3 D-PDA showed higher or lower vascularization in haemorrhoidal tissue in patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> The prevalence of anorectal varices and haemorrhoids in cirrhotic patients had no association to Child-Pugh’s grading.

The aim of the presented study was to assess the usefulness of MMP- 2, MMP- 8 and MMP- 9 as diagnostic markers of alcoholic liver disease. Sixty patients with alcoholic <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> were randomly enrolled during hospitalization in departments of hospitals from the Lublin Region in eastern Poland. The stage of cirrhosis was estimated according to Child-Turcotte-Pugh criteria (Child-Pugh score) as P- Ch A, P-Ch B, P-Ch C. The control group consisted of 10 healthy persons without liver disease, who did not drink alcohol. Additionally, a group of alcoholics without <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> was included in the study. Blood sample were obtained, and after centrifuge, serum was collected for further analysis.

The chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups, and the t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between groups. ResultsThere were 13 menopausal women (43. 33 %) in the control group and 23 (76. 67 %) in the <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> group, and the <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> group had a significantly higher proportion of menopausal women than the control group (χ 2 = 6. 944, P= 0. 008). Compared with the control group, the <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> group had a significantly lower level of E 2 (t= 4. 489, P＜ 0  01) and significantly higher levels of FSH and T (t=- 5  010 and - 4. 082, both P＜ 0  01). ConclusionThere are differences in the levels of some sex hormones between female patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and healthy women, and female patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> have different characteristics of the changes in sex hormone levels from male counterparts, which {{may be related to the}} development and progression of chronic liver diseases. This suggests that sex hormone therapy for patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> needs further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasound {{examination}} {{was performed}} in 80 hemodialysis (HD) patients with chronic hepatitis C {{in order to determine}} the ultrasound predictors of compensated <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> The ultrasound score (US) was calculated from the morphological parameters (liver size, morphology, surface, echogenicity and spleen volume) and the hemodynamic parameters (portal vein diameter and portal vein mean flow velocity). The US ranged from 0 to 200, with a cut-off value of 66, for discrimination between absence and presence of <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> A logistic regression model with stepwise variable selection was used to determine predictors of the progression of liver disease. According to the calculated US, patients were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 37 (46. 3 %) patients with US greater than 66, indicating the presence of compensated <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> The second group included 43 (53. 7 %) patients without <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis,</b> with US equal to or less than 66. The value of liver morphology was significantly higher, but the portal vein flow velocity was significantly lower in patients with compensated <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> compared with those without <b>cirrhosis.</b> Furthermore, rounded <b>liver</b> surfaces and increased liver echogenicity were significantly more frequent in patients with compensated <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> compared with the non-compensated group. Logistic regression model with stepwise discriminant analysis identified liver morphology, liver echogenicity and portal vein mean flow velocity as independent ultrasound predictors of compensated <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> in HD patients with chronic hepatitis C. Ultrasound examination could be used for non-invasive diagnosis of compensated <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis,</b> with accurate estimation of the disease severity in HD patients with chronic hepatitis C...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: T 1 -weighted MR images show {{high signal}} {{intensity}} in the pallidum of many patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate quantitative changes in MR signals in patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> by using the magnetization transfer technique. METHODS: Magnetization transfer ratios were measured in seven different regions of the brain in 37 patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and in 37 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The magnetization transfer ratios in patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> were significantly lower than those in control subjects in the globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, corona radiata, and subcortical white matter. CONCLUSION: Abnormal magnetization transfer ratios may be found in otherwise normal-appearing cerebral regions. T 1 -weighted MR images show high signal intensity in the pallidum of many patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> (1 – 4). It was recently suggested that this abnor-mality may be related to an accumulation of man...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{remains a}} major problem throughout the world, especially in diagnostic and therapeutic management. Previous studies stated that alpha- 1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) was a potensial biomarker in diagnostic of HCC. This study assessed the best cut-off value of AAG as a diagnostic biomarker of HCC with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> Method: This was a cross-sectional, diagnostic study, conducted from January to October 2013 in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. The subjects were HCC with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> patients and as control were <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> patients. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG), abdominal 3 phase contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan, and liver biopsy, if necessary, were done. All patients were having AAG examination, then the result was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and assessment of some cut-off values was done. Results: There were 25 HCC with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> patients and 37 <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> patients as control included in this study. HCC with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> patients were 92 % male and 8 % were female, over 50 years old (72 %). HBV infection {{was the most common}} etiology and most of the patients had multiple nodules in the liver (80 %). ROC curve showed the area under the curve (AUC) was 81. 44 %. Conclusion: The best cut-off value of AAG to be aware of HCC with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> was 61 mg/dL and as a diagnostic was 136 mg/dL...|$|R
40|$|Background & Aims: Alterations of {{vascular}} endothelium {{play an important}} role in the development of cardiovascular diseases, the occurrence of <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and the progression of its complications. Little is known about the impact of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene mutations on the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> The aim of the study was to investigate the possible association of the T 894 G gene polymorphism of eNOS with biochemical, cytokine blood indices, structural and functional parameters of heart in patients with nonviral <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> Methods: Investigation of eNOS gene polymorphism (T 894 G) was performed in 50 patients with nonviral <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and in 10 healthy volunteers. Furthermore, biochemical blood analysis, estimations of tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β 1, interleukin- 4, atrial natriuretic propeptide (proANP) plasma levels, echocardiographic studies were performed. Results: It was established that the presence of T-allele of eNOS gene in patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> was associated with increased activity of aspartate aminotransferase, higher plasma content of proANP, larger left atrium diameter and increased left ventricular myocardium mass. In males with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis,</b> T-allele was also associated with increased left ventricular myocardium mass index compared with patients with GG-genotype. Conclusion: The presence of T-allele of eNOS gene in patients with nonviral <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> is associated with occurrence of more severe cardiovascular alterations...|$|R
40|$|The role of trace {{elements}} in the pathogenesis of <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and its complications is still not clearly understood. Serum concentrations of zinc, copper, manganese and magnesium were determined in 105 patients with alcoholic <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and 50 healthy subjects by means of plasma sequential spectrophotometer. Serum concentrations of zinc were significantly lower (median 0. 82 vs. 11. 22 micromol/L, p < 0. 001) in patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> in comparison to controls. Serum concentrations of copper were significantly higher in patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> (median 21. 56 vs. 13. 09 micromol/L, p < 0. 001) as well as manganese (2. 50 vs. 0. 02 micromol/L, p < 0. 001). The concentration of magnesium was not significantly different between patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis</b> and controls (0. 94 vs. 0. 88 mmol/L, p = 0. 132). There were no differences in the concentrations of zinc, copper, manganese and magnesium {{between male and female}} patients with <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> Only manganese concentration was significantly different between Child-Pugh groups (p = 0. 036). Zinc concentration was significantly lower in patients with hepatic encephalopathy in comparison to cirrhotic patients without encephalopathy (0. 54 vs. 0. 96 micromol/L, p = 0. 002). The correction of {{trace elements}} concentrations might have a beneficial effect on complications and maybe progression of <b>liver</b> <b>cirrhosis.</b> It would be recommendable to provide analysis of trace elements as a routine...|$|R
