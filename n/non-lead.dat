As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law.

5|$|Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations {{occurred}} due {{to contact}} with golden eagles, lead poisoning, {{and other factors}} such as power line collisions. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors {{have been trained to}} avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased. Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste is a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices; lead waste is not as much of a problem for other avian scavengers such as the turkey vulture and common raven. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use <b>non-lead</b> bullets when hunting in the condor's range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California condor. There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the other states in which the condor currently resides.|$|E

While the note-tracking has generally been improved to avoid [...] "walls of notes"long sections of fast-moving notes requiring significant skill to surpassthese patterns are significantly different from their previous incarnation and may take some getting used to.

In contrast, Abbie Heppe of G4 TV found the recreation of the note tracking to have [...] "varying degrees of success", noting that while some of the guitar solos are more manageable, there were questionable sections in other songs arising from the nature of Star Power phrases when it was changed in Guitar Hero III. Gerstmann said that the difficulty of the <b>non-lead</b> guitar portions of the game was not as high as that of the lead guitar, primarily due to these songs' having been selected originally for being played by guitar controllers and not by a full band. Heppe suggests that some of these problems {{may be due to the}} farming out of the series to a different developer with no previous experience in the series. However, Bramwell was careful to note that Beenox Studios' effort on the game was strong, particularly with following the Guitar Hero: Metallica model, and their effort should not be dismissed due to how Activision chose to release the title.|$|E

40|$|We test Shattock’s legacy {{reputation}} {{thesis that}} <b>non-leading</b> {{universities in the}} UK face insuperable resource barriers to entering the leading group. Employing regression analysis, we examine whether prioritizing research performance is a viable strategy for <b>non-leading</b> UK universities aiming to improve their organizational effectiveness. The dependent variable, organizational effectiveness, {{is measured by the}} annual Guardian rankings of universities. The main independent variable, research performance, is measured using “research power” (‘RP’). RP is derived from the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF). For 2008 - 14 we find that changes in research performance impacted university rankings. However, we also find that changes to the rankings are largely confined to <b>non-leading</b> universities and have not led to these institutions breaking into the group of leading universities. Therefore, Shattock’s thesis is supported. Future research should use a longer time-span. It should investigate in more detail the mechanisms involved in the research performance-organizational effectiveness relationship. Failing to maintain research performance can have significant negative consequences for the rankings of <b>non-leading</b> universities.

40|$|We study power {{corrections}} to {{a recently}} introduced family of event shapes, {{the class of}} angularities, within the formalism of dressed gluon exponentiation (DGE). We find that the universal scaling rule for the leading power corrections deduced from resummation also holds when taking renormalon enhancements into account. The scaling is due to boost invariance of eikonal dynamics in the two-jet limit, which we recover {{in the context of}} DGE. Furthermore, dressed gluon exponentiation provides an ansatz for <b>non-leading</b> power corrections that violate the scaling. These <b>non-leading</b> corrections are further suppressed by non-integer powers of the hard scale. Comment: 24 page...|$|R

We used 6 years prospective data from the national HMV Register covering the entire Swedish HMV patient population (more than 1000 patients). The treatment prevalence of HMV in Sweden, January 1, 1996 was 6. 2 / 100, 000 and January 1, 2002 10. 5 / 100, 000 with a steady increase each year in all counties. The differences between leading and <b>non-leading</b> counties showed a tendency to diminish due to an increasing prescription rate in the <b>non-leading</b> counties. During the 6 years, the proportion of Pickwickian patients increased significantly in the country as a whole, but remained considerably and significantly higher in the leading counties, in spite of similar and temporally stable prescription criteria. Even if the evident dissimilarities in treatment prevalence may be levelling out, it will most probably do so at a level as high as or higher than today's top level of more than 20 / 100, 000 since we found that HMV therapy was well founded also in the counties with the highest prescription rates and that the prescription rate of the <b>non-leading</b> counties was approaching the level of the leading counties...|$|R
