5|$|<b>Nicol</b> David {{added another}} feather to her cap, {{becoming}} the first player – male or female – to win the US Open {{for the third straight}} year. The 31-year-old <b>Nicol,</b> a seven-time world champion and five-time British Open winner, exacted sweet revenge over Egyptian teenager Nour El Sherbini to win the US$115,000 (RM374,000) tournament in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|John Hudson {{stars as}} Eric, Jenni's new husband. Jenni {{is played by}} Peggy Webber. In order to get Webber {{interested}} in starring in the film, <b>Nicol</b> {{told her that he}} was planning to do a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock film Rebecca and brought a copy of the screenplay to her house. Other cast members include Russ Conway as Reverend Snow and Toni Johnson as Snow's wife. <b>Nicol</b> also stars as Mickey, the gardener.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nicol</b> {{was born}} on October 17, 1870 in Barry, Illinois. His father, Matthew <b>Nicol,</b> immigrated to the United States from Scotland in 1852, while his mother, Eliza, was born in America. As a youngster, he played {{baseball}} for a semi-professional club in nearby Mount Sterling. There, he rose to fame as a left-handed pitcher—probably due to rarity and valuableness of southpaws—and eventually got {{the opportunity to play}} in the major leagues before he turned twenty.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nicols</b> {{started by}} telling his {{close friends and}} local school officials. His friends were shocked, but supportive, and the Cooperstown school board volunteered to help <b>Nicols</b> tell the world. The <b>Nicols</b> family, {{reassured}} by the reaction so far, {{went on to the}} next step: a press conference in which <b>Nicols</b> would tell the public.|$|R

5|$|After his {{professional}} baseball career ended, <b>Nicol</b> moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1896, he married his wife Lilian. Together, {{they had one}} son, George Jr., {{who was born in}} 1908. In order to support his new family, he became a machinist. During this time, he continued to play baseball—albeit amateur baseball—with the Milwaukee City League.|$|E
50|$|By 1995, <b>Nicols</b> had {{established}} the Henry <b>Nicols</b> Foundation, {{a nonprofit organization}} to continue educating people about AIDS and to support other people with AIDS. He also continued traveling {{around the country to}} give educational talks.|$|R
500|$|The Feminist Improvising Group, and its successor, The European Women's Improvising Group, {{spawned a}} number of women-only improvising groups and events. In 1980 Contradictions was formed by Maggie <b>Nicols,</b> who {{modelled}} it on FIG. The founding members included <b>Nicols,</b> Jackie Lansley and Sylvia Hallett, with Irène Schweizer and Joëlle Léandre participating in their first concert. Contradictions {{went on to become}} a women's workshop run by <b>Nicols</b> in which [...] "anyone could participate". Schweizer was one of the organisers of the Canaille festivals that staged the first International Women's Jazz Festival for Improvised Music in 1986 in Frankfurt. In the early 1990s, <b>Nicols,</b> Schweizer and Léandre formed the [...] "highly theatrical and often satirical" [...] improvising trio, Les Diaboliques, who released three albums between 1994 and 1998.|$|R

5|$|On {{the night}} of August 3, 1924, <b>Nicol</b> died in his sleep {{at the age of}} 53. His death was treated as suspicious, as a {{post-mortem}} examination found him to have four broken ribs that led to his death. He was interred at the Union Cemetery in Milwaukee.|$|E
5|$|The adverse {{conditions}} {{faced by the}} keepers resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, but the remote location suited some veterans. Archibald McEachern was assistant keeper for 14 years from 1870–84 and John <b>Nicol</b> was principal from 1890–1903. The latter {{was involved in a}} dramatic rescue when the liner Labrador en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Liverpool ran aground on the nearby Mackenzie's Rock in 1899. The lifeboats were manned and two made it to Mull, but one with eighteen passengers reached the lighthouse where they were looked after {{for two and a half}} days before they could be taken to the mainland. No lives were lost and <b>Nicol</b> and his two assistants were commended by the NLB for their efforts.|$|E

5000|$|After <b>Nicols</b> {{publicly}} {{announced that}} he had AIDS, the writer Michael Ryan decided to make a documentary about Nicols's life. POZ Magazine quoted Ryan as saying, [...] "I had done magazine articles on AIDS and had friends who had died. Part of me looked at Henry and said this is propaganda, a way to tell middle America about AIDS." [...] Ryan spent almost three years with the <b>Nicols</b> family recording their daily lives. This project turned into the 1993 HBO documentary Eagle Scout: The Story of Henry <b>Nicols.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Nicol</b> {{attended}} Chantry High School but {{had left}} home at 16 {{to live in}} a hostel, working as a prostitute to fund her addiction to heroin and cocaine. She had originally worked in massage parlours, but was asked to leave on suspicion that she was using drugs. Her mother was unaware she was a prostitute, and thought she had been working in a bar or a hairdresser's.|$|E
5|$|The Screaming Skulls opening {{disclaimer}} that a free burial {{would be}} provided to anybody who died of fright while watching the film {{was inspired by a}} gimmick that had been used by William Castle in his film Macabre (1958), in which he offered every viewer who bought a ticket life insurance in case they died watching the film. Unlike Castle, <b>Nicol</b> did not actually contact an insurance company.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} senior architects, {{there was a}} team of Assistant Architects who were {{actually}} responsible {{for many of the}} cemetery and memorial designs. These architects were younger, and many of them had served in the war. The Assistant Architects were: George Esselmont Gordon Leith, Wilfred Clement Von Berg, Charles Henry Holden (who in 1920 became a Principal Architect), William Harrison Cowlishaw, William Bryce Binnie, George Hartley Goldsmith, Frank Higginson, Arthur James Scott Hutton, Noel Ackroyd Rew, and John Reginald Truelove. Other architects that worked for the Commission, or won competitions for the Commission memorials, included George Salway <b>Nicol,</b> Harold Chalton Bradshaw, Verner Owen Rees, Gordon H.

5|$|Datuk <b>Nicol</b> Ann David (born 26 August 1983) is a Malaysian female {{professional}} squash player, currently ranked {{world number}} 6. Beginning in August 2006, David {{was the world}} number one for a record-breaking 108 consecutive months, finally ceding the ranking in September 2015 to Raneem El Weleily. She has won the World Open title a record 8 times in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014, {{as well as the}} British Open title in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2012 and 2014. In July 2016, she reached her 151st successive month in the top 10, breaking the record in both men's and women's categories. She surpassed Peter Nicol's previous records of 150 months.|$|E
5|$|Extra time {{provided}} little action; {{the only}} player that looked like changing the scoreline was Conti, whose runs at Neal caused the Liverpool defender problems. Despite this, the score remained the same through the 30 minutes of extra time and the match went to a penalty-shoot-out. Liverpool {{were the first to}} take a penalty, but <b>Nicol</b> put his shot over the crossbar. Graziani stepped up to take Roma's first penalty, but Roma captain Agostino Di Bartolomei took the ball from him and took the penalty instead, scoring to give Roma the lead. Liverpool's next penalty was taken by their regular penalty taker Neal who scored to level the shoot-out. Conti took the next penalty for Roma, but like <b>Nicol</b> he put his shot over the crossbar. Souness and Ubaldo Righetti converted their respective penalties to make the scoreline2–2. Rush scored Liverpool's next penalty to make the score 3–2. Graziani stepped up again to take Roma's fourth penalty. While he was placing the ball on the penalty spot, Liverpool goalkeeper Grobbelaar was wobbling his legs in the Liverpool goal, hoping to distract Graziani. The tactic appeared to have worked as Graziani placed his penalty over the crossbar. Alan Kennedy was the next player to take a penalty and if he scored Liverpool would win the match. Kennedy scored the penalty sending Tancredi the wrong way. Liverpool won the shoot-out 4–2, thereby winning their fourth European Cup.|$|E
5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within <b>Nicol</b> Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Paul Rudnick's comedy I Hate Hamlet, {{performed}} at the Walter Kerr Theatre, was set in Barrymore's former apartment. He returns after a séance, dressed in his Hamlet costume. <b>Nicol</b> Williamson played the Barrymore role. Three years later, a London production, Jack: A Night on the Town with John Barrymore, ran for 60 performances at the Criterion Theatre, and Williamson again played the lead. Barrymore, a two-person play by William Luce, premiered in 1996 and depicts Barrymore {{shortly before his death}} in 1942 as he is rehearsing a revival of his Richard III. Christopher Plummer played the title role. A film version was released in 2012, with Plummer again taking the main role.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{tried to}} find a way back into the match. With 16 minutes left, Whelan was brought down in the Juventus penalty area by Massimo Bonini, but the referee decided {{that it was not a}} foul. Liverpool created more chances near the end of the match; Tacconi saved a shot from Whelan. Wark and Steve <b>Nicol</b> saw headers go wide of the Juventus goal. No further goals were scored and at {{full-time}} the score was 1–0 to Juventus, who had won their first European Cup and became the first club to win all three seasonal UEFA competitions.|$|E
