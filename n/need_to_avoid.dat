5|$|The Germans {{refrained from}} {{attempts}} {{to recapture the}} lost ground at Lens, due {{to the demands of}} defensive operations of the Third Battle of Ypres and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the diversion of forces from the main effort. The Canadian attack prevented the Germans from transferring five divisions in the Lens area to Flanders.|$|E
5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach2+ speeds; {{its maximum}} speed is Mach1.25 (about 950mph or 1,530km/h at altitude), but its {{low-level}} speed increased to Mach0.92 (700mph, 1,130km/h). The {{speed of the}} current version of the aircraft is limited by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses serpentine air intake ducts (see S-duct) and fixed intake ramps, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.|$|E

5|$|To the LCL, {{this was}} a {{dangerous}} situation, and seeing a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> it, they compromised: their position abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of the Legislative Council. When Dunstan put forward bills to reform it, the LCL relented, and Eastick convinced the LCL councillors to let them pass, conditional on amendments to the legislation. These were a minor change to the particular proportional system used to elect the councillors, and that it remained non compulsory {{to vote in the}} council. The new council would eventually have 22 members, with half elected each election from a multi-member constituency covering the entirety of the state. Hall attacked the LCL for its sudden change in stance on reform, and managed to see the first LM policy become law with the lowering of the council suffrage age to 18.|$|E
5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} can use both regular and special attacks. The latter use up Special Attack Stars; the player starts {{the game with}} three, and can gain more {{throughout}} the game, which carry over between areas. The types of attacks and stats such as attack power and agility differ depending on the character: Jack Frost's standard attack is throwing snowballs, Jack Lantern's is shooting fire balls, while Jack Skelton uses his knife. Their special attacks are, respectively, freezing all enemies for a few seconds; dealing {{a large amount of}} damage to all enemies; and defeating all enemies that are visible on the screen. As the player explores the floors, they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being attacked by enemies or falling into traps: each time this happens, the remaining time limit decreases by five seconds. If the timer reaches zero, the player reaches a game over state, although they are given the option to restart {{from the beginning of the}} current area.|$|E

25|$|In December 1991, the Quadripartite Agreement was {{established}} among Brazil, Argentina, the ABACC and the IAEA.

25|$|During {{the period}} in which Sahagún {{conducted}} his research, the conquering Spaniards were greatly outnumbered by the conquered Aztecs, and were concerned about the threat of a native uprising.

25|$|As {{butter is}} {{essentially}} just the milk fat, it contains only traces of lactose, so moderate consumption of butter {{is not a}} problem for lactose intolerant people.

25|$|In 1985, the Court {{once again}} heard a {{securities}} dispute where arbitrability {{was the central}} question. In Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v.

25|$|On 22 January 2009, the BBC {{declined}} {{a request}} from the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to screen an aid appeal intended {{to raise money to}} aid the relief effort following then recent hostilities in the Gaza Strip.

25|$|Actin can spontaneously {{acquire a}} large part of its {{tertiary}} structure. However, the way it acquires its fully functional form from its newly synthesized native form is special and almost unique in protein chemistry. The reason for this special route could be the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the presence of incorrectly folded actin monomers, which could be toxic as they can act as inefficient polymerization terminators. Nevertheless, it is key to establishing the stability of the cytoskeleton, and additionally, it is an essential process for coordinating the cell cycle.|$|E
