30|$|These {{observed}} {{changes in}} absorption {{are associated with}} excitation of the SnO 2 NWs by photons whose energy {{is larger than the}} bandgap energy which results in the generation of <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>carriers.</b> These <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>carriers</b> will distribute themselves along energy states that are normally unoccupied under equilibrium conditions. The occupation of states (referred to as state filling) following an ultrafast laser pulse will appear as a reduction in the absorption at the probing energy states. Clearly the observed recovery of this negative absorption change will be a direct measure of the time required by the photogenerated carriers {{to move out of the}} occupied states. Furthermore, a positive change in the induced absorption is also observed in the transient absorption measurements. This phenomenon is mainly due to secondary excitation of the photo-generated carriers by the probing photons from their initial states to higher energy states. This “free-carrier absorption” depends on the number of carriers present at the initial states and the coupling coefficient between the two energy bands. The temporal profile of this positive induced absorption is again a direct measure of the presence of the photo-generated carrier at the probing energy states.|$|E

30|$|Typical {{regimes of}} Gunn diode {{operation}} {{are characterized by}} highly inhomogeneous spatial-temporal distributions of <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>carriers</b> and fields. Charge excitations (domains or accumulation layers) propagate from the cathode through the active region of the specimen and generate current or voltage pulses when they are discharged at the anode, or in some cases, they may be transformed into the stationary anodic domains [1, 7, 8]. It {{is well known that}} in many cases, the drift-diffusion (DD) model gives a very good and correct semi-quantitative description of various Gunn diode regimes [9]. The key physical feature of DD models is the instantaneous dependence of all kinetic coefficients which describe carrier transport (mobility, diffusion coefficient, etc.) on the local electric field or the gradient of quasi-Fermi potential. The hot-electron effects are principally absent from the DD models. The carrier mean energy is solely determined by the lattice temperature and does not depend on the electric field, although the kinetic coefficients are in general taken as field-dependent.|$|E
