5|$|With so {{many people}} involved, {{security}} was a difficult task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the Manhattan Project's security issues. By 1943, {{it was clear that}} the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. The most successful Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs of the British Mission. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' <b>nuclear</b> <b>cooperation</b> with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades.|$|E

The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.|$|E

40|$|This paper elaborates on {{possible}} policy changes in nuclear armament and nuclear energy fields {{under the new}} BJP government, and their implications for Japan-India civil <b>nuclear</b> energy <b>cooperation</b> negotiation. Essentially, the scope of possible civil <b>nuclear</b> energy <b>cooperation</b> between Japan and India may be limited; their cooperation will probably not exceed the level that the U. S. has agreed to because of Japan's strict position on nuclear non-proliferation. Even so, whether or not civil <b>nuclear</b> energy <b>cooperation</b> between Japan and India can be realized primarily depends on the will and attitude of the new BJP government regarding the issues of nuclear armaments and nuclear energy, especially the new government's treatment of the 2010 Civil Nuclear Liability Act...|$|R

25|$|In general, India's {{strategy}} is {{the encouragement of}} the development of renewable sources of energy by the use of incentives by the federal and state governments.

25|$|Brazil and Argentina’s {{position}} on the global non-proliferation regime was quite similar. From {{the second half of}} the 1960s onward, both countries understood they should jointly resist external pressure applied to their respective nuclear programs. This common understanding was a major source for bilateral <b>nuclear</b> <b>cooperation</b> and helped dilute any security dilemma dynamics between the two countries.|$|E

25|$|In December 2006, the US Congress {{passed the}} {{historic}} Henry J.

US policy had been opposed to <b>nuclear</b> <b>cooperation</b> with India in prior years because India had developed nuclear weapons against international conventions, and had never signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NNPT).

25|$|In 1987–88, Argentina's National Atomic Energy Commission {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Iran to help in converting the reactor from highly enriched uranium fuel to 19.75% low-enriched uranium, and to supply the low-enriched uranium to Iran. According to a report by the Argentine justice in 2006, during the late 1980s and early 1990s the US pressured Argentina to terminate its <b>nuclear</b> <b>cooperation</b> with Iran, and from early 1992 to 1994 negotiations between Argentina and Iran took place with the aim of re-establishing the three agreements made in 1987–88. Some have linked attacks such as the 1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the AMIA bombing as part of an Iranian campaign to pressure Argentina into honoring the agreements. The uranium was delivered in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Iraq had {{established}} a nuclear program sometime in the 1960s, and in the mid-1970s looked to expand it through the acquisition of a nuclear reactor. After failing to convince the French Government to sell them a gas cooled graphite moderated plutonium-producing reactor and reprocessing plant, and likewise failing to convince the Italian government to sell them a Cirene reactor, the Iraqi government convinced the French government to sell them an Osiris-class research reactor. The purchase also included a smaller accompanying Isis-type reactor, the sale of 72 kilograms of 93% enriched uranium and the training of personnel. The total cost has been given as $300 million.
