It was succeeded by the memorable ministry of the Coalition, in which Fox and Lord North divided the real power under the <b>nominal</b> <b>lead</b> of the Duke of Portland. Members saw Lord North squeezed up on the Treasury bench between two men who had a year before been daily menacing him with the axe and the block; and it was not North whom they blamed, but Burke and Fox. Burke had returned to the Pay-Office. His first act there was unfortunate. He restored to their position two clerks who had been suspended for malversation, and against whom proceedings were then pending. When attacked for this in the House, he showed an irritation which would have carried him to gross lengths, if Fox and Sheridan had not by main force pulled him down into his seat by the tails of his coat. The restoration of the clerks was an indefensible error of judgment, and its indiscretion was heightened by the kind of defence which Burke tried to set up. When we wonder at Burke's exclusion from great offices, this case of Powell and Bembridge should not be forgotten.|$|E

Using a large general-population sample, we estimate a utility-theoretic model of consumer preferences across risk reduction programs targeted at {{a wide variety}} of major health threats with differing illness profiles. Individuals’ demands for programs targeting a particular illness are higher when there is a history of that illness and when subjective risks are higher. A history of other illnesses and greater other-illness subjective risks decrease demand.

40|$|This paper explores empirically the {{way that}} demand for health-enhancing and life-extending {{programs}} varies over the life-cycle for individuals. We test the hypothesis that, at any given current age, an individual’s schedule of marginal utility for future risk reductions rises on average with {{the age at which}} the future adverse health status would be experienced. However, as individuals age, we also hypothesize that there is a systematic downward shift in these schedules of marginal utility for risk reductions at future ages. Using data from a representative national sample of US households, we estimate the net effect of these two offsetting age effects for various risk-reducing policies. We identify the systematic age-varying determinants that explain why demand for some programs varies significantly with age, while demand for other programs does not. 1 Senior authorship is not assigned. <b>Nominal</b> <b>lead</b> authorship will rotate though the series of papers associated with this project...|$|E

These results are comparable to the deviations observed in the measurements of μ and thickness determined in the disk experiments. Results from the simulations suggest that 33 % more scatter and penetration occurs in the collimator {{as a result of the}} reduced attenuation properties, compared to “pure” 100 % density tungsten. Equally, the SLM collimator exhibits 17 % less scatter and penetration that the <b>nominal</b> <b>lead</b> collimator.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the permeability of protein-free myelin lipid liposomes to inorganic lead by using the fluorescent probes fura- 2, oxonol V, pyranine, and carboxyfluorescein. Inorganic lead readily crossed the lipid bilayer, as defected with fura- 2, to an extent that depended on the external pH and the total <b>nominal</b> <b>lead</b> concentration in the assay medium. Lead entry generated an internally positive transmembrane potential, which could be detected by oxonol V fluorescence quenching, and dissipated a transmembrane pH gradient by alkalinization of the intravesicular space, as measured with pyranine. These results cannot be explained by lead-mediated nonspecific damage to membrane lipids, based on the following results: 1) lead exposure did not increase carboxyfluorescein leakage from liposomes, 2) it did not increase the permeability of the lipid bilayer to glucose or KCl, 3) it did not generate peroxidation products in contact with myelin lipids, and 4) it did not induce chemical hydrolysis or modification of any myelin lipid class. We conclude that the principal molecular mechanism of lead permeation through a pure lipid bilayer is the passive diffusion of Pb(OH) +. We discuss the toxicological relevance of these findings for cells in general and for myelin in particular and suggest that this mechanism might contribute significantly to the total lead entry into the cells.

40|$|Protective aprons in imaging departments: {{manufacturer}} stated lead equivalence values require validation Abstract The {{composition of}} pro-tective aprons worn by X-ray per-sonnel to shield against secondary radiation is changing. Lead is {{being replaced by}} either lead-free or com-posite (lead with other high atomic numbered elements) materials. These newer aprons are categorised by manufacturers in terms of lead equivalent values, but {{it is unclear how}} these stated values compare with actual lead equivalent values. In this work, the actual lead equivalence of 41 protective aprons from four man-ufacturers, all specified as having 0. 25 mm lead equivalence, were investigated with transmission ex-periments at 70 and 100 kVp. All aprons were in current use. The aprons were screened for defects, and age, weight and design was recorded along with details of associated quality assurance (QA). Out of the 41 protective aprons examined for actual lead equivalence, 73 % were outside tolerance levels, with actual levels in some aprons demonstrating {{less than half of the}} nominal values. The lack of compatibility between actual and <b>nominal</b> <b>lead</b> equivalent values was demonstrated by aprons from three of the four manufacturers investigated. The area of the defects found on screening of the protective aprons were within recommendations. The results highlight the need for accep-tancy and ongoing checks of protec-tive aprons to ensure that radiation exposure of imaging personnel is kept to a minimum...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores a {{model of}} wage {{adjustment}} {{based on the assumption}} that information disseminates slowly throughout the population of wage setters. This informational frictional yields interesting and plausible dynamics for employment and inflation in response to exogenous movements in monetary policy and productivity. In this model, disinflations and productivity slowdowns have a parallel effect: They both cause the path of employment to fall below the level that would prevail under full information. The model implies that, in the face of productivity change, a policy of targeting either nominal income or the <b>nominal</b> wage <b>leads</b> to more stable employment than does a policy of targeting the price of goods and services. Finally, we examine U. S. time series and find that, as the model predicts, unemployment fluctuations are associated with both inflation and productivity surprises. ...|$|R

As a result, aggregate demand stabilization {{can be very}} desirable even though the frictions that cause fluctuations in aggregate demand to have real effects are slight.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a flexible price, two-sector model {{to study the}} effect and incidence of large nominal exchange rate shocks on sectors and factors of production. We adopt a classical two-sector model of a small open economy and enrich its structure with gradual investment and a preference for real money holdings. A <b>nominal</b> appreciation <b>leads</b> to in-creased spending (due {{to the role of}} money), which pushes nontraded prices up (with gradual capital adjustment, the short-term transformation curve is nonlinear). This translates into changes in factor rewards, capital labor ratios and sector-level employment of capital and labor. Higher nontraded prices lead to extra domestic income, validating some of the initial excess spending. A depreciation would imply exacty the same but reversed effects. This prop-agation mechanism leads to a persistent real effect (on relative prices, factor rewards, capital accumulation) of nominal shocks, which disappears gradually through money outflow (trade deficit). We also draw parallels with the literature on exchange rate based stabilizations...|$|R
