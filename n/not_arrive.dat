5|$|Parker's fleet had an {{extremely}} difficult crossing. Battered by storms and high seas, the first ships {{of the fleet}} did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> at Cape Fear until April 18, and Cornwallis did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> until May 3. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided Patriot properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions {{up and down the}} coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that {{the decision was made to}} go there.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{difficult}} journey, the Ottawas refused {{to change the}} date of the first game, only two days away. Ottawa arranged hospitable accommodations for the Dawson City team. The Yukoners received a huge welcome at the train station, had a welcoming dinner, and used the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Club's rooms for the duration of their stay. Young did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> in time to play for Dawson.|$|E

The crossings started at 03:00, with fire support from the 43rd Wessex Division. Through the remaining hours of darkness, only 153 men were able to cross– less than ¼ of the hoped for reinforcement.|$|E
5|$|Waltman was {{not used}} again by TNA until their Final Resolution PPV event on January 15, 2006. There, Waltman {{defeated}} Raven in a Raven's Rules match, forcing Raven to leave TNA in the storyline. Waltman {{was not used}} by the company due to management being angered by his failure to participate at Unbreakable. Despite him not showing up to the event, Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete, but did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> at the arena in time.|$|E

5|$|With a Protestant on the throne, the English {{refugees}} in Geneva prepared to return home. Knox himself {{decided to return}} to Scotland. Before his departure, various honours were conferred on him, including the freedom of the city of Geneva. Knox left in January 1559, but he did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> in Scotland until 2 May 1559, owing to Elizabeth's refusal to issue him a passport through England.|$|E
5|$|After his death, {{a legend}} arose {{that he had}} not died, that his funeral was staged, and that he had escaped to Hawaii, married a native woman, and fathered several {{children}} with her. Andrew Forest Muir, writing in 1956 in the Filson Club History Quarterly, debunked this legend. He documented that the first Deshas in Hawaii did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> until nearly two decades after Isaac Desha's death. At the time of Baker's murder, the progenitor of the Hawaiian Desha family had been four years old. That progenitor was John R. Langherne Desha, a grandson of Governor Joseph Desha and nephew of Isaac Desha. In Honolulu, he helped establish Queen's Hospital and worked there until his death.|$|E
5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants {{had started}} to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ Day {{was a lack of}} shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of the}} peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E

5|$|Auroras {{departure}} from Australia was delayed {{by a series}} of organisational and financial setbacks, and the party did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> in McMurdo Sound until 16 January 1915—very late in the season for depot-laying work. Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that sledging work should begin without delay, with a view to laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should be set aside to acclimatise and train men and dogs. However he was overruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton had ruled out a crossing that season.|$|E
5|$|By 1 December, the PVA 58th Division was {{virtually}} destroyed, {{with the remainder}} waiting for reinforcements from the 26th Corps of the 9th Army. But much to the frustration of Song Shi-Lun, the 26th Corps did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> before the Marines broke out of Yudam-ni. The airfield was opened to traffic on 1 December, allowing UN forces to bring in reinforcements and to evacuate {{the dead and the}} wounded. With the Marines at Yudam-ni completing their withdrawal on 4 December, the trapped UN forces could finally start their breakout towards the port of Hungnam.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of November 1846, the settlers had reached the Sierra Nevada where they became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee (now Donner) Lake, high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran extremely low and, in mid-December, some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the settlers, but the first relief party did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> {{until the middle of}} February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train had become trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived to reach California, many of them having eaten the dead for survival.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{accepting}} that Soult would <b>not</b> <b>arrive,</b> Ney could {{not hope to}} hold his position, much less push the Austrians back. He concluded that he must fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, he instructed Walther and his cavalry to establish {{a position on the}} Töss, above the bridge at Stieg. From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.|$|E
5|$|General de Kalb's forces took {{almost a}} month to descend the Chesapeake Bay and did <b>not</b> <b>arrive</b> in Petersburg, Virginia {{until the middle of}} June, {{almost a month}} after Lincoln had {{surrendered}} his army.

He assumed command on July 25, 1780 and immediately marched into South Carolina with the intent of engaging the British Army, now under the command of Charles Cornwallis. Williams served as Deputy Adjutant-General under Gates.|$|E
