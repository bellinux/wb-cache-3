Four other ENSARS modules (Infectious Agent, Facility, Pathway, and Socio-economic) were used to assess two case study species (European catfish Silurus glanis L. and red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii Girard). <b>No</b> <b>Annex</b> IV species was categorised as low risk, 10 as moderately low risk, 12 as medium risk, two as moderately high risk and none as high risk. The results are discussed and recommendations are made on further development of the scheme as well as the need to have multiple assessors of multidisciplinary expertise from the Member States concerned carry out the assessments using an approach similar to that carried out by EU Reference Laboratory proficiency tests...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mexico {{as one of}} the <b>No</b> <b>Annex</b> I {{countries}} signatories of Kyoto protocol {{has conducted}} several activities to face climate change. This paper presents the assessment and discussion of the actions comprising the three programs in the country during the period 2009 - 2012 : The federal program named Climate Change Special Program (PECC from its Spanish initials), the Clean Development Projects (CDP) registered in the IPCC, and the State Government Actions (SGA). Only 36 of the quantitative 53 PECC s ́ goals achieved some progress, although the global goal of reducing 129. 03 Mt CO 2 eq/year by the end of 2012 was fulfilled and exceeded, but several important goals were not met. Some actions were performed in order to generate clean energy, such as the construction of an Eolic Park and a hydroelectric, but the government has continued benefiting the extraction of fossil fuels. The estimated effectiveness for PECC actions was 13. 4 million of euros / Mt CO 2 eq. Index-terms—Mitigation, GHG policies, climate change. I...|$|E
40|$|Background Sporting organisations {{provide an}} {{important}} setting for health promotion strategies that involve policies, communication of healthy messages {{and creation of}} health promoting environments. The introduction of policy interventions within sporting organisations is one strategy to target high risk behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption, excess sun exposure, unhealthy eating and discrimination. Objectives To review all controlled evaluation studies of policy interventions organised through sporting settings to increase healthy behaviour (related to smoking, alcohol, healthy eating, sun protection, discrimination, safety and access). Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyclNFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Sociological Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts, freely available online health promotion and sports-related databases hosted by leading agencies, and the internet using sport and policy-related key words. We identified further studies in the bibliographies of articles and by contacting authors of key articles in the area. Selection criteria We aimed to identify research that had used study designs that incorporated an evaluated intervention and comparison. Uncontrolled studies, meeting other inclusion criteria, were to be reported in an annex to the review. Types of studies: Studies in which sporting organisations were allocated to a policy intervention or control/comparison group. No minimum follow-up required. Types of participants: People of all ages. Types of interventions : Any policy intervention implemented through sporting organisations to instigate and/or sustain healthy behaviour change, intention to change behaviour, or changes in attitudes, knowledge or awareness of healthy behaviour. Policies must address any of the following: smoking, alcohol, healthy eating, sun protection, access for disadvantaged groups, physical safety (not including injuries), and social and emotional health (e. g [...] anti-vilification, anti-discrimination). Types of outcome measures: Behaviour change, intention to change behaviour, change in attitudes, knowledge or awareness of healthy behaviour, and policy presence. Data collection and analysis We assessed whether identified citations were controlled evaluation studies and investigated the use of policy implemented in sporting settings. Abstracts were independently inspected by two reviewers and full papers were obtained where necessary. As no controlled evaluation studies were located, no data collection or analysis was undertaken. No uncontrolled studies meeting other inclusion criteria were identified and therefore <b>no</b> <b>annex</b> is presented. Main results No rigorous studies were located to test the effectiveness of policy interventions organised through sporting organisations to increase healthy behaviours, attitudes, knowledge or inclusion of health oriented policies within the organisarions. Authors 2 ̆ 7 conclusions We were unable to find any controlled studies to guide the use of policy interventions used in sporting settings. The search process revealed a number of case studies with anecdotal reporting of outcomes. We strongly recommend that rigorous evaluation techniques are employed more commonly in this field to illuminate the impact of health promoting policy on outcomes, and the contexts and processes which are likely ro be effective in reducing harmful behaviours. <br /...|$|E

40|$|There is now {{compelling}} {{scientific evidence}} that increased levels of physical activity can bring wide-ranging health benefits. These benefits can extend beyond physical health and include other positive impacts relating to mental health and personal development. The sport and recreation sector {{is viewed as a}} priority area for increasing rates of physical activity. Participation rates {{have been shown to be}} lower in females, decline with age, and are reduced in lower socio-economic and minority groups. It is important to determine the most effective interventions that sporting organisations can use to increase participation. To review all controlled evaluation studies of interventions organised through sporting settings to increase participation. We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyclNFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Sociological Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts, and a number of freely-available online health promotion and sports-related databases. The internet was used extensively to search for studies and locate information generated by sporting bodies throughout the world. Types of studies: Controlled evaluation studies. No minimum follow-up required. Uncontrolled studies, meeting other inclusion criteria, were to be reported in an annex to the review. People of all ages. Types of interventions: Any intervention designed to increase active and/ or non-active participation in sport. These could include: mass media campaigns; information or education sessions; management or organisational change strategies; policy changes, for example to improve the socio-cultural environment to encourage people of specific age, gender or ethnicity to participate; changes to traditional or existing programs, for example club or association-initiated rule modification programs; provision of activities beyond traditional or existing programs, for example 'Come and Try' initiatives (teaser or taster programs); skill improvement programs; volunteer encouragement programs. Types of outcome measures: Change in the number of (active and non-active) participants in organised sport, change in status from non-participating to non-active or active participation, change in status from non-active to active participation. We assessed whether identified citations were controlled evaluation studies which investigated the use of interventions implemented in sporting settings to increase participation. Two reviewers independently inspected abstracts. We obtained full papers where necessary. As no controlled evaluation studies were located, no data collection or analysis was undertaken. No uncontrolled studies meeting other inclusion criteria were identified and therefore <b>no</b> <b>annex</b> is presented. Despite a thorough review of the published and unpublished literature, we were unable to locate any rigorous studies which tested the effects of interventions organised through sporting organisations to increase participation in sport. There is an absence of high quality evidence to support interventions designed and delivered by sporting organisations to increase participation in sport. Interventions funded and conducted in this area must be linked to a rigorous evaluation strategy in order to examine overall effectiveness, sociodemographic differentials in participation and cost-effectiveness of these strategies...|$|E

Rather, emissions targets for each nation were separately negotiated and are to be voluntarily enforced, leading United States officials to regard the Paris Agreement as an executive agreement rather than a legally binding treaty.
