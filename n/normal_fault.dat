5|$|Tensional forces {{forming the}} Basin and Range physiogeographic {{province}} {{to the west}} about 20 to 25million years ago in Tertiary time created the two faults that bound the Markagunt Plateau (which underlies the park): the Sevier Fault on {{the east and the}} Hurricane Fault on the west. The Hurricane fault zone is a major, active, steeply west-dipping <b>normal</b> <b>fault</b> that stretches at least 155miles (250km) from south of the Grand Canyon northward to Cedar City, Utah. Along the southern boundary of the park, tectonic displacement along this fault is about 3,600ft (1,098m). Several other normal faults also developed on the plateau.|$|E

The area was equipped with an array of strong motion seismographs for analyzing the fault mechanisms of nearby earthquakes and seismic characteristics of the sediments in the valley. The earthquake was significant in the scientific community for studies of both fault mechanics and repeat events.

30|$|The {{topography}} of Sabah bears clear {{evidence for a}} 200 -km-long system of active <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> that extend northeast to southwest, through the epicentral region (Fig.  1 b). The scarps of these <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> bound five discrete valleys and exhibit hundreds of meters of topographic relief between the valley floors and mountain crests. The topographic evidence for youthful <b>normal</b> <b>faulting</b> along these valley margins is typical—triangular facets, scarps across alluvial terraces and other topographic truncations best explained by <b>normal</b> <b>faulting</b> (Additional file 1 : Figures S 7, S 8).

The grabens strike to the northeast and range in width from 0.5 to 2.8 km. Chains of pits craters associated with the grabens are also observed. The age relationship between the grabens and <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> is complex. In places, the grabens appear to crosscut the <b>normal</b> <b>faults,</b> indicating that the grabens are younger. However, the strikes of the <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> locally appear to have a strong northeast influence, suggesting that the stresses that formed the grabens predate the <b>normal</b> <b>faults.</b> It is likely that the grabens developed repeatedly {{over an extended period of}} time and may be partly contemporaneous with the <b>normal</b> <b>faults.</b>|$|R

These structures were observed in the ar-chaeological open site at Brzezie, in {{the central part of}} the Polish Carpathian Foredeep (Fig. 1 A).

40|$|The axial {{zone of the}} Ethiopian Rift {{is made up of}} Quaternary extensional {{fractures}} and <b>normal</b> <b>faults.</b> Field {{analysis was}} performed to study the mechanism of development of the <b>normal</b> <b>faults.</b> The collected data show that the <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> (1) are subvertical at surface, (2) have dilation proportional to the throw, and (3) end laterally as extension fractures, that is, tension fractures which gradually decrease in dilation. The minimum measured opening of <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> is 2 m and the maximum measured dilation of the extension fractures is 4 m. The minimum measured length of <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> is 800 m and the maximum measured length of the extension fractures is 400 m. The collected data suggest that the <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> nucleate from wider extension fractures in the axial zone. When the extension fractures reach critical dimensions (length 1 / 4,∼ 800 m and dilation 1 / 4 2 - 4 m, corresponding to a predicted depth of ∼ 700 m), the shear rupture behavior controls the further propagation of the fractures at depth. This mechanism has close similarities with models previously proposed for fault formation along the oceanic ridge of Iceland. This suggests common rifting processes along diverging plates, independently from the oceanic or continental nature of the lithosphere...|$|R
25|$|The {{principle}} of cross-cutting relationships {{pertains to the}} formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a <b>normal</b> <b>fault</b> or a thrust fault.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} the January 11 {{earthquake}} is debated. Some catalogues give an onshore epicentre without any direct association with a known structure, while others propose that the source was offshore due to the associated tsunami, involving either rupture along a <b>normal</b> <b>fault,</b> part of the Siculo-Calabrian rift zone, or rupture along the subduction zone beneath the Ionian Sea. An analysis {{of the distribution of}} tsunami run-ups along the coast suggests that a submarine landslide triggered by the earthquake is the most likely source, in which case the tsunami provides no constraint on the epicenter. A landslide origin is supported by the observation of possible landslide bodies along the Hyblean-Malta escarpment.|$|E
25|$|Sediment {{collected}} in various lakes {{in the area}} from around 17 to 15 million years ago, becoming the Miocene-aged Colter Formation. Beginning around 13 million years ago (also in the Miocene), a 40-mile (64-km) long steeply east dipping <b>normal</b> <b>fault</b> system called the Teton Fault started to vertically move two adjacent blocks. One block, the Jackson Hole basin, moved down while the other block, containing the westward-tilting {{eastern part of the}} Teton Range, moved up; thus creating the youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains. Most of the downward movement occurred right next to the fault, resuling in a 15° tilt of the Colter Formation. No sediment was deposited on top of the tilted Colter Formation for up to three million years, resulting in an angular unconformity as the tilted Colter partially eroded away.|$|E
40|$|Structures in the Triassic and Liassic {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Somerset coast indicate {{spatial and temporal}} variations in the deformation history. From Kilve to Watchet, there was Mesozoic north-south extension and Tertiary north-south contraction. At Lilstock, about 3 km to the east, there was a more complex history, including: (1) the development of joints, <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> and veins striking about 060 °; (2) approximately north-south extension on 095 ° striking <b>normal</b> <b>faults,</b> with sinistral transtension; (3) east-west contraction, with sinistral shear on some 095 ° striking normal faults; (4) dextral reactivation of some 095 ° striking normal faults; (5) north-south contraction, and thrusts and strike-slip faults, with the reverse-reactivation of the largest 095 ° striking <b>normal</b> <b>faults.</b> The joints in the district mostly postdate the faults. Two large approximately east-west striking faults are postulated to form the northern edges of the Quantock and Exmoor hills, here called the North Quantocks Fault (NQF) and the North Exmoor Fault (NEF). These were basin-bounding <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> during the Mesozoic, with maybe more than 1000 m of throw, suggesting that the Bristol Channel Basin is not a half-graben developed above a south-dipping Variscan thrust which underwent Mesozoic extensional reactivation. The NQF and NEF may have been reverse-reactivated during the Alpine contraction. The NQF probably caused variations in the stress history of the Mesozoic {{sedimentary rocks}} of the Somerset coast over only a few kilometres along strike. The possible relationships of the NQF and NEF with the Cothelstone Fault are discussed. Several broad orders of relay ramp scale occur, within which are developed smaller antithetic <b>normal</b> <b>faults.</b> Between the north-dipping NQF and NEF, the relay ramp contains south-dipping (antithetic) <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> with tens to hundreds of metres displacement.

Based on reflection seismic sections and surface observations, the following genetic types may be differentiated: - listric <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> involving the basement that are associated with some crustal attenuation. Such faults occur during the formation of rifts that often precede the formation of passive continental margins (e. g., Gulf of Biscay, Galicia Bank); - superficial soft-sediment listric <b>normal</b> <b>faulting</b> related to deltaic systems and/or to drifting sequences associated with the subsidence of passive continental margins (e. g., Gulf of Mexico); - listric <b>normal</b> <b>faulting</b> associated with the genesis of accretionary wedges of active continental margins (e. g., Colombia); - syn- and post-orogenic faulting associated with the stretching and shearing of orogenic systems and parts of their foreland (e. g., Great Basin).

40|$|Structural {{analysis}} and field mapping together with simple geometrical and flexural elastic models, document that two styles of Quaternary extensional tectonics characterized the Gran Sasso range (central Apennines, Italy). In {{the western part}} of the range, extension took place on 10 – 15 -km-long range-front <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> with associated 600 – 1000 -m-high escarpments showing evidence of Late Glacial–Holocene activity. This topography has been reproduced with a thin elastic plate subjected to the isostatic forces induced by the movement along high-angle (55 °– 65 °) planar <b>normal</b> <b>faults.</b> In the eastern part of the belt extension occurred on shallow-dipping <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> (30 °– 35 °) which reactivated progressively deeper pre-existing thrusts. In this area antithetic "domino" faults formed to accommodate the mechanical adjustment of the hanging-wall over a variably dipping major fault surface. The eastward increase in shortening, due to the earlier compressional phase, documented in the Gran Sasso belt by previous authors, accounts for the more developed zones of weakness and high topographic relief in the eastern sector. This setting could explain the different styles of extension and the more advanced northeastern limit of <b>normal</b> <b>faulting</b> in the eastern sector. This work suggests that <b>normal</b> <b>faults</b> can originate either with low- or high-angle geometry in the upper crust according to the pre-existing tectonic setting and that topography could be important in controlling the geometry and pattern of migrating <b>normal</b> <b>faulting...</b>|$|R

We also study three earlier <b>normal</b> <b>faulting</b> earthquakes that occurred in southern Tibet between 1992 and 2005. Coseismic deformation for each of these eight events is measured with ascending and descending interferograms from ENVISAT, ERS and ALOS SAR data. Elastic dislocation modelling of the line-of-sight InSAR displacements and body wave seismological modelling of P and SH waves are used to estimate fault parameters and are found to be in good agreement for all the events studied. The use of InSAR to measure deformation allows a relatively precise determination of the fault location in addition to resolving the focal plane ambiguity. Only five of the eight events are associated with a clear surface topographic feature, suggesting that an underestimation of the amount of extension would result from using the surface expressions of <b>normal</b> <b>faulting</b> alone. The observations, in all cases, are consistent with slip on planar surfaces, with dips in the range 40 - 50 °, that penetrates the uppermost crust to a depth of 10 - 15 km.
