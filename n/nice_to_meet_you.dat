2500|$|After her {{elimination}} from American Idol, Miller {{announced plans}} to launch a music career as soon as possible, {{as well as an}} eventual acting career. Of her intents for her debut studio album, Miller has revealed that she would like to write or co-write all material and intends to show all sides to her personality in an intricate and artistic manner which she feels current mainstream music largely lacks. She further explained, [...] "I want to have music that has meaning and is real. I don't want to have dance-party music, but at the same time, I don't want to put people to sleep. I want to incorporate the soulful piano sound with a lot of edge. I know the message that I want to send out, and I know the music I want to do. I can't wait to show it to people." [...] The top three finalists – Miller, Candice Glover and Harrison – recorded background vocals on a song for judge Mariah Carey's fourteenth studio album, though it is yet to be confirmed whether it will be on the final track listing.
