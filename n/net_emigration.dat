5|$|The ethnic Chinese {{population}} in Indonesia grew {{by an average}} of 4.3 percent annually between 1920 and 1930. It then slowed owing to the effects of the Great Depression and many areas experienced a <b>net</b> <b>emigration.</b> Falling growth rates were also attributed to a significant {{decrease in the number of}} Chinese immigrants admitted into Indonesia since the 1950s. The population is relatively old according to the 2000 census, having the lowest percentage of population under 14 years old nationwide and the second-highest percentage of population over 65. Their population pyramid had a narrow base with a rapid increase until the 15–19 age group, indicating a rapid decline in total fertility rates. This was evidenced by a decline in the absolute number of births since 1980. In Jakarta and West Java the population peak occurred in the 20–24 age group, indicating that the decline in fertility rates began as early as 1975. The upper portion of the pyramid exhibited a smooth decline with increasing population age. It is estimated that 60.7 percent of the Chinese Indonesian {{population in}} 2000 constitute the generation which experienced political and social pressures under the New Order government. With an average life expectancy of 75 years, those who spent their formative years prior to this regime will completely disappear by 2032.|$|E

30|$|To empirically {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between country-specific return migration rates and the pattern of retirement, we estimate reduced-form models of retirement status controlling for country of birth-specific emigration rates, which proxy for the <b>net</b> benefits of <b>emigration</b> for immigrants in HILDA from different countries since they reflect the prior migration decisions made by one’s countrymen. In some models, we also control for individuals’ demographic and human capital characteristics. Including controls for characteristics that are potentially related to retirement status, such as age, years in Australia, education, and work experience, allows us {{to account for the}} effect that differences in the composition of immigrant populations from different countries of origin plays in explaining {{the relationship between}} country of birth-specific emigration rates and retirement status. Since our objective is not to estimate a behavioral model of the retirement decision, but rather to understand the way that the propensity to be retired at a point in time (i.e. retirement status) differs among individuals from different countries of birth, we adopt a cross-sectional estimator, pooling data from multiple survey waves to improve efficiency.|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} {{changes in}} abundance of juvenile herring (Clupea harengus, Linnaeus, 1758) and sprat [(Sprattus sprattus, Linnaeus, 1758) ] in the Schelde Estuary were examined {{by means of}} stable isotopes. Juvenile herring and sprat typically overwinter in the estuary. Herring exhibits a second, smaller density peak in the summer. A similar density peak for sprat is not observed. The temporal use of the estuary by clupeoid fish has previously been attributed to seasonal migrations of juveniles between the North Sea and the estuary. Using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen {{we have tried to}} elucidate these migration patterns. Herring and sprat were sampled between May 2000 and April 2001. Samples were taken every month in the cooling water of the Doel Nuclear Power Plant (in the brackish part of the estuary) and the Borssele Nuclear Power Plant (at the mouth of the estuary). Using cluster analysis on the d 13 C and d 15 N values of individual muscle tissue, fish which recently immigrated from the North Sea (marine group with typical marine isotope values) could be distinguished from individuals which had resided in the estuary (estuarine group with typical estuarine isotope values). The analysis showed that herring and sprat had very similar migration dynamics in the Schelde Estuary, characterized by immigration and emigration almost throughout the year and an intensive migration activity during the winter. Net upstream immigration (i. e. the majority of fish enter the estuary) started in September and peaked in November. During December immigration remained high but had already decreased, which probably explains lower fish densities recorded at Doel. Although the density of herring and sprat further declined in February and March, <b>net</b> seaward <b>emigration</b> sensu strictu (i. e. the majority of the fish leave the estuary) was not demonstrated using the stable isotope technique. During the winter larger proportions of individuals with a typical marine isotope signature at Doel were not only associated with migration but also with a slower tissue turnover rate...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{simulate}} {{the labor market}} effects of <b>net</b> immigration and <b>emigration</b> during the 1990 's in all OECD countries. To accomplish this, we {{are the first to}} employ a comprehensive database of migrant stocks, grouped by education level and country of origin/destination, for the years 1990 and 2000. Due to the much higher international mobility of college graduates, relative to all other individuals, we find that net migration flows are college-intensive, relative to the population of non-migrants. Using the consensus aggregate model of labor demand and supply we {{simulate the}} long-run employment and wage effects of immigration and emigration. We use a range of parameter values spanning most of the estimates in the literature. In all cases we find that immigration had a positive effect on the wage of less educated natives. It also increased or left the average native wages unchanged and had a positive or no effect on native employment. To the contrary, emigration had a negative effect on the wage of less educated native workers and it contributed to increase within country inequality in all OECD countries. These results still hold true when we correct for the estimates of undocumented immigrants, for the skill-downgrading of immigrants, when we focus on immigration from non-OECD countries, and when we consider preliminary measures of more recent immigration flows for the period 2000 - 2007. immigration and emigration, complementarity, schooling externalities, average wage, wage inequality...|$|R

In {{the last decades}} the country began to observe {{a decrease in the}} <b>net</b> of <b>emigration</b> and an enlargement of the immigration influx. Although the financial crisis has had a strong impact on the mobility dynamics of the population in the country, which include a strong reduction in the immigration rate, Spain continues to receive immigrants, including, irregular ones, that look to settle in the country or to transit to others in the European space. The influx of irregular immigrants who often arrive through means so precarious as ‘pateras’ (boats) to Spain, is also observed in other southern European countries and as an established phenomenon, it has been paralleled by the strengthening of the borders of ‘Fortress Europe’. The new forms of governance emerging from the creation and expansion of the European Union have required deep transformations in the way European societies interact {{with each other and with}} the rest of the world, in order to come up with ways to manage and mitigate the intrinsic contradictions, challenges and complexities present in this process, among which the management of the external borders is central. As the migratory pressure rises, Europe faces the difficult task of simultaneously controlling the influx of immigrants and respecting the human rights and democratic values upon which it claims to be founded. These contradicting aims are often pernicious to each other in borders where deportations, violence, brutal encounters and vehement signs of rejection and exclusion are the rule everyday. Borders, including the European external ones, are not only geographical limits. They are institutions where values, interests, beliefs, feelings, imaginaries, and political and economic objectives are synthesized, materialized and reflected. In the process of making Europe, new border rules and practices have to emerge, as the European Union and its member states seek to ensure the perpetuation of a particular order of the world where they maintain the sovereignty over certain territories and populations.
