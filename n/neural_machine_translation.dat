50|$|<b>Neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> (NMT) is an {{approach}} to machine translation that uses a large neural network. It departs from phrase-based statistical translation approaches that use separately engineered subcomponents. Google and Microsoft translation services now use NMT.

For the task of capturing temporal structure in video, however, there still remain numerous open research questions. Current research suggests using a simple temporal feature pooling strategy {{to take into account}} the temporal aspect of video. We demonstrate that this method is not sufficient for gesture recognition, where temporal information is more discriminative compared to general video classification tasks. We explore deep architectures for gesture recognition in video and propose a new end-to-end trainable neural network architecture incorporating temporal convolutions and bidirectional recurrence. Our main contributions are twofold; first, we show that recurrence is crucial for this task; second, we show that adding temporal convolutions leads to significant improvements. We evaluate the different approaches on the Montalbano gesture recognition dataset, where we achieve state-of-the-art results...|$|R

5000|$|Launched in April 2006 as a {{statistical}} machine translation service, it used United Nations and European Parliament transcripts to gather linguistic data. Rather than translating languages directly, it first translates text to English {{and then to the}} target language. During a translation, it looks for patterns in millions of documents to help decide on the best translation. Its accuracy has been criticized and ridiculed on several occasions. In November 2016, Google announced that Google Translate would switch to a <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> engine - Google <b>Neural</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Translation</b> (GNMT) - which translates [...] "whole sentences at a time, rather than just piece by piece. It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation, which it then rearranges and adjusts to be more like a human speaking with proper grammar". Originally only enabled for a few languages in 2016, GNMT is gradually being used for more languages.|$|E

5000|$|Google Translate's new <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> {{system uses}} a large {{end-to-end}} {{artificial neural network}} capable of deep learning, in particular, long short-term memory networks.GNMT improves the quality of translation because it uses an example-based machine translation (EBMT) method in which the system [...] "learns from millions of examples." [...] It translates [...] "whole sentences at a time, rather than just piece by piece. It uses this broader context to help it figure out the most relevant translation, which it then rearranges and adjusts {{to be more like}} a human speaking with proper grammar". GNMT's [...] "proposed architecture" [...] of [...] "system learning" [...] was first tested on over a hundred languages supported by Google Translate. With the end-to-end framework, [...] "the system learns over time to create better, more natural translations." [...] The GNMT network is capable of interlingual machine translation, which encodes the [...] "semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations", and the system did not invent its own universal language, but uses [...] "the commonality found inbetween many languages". GNMT was first enabled for eight languages: to and from English and Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish. In March 2017, it was enabled for Hindi, Russian and Vietnamese languages, followed by Indonesian, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu languages in April.|$|E
50|$|The Google Brain Team has {{recently}} reached significant breakthroughs for Google Translate, {{which is part}} of the Google Brain Project. In September 2016, the team launched the new system, Google <b>Neural</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Translation</b> (GNMT), which is an end-to-end learning framework, able to learn from a large amount of examples. While its introduction has greatly increased the quality of Google Translate's translations for the pilot languages, it was very difficult to create such improvements for all of its 103 languages. Addressing this problem, the Google Brain Team was able to develop a Multilingual GNMT system, which extended the previous one by enabling translations between multiple languages. Furthermore, it allows for Zero-Shot Translations, which are translations between two languages that the system has never explicitly seen before. Recently, Google has announced, that Google Translate can now also translate without transcribing, using neural networks. This means, that it is possible to translate speech in one language directly into text in another language, without first transcribing it to text. According to the Researchers at Google Brain, this intermediate step can be avoided using neural networks. In order for the system to learn this, they exposed it to many hours of Spanish audio together with the corresponding English text. The different layers of neural networks, replicating the human brain, were able to link the corresponding parts and subsequently manipulate the audio waveform until it was transformed to English text.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} attention-based <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> in simultaneous translation. We introduce a novel decoding algorithm, called simultaneous greedy decoding, that allows an existing <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> model to begin translating before a full source sentence is received. This approach is unique from previous works on simultaneous translation in that segmentation and translation are done jointly to maximize the translation quality and that translating each segment is strongly conditioned on all the previous segments.

40|$|<b>Neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> is a {{relatively}} new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> using two models; RNN Encoder [...] Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.

40|$|The article dwells on {{the most}} {{important}} land-marks in the history of <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> (MT). In the middle of the twentieth century, at the time when discussions about <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> started, it was thought that after several years every person would have a small device allowing people to communicate in any language. Today the view towards <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> has become more pragmatic. For example, everyone agrees that <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> of fiction will never be of satisfactory quality. The article discusses three key methods of <b>machine</b> <b>translation,</b> namely, statistical, rule-based, and logical. For practical purposes, of-ten several methods of <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> are integrated. In rule-based <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> the most important role is played by dictionaries and sets of rules. The article demonstrates that morphological, syntactic, and semantic ambiguities are the main obstacles for creating a high quality formal <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> product. Statistical <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> is based on data from parallel and monolingual corpora. While statistical <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> is good for capturing the key words of a sentence, the overall quality of a translation remains low.

40|$|Word sense {{disambiguation}} {{is necessary}} in translation because different word senses often have different translations. <b>Neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> models learn different senses of words {{as part of an}} end-to-end translation task, and their capability to perform word sense disambiguation has so far not been quantified. We exploit the fact that neural translation models can score arbitrary translations to design a novel cross-lingual word sense disambiguation task that is tailored towards evaluating <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> models. We present a test set of 7, 200 lexical ambiguities for German â†’ English, and 6, 700 for German â†’ French, and report baseline results. With 70 % of lexical ambiguities correctly disambiguated, we find that word sense disambiguation remains a challenging problem for <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation,</b> especially for rare word senses. To improve word sense disambiguation in <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation,</b> we experiment with two methods to integrate sense embeddings. In a first approach we pass sense embeddings as additional input to the <b>neural</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> system.

While a baseline NMT system disambiguates frequent word senses quite reliably, the annotation with both sense labels and lexical chains improves the neural modelsâ€™ performance on rare word senses...|$|E
