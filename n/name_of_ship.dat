60|$|It is {{the custom}} among whalers {{to have their}} {{harpoons}} marked with date and <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship,</b> and Dr Scoresby, in his work on arctic voyages mentions several instances of whales having been taken near Behring's Straits, with harpoons in them bearing the stamp of ships that were known to cruise in the Greenland seas; and the dates on the harpoons were so recent as to preclude the supposition that the said whales had, after being struck, made a voyage round the capes above mentioned,--even were such a voyage possible to them. All this does not, indeed, absolutely prove {{the existence of an}} open arctic sea, but it does, we think, prove the existence of at least an occasionally open sea there, for {{it is well known that}} whales cannot travel such immense distances under ice.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} an {{output of the}} Pilot Project on Piracy, Maritime Awareness and Risks – Gulf of Guinea, {{carried out by the}} Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission on behalf of EuropeAid. Monthly reports are being {{produced}} during the duration of this project. To build a maritime piracy taxonomy for PIRATES, piracy incidents were described by their so called attributes, for instance the “name of the ship” that was attacked or the “location of the piracy incident”. Then, the attributes were grouped together in so called sections, for instance the “name of the ship” belongs to the group “ship details”. The following nine sections were created: 1) 	As regards identification, the following attributes were created: Reporting entity, Date entered, Incident number, Incident Sort, Incident Type, Status of report, Report last modified. 2) 	As regards DTG and location, the following attributes were created: Incident date, Incident time, Time zone, Period of day, Country of incident, Position of incident, Location of incident, Area of incident, Latitude and Longitude. 3) 	As regards the ship details, the following attributes were created: <b>Name</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship,</b> IMO Number, MMSI Number, Call sign, Flag of Ship, Type of ship, Length of ship, DWT of ship and photo of ship. 4) 	As regards ship circumstances, the following attributes were created: next port, last port and nearest port of ship, status of ship, speed of ship, freeboard of ship, security on board, Citadel/safe room, ships security level, visibility, wind speed and wave height. 5) 	As regards details of the attack, the following attributes were created: type and number of attackers, type and number of boats, weapons used, violence used, length of attack, attackers arrested, injured or killed, ship entered by and mitigating actions. 6) 	As regards victim details, there is a possibility to enter the number of victims killed, injured, missing, kidnapped, threatened, taken hostage and/or assaulted. There is a possibility to enter the number of crew on board with EU Citizenship. 7) 	As regards narrative, there is a possibility to enter a free-format description of the attack. 8) 	As regards the post-incident details, the following attributes were created: Consequences for victims, Days held in captivity, Ship released on, Ransom paid, Human Shield, Crew Mothership, Vessel raided, Estimated costs and Authorities reported to. 9) 	As regards photos and reports, a possibility to attach photos and reports of the incident was developed in PIRATES.
