50|$|By {{the time}} of the French {{revolution}} the name of Paoli had become something of an idol of liberty and democracy. In 1790 the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> in Paris passed a decree incorporating Corsica into France, essentially duplicating the work of 1780 but under a new authority. It granted amnesty to exiles, on which Paoli embarked immediately for Corsica. He arrived in time for the election of departmental officers at Orezza, ran for President, and was elected unanimously. Napoleon Bonaparte, organiser of the elections and active Jacobin, did not run at this time, but he was as much an admirer of Paoli as anyone.|$|R

40|$|The {{bicameral}} system is theoretically incompatible with indivisible sovereignty of a nation. The Czechoslovakian <b>revolutionary</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> 1918 - 1920 was unicameral. The {{creation of the}} Senate under Constitution of 1920 sparked controversy among political powers of time. The senate fullfilled the role ascribed to {{bicameral system}} in a modern state because it was composed of {{a different type of}} people. Pursuant to the Constitutional Decree of 1944 the Interim National Assembly was unicameral. The possibility to use the Senate as a potential barrier to subjecting the Slovaks to the Czech majority and against the electorates' radicalism not found support. The Constitution of the Czech Republic instituted the Senate but it actually came into existence only 1996...|$|R
50|$|The first {{parliament}} of {{an independent}} Benin was defined by the Constitution of 28 February 1959 and lasted from April 1959 to November 1960. It was chaired by Justin Ahomadegbé Tomètin.

5000|$|Over the {{following}} two months Šrobár founded the provisional government of Slovakia and became both the Czechoslovak minister {{of health and the}} minister for the administration of Slovakia. He retained both posts until 1920 and contributed significantly to the establishment of Czechoslovak rule in Slovakia, exercising virtually dictatorial powers on behalf of the Prague government. It was Šrobár's decision to make the former Austrian city of Pressburg - now Bratislava - the administrative capital of Slovakia, despite only 15% of its pre-war population being Slovaks. He also chose who would represent Slovakia on the newly established <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly.</b> Only 54 of its 256 members were from Slovakia, and of those only 41 were ethnic Slovaks. Lutherans outnumbered Catholics - the majority denomination in Slovakia - by three to one, reflecting Šrobár's pro-Lutheran leanings but angering the Slovak Catholic clergy and increasing ethnic and religious tensions in the new state. He dissolved the Slovak National Council on 8 January 1919 as part of a centralising drive, for which he was widely criticised, and a year later Slovakia itself was abolished as an administrative unit under the new constitution.|$|R

5000|$|In 1726, the Prince-Bishop of Basel, Johann Konrad von Reinach-Hirzbach, {{attempted}} to modernize and consolidate his extensive land holdings. He tried to sweep away the numerous local laws, customs and rights {{and replace them}} with a central government ruled according to the principles of enlightened absolutism. Riots and revolts against the new government broke out almost immediately in the Erguel valley and the region remained a center of anti-government activity. [...] In 1733 a meeting at the Courtelary Castle exploded into a riot and the Prince-Bishop's bailiff, Benoît-Aimé Mestrezat, was forced to flee the city. In 1792 and 1793, heavily influenced by the French Revolution, the <b>revolutionary</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> of Erguel was established in Courtelary. Revolutionaries flocked to the town and established a short-lived Republic of Erguel. In 1797 the French invaded the lands of the Bishop of Basel and established the Canton of Courtelary with Courtelary as the capital. The Canton was initially part of the Department of Mont-Terrible followed by the Department of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat, in 1815, the Erguel region became part of the Canton of Bern. Courtelary was the capital of the District of Erguel until 1831 when it became the capital of the District of Courtelary.|$|R

The final assault which occurred on the February 20, 1950, with {{over a hundred}} <b>National</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> Army soldiers successfully taking over a bunker in the Tianquan. The defending company of the 555th Regiment then counterattacked and besieged the bunker.
