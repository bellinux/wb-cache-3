5|$|Hours before Isabel made {{landfall}} on North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} tropical storm warning {{for a portion of}} the southern Long Island coastline from the New Jersey/New York border to Moriches.

By about two days before Isabel struck land until several hours after it moved ashore, forecasters predicted the storm to pass over western <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> transitioning tropical cyclone before passing into Canada as an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|In 1858, he {{accepted}} a teaching {{position at the}} ICY's preparatory school for boys. White furthered his interests in mathematics during his teaching stint at the institute. He became a lecturer on the subject while {{a member of the}} mathematics committee of the Banneker Institute, also becoming a proficient chess player in his leisure time. His exceptional skills with figures and calculations led to different business ventures: he was an agent for the Anglo-African weekly newspaper (1860–1861) and Pine and Palm (1860–1862). In 1861, he became a representative at the Haitian Bureau of Emigration, empowering him with the transfers of funds for free blacks who sought to move to Haiti, via <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of his different ventures, White became a relatively wealthy man at a young age.|$|E
5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> violation of the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were {{to be put in}} escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E

It remained unchanged until April1, 1997, when ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Steuben County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In the switch, NY333 and nearby NY432, both maintained by the state, were given to Steuben County in exchange for maintenance of NY415 from Meads Creek Road in Coopers Plains (northwest of Painted Post) to Babcock Hollow Road in Bath as well as for maintenance of Hamilton Street (the original routing of NY17) between US15 and Gang Mills. NY333 was redesignated as CR333 as a result.|$|E
