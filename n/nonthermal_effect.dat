We have {{computed}} the Lyman continuum intensities {{for different}} flare circumstances, namely, {{the temperature rise}} in the chromosphere, the downward shift of the transition region, and the <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effect</b> of a precipitating beam of electrons. All the three factors can enhance the intensity by various amounts. The third effect additionally lowers the color temperature of the Lyman continuum. It thus provides a diagnostic tool to discriminate whether there exists an obvious <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effect</b> of electron beam bombardment during solar flares. It is also suggested that the relative magnitudes of Lyman and Balmer continuum enhancements {{can be used to}} infer the energy distribution type of the beam electrons...|$|E

The resultant ocular pathology evolved insidiously and slowly {{over a period of}} years in a similar way to other forms of radiational injury. By the time of consultation examination, all had progressed to a relatively late state, exhibiting not only capsular cataract but also vesiculation and opacification of the proximal subcapsular lens substance.

40|$|Abstract. Biodegradable β-tricalcium {{phosphate}} (β-TCP) /poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) composites were synthesized by in situ polymerization with microwave energy. The {{influence of}} the β-TCP content in β-TCP/PLGA composites on the molecular weight, crystallinity, microstructure, and mechanical properties was investigated. As the molecular weight of composites decreased, the β-TCP content increased up to 10 wt%, while further raising of the β-TCP content above 10 %, the molecular weight increased with increasing β-TCP content. This behavior may be ascribed to the superheating effect or <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effect</b> induced by microwave energy. It {{was found that the}} bending strength and Young’s modulus of the β-TCP/PLGA composites were proportional to the molecular weight of PLGA.

These two lines have different responses to thermal and <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects,</b> {{and can be}} used to diagnose the thermal and nonthermal heating processes. We apply our method to an X-class flare that occurred on 2001 October 19. We are able to identify quantitatively the heating effects during the flare eruption. We find that the <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> at {{the outer edge of the}} flare ribbon are more notable than that at the inner edge, while the temperature at the inner edge seems higher. On the other hand, the results show that <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> increase rapidly in the rise phase and decrease quickly in the decay phase, but the atmospheric temperature can still keep relatively high for some time after getting to its maximum. For the two kernels that we analyze, the maximum energy fluxes of the electron beams are ∼ 10 10 and 10 11 ergs cm − 2 s − 1, respectively. However, the atmospheric temperatures are not so high, i. e., lower than or slightly higher than that of the weak flare model F 1 at the two kernels.

40|$|As {{is known}} from visible-light experiments, silicon under {{femtosecond}} pulse irradiation can undergo so-called “nonthermal melting” if {{the density of}} electrons excited from the valence to the conduction band overcomes a certain critical value. Such ultrafast transition is induced by strong changes in the atomic potential energy surface, which trigger atomic relocation. However, heating of a material due to the electron-phonon coupling {{can also lead to}} a phase transition, called “thermal melting. ” This thermal melting can occur even if the excited-electron density is much too low to induce <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects.</b> To study phase transitions, and in particular, the interplay of the thermal and <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> in silicon under a femtosecond x-ray irradiation, we propose their unified treatment by going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation within our hybrid model based on tight-binding molecular dynamics. With our extended model we identify damage thresholds for various phase transitions in irradiated silicon. We show that electron-phonon coupling triggers the phase transition of solid silicon into a low-density liquid phase if the energy deposited into the sample is above ∼ 0. 65 eV per atom. For the deposited doses of over ∼ 0. 9 eV per atom, solid silicon undergoes a phase transition into high-density liquid phase triggered by an interplay between electron-phonon heating and <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects.</b> These thresholds are much lower than those predicted with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (∼ 2. 1 eV/atom), and indicate a significant contribution of electron-phonon coupling to the relaxation of the laser-excited silicon.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{summarize}} the recent progress on laser-induced magnetization dynamics in magnetic dielectrics. Due to the slow phonon–magnon interaction in these materials, direct thermal effects of the laser excitation can only {{be seen on the}} time scale of almost a nanosecond and thus are clearly distinguished from the ultrafast <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects.</b> However, via the crystal field, laser pulses are shown to indirectly modify the magnetic anisotropy in rare-earth orthoferrites and lead to the spin reorientation within a few picoseconds. More interesting, however, are the direct <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> of light on spin systems. We demonstrate coherent optical control of the magnetization in ferrimagnetic garnet films on a femtosecond time scale through a combination of two different ultrafast and <b>nonthermal</b> photomagnetic <b>effects</b> and by employing multiple pump pulses. Linearly polarized laser pulses are shown to create a long-lived modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy via optically induced electron transfer between nonequivalent ion sites. In addition, circularly polarized pulses are shown to act as strong transient magnetic field pulses originating from the nonabsorptive inverse Faraday effect. An all-optical scheme of excitation and detection of different antiferromagnetic resonance modes with frequencies of up to 500 GHz will be discussed as well.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the inactivation effects of ohmic heating (internal heating by electric current) and conventional heating (external heating by hot water) on viable aerobes and Streptococcus thermophilus 2646 in milk under identical temperature history conditions. The effects of the two treatments on quality of milk were also compared by assessing degrees of protein denaturation in raw milk and sterilized milk (raw milk being sterilized by ohmic heating or conventional heating). It was found that microbial counts and calculated decimal reduction time (D value) resulting from ohmic heating were significantly lower than those resulting from conventional heating. There was no difference in degrees of protein denaturation during the two treatments. The results suggested that ohmic heating had not only a lethal thermal effect but also a lethal <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effect</b> due to the electric current on microorganisms.

40|$|For over sixty years, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that microwave electromagnetic radiation (EMR) had effects on humans which could not be explained by detectible heating of tissue. Auditory responses to radar, called microwave hearing, have been the best known of these phenomena. To account for microwave hearing, many studies in the literature have adopted a rate-of-heating hypothesis advanced by Foster and Finch in 1974. We show here that theoretical and experimental studies supporting this hypothesis are weaker than usually assumed. We develop a simple framework of understanding of EMR that may be used to explain microwave hearing as a nonthermal, nonacoustic effect. We then extend this approach to other contexts, pointing out several fundamental misconceptions confounding the field. EMR, especially wide-band EMR, primarily must have a <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effect</b> on living tissue before conversion to heat. Auditory and tactile sensations, central neurological disability, and blood pressure loss caused by EMR have been documented.

40|$|In this manuscript, a {{study of}} the effect of {{microwave}} radiation on the high-performance liquid chromatography separation of tocopherols and vitamin K 1 was conducted. The novelty of the application was the use of a relatively low polarity mobile phase in which the dielectric heating effect was minimized to evaluate the <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effect</b> of the microwave radiation over the separation process. Results obtained show that microwave-assisted high-performance liquid chromatography had a shorter analysis time from 31. 5 to 13. 3 min when the lowest microwave power was used. Moreover, narrower peaks were obtained; hence the separation was more efficient maintaining or even increasing the resolution between the peaks. This result confirms that the increase in mobile phase temperature is not the only variable for improving the separation process but also other nonthermal processes must intervene. Fluorescence detection demonstrated better signal-to-noise compared to photodiode arrayed detection mainly due to the independent effect of microwave pulses on the baseline noise, but photodiode array detection was finally chosen as it allowed a simultaneous detection of nonfluorescent compounds. Finally, a determination of the content of the vitamin E homologs was carried out in different vegetable oils. Results were coherent with those found in the literature...|$|E

Such ultrafast transition is induced by strong changes in the atomic potential energy surface, which trigger atomic relocation. However, heating of a material due to the electron-phonon coupling {{can also lead to}} a phase transition, called 'thermal melting'. This thermal melting can occur even if the excited-electron density is much too low to induce non-thermal effects.

40|$|A {{hundred years}} {{passed since the}} {{discovery}} of superconductivity, {{but it is only}} during last decades superconductors transformed from exotic object for physical experiments to practically promising materials. During this time new theoretical concepts, measurement techniques and fabrication methods were invented in order to study these materials. New types of superconductors were discovered. It is hard to overestimate current impact of superconductivity in modern life: the most sensitive devices (SQUIDs) based on Josephson effect, loss-free cables for electric networks in Tokyo and New York, high-speed levitating trains in China and Japan, high-field magnets for magneto-resonance imaging and power generators, and other applications have become available. One of the most popular and well studied superconducting material is a YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO) high-temperature superconductor (HTSC). High working temperatures, high transport currents and technological effectiveness enable a potential of YBCO application in all possible areas from industrial power applications to microelectronics. Hence, a technological control or enhancement of YBCO performance is of current importance. Moreover, well studied YBCO is a good model material to study some physical aspects of HTSC behaviour which are not answered or not quantified. Enhancement of superconducting properties or even novel physical effects can be obtained combining superconducting and ferromagnetic materials (so-called hybrids). FePt ferromagnetic material is of a particular interest for application in highfield hybrids because of high coercive force and magnetic anisotropy. In addition FePt is promising for “traditional” applications of ferromagnets, such as magnetic recording media, micro-electro mechanical systems or high energy product magnets. However, high degree of technological control is required in order to reach necessary performance of FePt. Functional materials, such as YBCO or FePt, demonstrate their best performance or reveal certain physical effects in form of thin films. In this work large degree of control on structure of quasi-single crystal superconducting YBCO thin films and hard ferromagnetic L 10 -FePt thin films is demonstrated simply by varying laser frequency of pulsed laser deposition. Significant structural modifications have been obtained for the films of constant thicknesses. These modifications are shown to dramatically affect corresponding physical properties of thin films. In particular, critical temperature of YBCO thin films is shown to decrease with laser frequency. Moreover, a strong dependence on the laser frequency is discovered for the critical current density behaviour {{as a function of the}} applied magnetic field (Jc(Ba)) of YBCO films with the unexpected reversal of Jc(Ba) curves with temperature. The mechanisms of structure modifications of YBCO films and corresponding properties variations are discussed. In case of FePt thin films the experimental dependence of structure on laser frequency demonstrates the opposite growth development to the trend reported for the modulated flux in the literature. A theoretical model based on the mean field approach is developed, which quantitatively describes the structural changes obtained experimentally. Structure modulation of FePt thin films obtained by varying laser frequency result in modification of demagnetization mechanism and subsequent 20 -fold increase of coercive field. A sensitivity of physical properties to structure variation provides an instrumental ability for tuning the practical characteristics of these films by changing the laser frequency of their deposition. One of the most practically important characteristics of any superconductor is a critical current dependence on applied magnetic field (Jc(Ba)). Relatively high working temperature of YBCO modifies the concepts of critical current and vortex pinning, making description of Jc(Ba) more sophisticated. A new model of critical current density for high-quality YBCO thin films has been proposed, combining thermally activated flux creep with a vortex pinning on columnar defects. The pinning for thermally activated vortices has been described as a strong pinning on chains of individual edge dislocations that form low-angle domain boundaries in pulsed laser deposited high-quality YBCO thin films. An electric field criteria (Ecr) introduced into the model allows to apply it for description of critical current obtained by different measurement techniques. In addition, the dependence of the irreversibility field on the Ecr criterion can be obtained within the model. The dependences (Jc(Ba) for high-quality YBCO thin films over the entire applied magnetic field range were obtained using MPMS, VSM PPMS and four-probe method. Thus, the measurements of Jc(Ba) were done employing Ecr varied in 9 order of magnitude range. Transport current and quasi-equilibrium magnetization measurement data were successfully fitted by the developed model with appropriate electric field criteria. Hence, for the first time the model consolidates substantially different Jc(Ba) dependences of YBCO thin films obtained by different measurement techniques. At the same time the dynamic magnetization measurements of the Jc(Ba) obtained using VSM strongly depend on instrumentally defined parameters, introducing inconsistencies in the experimental results. The model calculations are able to explain the Jc(Ba) curves only if the instrumental vibrations affecting vortex behaviour are minimised. Further, a systematic study on the behaviour of superconductors with varied VSM settings (frequency f and amplitude A of vibration) is presented. It was shown that the vibration affects critical currents of all possible types of superconductors during their measurement employing VSM magnetometer regardless geometry of the sample, vortex pinning properties or measurement temperature. Enhancement of vibration frequency or amplitude leads to a progressive reduction of critical current density with applied magnetic field. The vibration effect is more intense for thin films, it is responsible for development of unexpected kinks on Jc(Ba) curves in thin films. The study of magnetic moment dependence of YBCO film on applied magnetic field measured at different VSM settings revealed the asymmetry of the vibration effect on ascending and descending magnetic field branches of magnetization, indicating uneven states of vortex lattice in these branches. In addition, certain thermal response of magnetization to vibration with high f and A was detected. Investigation of magnetization relaxation process of YBCO film showed that the vibration effect in general can be interpreted as a suppressed pinning potential where the thermal response is one of the sources for pinning reduction. Critical current measurements in YBCO film using VSM with magnetic field sweep rate scaled with vibration frequency (f/(dBa/dt)) revealed a strong <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effect</b> of vibration on dynamics of vortices. The vibration effect, reducing the Jc(Ba), decreases irreversibility field of YBCO thin films. It was demonstrated how a technically defined irreversibility field B*irr can be a useful characteristic that reflects the vibration effect on entire Jc(Ba) dependence. It was discussed that the effect of vibration on magnetization, relaxation of magnetization, critical current and irreversibility field is governed by thermal and magnetic fluctuations of vortex structure in oscillating superconducting sample. The role of thermal fluctuations is relatively small: estimated enhancement of temperature induced by vibration does not exceed 1 K. The major impact is expected from magnetic fluctuations, which promote relaxation of vortex lattice in sweeping magnetic field, reduce effectively the pinning potential and degrade the critical current. The mechanism of forced relaxation is expected to be similar to “vortex shaking” mechanism where magnetic periodic perturbations create local ac currents and “shake” vortices out of pinning centres. In order to understand a microscopic nature of vibration effect on YBCO film, a behaviour of vortices in 300 nm YBCO film in 1 T and 2 T of applied magnetic field and 77 K were simulated employing Langeving molecular dynamic simulation. In general, results of simulations confirmed a dominating role of out-of-plane dislocations of relatively low density in establishing the critical current of YBCO films; weak pinning centres of much higher density have only marginal effect. Depinning currents obtained in simulated magnetic fields without vibration are in a good agreement with critical currents measured by VSM. Vibration at 1 T makes interaction of vortices with weaker pinning centres completely negligible, while pinning on out-of-plane dislocations still is effective. Shaking of vortices in 2 T decreases depinning current more substantially then at 1 T, assisting to depinning from all kinds of pinning centres including dislocations. In addition, shaking induces a peak effect behaviour of I-V characteristic. The origin of peak effect (vortex lattice orderdisorder transition vs. matching effect) is determined by applied magnetic field. This difference in vortex behaviour is responsible for switching theJc(Ba) trend at magnetic field of the kink developed by vibration of YBCO film. Finally it was noticed, that vibration of Nb film subjected to flux jumps reduce magnetization (Mfj) and enhance the field second magnetization peak (BSMP). The increase of BSMP implies that vibration induces transition from critical state to undercritical flux jump mediated state. Behaviour of Mfj and BSMP together with other evidences presented justify the self-organised criticality nature of flux jumps in Nb films during magnetometery (represented by a sandpile) instead of commonly assumed thermo-magnetic instability origin. A simple expression for fitting Mfj(Ba) affected by vibration was designed considering avalanche process in a flow-like regime. Fitting of Mfj(Ba) allowed to estimate a nonuniformity of magnetic field in a sample space (approx. 10 − 5) ...|$|E
40|$|A radio {{frequency}} (RF) dielectric heater {{has been developed}} for isolating thermal and <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> of RF energy on microorganisms in liquid foods. The modified heater enables the simultaneous application of RF energy and removal of thermal energy from the liquids. A double-pipe heat exchanger {{is an integral part}} of the heater. The outer pipe is made of Teflon. The inner pipe is made of stainless steel that is grounded in the RF circuit. Liquid food flows through the annular region between the two concentric pipes. Cooling water flows through the stainless steel pipe. The food in the annular region absorbs the RF energy. Concurrently, the cooling water flowing in the inner pipe removes the thermal energy from the food, thus controlling the temperature...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{have been}} made of a nondispersive spectroscopic X-ray {{detector}} which operates by measuring the temperature rise following absorption of a single photon. Thermal pulses from 6 -keV X-rays have been observed, and the different amplitudes resulting from Mn K-alpha and K-beta events have been resolved. This device was assembled to make quantitative tests of theoretical calculations of the properties of such detectors, and its high heat capacity does not allow it to attain the very high resolution predicted for detectors made by more sophisticated, but still straightforward, techniques. Both the measured resolution of 270 -eV full width at half maximum and the absolute amplitude of the response are consistent with predictions. <b>Nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> in the thermistor limit the precision of this comparison to about 30 percent...|$|R

BEMS,WHO, and the Precautionary Principle – Blank & Goodman I cite The WHO EMF program {{would do well to}} acknowledge recent biological research and promote forward looking policies {{in the spirit of the}} Precautionary Principle, rather than continue to insist that the status quo is just fine. Our environment is changing rapidly, both in the power frequency range, but especially in the growing RF background from radio, TV, and cell phone transmission. At a minimum, the WHO should incorporate recent scientific advances into its policies and support the inclusion of <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> in risk assessment. The WHO should also support safety standards that take into account the cumulative effects of EMF exposures across the spectrum Yours truly...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Emission by the H 3 + {{molecular}} ion {{may be important}} in determining the energy balance in astrophysical situations, such as in (exo) planetary atmospheres. Here we report the calculation of a new cooling function, based on refitted partition functions and a recalculation of the total energy emitted by the molecule. This new function gives significantly increased cooling at higher temperatures, typical of {{those found in the}} atmospheres of gas giants. It is shown that <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> also need to be considered. A link to a web-based code to calculate radiative cooling in H 2 /H 3 + gas mixtures, including the effects of departures from equilibrium, is provided. The existence of a species with a mass-to-charge ratio of 3 was first reported by J. J. Thomson 1 in 1911, which he originally labeled X 3. At lectures at the Royal Institutio...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of possible nonthermal bio-effects {{has been an}} open question during the last five decades. In this paper, the authors present a critical literature review of the models of the interaction mechanisms, together with an overview of all the publications finding positive results for in vitro and in vivo studies. The systematic approach consisted of pooling together the positive studies {{on the basis of}} the endpoints and the biological systems, to identify specific plausible targets of the action of the electromagnetic fields and the related pathways. Such a classification opens the way to the discussion of some hypotheses of interaction mechanisms considered as first transduction step. The authors conclude that only through a multiscale methodology it is possible to perform a comprehensive study of the <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects,</b> based on affordable and realistic in silico models...|$|R

40|$|With an {{automated}} computerized temperature control and a specialized temperature measurement system, dry spores of Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger {{were treated with}} heat simultaneously in a convection dry-heat oven and a microwave oven. The temperature of the microwave oven was monitored such that the temperature profiles of the spore samples in both heat sources were nearly identical. Under these experimental conditions, we unequivocally demonstrated that the mechanism of sporicidal action of the microwaves was caused solely by thermal <b>effects.</b> <b>Nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> were not significant in a dry microwave sterilization process. Both heating systems showed that a dwelling time of more than 45 min was required to sterilize 10 (5) inoculated spores in dry glass vials at 137 degrees C.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} carried out to assess, for the first time, the effect of ohmic heating on the {{carotenoid}} profile of two citrus fruit juices: grapefruit and blood orange. Two heat treatments were designed to obtain pasteurization values of 50 and 150 min (Tref= 70 °C and z-value= 10 °C) with ohmic heating as compared to conventional heating. The results showed that xanthophyll losses could reach 70 % for epoxyxanthophylls (cis-violaxanthin and cis-antheraxanthin) and 40 % for hydroxyxanthophylls (β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin) with conventional heating, but losses were under 30 % and 20 %, respectively, with ohmic heating. Carotene species (lycopene and β-carotene) were stable regardless of the treatment. No negative <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> of ohmic heating were shown on carotenoids. Loss simulations of the studied carotenoids showed that the high temperatures reached with ohmic heating during pasteurization could substantially increase the organoleptic and nutritional quality of acid carotenoid-rich juices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Using the Hα line {{intensity}} as a constraint, {{we study}} {{the role of}} a chromospheric condensation and the role of <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> in producing the continuum enhancement of white-light flares. Within an acceptable range of Hα line intensities and electron energy flux, it is shown that neither a chromospheric condensation nor non-thermal effects alone can directly explain the observed continuum enhancement. The hybrid role of both chromospheric condensation and non-thermal effects can only lead to a Balmer jump, but still not to a significant continuum intensity increase between 4000 and 7000 ˚A. A possible picture is discussed, that is, the Balmer jump is directly produced by the association of a chromospheric condensation and of non-thermal effects, while the continuum enhancement between 4000 and 7000 ˚A is indirectly produced by the condensation and the non-thermal effects via radiative heating to the deeper photospheric layers...|$|R

Twenty-one males in {{the age group of}} 25 to 35 years, who were regular users of mobile phones, participated in the study. Audio-visual response times (ART & VRT) were recorded under basal condition. Same variables were recorded after a five minute conversation on landline and on mobile phones. Paired t-test was used for statistical analysis. It was observed that following conversation on mobile phones, ART changed from 231. 58 ± 26. 04 to 210. 9 ± 25. 22 millisecond (P< 0. 001) and VRT from 213. 29 ± 24. 16 to 198. 94 ± 35. 62 (P< 0. 001). However there was no statistically significant alteration in these variables following conversation over landline phones. The observed changes are attributable to thermal and <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects</b> of radio-frequency radiations of mobile phones...|$|R

This Colloquium explores the approaches to produce plasmas with nanometer dimensions and the arising physical phenomena and properties {{associated with this}} extreme, nonequilibrium state of matter. Analysis of the spatial confinement, coupling, ideality, and degeneracy criteria lead to the possibilities to produce transient nanoplasma states near, in, and from solids by using ultrafast photoexcitation. These states arise through the interplay of nonequilibrium, many-body Coulomb interactions, thermal, and <b>nonthermal</b> <b>effects.</b> Examples include photoexcited electron-hole plasmas in semiconductors, transient solid-to-plasma states including warm dense matter, nanoplasmas produced by interaction of nanoclusters and nanoparticles with intense radiation, nanoplasmas in high-energy ion tracks within solids, nanoplasmas in relativistic regime, and others.
