5|$|During {{the postwar}} era, Indiana became a {{critical}} swing state that often helped decide which party controlled the presidency. Elections were very close, {{and became the}} center of frenzied attention with many parades, speeches and rallies as election day approached; voter turnout ranging over 90% to near 100% in such elections as 1888 and 1896. In remote areas, both sides paid their supporters to vote, and occasionally paid supporters of the opposition not to vote. Despite allegations, historians have found very little fraud in <b>national</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 1941, during World War II, {{when the}} Vichy French were {{in control of}} Syria, Quwatli called for {{immediate}} Syrian independence amid a period of food shortages, high unemployment and widespread nationalist rioting in the country.

France officially recognized Syria's independence on 27 September. However, French troops were not withdrawn and <b>national</b> <b>elections</b> were postponed by the French Mandatory authorities.|$|E

5|$|One of Ford's {{greatest}} challenges {{was dealing with}} the continued Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for <b>national</b> <b>elections</b> in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1943 <b>national</b> <b>elections</b> in French Mandatory Syria, the French {{authorities}} {{attempted to}} negotiate with Quwatli {{as head of the}} National Bloc to issue a treaty that guaranteed an independent Syria's alignment and close military cooperation with France, in return for French help in securing Quwatli's election to the presidency. Quwatli refused, believing the Syrian people would view such negotiations negatively. He was also confident that the National Bloc would win the elections regardless of French support. Quwatli did win the vote, becoming Syria's president on 17 August 1943.|$|E

Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E

The Vietminh announced that they would abolish the mandarin governance system and hold <b>national</b> <b>elections</b> with universal suffrage in two hold.

5|$|The American Civil War altered Indiana's society, politics, and economy, {{beginning}} a population shift to central and northern Indiana, {{and contributed to}} a relative decline {{in the southern part}} of the state. Increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth in Hoosier cities and towns ushered in a new era of economic prosperity. By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural state than it previously had been. Indiana's votes were closely split between the parties for several decades after the war, making it one of a few key swing states that often decided <b>national</b> <b>elections.</b> Between 1868 and 1916, five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets.

The Liberal-Courtier cabinet did not survive long, however, and its ministers presented their resignations in turn. On 23 March 1841, a new cabinet was nominated that included Aureliano Coutinho from the Courtier Faction and other ministers drawn from the Reactionary Party.|$|E
