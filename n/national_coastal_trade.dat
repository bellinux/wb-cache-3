50|$|A {{thriving}} <b>coastal</b> <b>trade</b> rapidly {{developed with}} commodities from rural ports being transported to Adelaide. Initially ships were loaded from the shore, sometimes by beaching a ship at high tide {{so that it}} could be loaded direct form carts at low tide and sailed off on the subsequent high tide. With its lack of natural harbours and relatively calm gulf waters, jetties came {{to play an important role}}. These jetties are now a distinctive feature of many South Australian towns and the coastline of Adelaide. South Australia came to play an important role in the clipper ship trade collecting bulk goods from South Australia's coastal ports and transporting them to Europe. The state became a last stand of the clipper industry, with the last trade dying out in the 1950s. The <b>coastal</b> <b>trade</b> involving sailing ketches only ended in the early 1980s with the Nelcebee and the Falie being the last two ships to participate in the <b>coastal</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and analyses}} {{the development of}} Swedish exports to the Soviet Union during the perestroika period, both in general and {{with regard to the}} specific case of the <b>coastal</b> <b>trade</b> between these countries using the Uppsala model's concepts of learning, the liability of foreignness, and the liability of outsidership. During this period the Soviet foreign trade system went through a significant reorganisation, with foreign trade being decentralised and newactorsbeing established, although the source material indicates that this decentralisation was less disruptive to the <b>coastal</b> <b>trade</b> than in general. It concludes that the different outcomes seen in these cases could be attributed to the <b>coastal</b> <b>trade</b> being less affected by the liability of outsidership than the general case. With regard to learning, it concludes that experiential knowledge, both from personal experience and network sources, is necessary in order to evaluate objective knowledge, as this can also be seen in the source material...|$|R
