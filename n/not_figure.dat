5|$|In 2006, a new registry, the Foundation Foxtrotter Heritage Association (FFHA), {{was formed}} {{with a goal}} of {{preserving}} and promoting the original heritage type of Fox Trotter that {{was seen in the}} first 20 years of the MFTHBA registry, in large part through reducing the amount of Tennessee Walking Horse blood. The Tennessee Walker did <b>not</b> <b>figure</b> prominently in original Missouri Fox Trotter pedigrees, and so the FFHA, by restricting the amount of Walker blood, is attempting to develop horses that more closely resemble the original Fox Trotter type.|$|E
5|$|Stage 12 of the 2009 Giro d'Italia {{took place}} on 21 May; the race {{concluded}} with Stage 21 on 31 May. The {{second half of the}} Giro began with a long and challenging individual time trial in Cinque Terre. It was in this time trial that Denis Menchov took the overall lead in the race. This was followed by a flat stage, after which most of the sprinters in the Giro withdrew from the race, as they did <b>not</b> <b>figure</b> to be in contention in the hilly and mountainous stages to follow.|$|E
5|$|As one of Harun's younger sons, Abu Ishaq was {{initially}} of little consequence, and did <b>not</b> <b>figure</b> {{in the line}} of succession. During the civil war between his elder half-brothers al-Amin (r. 809–813) and al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) he remained in Baghdad, and, like most members of the Abbasid dynasty and the Abbasid aristocracy (abnāʾ al-dawla), he supported the anti-caliph Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi in 817–819. Al-Tabari records that Abu Ishaq led the Hajj pilgrimage in 816, accompanied by many troops and officials, among whom was Hamdawayh ibn Ali ibn Isa ibn Maham, who had just been appointed to the governorship of the Yemen and was on his way there. During his stay in Mecca, his troops defeated and captured a pro-Alid leader who had raided the pilgrim caravans. He also led the pilgrimage in the next year, but no details are known.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{pay-per-view}} {{focused on}} the tournament, few major feuds were highlighted. Aside from Owen Hart, the tournament did <b>not</b> <b>figure</b> prominently into the future storylines {{of any of the}} other participants. The qualifying match between the 1–2–3 Kid and Adam Bomb did, however, help advance a storyline. Bomb and Kwang, both managed by Harvey Wippleman, began feuding shortly after King of the Ring when Wippleman and Kwang turned on Bomb. Bomb began wrestling as a face as a result. Their feud did not end with a major blow off match, however. Instead, it was quietly resolved in a dark match prior to the SummerSlam 1994 broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Meredith {{signed for}} League Two team Shrewsbury Town on 14 January 2008 on a one-and-a-half-year {{contract}} after training with the club, {{which included a}} clause that after making five appearances the contract could be renegotiated. He made his debut on 23 February 2008 in the 2–1 home defeat to Hereford United, finishing the 2007–08 season with three appearances, with his final match coming against Rochdale {{on the last day}} of the season. He was told that he did <b>not</b> <b>figure</b> in new manager Paul Simpson's immediate plans in July 2008, being left behind as the club travelled to Spain on a pre-season training camp.|$|E

25|$|Documents {{indicate}} that Teignmouth {{was a significant}} port by the early 14th century, second in Devon only to Dartmouth. It was attacked by the French in 1340 and sent seven ships and 120 men to the expedition against Calais in 1347. Its relative importance waned during the 15th century, and it did <b>not</b> <b>figure</b> in an official record of 1577. This {{may have been due}} to silting up of the harbour caused by tin mining on Dartmoor.|$|E

25|$|The inner gallery {{is nearly}} filled by the upper terrace, raised one level higher again. The lack of {{space between the}} inner gallery and the upper terrace has led {{scholars}} {{to conclude that the}} upper terrace did <b>not</b> <b>figure</b> in the original plan for the temple, but that it was added shortly thereafter following a change in design. Originally, it is believed, the Bayon had been designed as a single-level structure, similar in that respect to the roughly contemporaneous foundations at Ta Prohm and Banteay Kdei.|$|E
25|$|Dewes was a protegé of E. J. H. Nash, the British Evangelical Anglican clergyman (along {{with fellow}} cricketer David Sheppard). In 1945, {{he was one}} of three {{relative}} unknowns from public schools included in the England side for the third Victory Test against Australia at Lord's (it was his first-class debut). The others were Donald Carr from Repton School and the Etonian, Luke White. Dewes had left Aldenham School the previous year.

25|$|According to some reports, the Komsomolsk-na-Amure {{installation}} in the Russian Far East {{was taken}} off combat alert duty in November 1989, {{and some of its}} equipment was subsequently scrapped. The original Duga-1 site lies within the 30 kilometer Zone of Alienation around the Chernobyl power plant. It appears to have been permanently deactivated, since their continued maintenance did <b>not</b> <b>figure</b> in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over the active Dnepr early warning radar systems at Mukachevo and Sevastopol.

25|$|The {{system did}} <b>not</b> <b>figure</b> {{in all other}} social groups present in premodern Chinese society, and its broad {{categories}} were more an idealization than a practical reality.

The definition of {{the identity of the}} shi class changed over time—from an ancient warrior class, to an aristocratic scholarly elite, and finally to a bureaucratic scholarly elite with less emphasis on archaic noble lineage. There was also a gradual fusion of the wealthy merchant and landholding gentry classes, culminating in the late Ming Dynasty.|$|E
