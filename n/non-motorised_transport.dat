40|$|We are {{witnessing}} a {{growing interest in}} <b>non-motorised</b> modes of <b>transport,</b> {{due in large part}} to concerns over the negative side effects of car usage. The increased levels of traffic have already resulted in many cities suffering from serious problems in the areas of: safety, congestion and pollution. Some of these problems could be solved if the number of short car journeys were reduced and replaced by walking. Many of our travel routines are influenced by a number of factors such as socio-economic, demographic, together with needs and attitudes. An important step in the direction of developing general concepts for the implementation of supportive measures for walking would therefore be to collect enough background information about the traveller him/herself. The results from different studies have found that in general people’s attitudes are very positive about walking if the conditions are right. One important factors is distance others are comfort, traffic, perception of safety, security and aesthetics.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Transportation research has mostly focused on urban elements of development, and quite often, urban transportation planning methods and models are imported to rural transportation practice with negligible changes resulting almost always in ineffective solutions. The tide has begun to change though as planners are beginning to craft interventions {{that are relevant to}} rural areas as the example of a project discussed in this paper shows. The North West Province is predominantly rural, characterized by dispersed towns, villages and other land-uses with varying activities. Given the dispersed nature of settlement patterns, the Provincial Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport embarked on various non-motorised interventions for schools around Ngaka-Modiri Molema District Municipality (NMMD) in an attempt to address in part the legacy of apartheid planning. These interventions are being implemented within the ambit of inclusive and relevant rural transport policy and implementation programs. This paper reviews the prevailing transport development policy context in the North West Province with specific reference to the NMMD. It then describes the non-motorised bicycles project, which has been implemented {{in order to ensure that}} scholars in NMMD exercise their democratic right of accessing basic education, as most scholars walk in excess of 5 kilometers to school. The paper briefly reflects on scholar mobility in order to clarify the policy discourse and rationale that underpinned the planning and implementation of the NMMD <b>non-motorised</b> scholar <b>transport</b> project. This paper relies heavily on a review of mostly NMMD transport policies, literature and interventions. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

40|$|During {{a period}} of {{economic}} reform, the People's Republic of China has emerged as an important market for multinational automobile manufacturers {{and a source of}} concern for “sustainable transport” advocates worried about the long-term sustainability of systems based on private automobiles and fossil fuels. Much of the growth in China's motor vehicle fleet and the negative consequences of that growth has been concentrated in China's large, economically dynamic coastal cities. Based on a large standardised 1995 database on urban transport, this paper compares characteristics of three of China's largest cities with cities around the world. This international comparative perspective suggests that in 1995, Chinese cities still had exceptionally high use of <b>non-motorised</b> and public <b>transport</b> modes. However, some characteristics of these cities indicated a high potential for extensive and rapid growth in private motor vehicles which could generate significant problems in the future. In particular, the relatively high population density and lack of reserved public transport routes suggested that the potential for highly concentrated negative impacts were in place, while the means of moving large numbers of people with lesser polluting modes of transport than the private motor vehicle were not in place. Finally, data on investment in public transport and freeways indicated that in the early 1990 s the conditions were being created for rapid and continued motorisation. While in 1995 China's cities in some ways approximated a “sustainable transport” ideal, this is likely to have already changed substantially...|$|R

40|$|Transport {{accounting}} and accountability, {{in addition to}} traditional infrastructure costs (i. e. vehicle and service operation), now include sustainability considerations: costs {{in terms of the}} environment, society and time spent in transit. This new perspective has highlighted the elevated expense of current daily mobility models in Western society, which are based on massive use of the car. We can see a willingness in present political agendas to change this mobility model for one which would reduce these high costs. These are primarily based on positive discrimination policies towards <b>non-motorised</b> and collective <b>transport</b> models which are reinforced by territorial management policies that promote proximity to the work place and services, as well as the use of high-capacity public transport means. Mobility model studies have generally tended to approach this topic from the perspective of actions taken by public administrations (i. e. providing more public transport vehicles or alternative criteria for managing parking spaces), overlooking the many and varied contributions by representatives of non-public administration organisations that play an active role in generating daily mobility. Therefore, in this paper we look at the contributions of these organisations to this changing model. The particular focus of our analysis is the largest trade union in Catalonia, Comissions Obreres, and its role in shaping a new scenario for work-related mobility, seen as an organisation that not only makes claims and negotiates with public administrations and employers’ associations, but also propagates new mobility models among its own members...|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} our {{aim is to}} {{contribute}} to building a stratified understanding of the scenarios we might be looking at with respect to future daily mobility. In past decades, various scenarios of future mobilities have been visualised [7 – 11], central among them being challenges related to climate change from growing emissions of CO 2 and potential strategies towards achieving changes. Concerns {{about the risk of}} terrorism and criminality, erosion of the modern state at its democratic systems and the rise of neoliberalism have also been discussed. The role of new technologies, however, has been recognised as the most influential parameter for future mobility. Dennis and Urry [12] have proposed three general visions of the future of mobilities that capture several dimensions represented in much of the current literature: “Local Sustainability” describes an environmental-communitarianism future where long-distance travel is reduced because of resource shortages and where localised low carbon journeys by <b>non-motorised</b> forms of <b>transport</b> and movement come to dominate alongside motorised forms. A second vision, labelled “Regional Warlordism”, describes a future witnessed by an implosion of mobility, where movement is hard to achieve, dangerous outside certain boundaries and reliant on ingenuity of skills to maintain decaying car culture. In their final scenario, “Digital Networks of Control”, the author describes an Orwellian style future where collective automation of movement under constant surveillance replaces autonomous separateness with obvious implications for human freedom of movement. These visions have proved to be influential in academic as well as policy-oriented discussions.|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} decades, {{residents}} {{have moved to}} the suburbs {{in order to satisfy}} their desire for a house with a garden. Being far less accessible than residences in cities, these suburban areas often require longer commuting distances and motorised travel and therefore cause greater emissions and energy consumption than compact development. Recently, new living concepts that combine suburban housing types with urban amenities are emerging within the urban fabric. In this paper it will be discussed if these new living concepts promote energy efficient mobility and if they are an alternative to suburban residences. By analysing the daily mobility of residents living in a new inner-city area in Berlin, the results suggest that this area mostly attracts families who welcomed the combination of living in a central location with good public transport access and having a house with a garden. In the context of daily mobility, an interesting mismatch was found: over 80 % of the households have a car – this is highly above average in Berlin. However, the residents make more than half of their trips by foot or by bike. Nonetheless, the potential for sustainable land use and travel behaviour is not fully exploited. Simple urban planning measures, such as providing less private parking spaces, ensuring a fine mix of uses and proximity to public transport can – at least to a small extent – further promote <b>non-motorised</b> and public <b>transport</b> modes and therefore reduce emissions due to motorised private transport in urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Transport {{and public}} health {{researchers}} have a shared interest in the promotion of active travel. Walking and cycling are activities that may help achieve health benefits, while also contributing to wider sustainability goals, such as a reduction in carbon emissions from transport, and improvements in air pollution and congestion. A variety of interventions {{have been used to}} promote travel behaviour change, for example, infrastructure change and personalised travel planning. Some researchers have directed their interest towards the potential of technology and visual representation to motivate and engage individuals to become more sustainable. Computer visualisation tools may be an instrument to prompt behaviour change, leading to a shift towards more active modes of travel. Visualisation technology has been used for multiple purposes including raising awareness of global environmental problems, scenario modelling and the representation of walking and cycling futures. Recently, the availability of large data sets has led to the visualisation of system usage data from cycle hire schemes. Elsewhere, various representations of personal journey data have been evaluated in terms of their capabilities to change behaviour. Currently it is thought that the technical possibilities of visualisations exceed the knowledge of their correct application. Therefore, methods and guidelines for producing and applying visualisations are required. To our knowledge, tThere has been no evaluation of use of a visualisation that shows infrastructure change to promote active travel. Participants were asked to watch a computer visualisation of a new walking and cycling route in Glasgow. This animated visualisation included an existing segregated cycling facility and pedestrian and cyclist bridge. Eleven semi-structured interviews and two focus groups considered the potential utility of visualisation in promoting a new walking and cycling facility and identified any limitations of this approach and potential improvements. The results suggested that visualisation technology has the potential to stimulate debate on in-journey accounts of active travel and the embodied experience of cycling. The built environment and psychosocial factors that culminate in road user conflicts were discussed. The perception of <b>non-motorised</b> modes of <b>transport</b> as risky was not overlooked by participants, who shared their knowledge of cycling road safety and ‘correct’ walking and cycling behaviours. Participants responded positively to the appearance of protection from traffic by the new routes. However, many criticised the limited coverage of the visualisation and low traffic volumes. The decision to cycle is often made in the context of real-life constraints that were not fully replicated in this visualisation. Further development of visualisation technology may be needed before it can be used successfully for active travel interventions...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{transport}} has {{played an important role}} in causing various problems including environmental destruction, resource depletion, global warming, social segregation, congestion and inequality in cities around the world. The situation could be even serious in urban China. As a country in transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, China has been experiencing unprecedentedly fast motorisation, which has resulted in a decline in <b>non-motorised</b> and public <b>transport,</b> increasing traffic congestions, air pollution and fatal casualties. Unfortunately, the trend is more than likely to continue in the future. Therefore, knowledge of changing travel behaviour in China is urgently needed. This is especially so considering that existing literature draws disproportionally on data from North American, North-western Europe, Australia and Japan and little is knew about travel behaviour outside the western world, including China. Given that the context of urban China is different in several respects-socio-cultural norms, institutional setting, built environment, and special development stage-from western countries, an empirical study into travel behaviour in China could thus have important practical relevance in helping to adjust transport-planning practices to the Chinese context as well as significant scientific relevance to understand the importance of urban China’s different contexts for transport behaviour and get a deeper, more complete understanding of travel behaviour and its determinants in general. In this research, an empirical analysis is carried out to demonstrate the situations of travel behaviour of Nanjing residents and its determinants. Using the dataset of Nanjing Resident Travel Survey (NRTS), the research examines travel behaviour in Nanjing Metropolitan Area by employing various regression models including OLS model, logistic model, ordered probit model and changing parameter model. This research finds that the characteristics of travel behaviour and its determinants in Nanjing display a number of similarities with travel behaviour in western cities but at the same time, there are some important differences. More importantly, the empirical analyses in the dissertation show that the specific Chinese context-socio-cultural norms, institutional setting, built environment, and special development stage-matters. The research also delivers some implications for transport policies. The results in this dissertation confirm that that land use can influence travel behaviour significantly. This proved link between land use and travel behaviour gives the premise for implementing land use policy initiatives to reduce private car use. However, the analysis also shows that compactness alone serves as a necessary but not as a sufficient condition for diminished car use. To reduce car use, Chinese governments should also provide alternatives to private cars. Based on the research results of the dissertation, for short distances, it is highly recommended that urban China should preserve as much as possible the configurations of compact land use to stimulate walking and cycling as the main transport modes to limit car use. In the meanwhile, to replace car use for long distances, the governments should heavily invest in fast public transport to promote public transport as the major mode...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. T. R. P.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. Currently, {{the global}} agenda of {{sustainability}} {{and sustainable development}} have become the yardstick to which human activities are measured. The concept of sustainability is known to contain directives, when implemented will ensure that resources are used in ways that can benefit current and future generations. The ways in which spatial planning and urban development occur have also become relevant in this respect. Within this premise, urban form has also become relevant to the urban sustainability. Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre is a private development modeled {{on the concept of}} New Urbanism. The concept of New Urbanism is known to contain elements which respond positively to current urban challenges such as urban sprawl, increased pollution from automobile dependency and socio-economic polarization. In essence, New Urbanism purports to contribute towards urban sustainability. The main objective of this research has been to ascertain {{the extent to which the}} current developments in Umhlanga Ridge satisfy the principles of New Urbanism and urban sustainability. This included the identification of appropriate indicators of a sustainable urban form. Emphasis was made on how the indicators of urban form had manifested in the development of Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre and the impacts they have had on identified urban challenges in the Ethekwini Municipality. The rationale was that sustainable urban development must be able to address local urban challenges and promote sustainable practices within the private and the public domain. The methodology for this research included the use of secondary and primary sources. Interviews were conducted with Tongaat Hulett Development in their capacity as a land owner and planners of the Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre. The Ethekwini Municipality was also interviewed with respect to what impacts this development had had on their overall long-term development strategy. Three renowned planners who had adequate knowledge of urban development trends in the Ethekwini Municipality were also interviewed. A questionnaire survey was undertaken with users of the Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre to gain their perceptions on urban form in relation to their needs. The research revealed that the application of New Urbanism in the development of Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre was partly an investment initiative for profit-maximisation as well as a response to sustainable practices in urban development. Being part of a major investment node in the Ethekwini region, it had contributed towards job creation and enhanced the economic base of the region. However, it was found to have partially fulfilled the principles of New Urbanism used in the assessment. It was concluded that the application of New Urbanism in urban development was not adequate to achieve urban sustainability but provided lessons which can be learnt such the use of high densities to enhance compaction and the creation of a living environment which supported <b>non-motorised</b> forms of <b>transport.</b> Private sector participation and buy-in into the long-term vision of regions had also become necessary to enhance the adoption of sustainable practices into the future...|$|R
