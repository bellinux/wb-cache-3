Many structural isomers are possible, {{depending on the}} location of the C=C double bond and the branching of the other parts of the molecule. Industrially, the most important nonenes are trimers of propene. This mixture of branched nonenes is used in the alkylation of phenol to produce nonylphenol, a precursor to detergents, which are also controversial pollutants.|$|E

The procedure includes treatment of SWNTs with amine vapors under reduced pressure and temperature of 160 - 170 ºC. Applicability of temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry for chemical {{characterization of the}} derivatized SWNTs was analyzed. Heating of the amine-treated SWNTs at temperature > 200 ºC causes cleavage of alkenes from the amine residues: <b>nonene</b> and pentene are formed {{in the case of}} nonylamine and dipentylamine, respectively...|$|E

50|$|Nonylphenol can be {{produced}} industrially, naturally, and by the environmental degradation of alkylphenol ethoxylates. Industrially, nonylphenols are produced by the acid-catalyzed alkylation of phenol {{with a mixture of}} <b>nonenes.</b> This synthesis leads to a very complex mixture with diverse nonylphenols. Theoretically there are 211 constitutional isomers and this number rise to 550 isomers if we take the enantiomers into account. To make NPEs, manufacturers treat NP with ethylene oxide under basic conditions. Since its discovery in 1940, nonylphenol production has increased exponentially, and between 100 and 500 million pounds of nonylphenol are produced globally every year, meeting the definition of High Production Volume Chemicals.|$|R
30|$|Nonylphenols {{derived from}} <b>nonene</b> {{are used to}} produce antioxidants, {{additives}} for lubricating oils, detergents and emulsifiers (Soares et al. 2008). Esters of heptanoic acid and decanoic acids are used as fragrances, artificial flavours and to esterify steroids for pharmaceutical applications (Tibor 2010; David and Milne 1993). A considerable amount of fuel based flammable hydrocarbons were also present in all four distillate fractions, {{and they were in}} the range of C 6 –C 17, whereas the fuel based hydrocarbons in the organic fraction of the pyrolitic oil of Na-soap were in the range of C 14 –C 16. In the pyrolysis of soybean and palm tree oil, hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids were found to be in the range of C 7 –C 15 whereas the hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids yielded in the pyrolysis of castor oil were in a considerably narrow range of C 15 –C 16 and C 11 –C 12 respectively (Lima et al. 2004). However, castor oil gave more oxygenated products such as ketones and phenols (Hanna 2011) which were not found in the pyrolysis of RSO.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 New syntheses for 2 -bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonanone and 7 -bicyclo-(3. 3. 1) nonen- 2 -one were developed. The {{saturated}} ketone {{was prepared}} from phenol and acrylonitrile via a novel intramolecular S[subscript N] 2 cyclization process. A Friedel-Crafts cyclization of 3 -(3 -cyclohexenyl) propanoyl chloride permitted {{synthesis of the}} unsaturated ketone from 4 -cyclohexene carboxaldehyde. The formation of the bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonane rather than a bicyclo(3. 2. 2) nonane skeleton in the Friedel-Crafts cyclization was proven by comparative mass spectrometry. An attempt to prepare 2 -bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonyl acetate by solvolysis of 3 -(3 -cyclohexenyl) propyl tosylate led only to monocyclic products. The influence of the proximity of carbons 3 and 7 on the chemistry of the bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonane ring was studied via the transannular reactions from 2 -bicyclo(3. 3. 1) <b>nonene</b> oxide. This epoxide was shown to be the exo- 2, 3 -epoxide by reduction to the known exo- 2 -bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonanol.

The Taguchi experimental gents a non account for 80 % of the APE produced, while the remaining 20 % is basically octylphenol ethoxylates (Renner, 1997). In the manufac-turing process, APs are produced through alkylation of phenol with octene or <b>nonene</b> {{in the presence of}} an acid catalyst, preferentially alkylates at the para position of phenol, and then APEs are produced by the ethoxylation of APs (European Commission, 2002). APEs are discharged into wastewater treatment facilities or directly released into the environment (Ying et al., 2002). It turers of detergents in some countries (European Commission, 2002). Many researchers have reported on the wide occurrence of APs in the environment matrices, included air (Xie et al., 2006), surface water (Cheng et al., 2006), wastewater and tap water (Diaz et al., 2002), and sediment (Peng et al., 2006).

40|$|AbstractIon-molecule {{reactions}} {{of a number}} of alkene molecular ions with different neutral alkenes were studied in a quadrupole ion trap equipped with a pulsed sample-inlet system. The molecules studied include several isomeric unbranched hexenes, heptenes, octenes, and <b>nonenes,</b> as well as representative alkenes with ten, twelve, fourteen, and twenty-three carbon atoms. Transfer of structurally characteristic number of methylene units between the ionic and neutral reactants dominates the product distributions for all the alkenes studied, with the exception of 1 -alkenes. Isomeric alkenes can be readily distinguished {{on the basis of their}} products from reactions with neutral alkenes. It is suggested that distonic intermediates are generated in these reactions, and that they fragment by alkene elimination after 1, 2 - and 1, 5 -hydride shifts. The ability to vary the reaction time, pressure of the neutral reagents, and the type of ions and neutral molecules present in the reaction chamber during each stage of the experiment sequence makes it possible to maximize the amount of structural information obtained for alkenes in these experiments. Use of CS 2 ∓ to generate the alkene molecular ion by charge exchange yields the same information without the need to carry out a mass-selection step for the ionized alkene...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{preparation}} of 4 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) cyclohexanone and of 4 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) cyclohexene {{and a number}} of their derivatives as potential precursors of asymmetrically substituted bicyclo [3, 3, 1] nonanes is described. The ketone, 4 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) cyclohexanone, was prepared from p-allylanisole by three different routes. Common to each route was an initial hydroboration-oxidation followed by a Birch reduction to give a 4 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) - 1 -methoxy- 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene. Mild acid hydrolysis and catalytic reduction converted this to the desired product. The enol-ether was converted also to the related acetate, then hydrolyzed and reduced to give 4 -(3 -acetoxypropyl) - cyclohexanone. Finally methanolysis of the enol-ether gave the dimethyl ketal and a series of related ketals was prepared from that substance. Readily available 4 -cyclohexenecarboxaldehyde was used to prepare 4 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) cyclohexene. This was accomplished via a normal chain elongation series employing a Grignard reaction with ethylene oxide as the crucial step. The tosylate of the unsaturated alcohol gave a mixture of unidentified acetates when solvolyzed. An attempt to prepare a comparison sample of 2 -acetoxy-bicyclo [3, 3, 1] nonane from cyclohexanone enamine and acrolein was abandoned where only a low yield of 2 -bicyclo [3, 3, 1] <b>nonene</b> was obtained on pyrolysis of the amine oxide of 2 -pyrollidinobicyclo- [3, 3, 1] nonane...|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that RSO and its Na-soap could be converted into SMOC by using the pyrolysis technique. The results of the pyrolysis of RSO confirm the potential of producing SMOC {{which can be used}} as valuable renewable organic chemical precursors similar to petrochemicals. However, the product obtained from the pyrolysis of Na-soap consisted of more saturated alkanes of C 14 –C 17 as found in diesel fuel. Therefore, pyrolysis of Na-soap of RSO is more suitable for producing fuel than petrochemicals. Some industrially utilised chemicals such as cyclohexane, <b>nonene,</b> heptanoic acid, decanoic acid and limonene were produced through the pyrolysis of RSO. The products obtained in the pyrolysis of RSO were similar to that of soybean oil and the range of products was found to be notably wider than the range of products obtained in the pyrolysis of several other fatty oils such as castor oil, palm tree oil and canola oil. The acidity and density of the distillates were found to increase with the distillation temperature. The thermal cleavage of triglycerides (TG) into free fatty acids (FFA) became significant above 150  °C and the end point of ester bonds in triglycerides was found to be at a temperature around 275  °C. The findings of this paper encourage future {{research in the area of}} pyrolysis as a renewable source for petrochemicals since currently we are currently within the declining phase of using crude oil.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{experimental}} study of the thermal decomposition of methyl decanoate was performed in a jet stirred reactor at temperatures ranging from 773 to 1123 K, at residence times between 1 and 4 s, at a pressure of 800 Torr (106. 6 kPa) and at high dilution in helium (fuel inlet mole fraction of 0. 0218). Species leaving the reactor were analyzed by gas chromatography. Main reaction products were hydrogen, carbon oxides, small hydrocarbons from C 1 to C 3, large 1 -olefins from 1 -butene to 1 <b>nonene,</b> and unsaturated esters with one double bond {{at the end of}} the alkyl chain from methyl 2 propenoate to methyl- 8 -nonenoate. At the highest temperatures, the formation of polyunsaturated species was observed: 1, 3 -butadiene, 1, 3 -cyclopentadiene, benzene, toluene, indene, and naphthalene. These results were compared with previous ones about the pyrolysis of n dodecane, an n-alkane of similar size. The reactivity of both molecules was found to be very close. The alkane produces more olefins while the ester yields unsaturated oxygenated compounds. A detailed kinetic model for the thermal decomposition of methyl decanoate has been generated using the version of software EXGAS which was updated to take into account the specific chemistry involved in the oxidation of methyl esters. This model contains 324 species and 3231 reactions. It provided a very good prediction of the experimental data obtained in jet-stirred reactor. The formation of the major products was analyzed. The kinetic analysis showed that the retro-ene reactions of intermediate unsaturated methyl esters are of importance in low reactivity systems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{transformation}} of decanoic acid, {{used as a}} model oxygenated compound, was first studied over Mo/Al 2 O 3 at 340 degrees C under 4 MPa of total pressure (H- 2 pressure equal to 2. 72 MPa) in a fixed-bed reactor. The deoxygenation of decanoic acid is considered to proceed through two main routes: (i) the HDO pathway yielding decenes and decane as ultimate hydrocarbons, oxygen being removed as water; (ii) the DEC pathway involving a decarbonylation reaction and mainly leading to <b>nonene</b> isomers, oxygen being discarded as water and carbon monoxide. Other products such as oygenates (mainly decanal and 1 -decanol) and sulfur-containing products (mainly 1 -decanethiol) appeared as intermediates of the HDO way. A significant inhibiting effect of carboxylic acid on the deoxygenation of decanal was highlighted. A general reaction scheme of deoxygenation of decanoic acid over sulfided catalysts was established. Considering a sulfur vacancy as an active site, deoxygenation reaction mechanisms were proposed involving a cationic species as a common intermediate between the HDO and the DEC pathways. The effect of Co and Ni on the deoxygenation rate of decanoic acid was measured by using both CoMo/Al 2 O 3 and NiMo/Al 2 O 3. The DEC route was strongly promoted by Co and Ni, whereas an inhibiting effect of Co and Ni was observed on the HDO route. It was assumed that the promoter effect on the DEC route may result from an increase of the basicity of sulfur anions neighbouring of Co or Ni present in the sulfided promoted phase...|$|E
