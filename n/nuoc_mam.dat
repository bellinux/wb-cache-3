In the central section of the country, people like using a less dilute form of <b>nước</b> <b>mắm</b> pha that has the same {{proportions}} of fish sauce, lime, and sugar as the recipe above, but less water, and with fresh chili. Southern Vietnamese people often use palm sugar and coconut water as the sweetener.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, chả lụa {{is made of}} lean pork, potato starch, garlic, {{ground black}} pepper and <b>nước</b> <b>mắm</b> (fish sauce). The pork has to be pounded until it becomes pasty; it cannot be chopped or ground as the meat would still be fibrous, dry, and crumbly. Near {{the end of the}} {{pounding}} period, a few spoonfuls of <b>nước</b> <b>mắm</b> are added to the meat for flavour, but salt, ground black pepper, and sugar can also be added. The meat is now called giò sống, meaning “raw sausage”, and can be used in other dishes as well.|$|E

5000|$|The {{required}} {{ingredients of}} bánh chưng are glutinous rice, mung bean, fatty pork and black pepper, salt, sometimes green onion, and <b>nước</b> <b>mắm</b> for spices. [...] In the wrapping stage, one needs lá dong, strings split from giang, {{one type of}} bamboo which has long node, and sometimes a square mold in wood so that bánh chưng can be wrapped in a better shape, lá dong, which is popular only in the Southern Asia, can be substituted by banana leaves or even lá bàng. Lá dong and giang strings have to be washed carefully {{in order to preserve}} the taste of the cake, giang strings may be soaked in salt water or steamed so that they can become flexible enough for wrapping. People often choose high quality rice and bean for making bánh chưng, they are soaked in water for 2 hours in case of mung bean and 12 to 14 hours in case of glutinous rice. The fat and lean pork is preferred for bánh chưng because its fatty flavour well associates with the glutinous rice and mung bean. After being sliced in big parts, pork is mixed with pepper, onion and salt or <b>nước</b> <b>mắm.</b> People in Bắc Ninh once added sugar in this mixture of spices.|$|E
5000|$|Bún thịt nướng ( [...] , rice noodles {{with grilled}} meat) {{is a popular}} Vietnamese cold rice-vermicelli noodle dish topped with grilled pork, fresh herbs like basil and mint, fresh salad, Giá (bean sprouts), and chả giò (spring rolls). The dish is dressed in <b>nước</b> <b>mam</b> fish sauce (nước chấm). Also, the dish is topped with roasted peanuts, Vietnamese pickled carrots, nem nướng̣ garlic pork sausage or grilled prawns. [...] Bún thịt nướng is popular in all regions of Vietnam, except for in Hanoi, where a related dish bún chả is served.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} served with grilled pork (either ribs or {{shredded}}) plus the Vietnamese dish bì (thinly shredded pork mixed with cooked and thinly shredded pork skin) over broken rice. The rice and meat are served with various greens and pickled vegetables, {{along with a}} prawn paste cake, trứng hấp (steamed egg), and grilled prawns. Typically, restaurants will serve this popular combination rice plate with a small bowl of <b>nước</b> <b>mắm,</b> {{as well as a}} small bowl of soup broth (canh) with garlic chives (to cleanse the throat). The dish cơm tấm bì comes with a chả trứng egg meatloaf. Nowaday, Cơm tấm is also served with Omelette.|$|E
5000|$|The cooked beef {{portions}} {{are then}} wrapped (by the individual eating it) with rice paper, {{a variety of}} herbs (rau sống), lettuce, cucumbers, and carrots and then dipped in mắm nêm. This slightly chunky sauce is made with anchovies and has a sweet and tangy flavor, due to the pineapple that is often added to achieve sweetness.This sauce is much more pungent in flavor than its cousin, <b>nước</b> <b>mắm</b> (fish sauce), and is not homogenized, allowing the textures of the original ingredients to characterize the sauce. A similar but less popular multi-course meal is the Cá 7 Món (literally [...] "seven courses of fish").|$|E
50|$|In Vietnam, anchovy is {{the main}} {{ingredient}} in the fish sauce - <b>nước</b> <b>mắm</b> - the unofficial national sauce of Vietnam. In Thai cuisine, dried anchovies are called pla katak haeng. They are used {{in a variety of}} dishes and especially popular deep-fried as a snack. Similarly to Vietnamese fish sauce, Thai fish sauce (nam pla) is also often made from anchovies. In other parts of Asia, such as Korea and Japan, sun-dried anchovies are used to produce a rich soup similar to setipinna taty. These anchovy stocks are usually used as a base for noodle soups or traditional Korean soups. There are many other variations on how anchovy is used, especially in Korea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nước</b> <b>mắm</b> (fish sauce) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used and iconic condiment in Vietnamese cooking. It is made from fermented raw fish, and is served with most of the Vietnamese dishes. Vietnamese cuisines are not known for ingredients with top quality, but rather for the very inexpensive and simple scraps that are creatively mixed together to create dishes with bold flavor. A traditional southern Vietnamese meal usually includes cơm trắng (plain white rice), cá kho tộ (catfish in a clay pot), canh chua cá lóc (sour soup with snakehead fish), and it would be incomplete without fish sauce served as a condiment. Dishes are prepared less with appearance in mind, but are served family style to bring everyone together after a long day of work.|$|E
50|$|The variety from Vietnam {{is called}} <b>nước</b> <b>mắm.</b> Two areas in Vietnam are most famous for {{producing}} fish sauce: Phú Quốc and Phan Thiết. Popular brands include Red Boat, 3 Crabs, Golden Boy, and Hon Phan Thiết. The quality of fish sauce {{is determined by}} many factors. Some Vietnamese fish sauces are made with only two ingredients: anchovies and salt. They {{do not have any}} additives like sugar, hydrolyzed protein, or preservatives. Another factor is the sauce should not have a particularly strong smell, and it should be transparent with a deep golden amber color. “First press” fish sauce, meaning the sauce is bottled from the first time the fermenting barrels are drained, also indicates quality. Lastly, when measuring the nitrogen level of fish sauces (N), most fish sauce on the market falls within the mid 20N range. Anything over 30N is considered high-grade, and 40N is optimal.|$|E
50|$|The {{prepared}} cakes are tightly {{arranged in}} large pot, the pot {{is filled with}} fresh water and boiled for hours until they are done from the inside stuffing to outside. After cooling and unwrapping, the rice skin of bánh chưng turns green because rice has absorbed the colour of lá dong. One bánh chưng is often divided in 8 parts, usually by using the very giang string which bound the wrap of the cake. As a cake formed from several ingredients, the taste of bánh chưng varies from part to part with different flavours of glutinous rice, pork, bean and even the wrapping lá dong. Bánh chưng is often served with pickled onions or vegetables, chả lụa and <b>nước</b> <b>mắm.</b> After unwrapping, bánh chưng can stay good for several days while a wrapped one can be kept for two weeks. Bánh chưng has the water activity value aw of about 0.95 and its pH is approximately 6.4.|$|E
50|$|Spring rolls, are a Vietnamese {{delicacy}} {{known as}} gỏi cuốn. Depending on region, salad rolls were made differently. Some vegetarian families make vegetarian spring rolls rather than meat spring rolls. However, the typical ingredients include slivers of cooked pork (most often cha pork sausages), shrimp, sometimes chicken or tofu, fresh herbs like basil or cilantro, lettuce, cucumbers, sometimes fresh garlic, chives, rice vermicelli, all wrapped in moistened rice paper. A typical gỏi cuốn may contain boiled pork, boiled rice noodle, cucumber, carrot and herb only. Fresh Vietnamese spring rolls {{can be made}} at home or found at Vietnamese restaurants and some grocery stores. They are served at room temperature with dipping sauce. Nước chấm, tương xào, or a hoisin peanut sauce are all common dipping sauces. A typical hoisin dipping sauce includes chili, hoisin sauce, peanut butter, and sugar. A standard <b>nước</b> <b>mắm</b> pha (nước chấm) dipping sauce is composed of fish sauce, lime, garlic, sugar, and chilies or simply fish sauce, sugar and vinegar.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, Vietnamese {{agricultural}} technicians {{began to}} arrive in Senegal under the sponsorship of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, through an initiative to promote cooperation between {{the nations of the}} global South. By 2001, their numbers had risen from 40 to 100. Most technicians come to Senegal on two year stints, unaccompanied by their spouses, and live in group housing with other Vietnamese. They aim to promote small-scale technologies and techniques suitable to Senegal's level of economic development; for example, Vietnamese beekeepers introduced Senegalese farmers to manually driven centrifugal honey extractors and Vietnamese-style concrete beehives. Others attempted to familiarise Senegalese people to the representative Vietnamese fish sauce <b>nước</b> <b>mắm.</b> Though as of 2001, it was only produced and used by the restaurants in Dakar, Vietnamese technicians in the seaside town of M'Bour trained a women's group in its preparation, and produced roughly 20 tanks of the sauce. Most of the technicians speak only Vietnamese, though they typically learn some Wolof language agricultural vocabulary during their time in the country.|$|E
