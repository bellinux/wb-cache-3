30|$|P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> is {{the latest}} {{financial}} lending platform business, which is {{a new way of}} borrowing under the background of rapid development of the mobile Internet. Since the beginning of the new century, <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> default has caused P 2 P companies to break up funds and operate without continuity, which has become an important factor affecting the healthy development of the industry. Therefore, starting from the actual management situation of P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> platform, the default risk of <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> was studied based on Spark technology in wireless network environment. The decision tree data mining algorithm was introduced to construct the early warning model of the <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> default risk, which achieved effective control of risk links. From the fuzzy characteristics that affected the uncertain factors of <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> credit, a hybrid algorithm model of C 4.5 decision tree optimization was established.

30|$|The latest {{model of}} the Internet {{innovation}} finance P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan,</b> although it was born less than 10  years, subversive changes to the global financial lending model has been brought. In the P 2 P platform, the <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> business is welcomed and loved by the ordinary consumers because {{of the advantages of}} flexible borrowing methods, fast money to account, and so on, which is also the most important market competition ability of the P 2 P platform [7]. In the survey of the development data {{of a large number of}} P 2 P companies in China, it is found that the main factors that cannot effectively control the credit risk of the network directly affect the health business development of the P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan,</b> which is how to control the risk of the <b>net</b> <b>loan.</b> The risk of <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> default brings serious consequences to the P 2 P platform, such as slow return of capital, fragmentation of capital chain, bankruptcy, and liquidation of enterprises. These consequences bring about economic losses that P 2 P companies and investors cannot recover and also cast a shadow on the healthy and sustainable development of the entire P 2 P industry [8]. In the analysis of P 2 P network credit management, it is seen that the risk nature of the credit risk in the network loan platform and the traditional bank lending is the same, because the borrower is unable to achieve the initial repayment agreement under various factors, making the interest of the <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> company damaged. Or the <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> company is unable to repay the agreed interest rate. There are differences between investors’ actual interests and contractual agreements, and personal economic interests are infringed [9]. The advantage of fast loan in network lending is also a great potential risk. For borrowers, information audit time is too short and information collection is limited, which may bring about credit default such as default and non-repayment [10]. Using a decision tree algorithm to study credit default risk of P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> has a good theoretical foundation. Mathematical models can be used to analyze the impact of risk more effectively and quantitatively determined the consequences that may be caused by different factors. In view of different risk factors, this paper puts forward specific control measures to curb default risk from the source.|$|R

40|$|A {{few years}} since {{the worst of the}} Euro {{sovereign}} debt crisis, many nations, from Cyprus to Ireland, including South Africa are re-visiting their public debt management to avert or lessen the impact of similar such happenings in the future. There are a number of studies on risk assessments of fiscal sustainability; however, few focus on contingent liabilities and even fewer on financial guarantees. In South Africa, financial guarantees have consistently comprised just above or below 50 % of all contingent liabilities {{since the early days of}} majoritarian rule. In lieu of this, the paper analyses the risks posed by financial guarantees to fiscal sustainability in South Africa. We estimate the effect of financial guarantees on public debt in South Africa via the Engle Granger and causality model with quarterly time series data obtained from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) as well as the National Treasury. The data covers the April 1997 to December 2011 period. All econometric methods were executed using the statistical software package E-Views 7. We found that no long run relationship exists between national <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> debt and financial guarantees in South Africa. The pass rate of financial guarantees significantly affects its present value. The pass rate of financial guarantees has a predicting ability in determining the present value of national <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> debt. These findings may be contrary to what would be expected in the case of South Africa considering that the country is managing the issuance of financial guarantees prudently and that at present levels, there is no need for a radical policy shift.

30|$|In the {{application}} research of classification prediction, the artificial intelligence decision tree algorithm {{is often used}} to process the data, and the induction algorithm is used to calculate the corresponding rules. After constructing the decision tree shape map, the new data is analyzed according to the decision strategy, and the analysis results can provide important basis for future decision-making. In this paper, the P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> default risk based on Spark and complex network analysis in wireless network element data environment are mainly studied. After analyzing the basic principle of the decision tree algorithm, the fuzzy set is used to optimize and update the decision tree algorithm in view of the uncertain characteristics of <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> credit data. Starting from the fuzziness of the uncertain data, integral function is used to deal with it. By using the compound membership function, the uncertain attribute that affect the lack of credit is fuzzy processing, so the risk of credit risk is predicted by the classification rules of the decision tree. In the simulation experiment, through the analysis of the attributes of the uncertainty, the problems can be effectively solved and the problems are that the important attribute value of the assets, such as the income situation, the debt ratio, the housing, and other assets, cannot be determined, which effectively improves the accuracy of the decision tree algorithm. The results of the experiment have proved that the study is successful. However, there are still some improvements in this research. The next step is to further study the pruning method of the optimizing decision tree algorithm.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the more fragile a banking system is, {{the more likely it is}} to experience problems when an unexpected shock hits. The empirical framework where this test is conducted is a reduced form model, where macroeconomic factors explain banks’ loan losses. The dependent variable is the ratio of <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> losses to lending in a panel comprising the banking sectors of nine sample countries. An econometric model is estimated on pooled annual data mostly covering the period from the early 1980 s to 2002. There are three separate explanatory terms. Two of these include a surprise change both in incomes and real interest rates. Both form a separate cross-product term with lagged aggregate indebtedness. The lagged dependent variable is the third explanatory term possibly capturing the feedback effect from loan losses back to the real economy. The underlying macroeconomic account that this paper puts forward is that loan losses seem basically to be generated by strong adverse aggregate shocks under high exposure of banks to such shocks. The model has been used in connection with stress testing in the Bank of Finland. financial fragility; unexpected macroeconomic shock; loan loss; stress test...|$|R

The group consists of a headquarters organization and about 150 member banks which own the headquarters.

Then we show that such constraints are not apparent at more influential member banks, where influence {{is measured by the}} divergence of voting rights from ownership rights. The more influential banks are allocated more funds from the headquarters, but also show more restraints in investments when experiencing large deposit inflows. Influence matters more among member banks requiring more information exchanges with the headquarters as a result of more volatile funding requests. Influence also matters more for small business loans, which contain more soft information, than for standardized residential mortgage loans. These results suggest that corporate politics can be used to address allocation inefficiencies resulting from information asymmetries between the headquarters and divisions (member banks in our case) ...|$|R
