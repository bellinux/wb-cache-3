5|$|Bush used {{a budget}} surplus {{to push through}} Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion. He {{extended}} government funding for organizations providing education {{of the dangers of}} alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce domestic violence. Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the chalk}} cliff near the lower {{terminus}} collapsed in 1957, forcing the railway's closure while a strengthening concrete wall was built. The new wall reduced the lower terminus {{to a single}} length of track. The second track at Hereson Road was closed at the same time, and removed to build a short siding <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the tunnel for stabling the trains. The wooden station platforms were replaced by modern concrete structures.|$|E
5|$|The first Winter Olympics {{took place}} in 1924. Australia first competed at the Winter Olympics in 1936, when its sole representative, Kenneth Kennedy, participated in speed skating. Kennedy came 33rd in both the 1500m and 5000m, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the standings. He was entirely on his own; no Australian support staff were in attendance, even though the AOF officially sanctioned Kennedy's entry.|$|E

There was no answer, and even the doctor, who had never seen Allonby, felt the silence that followed it.|$|R
40|$|Resilience has {{historically}} characterized the New England region, {{and the past}} year has exemplified that long-standing quality. Coming out of the worst regional recession since the Great Depression has been slow and painful, and the lives of many of our neighbors have been disrupted along the way. Fortunately, by the end of 1992 there were signs that the economic decline in New England was <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E
5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the foramen magnum. The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side of the tube in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded foramen beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a tuberosity bearing a ridge above. On the front of the basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> The basisphenoid resembles a triangular hatchet in shape when viewed from the side.|$|E

Leaves are basal and mostly alternate, linear and sessile <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} plant, while oblanceolate with petioles <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> all with whitish midribs. Flowers are arranged in a loose raceme on the upper stem, with rounded pinkish purple flower heads, each with 30-100 five-lobed, tubular flowers per head. Each flower has a long, thread-like, divided style protruding from the center.|$|R
50|$|As lead mining {{declined}} in Mineral Point, zinc mining and smelting became important new industries. Zinc ore was discovered {{with increasing frequency}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottoms</b> of old lead mines. The Mineral Point Zinc Company was founded in 1882, and by 1891 it was operating the largest zinc oxide works in the United States at Mineral Point. Zinc mining and processing continued {{on a large scale}} until the 1920s.|$|R
5|$|In March 2015, Bruce {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} extension. A run of poor form left Hull <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the table going into {{the final game of}} the 2014–15 season and needing to defeat Bruce's former club Manchester United to stand any chance of avoiding relegation. They could only manage a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championship. The poor performances of a number of players signed by Bruce, including club record signing Abel Hernández, were identified as key factors in the club's failure to remain in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} the original ZX Spectrum Underwurlde release. They noted its expansive game world and appreciated the parts where Sabreman travelled by bubble. Later critics {{commented on the}} game's frustrating difficulty. While the Commodore 64 version {{was similar to the}} original, reviews were mixed—one critic thought the title had aged poorly in the year between releases. Your Sinclair placed Underwurlde within its top 20 for the ZX Spectrum, though their readers put it <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of their top 100. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Rich in {{cultural}} heritage, Virginia however ranks <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of U.S. states {{in terms of}} public spending on the arts, at nearly half of the national average. The state government does fund some institutions, including the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Science Museum of Virginia. Other museums include the popular Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum and the Chrysler Museum of Art. Besides these sites, many open-air museums are located in the Commonwealth, such as Colonial Williamsburg, the Frontier Culture Museum, and various historic battlefields. The Virginia Foundation for the Humanities works to improve the Commonwealth's civic, cultural, and intellectual life.|$|E

5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> for groundfishes such as cod, hake, icefish, dories, sand lances, lumpsuckers, and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and tope sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the geyser {{rise to a}} point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise {{to the top of the}} column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E
5|$|As several squads {{left the}} hill on a patrol, North Koreans {{attacked}} the main company position behind it. The platoon dropped {{down off the}} ridge into a gully on the left. Some {{of the men in}} the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured most <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines. About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated North Korean battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The company to turned back this attack. That night, North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks.|$|E
