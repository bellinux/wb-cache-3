5000|$|Offshore finance {{has been}} the subject of {{increased}} attention since 2000 and even more so since the April 2009 G20 meeting, when heads of state resolved to [...] "take action" [...] against <b>non-cooperative</b> <b>jurisdictions.</b> Initiatives spearheaded by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and the International Monetary Fund have had a significant effect on the offshore finance industry.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to FATF's [...] "Forty plus Nine" [...] Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued {{a list of}} [...] "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" [...] (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist. This was a list of 15 jurisdictions that, {{for one reason or}} another, FATF members believed were uncooperative with other jurisdictions in international efforts against money laundering (and, later, terrorism financing). Typically, this lack of cooperation manifested itself as an unwillingness or inability (frequently, a legal inability) to provide foreign law enforcement officials with information relating to bank account and brokerage records, and customer identification and beneficial owner information relating to such bank and brokerage accounts, shell company, and other financial vehicles commonly used in money laundering. As of October 2006, there are no Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories {{in the context of the}} NCCT initiative. However FATF issues updates as countries on High-risk and <b>non-cooperative</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> list have made significant improvements in standards and cooperation. The FATF also issues updates to identify additional jurisdictions that pose Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing risks.|$|E
30|$|International {{pressure}} on Swiss bank secrecy {{had already been}} mounting for some time. Before the U.S. came into play, {{there had been a}} series of initiatives led by the OECD to increase transparency and induce cooperation among countries on taxation. With respect to bank secrecy, the OECD tried to establish the free exchange of information between tax authorities, or ideally the automatic exchange of information on tax subjects. This amounts to abolishing bank secrecy for tax purposes. The strategy of the OECD relied mainly on blacklisting <b>non-cooperative</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> thereby hoping that this public shaming would prove effective. In successive negotiations between Switzerland and the EU, a withholding tax on interest income was introduced, and the distinction between tax evasion and tax fraud was removed, thereby easing the way for an EU tax authority to request information on bank accounts in Switzerland about which they were suspicious. However, in all these negotiations, bank secrecy itself was fully preserved.|$|E
40|$|Can a WTO Member {{discriminate}} against foreign suppliers of services located in jurisdictions that refuse {{to share information}} with a government to permit it to determine if its nationals engage in tax evasion? Does it matter if the Member uses standards developed by an international body as the criterion for deciding whether to impose measures? In Argentinaâ€”Financial Services the WTO Appellate Body held that services from jurisdictions that share financial tax information may be different from services provided by jurisdictions that do not cooperate in supplying such information. It overruled a Panel finding that measures to increase taxes on financial transactions with <b>non-cooperative</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> were discriminatory. We argue that the AB reached the right conclusion but that an important opportunity was missed to clarify what WTO Members are permitted to do to enforce their domestic regulatory regimes, and how international standards could have a bearing on this question. By giving consideration to arguments that the likeness of services and service suppliers may {{be a function of}} prevailing domestic regulatory regimes, the AB increased the scope for confusion and future litigation...|$|E
40|$|In late 2008 {{and early}} 2009, the G 8 and the G 20 {{pressured}} remaining <b>non-cooperative</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> with sanctions if {{they failed to}} commit to the OECD standards of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes and sign 12 agreements that met these standards. Leading up to this event was the continued work of the OECD to construct a treaty network to combat tax evasion by means of tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs). In this thesis, I investigate if the pressure to implement the network of tax information exchange agreements reduces tax evasion activities in jurisdictions providing banking secrecy. To measure {{the effect of these}} tax information exchange agreements I use the value of service charges banks and other financial institutions in a country apply to their foreign clients that own financial assets there. These charges are for each country included in the category financial services export in the Balance of Payments (BOP) data set. And this is the data used to analyse potential effects. In other words, I use financial services export as a proxy for foreign financial assets. The statistical software package used in this thesis is Stata 14. 1. There are two methods that I use to estimate an effect of the pressure to commit to the OECD standards and sign 12 agreements that meet the standards. The first approach is the fixed-effects (FE) model, and it is used to measure the change in financial services export as a percent of goods and services export for all countries that goes from being uncooperative to cooperative in exchanging tax information. The overall effect on the data set is then measured by this method. The second approach is called the synthetic control method and is used on the data to estimate a potential effect on an individual country's financial services export. I apply it to Switzerland as it historically has been the place to hide financial assets, with a banking secrecy law enacted in 1935, and an almost complete hegemony over the international wealth-management market until the beginning of the 1980 s. By using the fixed-effect model and, in this context, the previously unused Balance of Payments data set, I find evidence that committing to the OECD standards and signing at least 12 tax information exchange agreements to the OECD standards has no significant effect on the cumulative amount of foreign financial assets. I theorise that this is a result of heterogeneous effects, caused by spillover effects of foreign financial assets from highly cooperative jurisdictions to less cooperative jurisdictions. By using the synthetic control method on an individual country known to provide banking secrecy, Switzerland, I find a large decrease in foreign financial assets from committing to the OECD standards and signing tax information exchange agreements to the OECD standards. This strengthens the theory of heterogeneous effects from the fixed-effects model, as a reduction in Switzerland necessitates a similar opposite effect in other countries that have committed to the OECD standards and signed at least 12 agreements that meet the standards. The concerns that the bilateral agreement network does not cover enough country pairs to effectively prevent tax evasion seems to be valid. The network for each country is far from complete, and {{a large part of the}} world is completely left out because of administrative costs of implementing and enforcing agreements. This continues to provide the opportunity for a tax evader to transfer financial assets, with little risk of detection, to countries not covered by an agreement with the home country of the tax evader...|$|E
