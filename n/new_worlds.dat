5|$|In early 1964, David Warburton of Roberts & Vinter, an {{established}} publisher, {{heard from the}} printer of Science Fantasy and <b>New</b> <b>Worlds</b> that the magazines were going to fold shortly. Warburton decided that having a respectable magazine would help him in getting good distribution for Roberts & Vinter's books: Science Fantasy and <b>New</b> <b>Worlds</b> both had distribution arrangements with the two main British newsagents of the time, John Menzies and W.H. Smith. Carnell {{did not want to}} continue to edit the magazines in addition to New Writings in SF, and recommended Moorcock to Warburton; Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of Brian Aldiss, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose <b>New</b> <b>Worlds,</b> and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of Science Fantasy. Roberts & Vinter changed the format from digest to paperback, and the first issue under Bonfiglioli's control was number 65, dated June–July 1964. The schedule was initially somewhat irregular, with each issue dated with two months even when two issues were only a month apart—for example, June–July 1964 was followed by July–August 1964. From March 1965 a regular monthly schedule was begun.|$|E
5|$|Carnell {{joined the}} British Army in 1940 {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War, and did not return to civilian life until 1946. He negotiated a publishing agreement for the magazine with Pendulum Publications, but only three issues of <b>New</b> <b>Worlds</b> were subsequently produced before Pendulum's bankruptcy in late 1947. A group of science fiction fans formed a company called Nova Publications to revive the magazine; the first issue under their management appeared in mid-1949. <b>New</b> <b>Worlds</b> continued to appear on a regular basis until issue 20, published in early 1953, following which a change of printers led to a hiatus in publication. It was not until early 1954, when Maclaren & Sons acquired control of Nova Publications, that the magazine returned to a stable monthly schedule.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Nova {{decided to}} launch a British reprint of the American {{magazine}} Science Fiction Adventures, under the same title. The British Science Fiction Adventures lasted until May 1963, when it was felled by declining sales. <b>New</b> <b>Worlds,</b> Nova's flagship title, and Science Fantasy were also suffering from poor sales, with circulation estimated at about 5,000, though a switch from bimonthly to a monthly schedule was also considered that year for Science Fantasy. In September Nova decided to close down both remaining titles, and {{in preparation for the}} change Carnell signed a contract in December 1963 to edit an original anthology series, New Writings in SF, for publisher Dennis Dobson. Readers' responses to news of the planned demise of the magazines included a letter from Michael Moorcock, published in the April 1964 <b>New</b> <b>Worlds,</b> asking how the British market would now be able to train writers to sell to the higher-paying U.S. magazines.|$|E

In April 2006, NWPCS merged with Hong Kong CSL Limited to form CSL <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Mobility Group, a joint-venture company owned by Telstra Corporation (76.4%) and <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Mobile Holdings Limited (23.6%). In October 2006, it sold its 23.6% stakes of the Group to <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Development. <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Development then sold the stakes of <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Mobile to a company privately held by Mr. Simon Lo, the chairman of <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Mobile.|$|R

5|$|Science Fantasy, {{which also}} {{appeared}} under the titles Impulse and SF Impulse, was a British fantasy and science fiction magazine, launched in 1950 by Nova Publications as {{a companion to}} Nova's <b>New</b> <b>Worlds.</b> Walter Gillings was editor {{for the first two}} issues, and was then replaced by John Carnell, the editor of <b>New</b> <b>Worlds,</b> as a cost-saving measure. Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964. The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit Science Fantasy; Bonfiglioli changed the title to Impulse in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable. The title was changed again to SF Impulse for the last few issues. Science Fantasy ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that the first issue of <b>New</b> <b>Worlds</b> appeared, a {{separate}} British magazine called Fantasy was launched by Walter Gillings, a science fiction fan and a reporter by profession. Fantasy lasted for only three issues before dying in 1947, but Gillings had accumulated a substantial inventory of stories—enough to fill nine issues. Gillings followed the demise of Fantasy by publishing a fanzine, titled Fantasy Review, beginning in March 1947.|$|E
5|$|Geneva and {{the nearby}} French {{department}} of Ain co-host the world's largest laboratory, CERN, dedicated to particle physics research. Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), diazepam (Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some technologies enabled the exploration of <b>new</b> <b>worlds</b> such as the pressurised balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Development {{promised the}} {{waterfront}} would {{be run by}} non-profit-making organisation, the Victoria Waterfront Concern Group questioned that the Plan could provide <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Development an unfair indirect commercial benefits. <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Development owned three commercial projects nearby, including <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Millennium Hong Kong Hotel and <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Centre.

5|$|In early 1946, British fan John Carnell {{launched}} a new science fiction magazine titled <b>New</b> <b>Worlds,</b> published by Pendulum Publications. The first issue appeared in July 1946 and failed to sell well. The second issue, in October of that year, sold better, but Pendulum {{went out of business}} before the end of 1947 with only one more issue released. A group of sf fans, including Carnell and Frank Cooper, decided to restart the magazine under their own control, and formed Nova Publications Ltd. The fourth issue appeared in April 1949.|$|E
5|$|Pendulum Publications {{produced}} {{one more}} issue in October 1947, shortly before going bankrupt and thus leaving <b>New</b> <b>Worlds</b> without a publisher. The magazine was saved {{by a group}} of sf fans who since 1946 had been meeting regularly on Thursday nights at the White Horse public house on New Fetter Lane, near Fleet Street. At one of those meetings it was suggested that they form a company to revive New Worlds; one of those present, Frank Cooper, recently retired from the RAF, agreed to look into what would be necessary to start a new company.|$|E
5|$|The Sector General series {{began as}} short stories {{published}} in <b>New</b> <b>Worlds</b> from 1957 onwards. Originally White intended {{to end the}} series with Star Healer (1985), by which time the central characters had reached the top levels in their careers, but Ballantine Books persuaded him to continue. He extended the stories' range by introducing new central characters beginning with Code Blue - Emergency (1987), and The Genocidal Healer (1992) focused on psychological and theological issues of guilt and forgiveness rather than strictly medical ones.|$|E
50|$|In December of that year, <b>New</b> <b>World</b> formed two <b>new</b> divisions, <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Family Filmworks and <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Action Animation, to {{increase}} production for the growing family market by $20 million; Marvel Productions President Rick Ungar was appointed to head the two divisions. Following Marvel Entertainment Group's acquisition of ToyBiz in 1993, that company's CEO Avi Arad was named President and CEO of both <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Family Filmworks and Marvel Films, a new unit formed as {{a joint venture between}} Marvel and <b>New</b> <b>World</b> (which included an animation studio, Marvel Films Animation); Marvel Productions was renamed <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Animation in 1993.|$|R

5|$|Under Campbell Authentic {{improved}} somewhat, {{and continued}} its metamorphosis into a magazine, with additional non-fiction writing, and short fiction {{in addition to}} the main novel in each issue. Hamilton also ran a science fiction paperback imprint, Panther Books, which would go on {{to become one of the}} leading British sf houses. By 1953 the British sf market was going through a metamorphosis similar to the one going in the US at the same time: poor quality sf markets were failing, and the result was a reduced but active market, with four magazines: Authentic, <b>New</b> <b>Worlds,</b> Science Fantasy, and Nebula Science Fiction.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} Final Fantasy, Sakaguchi required a larger production team than Square's previous titles. He began crafting the game's story while experimenting with gameplay ideas. Once the gameplay system and game world size were established, Sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into the available resources. A different {{approach has been}} taken for subsequent titles; the story is completed first and the game built around it. Designers have never been restricted by consistency, though most feel each title should have a minimum number of common elements. The development teams strive to create completely <b>new</b> <b>worlds</b> for each title, and avoid making new games too similar to previous ones. Game locations are conceptualized early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out {{as a base for}} entire structures.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} across {{multiple}} worlds based on Pinocchio, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, , Fantasia and , each having two different plots from {{the perspectives of}} Sora and Riku. These worlds need to be completed by both Sora and Riku in order to unlock <b>new</b> <b>worlds</b> and progress through the game. Upon visiting each world for the first time, each character must go through a Dive section, in which characters freefall down a tube and must clear a certain objective, such as obtaining a certain amount of points, defeating a certain amount of enemies in a time limit, or defeating a boss character. In this mode, Sora and Riku can attack opponents, slow down their descent, or dodge attacks. They can also pick up magic spells which give them a limited supply of magical attacks to use against enemies.|$|E
50|$|CSL <b>New</b> <b>World</b> Mobility Group was {{established}} in 2006 with the merger of two mobile network operators, Hong Kong CSL Limited and <b>New</b> <b>World</b> PCS Limited.

5|$|Gillings had an {{inventory}} of material that he had acquired while editing Fantasy, and he drew on this for Science Fantasy, as well as incorporating his own fanzine, Science Fantasy Review, into the new magazine. Once Carnell took over, Science Fantasy typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included John Brunner, Ken Bulmer, and Brian Aldiss, whose first novel Nonstop appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during {{the latter half of}} the 1950s, and in the early 1960s Carnell began to publish Thomas Burnett Swann's well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of Science Fantasy was always higher than that of <b>New</b> <b>Worlds,</b> and in the early 1960s his efforts were rewarded with three consecutive Hugo nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including Keith Roberts, Brian Stableford and Josephine Saxton. In the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, the final year of Impulse, as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{science fiction}} (sf) {{magazines}} {{had been published}} successfully in North America for over twenty years, but little progress {{had been made in}} establishing British equivalents. The bulk of British sf was published as paperback books, rather than magazines; a situation opposite of that in the US. Several short-lived magazines had come and gone, {{both before and after the}} war. John Spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950, which continued into the mid-1950s, while one magazine, <b>New</b> <b>Worlds,</b> had survived since 1946. Since 1939, Atlas, a British publisher, had been producing a reprint edition of Astounding Science Fiction, one of the most well-regarded American sf magazines. During the war the contents had often been cut severely, and the schedule had not been regular, but it was reputed to sell 40,000 copies a month. This was enough to attract the attention of Hamilton & Co., a British publisher looking for new markets.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is the second}} most {{specialised}} member of the genus Canis, after the Ethiopian wolf, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior. It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the eastern wolf, coyote, and golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and <b>New</b> <b>Worlds,</b> and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.|$|E

5|$|The {{setting of}} the game {{takes place in the}} 24th century when {{humanity}} has discovered interstellar travel through the use of interstellar subspace jump nodes that function {{in the same manner as}} wormholes, allowing it to spread out across the stars and colonise <b>new</b> <b>worlds.</b> Prior to the game beginning, humanity (referred to as Terrans) formed the Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) as the central power of all of their systems' governments and military, and became engaged in a war over systems and resources against the Vasudans of the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire (PVE). By the time the story begins, this war has entered its fourteenth year, as a third species, dubbed Shivans, makes an unprovoked attack on the Terran system of Ross 128. The player, acting as a new Terran pilot in the GTA, is initially involved in the conflict with the PVE before the fights focus on the new species' arrival and subsequent assaults.|$|E
5|$|Birth by Sleep is a prequel to {{the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, taking place ten years prior. Like the other games in the series, the player {{progresses}} through a collection of various worlds, based on various locales from the Disney animated features canon: Dwarf Woodlands from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Enchanted Dominion from Sleeping Beauty, Castle of Dreams from Cinderella, Olympus Coliseum from Hercules, Deep Space from Lilo & Stitch, Neverland from Peter Pan and Mysterious Tower from Fantasia. The game also features various <b>new</b> <b>worlds</b> specially created for the series by Square Enix such as the Land of Departure and Radiant Garden. Disney Town, which is the town that surrounds the castle grounds of Disney Castle, serves as the game's minigame world. Worlds such as Destiny Islands and Castle Oblivion also appear {{in the form of}} cutscenes, while the 100 Acre Wood from the Winnie the Pooh franchise, which had appeared in most other games of the series, only appears as a Command Board in Birth by Sleep. The staff first chose the worlds based on the game's scenario, leading to the inclusion of Princesses' worlds. They then added the worlds of Neverland and Deep Space to add variety to the game, while Olympus Coliseum was selected to reflect the game's earlier setting compared to the original Kingdom Hearts.|$|E
5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor {{of a group of}} children with the ability to communicate with God. To hide from the pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to <b>new</b> <b>worlds,</b> while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E
