By adding consumption loans (which are non-productive) into a standard model of imperfect information, this paper finds that {{an increase in the}} <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> may increase, decrease, or have no significant effect on economic growth for <b>inflation</b> <b>rates</b> below a threshold level; however, for <b>inflation</b> <b>rates</b> higher than this threshold level, an increase in the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> significantly reduces economic growth. Moreover, the marginal impact of an increase in the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> in terms of reducing economic growth increases with the rise in the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate,</b> until the <b>inflation</b> <b>rates</b> reach the second threshold level, from which such a marginal effect significantly decreases.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{hypothesis}} that a central bank's asymmetric preferences are able to explain <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> in a developing country. In addition, it seeks to help comprehend movements of <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> in Jordan and to understand Central Bank of Jordan preferences regarding <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> and output. Design/methodology/approach – A standard monetary model consists of a central bank's loss function and an economy structure is constructed, which acts as a constraint on the central bank's behavior. Then, a distribute-lag version of the derived model is estimated using ordinary least squares method. Findings – The empirical evidence from the Jordanian economy shows that <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> relies on the variances of <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> and the variances of output. This finding supports the hypothesis that a central bank's asymmetric loss function is able to justify <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> movements.

Originality/value – The paper provides evidence from a developing country regarding the ability of the asymmetric central bank preferences to justify <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> movement.
