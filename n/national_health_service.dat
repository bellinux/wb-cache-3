40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{investigated}} the association between health care systems and health indicators in developed countries. METHODS. Cross-national comparisons were conducted with regression analysis between 17 Western European countries with two types of <b>health</b> care systems: <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> and social security systems. RESULTS. Health care expenditures were inversely correlated to potential years of life lost to females and to infant mortality rates; they were positively correlated to life expectancy for females. Regression models predicted that countries with <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> systems would have lower infant mortality rates at similar levels {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP) and health care expenditures. Finally, increases in health care expenditures would decrease the ratio of observed to predicted infant mortality rates according to GDP; this decrease would be greater in countries with <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> than in those with social security systems. The model predicted this difference to be about 13 % at average levels of <b>health</b> expenditures. CONCLUSIONS. <b>National</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> seem to be more efficient at producing lower infant mortality rates than social security systems in Western European countries...|$|R
