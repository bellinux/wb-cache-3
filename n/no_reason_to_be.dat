5|$|Miss Honora Sneyd {{would not}} admit the {{unqualified}} {{control of a}} husband over all her actions; she did not feel, that seclusion from society was indispensably necessary to preserve female virtue, or to secure domestic happiness. Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence might best subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she had <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her.|$|E

[...] He could not associate with convicted mafiosi during his probation. [...] While the FBI suspected Vitale was a mafioso, {{he had never}} been convicted of a crime, and the FBI would have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suspicious of him associating with Massino since they were brothers-in-law. He returned to his job at King Caterers, and in 1996 became co-owner of Casablanca, a well-reviewed Maspeth Italian restaurant.|$|E

In a 2010 British Academy of Film and Television Arts lecture, she told of a scene that was changed after one of these reviews, where Nigel told Andy not to complain so much about her job. Originally, she had made his speech more of a supportive pep talk; however one of those acquaintances said that would not happen: [...] "o-one in that world is nice to each other ... There's <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> and they don't have time." [...] she quoted him as saying.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{journalist}} Matt Taibbi {{had previously}} covered four other presidential campaigns prior to 2016. Taibbi documented the 2016 presidential campaign {{in a series}} of contemporaneous reports for Rolling Stone. He combined these dispatches into one publication for Insane Clown President. The book contains illustrations by Victor Juhasz, an artist for Rolling Stone. In a pre-inauguration interview with PBS, Taibbi explained his choice of Insane Clown President as the title, [...] "If the president-elect and his followers have complaints about the title, they should really blame Trump himself. Because I actually learned a lot about marketing watching Donald Trump {{over the last couple of}} years. There is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subtle at all in the current environment." ...|$|E
500|$|David Packard of DVD Verdict {{said that}} the live action scenes [...] "add to the silliness." [...] He also said [...] "It's a nice change of pace to see Plankton and Krabs as chums pre-Chum Bucket and finding out what led to their friendship's {{eventual}} demise. Viewers also get to see Mr. Krabs introduced to 'the love of his life' as he develops the secret formula to the Krabby Patty that Bikini Bottom's residents know and love today." [...] On the DVD, Patrick Cossel of Blogcritics said [...] "Children and adults will laugh out loud at the crazy slapstick antics {{of the one who}} lives under the sea." [...] He added that [...] "This release is sure to be huge hit for SpongeBob fans everywhere." [...] Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo! Voices was negative on the episode saying [...] "'Friend of Foe?' just felt like a regular episode that really had <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hyped a special." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, Pascu sparked {{criticism}} in the media when he agreed to perform at a Timişoara rally of Gregorian Bivolaru's Yoga movement (MISA). Bivolaru's legal troubles and allegations regarding MISA's sexual policies were the center of public debates; when contacted by reporters, Pascu stressed {{that it was a}} regular gig and stated, [...] "Those people have never harmed me and I have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> avoiding their company." [...] Pascu's activities for that year included other live concerts, including one held during the Bookfest event of June. In November, he was a guest at the Mircea Baniciu tribute concert, entertaining the public with musical impressions of folk singers Nicu Alifantis and Victor Socaciu, and performing Pasărea Colibri classics. Pascu also purchased his own drinking establishment and live music venue, a Bucharest tavern he named Gyuri's Pub, which hosted performances by the Moldovan folk singer Radu Captari. A collaborator of Pascu on solo music projects during spring 2010, Captari sang and played the guitar while riding a horse.|$|E

500|$|Orr {{was also}} known for his mean streak. Former coach Don Cherry recounts an {{incident}} one night in Los Angeles during a game that the Bruins were losing. With a minute to go, Orr pulled one of the Bruins off the ice, left the bench and attacked a Los Angeles Kings player. Asked why, Orr said to Cherry [...] "He was laughing at us." [...] According to Cherry, he fought a lot. On another occasion in November 1967, Orr was clipped in the face by a stick from the Toronto Maple Leafs' Brian Conacher. Boston teammate Johnny McKenzie flattened Conacher from behind and started punching Conacher. Orr, cut and bleeding, {{got up from the}} ice, pulled MacKenzie off Conacher and started punching Conacher. Conacher, who was not fighting back, was also sucker-punched by the Bruins' Ken Hodge. Orr would be booed in Toronto from that date onwards. Orr was frequently compared to Brad Park, who played a similar style to Orr and later succeeded Orr as Boston's top defenceman, and the two often fought each other on-ice, fueling the bitter rivalry between the Bruins and New York Rangers. Park said [...] "I saw <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> upset because I was rated second to Bobby Orr. After all, Orr not only was the top defenceman in the game but he was considered the best player ever to {{put on a pair of}} skates. There was nothing insulting about being rated number two to such a super superstar".|$|E
500|$|The Altar and the Door {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews upon its release. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave it four-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, saying it has a [...] "slightly greater dose of rock" [...] and [...] "Casting Crowns gave fans <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disappointed on Alter [...] ". Deborah Evans-Price of CCM Magazine gave it {{four out of five}} stars, commenting that [...] "With this new set, [...] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today’s tumultuous world, but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us". Jennifer E. Jones of cbnmusic.com gave it four out of five spins, opining that [...] "There’s a reason why Casting Crowns {{is one of the best}} Christian bands out today, and that reason is evident when you listen to The Altar and The Door. After three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot... The Altar and The Door leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus". Mark Lawrence of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, saying [...] "Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band's legacy: some bands self implode and produce an album high on production sheen but low on song quality... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece... The Altar and the Door leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with a sense that they have even greater things to come... The Altar And The Door' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound, content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones". Brian Mansfield gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that [...] " [...] concern themselves with the space between the title’s two fixtures– that is, between intention and action, between doing good and getting in the way, or, as one song puts it, between “the God we want and the God who is.” That’s a space worth exploring, and the band’s motives may be the best, but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist’s tears: start soft, build big, then cue the strings".|$|E

During his visit to Mumbai (Bombay) he came on board INS Vikrant. During a conversation with Vice Admiral Swaraj Prakash, Gorshkov asked the Vice Admiral, [...] "Were you worried about a battle against the American carrier?"

2500|$|Author and {{political}} commentator Peter Holding called Hitchens' analogy [...] "hysterical, unfair and offensive," [...] adding that [...] "some {{of the criticism}} directed towards Moore's film displays the very same characteristics for which Moore's film has been criticised". Fellow Slate columnist and Iraq war critic David Edelstein, though generally supportive of the film, wrote Fahrenheit 9/11 [...] "is an act of counterpropaganda that has a boorish, bullying force", but called it a [...] "legitimate abuse of power." [...] Prominent left-wing intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy agreed the war was [...] "a bad idea", but was sympathetic to the neoconservative {{point of view and}} disagreed with what he perceived to be the film's [...] "core" [...] argument, that [...] "we have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interfering" [...] in the Middle East. Joe Scarborough alleges that Moore has ducked criticism and dodged interviews from both himself and Hitchens.|$|E
2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak." ...|$|E
