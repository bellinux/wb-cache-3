The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871–72, General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking {{for a group of}} Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre, and Irataba {{had no choice but to}} turn the war party over to the army. He traveled to the trial proceedings at Fort Date Creek, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, Ohatchecama, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> had turned them over to Crook.|$|E

25|$|In a December {{game against}} the Seattle Seahawks, Testaverde was {{involved}} in a play that was cited as an impetus for the NFL's adoption of a new instant replay review system the next season. With the Jets trailing 31-26 and twenty seconds left in the game, Testaverde attempted to score on a quarterback sneak on fourth and goal from the Seattle five-yard line. Testaverde had been tackled and the ball was not across the goal line when this happened, but because Testaverde's helmet had crossed the line the game's head linesman, Earnie Frantz, ruled the play a touchdown. The Jets won the game 32-31 and the loss was said to have cost the Seahawks a playoff berth and coach Dennis Erickson his job. The game's referee, Phil Luckett, drew criticism for the call although he was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> made it.|$|E

From a game-theoretic point of view, [...] "chicken" [...] and [...] "hawk–dove" [...] are identical; the different names stem from parallel development of the basic principles in different research areas.

2500|$|If Abingdon was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> {{encouraged}} the poem's composition, {{he at least}} enjoyed having the celebrated poet in his household. [...] At around this time, Gould also became a friend of Fleetwood Sheppard's, who appeared to treat the poet with great generosity. [...] The next poems from Gould continued the misogyny of Love Given O'er (e.g. A Satyr on Wooing, Epistle to One Made Unhappy in Marriage, A Scourge for Ill Wives, inter al.) and attempted to broaden out the satire into an attack on human vanity in particular and mankind in general. [...] Gould's A Satyr on Mankind was, in its own day, noted for its excellence, and Alexander Pope paraphrases it. [...] Additionally, Jonathan Swift uses {{some of the same}} satirical figures, and it is likely that both authors had read Gould in the 1709 version of his poems. [...] Also in 1683 (on June 17), Gould married Martha Roderick, and the two would later have a daughter named Hannah. [...] Between 1683 and 1689, Gould produced a number of satires, some of them providing unique insight into the English Restoration. Satyr Upon the Play-House (1688), for example, attacked the parentage and pretense of Elizabeth Barry and Thomas Betterton, as well as the dissipate, drunken, whoring patrons of the theater. [...] It records the life of London around Covent Garden, complete with demobbed soldiers, thieves, prostitutes, and the nobility who only cover their filth in gold, cosmetics, and perfumes. [...] He also produced a few topical satires, such as To Julian, Secretary of the Muses, which attacks an anonymous lampoon author and gives specific detail about the personalities and personages of some of the dramatists of the day. [...] He even wrote a poem in honor of a retarded villager of Lavington before, two years later, writing a violent attack on the stupidity and obdurancy of all the [...] "simple folk" [...] of the country.|$|E
