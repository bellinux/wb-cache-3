Fleming traveled to Robinson on May 13 to ask residents to remain calm; his address was well received. Washington was assigned several inexperienced lawyers.

The TV Company argued that Ecclestone and Mosley were in breach of commercial clauses in the Treaty of Rome; following the court's decision Mosley appealed the judgement and cancelled the series until further <b>notice.</b> <b>On</b> appeal, the court ruled that the series organiser should be able to sell the television rights to whoever they felt was the best option for coverage and the FIA reinstated the European Truck Racing Cup.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by the Japanese, {{in an attempt}} to prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative overland road named Burma Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, Burma, transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese when referring to Southeast Asia). Following the request, the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment <b>notice</b> <b>on</b> 7 February 1939.|$|E

5|$|In spring 1917, Rau, by {{this time}} an elected trade union {{official}} in his firm, participated {{in the attempt to}} organise a strike against the war. His action led to a reprimand from his employer, and may have hastened his conscription into the army in August 1917. In the army he was trained in the Zuffenhausen-garrisoned Infantry Regiment 126 and deployed to the Western Front as member of a machine gun company. In September 1918 a shell splinter penetrated his lungs. In the following weeks, he was treated in military hospitals in Weimar and in Stuttgart's neighbouring town Ludwigsburg. While in Ludwigsburg, Rau managed to get leave at short <b>notice</b> <b>on</b> 8November 1918 and joined the in those days developing revolution in Stuttgart.|$|E
5|$|With World War I {{raging in}} Europe, Szilard {{received}} <b>notice</b> <b>on</b> January 22, 1916, {{that he had}} been drafted into the 5th Fortress Regiment, but he was able to continue his studies. He enrolled as an engineering student at the Palatine Joseph Technical University, which he entered in September 1916. The following year he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army's 4th Mountain Artillery Regiment, but immediately was sent to Budapest as an officer candidate. He rejoined his regiment in May 1918 but in September, before being sent to the front, he fell ill with Spanish Influenza and was returned home for hospitalization. Later he was informed that his regiment had been nearly annihilated in battle, so the illness probably saved his life. He was discharged honorably in November 1918, {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|As Stanton and Ranft {{discussed}} the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter {{liked the idea}} and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early-1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave <b>notice</b> <b>on</b> July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole-director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.|$|E

5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} fissures {{in the water}} drums of her boilers {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further <b>notice.</b> <b>On</b> 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Throughout September1, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} {{and the following}} day, it began to track towards the north-northeast as the ridge located {{to the east of}} it strengthened. Additionally, nearby ship reports of sustained winds indicated that tropical storm-force winds extended 230miles (370km) northwest of the center of circulation. The trough located west of Gustav began accelerating late on September2, causing the hurricane to track towards the northeast, away from Newfoundland. Around 1800UTC, Gustav weakened to a tropical storm, as winds decreased to 70mph (110km/h). By this time, Gustav had entered the Canadian Hurricane Centres area of responsibility, leading to them initiating advisories on the weakening storm. Early the next day, the former hurricane underwent and completed an extratropical transition. The last <b>notice</b> <b>on</b> the remnants of Gustav were while the system was located roughly 230miles (370km) south of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{they were}} ordered to Roslavl, {{south-east}} of Smolensk, but this was soon changed to Yelnya, east of Smolensk. When they reached Smolensk, they marched on through Yartsevo to Safonovo before being ordered to turn north towards Bely to help stop a Soviet breakthrough south of Rzhev. At {{the head of the}} division, the 25th Panzergrenadier Regiment attacked off the route of march towards elements of the 1st Panzer Division holding out around the village of Komary. The fighting continued in snowstorms and extreme cold until 16 December, with Mickl forward directing the battle, which ended with the destruction of eight Soviet tank and rifle brigades in the Bely area. After a few days rest, on 23 December Mickl's regiment marched to the north-east of Bely to stop Soviet forces moving into the Luchesa river valley. In the difficult terrain and weather conditions, the regiment was exhausted from constant fighting over hamlets that often changed hands. On 30 December, the fighting escalated as the Red Army forces in the sector were reinforced, and Mickl's II Battalion was forced to temporarily withdraw into the surrounding forest. Fierce fighting continued until the 12th Panzer Division was detached at short <b>notice</b> <b>on</b> 14 January 1943, but not before the divisional staff had reported Mickl's brave leadership in the fighting to the Oberkommando des Heeres (German Army High Command). On 16 January 1943, the division was on the move, this time headed north-west to Velikiye Luki, but its move to the front was countermanded.|$|E
