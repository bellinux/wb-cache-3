40|$|Fungal {{cutaneous}} {{infection is}} referred as infection of skin, hair or <b>nails</b> by <b>fungus.</b> Three groups of fungi can cause cutaneous infection: yeasts, dermatophytes and non-dermatophytic moulds. Dermatophytes {{are the most}} common causative agents, but the non-dermatophytic moulds have the highest diversity. Most of the clinical microbiology laboratories in Hong Kong identify these fungal pathogens based on phenotypic method, which is labor intensive, time consuming, difficult to distinguish within genera and may be inaccurate, especially for those uncommon pathogens. Comparative sequence analysis provides a rapid and accurate method to resolve these problems. In this study, 6 non-dermatophytic moulds isolated from clinical cutaneous specimen were identified using ITS region and 28 S rDNA sequencing technique. Four strains were correctly identified to species level: Purpureocillium lilacinum, Chaetomium globosum, Exophiala oligosperma and Cephalotheca foveolata. For the remaining two strains which could not be identified by ITS region and 28 S rDNA, further sequencing of 18 S rDNA, Actingene, β-tubulin gene, EF 1 -αgene and Calmodulin gene were done. Results indicated that these two strains were not belonged to any existing fungal species, and was suggested to be a novel species of Ochroconis and Gliomastix respectively. Further phenotypic characterizations are required for these two strains for proposing as a novel species. published_or_final_versionMicrobiologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R
40|$|Onicomicoses são infecções fúngicas que atingem as unhas e acometem cerca de 30 % da população. Recentemente tem sido relatado aumento dessas infecções e também alterações em sua etiologia. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a freqüência das onicomicoses e perfil dos pacientes acometidos em Maringá, Estado do Paraná, Brasil. Entre janeiro de 1999 a junho de 2003 foram analisadas, no Laboratório de Micologia do Lepac (Laboratório de Ensino e Pesquisa em Análises Clínicas) da Universidade Estadual de Maringá, um total de 435 amostras de pacientes com suspeita clínica de onicomicose. Destas amostras 74, 25 % (N = 323) foram positivas, sendo 15, 48 % confirmadas por exame direto (N= 50), 20, 43 % exclusivamente por cultura (N= 66) e 64, 09 % por exame direto e cultura (N= 207). As mulheres foram mais afetadas que os homens (72, 67 % e 27, 33 %), respectivamente, e a maior prevalência foi em indivíduos com mais de 40 anos. As unhas dos pés foram mais acometidas que as unhas das mãos (65, 90 % e 34, 10 %), respectivamente. Os agentes etiológicos mais freqüentes foram as leveduras (52, 17 %) isoladas especialmente das unhas das mãos.

40|$|Mycosis of the skin, {{also called}} dermatomycosis, affects {{a large part}} of the world’s {{population}} and they had a considerable influence on health in Europe until the middle of the 20 th century. Many of these infections occur as hyperendemic diseases capable of producing epidemic outbreaks in susceptible populations, especially in chil-dren and teenagers [2]. These infections now mainly affect less-developed countries, and the lower social clas-ses of industrial cities, where there are conditions of poor hygiene and a lack of health care; in this rather large pro-portion of the world’s population, for example, there is still a hyperendemia of tinea capitis in prepubertal chil-dren. Infections of the nails are also included in this group of skin mycosis, in spite of the fact that they are usually considered superficial infections; the fungal inva-sion does in fact frequently cause a hyperkeratosis reac-tion and a greater or lesser degree of destruction to the external layers or other structures. Infections of the <b>nails</b> caused by <b>fungi</b> have not been extensively studied. This is partly because traditio-nally they have been considered more a cosmetic problem than a health problem [3], and therefore of only minor importance. As dermatomycosis are not diseases requiring declaration, just like other types of mycosis, little is known of their incidence and prevalence in the world’s population. As will be seen here, most of the available data proceeds from partial clinical or mycological studies carried out in very specific areas. Sometimes even in an extremely limited population.

40|$|Charlotte E LaSenna, Antonella TostiDepartment of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USAAbstract: Onychomycosis is a {{difficult}} diagnosis to manage and treatment is sometimes avoided, as this diagnosis is often wrongly perceived as a cosmetic problem. However, onychomycosis has {{a negative impact on}} patients’ quality of life, affecting social interaction, psychological well-being, and physical activities. Onychomycosis is also a risk factor for patients with diabetes, with proven increased rates of cellulitis, gangrene, and foot ulcers. Treatments are only mild to moderately effective, and rates of relapse and reinfection are high. Oral treatments require laboratory monitoring due to risk of hepatotoxicity and may be contraindicated in some patients due to risk of drug–drug interactions. Topical treatments require prolonged application and are not very effective. Efinaconazole 10 % solution is a new topical triazole treatment for mild to moderate distal subungual onychomycosis, with good efficacy and without the need for debridement of nails. In onychomycosis of the toenails, efinaconazole 10 % solution is documented to have a statistically significant, positive impact on patient satisfaction and quality of life.

40|$|Onychomychosis, a <b>nail</b> <b>fungus</b> {{infection}} {{is the most}} frequent nail ailment, constituting {{about half of all}} nail disorders. It can be caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophytes, yeasts and Prothoteca spp. Methods include 5407 samples of patients with suspected onychomycosis, studied from January 2002 to December 2006, by direct mycological examination and fungi culture. The diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed in samples from 3822 direct mycological and/or culture positive. The diagnosis was established by culture for fungi. Among the 1. 428 identified agents, the dermatophytes were responsible for 68. 6 % (N = 980) of cases, followed by yeasts with 27. 6 % (N = 394), non-dermatophytes fungi with 2. 2 % (N = 31), Prothoteca spp with 0. 1 % (N = 2), and associations with 1. 5 % (N = 22).

40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} that UV-C {{radiation}} kills fungus by radiating their DNA. We wanted to verify, if we could use radiation produced by excimer laser as an alternative method {{for the treatment of}} onychomycosis – <b>nail</b> <b>fungus.</b> Medical procedure like this should meet certain conditions such as perfectly and reliably destroying the fungi and to make no harm to the patient (in this case overheating of the under-nail tissue). The main part of the first stage of this work was to determine the coefficients for transmission, reflection and absorption of nails to determine the quantity of energy going through and absorbed by the nail – that means quantity of energy which could harm the healthy tissue. In the following stage we focused on the irradiation of the fungi. Our final task was to assess whether is it possible to determine the parameters of the radiation (total dose, dose per pulse frequency, repetition rate and number of pulses) for which the elimination of the fungi would be most effective without damaging the nail and the soft tissue underneath it. The results so far have proven that UV-C radiation does not pass through a fingernail to such extent that it could damage the soft tissue beneath it. We've measured the absorption and transmission spectrum for the nail tissue at the first time and we've determined the value of absorption coefficient is α = 1. 7 mm-...|$|E
