The company turned him down because the sole would cost $4.50, when an expensive shoe at the time cost $3.75. Sperry then offered the patent to Converse Rubber Company in Boston, Massachusetts, which agreed to make blank rubber soles and ship them to Sperry for siping and then assemble the finished shoes and return them to Sperry for sale. Sperry developed a machine for cutting the <b>non-skid</b> <b>design</b> into the soles and launched the project working in his spare hours while employed full-time at the Pond Lily Company.|$|E
