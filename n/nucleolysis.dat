40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to compare short- and long-term effect on chronic low back pain of intradiscal injection of methylprednisolone with or without presence of Modic type 1 MRI changes. Patients and methodsMedical charts of patients receiving intradiscal injection of methylprednisolone from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 24 h after injection and at follow-up (12 – 14 months). Patients were studied in three groups: Modic I-a, if patients had Modic type 1 changes with no previous surgery or <b>nucleolysis</b> (n= 30); Modic I-b, if patients had Modic type 1 changes at the level of previous surgery or <b>nucleolysis</b> (n= 37); Control, if patients had no Modic type 1 changes (n= 30). ResultsTwenty-four hours after methylprednisolone injection, higher proportion of patients with self-assessed improvement was observed in Modic I-a (90 %) and Modic I-b (71 %) than in Control (30 %). Low back pain decreased in both Modic groups. Low back pain did not vary from baseline in controls. No effect was detected in three groups, neither for radiating pain 24 h after injection, nor for any outcome parameters at the latest follow-up. ConclusionsWe suggest that patients with disabling chronic low back pain and Modic type 1 MRI changes have specific acute response to intradiscal injection of methylprednisolone. Clinical studies are however necessary to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of such injections...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrity}} {{and stability of}} nucleosomes under transcription assay conditions {{has been found to}} depend on concentration and ionic environment. Rifamycin AF/ 013, a commonly used inhibitor of initiation, is particularly effective in destabilisation of nucleosomes. Intact nucleosomes are refractory to transcription by wheat RNA polymerase II, the histone core preventing initiation. Template titration suggests that the polymerase can, however, bind to nucleosomes, and a 15 [...] 16 S complex has been observed on sucrose gradients. DNase I digestion of polymerase-nucleosome incubations indicates that whilst histone is still present in the complex, the nucleosome conformation is altered resulting in enhanced <b>nucleolysis</b> at sites near the DNA centre but reduced overall kinetics of digestion...|$|E

40|$|Efforts {{to catalog}} {{eukaryotic}} transcripts have uncovered many small RNAs (sRNAs) derived from gene termini and splice sites. Their biogenesis pathways are largely unknown, but a mechanism based on backtracking of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) has been suggested. By sequencing transcripts 12 – 100 nucleotides in length from cells depleted of major RNA degradation enzymes and RNAs associated with Argonaute (AGO 1 / 2) effector proteins, we provide mechanistic models for sRNA production. We suggest that neither splice site–associated (SSa) nor transcription start site–associated (TSSa) RNAs arise from RNAPII backtracking. Instead, SSa RNAs are largely degradation products of splicing intermediates, whereas TSSa RNAs probably derive from nascent RNAs protected by stalled RNAPII against <b>nucleolysis.</b> We also reveal new AGO 1 / 2 -associated RNAs derived from 3 ′ ends of introns and from mRNA 3 ′ UTRs {{that appear to}} draw from noncanonical microRNA biogenesis pathways...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{emission}} measurements {{by means}} of 3 He neutron detectors were performed on solid test specimens during crushing failure. The tests were carried out at the Laboratory of Fracture Mechanics of the Politecnico di Torino. The materials used were marble and granite, selected in that they present a different behaviour in compression failure (i. e., a different brittleness index) and a different iron content. All the test specimens were {{of the same size}} and shape. Neutron emissions from the granite test specimens were found to be of about one order of magnitude higher than the natural background level at the time of failure. These neutron emissions should be caused by <b>nucleolysis</b> or piezonuclear "fissions" that occurred in the granite, but did not occur in the marble: Fe 2 Al 2 neutrons. 14 13 30 26   The present natural abundance of aluminum (7 - 8 % in the Earth crust), which is less favoured than iron from a nuclear point of view, is possibly due to the above piezonuclear fission reactio...|$|E
40|$|Ribonuclease {{mitochondrial}} RNA processing (RNase MRP) is a multifunctional ribonucleoprotein (RNP) {{complex that}} {{is involved in}} the maturation of various types of RNA including ribosomal RNA. RNase MRP consists of a potential catalytic RNA and several protein components, all of which are required for cell viability. We show here that the temperature-sensitive mutant of rmp 1, the gene for a unique protein component of RNase MRP, accumulates the dimeric tRNA precursor, pre-tRNA(Ser-Met). To examine whether RNase MRP mediates tRNA maturation, we purified the RNase MRP holoenzyme from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and found that the enzyme directly and selectively cleaves pre-tRNA(Ser-Met), suggesting that RNase MRP participates in the maturation of specific tRNA in vivo. In addition, mass spectrometry-based ribonucleoproteomic analysis demonstrated that this RNase MRP consists of one RNA molecule and 11 protein components, including a previously unknown component Rpl 701. Notably, limited <b>nucleolysis</b> of RNase MRP generated an active catalytic core consisting of partial mrp 1 RNA fragments, which constitute "Domain 1 " in the secondary structure of RNase MRP, and 8 proteins. Thus, the present study provides new insight into the structure and function of RNase MRP...|$|E
40|$|Granzyme (gzm) A and gzmB {{have been}} implicated in Fas-independent nucleolytic and cytolytic {{processes}} exerted by cytotoxic T (Tc) cells, but the underlying mechanism(s) remains unclear. In this study, we compare the potential of Tc and natural killer (NK) cells of mice deficient in both gzmA and B (gzmA×B−/−) with those from single knockout mice deficient in gzmA (−/−), gzmB (−/−), or perforin (−/−) to induce nuclear damage and lysis in target cells. With the exception of perforin−/−, all in vitro– and ex vivo–derived Tc and NK cell populations from the mutant strains induced 51 Cr-release in target cells at levels and with kinetics {{similar to those of}} normal mice. This contrasts with their capacity to induce apoptotic nuclear damage in target cells. In gzmA×B−/− mice, Tc/NK-mediated target cell DNA fragmentation was not observed, even after extended incubation periods (10 h), but was normal in gzmA-deficient and only impaired in gzmB-deficient mice in short-term (2 – 4 h), but not long-term (4 – 10 h), nucleolytic assays. This suggests that gzmA and B are critical for Tc/NK granule– mediated <b>nucleolysis,</b> with gzmB being the main contributor, while target cell lysis is due solely to perforin and independent of both proteases...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} we {{questioned}} the current {{view that the}} two principal cytotoxic pathways, the exocytosis and the Fas ligand (FasL) /Fas-mediated pathway, have largely nonoverlapping biological roles. For this purpose we have analyzed the response of mice that lack Fas as well as granzyme A (gzmA) and gzmB (FasxgzmAxB -/-) to infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We show that FasxgzmAxB -/- mice, in contrast to B 6, Fas -/-, and gzmAxB -/- mice, do not recover from a primary infection with LCMV, {{in spite of the}} expression of comparable numbers of LCMV-immune and gamma interferon-producing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in all mouse strains tested. Ex vivo-derived FasxgzmAxB -/- CTL lacked nucleolytic activity and expressed reduced cytolytic activity compared to B 6 and Fas -/- CTL. Furthermore, virus-immune CTL with functional FasL and perforin (gzmAxB -/-) are more potent in causing target cell apoptosis in vitro than those expressing FasL alone (perfxgzmAxB -/-). This synergistic effect of perforin on Fas-mediated <b>nucleolysis</b> of target cells is indicated by the fact that, compared to perfxgzmAxB -/- CTL, gzmAxB -/- CTL induced (i) an accelerated decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, (ii) increased generation of reactive oxygen species, and (iii) accelerated phosphatidylserine exposure on plasma membranes. We conclude that perforin does not mediate recovery from LCMV by itself but plays a vital role in both gzmA/B and FasL/Fas-mediated CTL activities, including apoptosis and control of viral infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} pathological changes in brain tissues of Frisien Holstein dairy cattle affected by organophosphate (OP). The study was directed to anticipate spongiform encephalopathy. Samples consisted of animal feeds, sera and brain tissues were collected from Lembang, West Java. Animal feeds (fodders and commercial feed) were collected directly from the dairy farms around Lembang. Sera (31 samples) were from dairy cattle owned by the local farmers and brain tissues were from the local animal slaughter house. Pesticide residues were analysed following a standard procedure using gas chromatography (GC). There was an interaction between pesticide residues in animal feeds, residue level of pesticides in sera and brain tissues to cause encephalopathy in dairy cattle. Pesticide contamination in animal feeds was regarded as the source of encephalopathy in dairy cattle. The total average of OP residues (16. 8 ppb) were lower than organochlorines/OC (18. 7 ppb) in fodder, showing that pesticides were originated from the contaminated soils. On the other hand, the total average of OP residues in commercial feeds (12. 0 ppb), sera (85. 6 ppb) and brain tissues (22. 7 ppb) were higher than OC (1. 8; 16. 7; and 5. 1 ppb). The OP appears more frequently used for dairy farm activity as insecticides. Histopathological examination for brain tissues of dairy cattle showed that most cattle were diagnosed as encephalopathy with microscopic changes of vacuolation, neuronal necrosis, chromatolysis of neurons and <b>nucleolysis</b> of neurons. The encephalopathy was confirmed in rats intoxicated with chlorpyrifos methyl as severe brain damage with spongiform-like lesions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionDiscogenic {{lumbosciatica}} is {{a common}} disorder in patients between 30 and 40 years old. Because of the frequency and socio-professional impact of this entity, it represents a real public health problem. DiscoGel® is a class III medical device used for <b>nucleolysis</b> to avoid discectomy. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment in patients with discogenic lumbosciatica following unsuccessful conservative medical treatment. Materials and methodsThis is a retrospective, single-center study including 25 patients who were treated with DiscoGel® between 2010 and 2011 at Niort Hospital, France. The severity of lumbar and radicular pain was assessed by a verbal numeric scale (VNS) and patient satisfaction. Patients were classified as successes or failures. ResultsTreatment was found to reduce the severity of lumbar pain in 73 % and of radicular pain in 80 % of patients in the success group. Treatment was a failure in 64 % of patients. A comparison of the two groups showed that a preoperative MODIC 2 MRI signal of the adjacent vertebral end plate was significantly associated with treatment failure (Chi 2 = 8572, P <  0. 01). DiscussionThe VNS for lumbar pain and radicular pain decreased in 42 % and 50 % of patients respectively after the use of DiscoGel®. In our series, DiscoGel® treatment was unsuccessful for discogenic lumbosciatica in 16 patients. These results do not support others in the literature. A lack of statistical power could partly explain these results. The most important result of this study is found in the subgroup analysis which suggests that indications for DiscoGel® treatment could be modified in the future in relation to preoperative imaging data.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesSciatica is {{a common}} disease; between 13 % and 40 % of the general {{population}} will experience at least one episode of sciatica due to spinal disc herniation and nerve root irritation. In some specialist centres, percutaneous intradiscal techniques can be applied as an intermediate measure between conservative treatment and surgery, with a view to avoiding the adverse events associated with surgical discectomy. Discogel® is a percutaneously implanted medical device for the treatment of lumbar sciatica due to a herniated disc. We performed an open, prospective, observational study in order to (a) determine whether the prior use of air disc manometry could limit the risk of nerve root irritation reportedly associated with <b>nucleolysis</b> and administration of Discogel® and (b) investigate the technique's efficacy and safety. MethodA total of 79 Discogel®-treated patients were systematically reviewed. A nurse anaesthetist evaluated each patient's pain levels during the procedure itself. The therapist assessed the patient on inclusion and 8 weeks after the Discogel® procedure. A third assessment was based on a telephone interview (by an independent assessor) at least 4 months after the procedure. ResultsPain levels immediately after the Discogel® procedure (1. 7 ± 2. 0) were markedly lower than before the procedure (5. 5 ± 2. 3). There were no complications. Two months after Discogel® administration, the initial pain level had fallen by an average of 74 ± 34 %. The outcome was quite stable over time (mean follow-up: 8 months). At the end of the follow-up period, 60. 7 % of the patients were free of pain, 76 % considered the treatment outcome to be good or very good, 74 % had returned to work and 76 % would recommend the treatment to a friend. ConclusionThe favourable outcomes associated with the procedure should now be confirmed in a controlled trial...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} farming system between rice and beef cattle was initiated in 2000 in Sukamandi, West Java. However, since 2002 some cattle were suffering from neurological and ophthamological signs, {{and some of}} them were found dead after consuming rice straws. Field studies showed that 6 out of 12 cattle were suffered from eye disorders such as blindness, corneal opacity and sereous lacrimation. Two of 6 cattle were severely affected. But, neurological signs were not found during field observation. Pesticide analysis in rice straws shows that both groups of pesticide, organochlorines (OP) and organophosphates (OP) were detected. Residues of OC were higher than OP as shown as 14. 41 vs 2. 84 ppm (before processing) for OC and 1. 80 vs 0. 0003 ppm (processed) for OP consisting aldrin, lindane, dieldrin, endosulfan and chlorpyrifos methyl. There was only OC detected in sera consisting lindane (0. 6 – 37. 6 ppb); heptachlor (0. 03 – 4. 4 ppb); and aldrin (0. 8 – 20. 4 ppb) with an average total of 21, 4 ppb. The neurological and ophthalmological signs were suspected to be due to organophosphates (OPs) contaminated-rice straws and any other factors such as insufficient vitamin A, magnesium and calcium. Feed replacement with fresh grasses for two cattle reduced corneal changes. Similar symptoms were also reproduced in Wistar rats dosed intraperitoneally with chlorpyriphos methyl. Clinical signs included incoordination, cachexia, eye disorder and corneal opacity. Necropsy showed hepatic injury (hepatic necrosis, mottling of hepatic surface and pale); pale kidneys; swollen of spleen and hyperaemic brain. Microscopic changes were found in brain, liver and eyes. Hepatic changes included haemorrhages, centrolobular hepatic necrosis and focal coagulative necrosis. Brains were showing focal necrosis, haemorrhages, vacuolisation, neuronal necrosis, chromatolysis and <b>nucleolysis.</b> Eyes appeared to have necrosis of tunica muscularis, haemorrhages and eosinophilic infiltration. The study indicates that organophosphates contamination in rice straws as animal feed may lead chronic neurological and ophthalmological symptoms...|$|E
