5|$|Termite alates only {{leave the}} colony when a <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> takes place. Alate {{males and females}} pair up {{together}} and then land {{in search of a}} suitable place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never go outside and spend {{the rest of their lives}} in the nest. <b>Nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with large individuals, can number in the millions.|$|E
5|$|Virgin queens {{and males}} appear in colonies during January, before their <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight.</b> 20 females or fewer {{are found in}} a single colony, while males are much more common. The <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> begins at {{different}} times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), {{but there is one}} case of a <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> occurring from May to July. Ideal conditions for <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30km/h (18mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F), and elevations of 91 metres (300ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although as many as four queens may leave the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and polyandrous, with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous. For example, nearly 80% of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly polyandrous. <b>Nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a glandular secretion from the tergal gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and will drop to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. M. pulchra queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that {{eats the}} virgin queens during <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> {{due to their}} high percentage of fat. Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; instead, they usually attack nests during August to October, which is when the winged females and males, known as alates emerge from their nest. Queens will also face more threats during <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently excavated soil, will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nuptial</b> <b>flights</b> {{take place}} in June, {{although}} they may be postponed during colder years to July.|$|R
50|$|F. fusca {{feeds on}} small insects, aphid {{honeydew}} and extrafloral nectaries. Alate (winged) forms are produced in June/July and <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights</b> are in July/August.|$|R
25|$|Only two castes in {{the colony}} reproduce, the queens and the males. Workers are sterile and tend to the queen and brood. Mating occurs during <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights,</b> where winged queens and males swarm outside the nest.|$|R
5|$|Ants are not {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} that perform raids. Many sphecoid wasps and several species including Polybia Lepeletier and Angiopolybia Araujo are known to raid termite mounds during the termites' <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|As colonies {{closer to}} each other are more genetically similar, {{independent}} colony foundation is most likely associated with <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> if they disperse far from genetically similar colonies they originate from. Inseminated queens could even seek adoption into alien colonies if a suitable nest site area for independent colony foundation is restricted or cannot be carried out, known as the nest-site limitation hypothesis. Some queens could even try {{to return to their}} nests that they came from after <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight,</b> but end in another nest, in association that nests nearby will be similar to the queens birth nest.|$|E
5|$|Only {{reproductive}} ants, queens, and males, have wings. Queens {{shed their}} wings after the <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight,</b> leaving visible stubs, a distinguishing feature of queens. In a few species, wingless queens (ergatoids) and males occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nuptial</b> <b>flights</b> {{are common}} in Monteverde, and the distinctively {{patterned}} dealate queens are often seen on the roads. Dealate queens have been observed out cutting leaves, suggesting the queens need to forage themselves to establish a colony.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we {{document}} {{for the first time}} flight patterns along a 24 h time range for an ant assemblage {{in one of the most}} diverse ecosystems on Earth, the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Malaise traps were used to analyze the diurnal <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights</b> of a Neotropical ant assemblage during five days. Traps captured 802 individuals, revealing a remarkably high diversity (42 ant species), with samples strongly male biased (1 : 22). Contrariwise to similar studies, we found only a small proportion of species engaged in nocturnal <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights,</b> with diurnal flights accounting for an impressive 95 % of all ant flight activity recorded. For the 18 most common species, three ant groups could be identified regarding flight period: sunrise, sunset, and continuous flight activity. Similarity analyses, however, suggest that closely related time ranges of flight activity may actually not be continuous. Further, three species showed pulsed flight activity, at varied hours of the day. Two species of Hypoponera showed flight activity at different periods of the day, suggesting congeneric staggered <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights.</b> Our results match long-term studies of ant assemblages showing high diversity of flight phenologies in hyperdiverse tropical ant assemblages and provide the first data on the reproductive phenology for several Neotropical ant species...|$|R
2500|$|Mating amongst wasps {{commonly}} {{occurs during}} warm season. There {{is a tendency}} for males to occupy a dense area on trees and shrubs and perform <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights.</b> They swarm in groups. D. norwegica males [...] and a few workers have been found with on a rocky summit in Scotland in groups.|$|R
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about its {{reproduction}} or <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight.</b> Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not {{large enough to be}} reproductive ants. However, it is possible that <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight,</b> queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants. This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs {{on the side of the}} larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and pupae, the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest. In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|Most ants are univoltine, {{producing}} {{a new generation}} each year. During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females, and winged males leave the colony in {{what is called a}} <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight.</b> The <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> usually takes place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid. Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests. Males typically take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{show that}} <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> {{does not occur}} before February. This is based on larvae {{spinning}} into cocoons by November, and by January, these cocoons could not produce adult workers or reproductive males and females. Queens are most likely fertilised by males sometime between February and April; however, scientists have seen alates engage in <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> during March. Before emerging from their parent nest, queens will shed their wings inside the nest and mate with low-flying males nearby. After <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight,</b> a queen will isolate herself and form a small chamber underground, where she remains for seven to eight months. However, it is improbable that a queen can survive on her own storage of fat and wing-musculature for that long. During this time, the queen may emerge from her nest occasionally, but she will only lay eggs from October to November {{when there is a}} rich supply of food. While this may be the case, some queens will lay eggs after a month of isolation during winter. M.regularis is a semi-clasutral ant, meaning that a queen will go out and forage in order to feed her young. Queens will emerge from their nests from time to time, during which they will capture insects for their young or feed on sweet substances. If food sources are deprived, a queen will only rely on her fat to feed the larvae until she perishes or finds food, but the larvae will not be cannibalised, and remain alive until a week after the queen's death. An individual ant may take eight months to develop from an egg to an adult.|$|E
50|$|Disparities {{between local}} weather {{conditions}} can cause <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights</b> {{to be out}} of phase amongst widespread populations of L. niger. During long-lasting, hot summers, flights can take place simultaneously across the country, but overcast weather with local patches of sunshine results in a far less synchronised emergence of alates (winged individuals).|$|R
50|$|Acrobat ants {{acquire food}} largely through {{predation}} of other insects, like wasps. They use venom to stun their prey and a complex trail-laying process to lead comrades to food sources. Like many social insects, they reproduce in <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights</b> {{and the queen}} stores sperm as she starts a new nest.|$|R
50|$|Mating amongst wasps {{commonly}} {{occurs during}} warm season.

D. norwegica males and a few workers have been found with on a rocky summit in Scotland in groups.|$|R
5|$|Although most banded sugar ant colonies are monogynous (a nest that {{contains}} a single queen), some {{have been found to}} be polygynous, where a colony will have multiple queens; this is the fourth Camponotus species that is recognized as exhibiting polygyny. In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are monandrous, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight,</b> although virgin queens and males (alates) were observed mating in South Australia in January. This hints that banded sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. Ideal conditions for <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), which is when the alates begin to swarm. A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven years or more. The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is known to adopt larvae and pupae from banded sugar ant colonies.|$|E
5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when {{the rainy season}} begins. During a <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight,</b> they are typically seen around lights {{to which they are}} attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E
5|$|Both {{independent}} and dependent colony foundation can occur after mating. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns {{have been recorded}} with M. pilosula queens, where nests that tend to be closer together were more genetically {{related to each other}} in comparison to other nests further away. Independent colony foundation is closely associated with queens which engage in <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> in areas far from their home colony, showing that dependent colony foundation mostly occurs if they mate near their nest. In some cases, queens could seek adoption into alien colonies if there are no suitable areas to find a nest or independent colony foundation cannot be carried out. Other queens could try and return to their home nest after <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight,</b> but they may end up in another nest near the nest they originally came from. In multiple-queen societies, the egg-laying queens are generally unrelated to one another, but one study showed that it is possible for multiple queens in the same colony to be genetically related to each other. Depending on the species, the number of individuals present in a colony can range from 50 to over 2,200 individuals. A colony with less than 100 workers is not considered a mature colony. M. dispar colonies have around 15 to 329 ants, M. nigrocincta have over 1,000, M. pyriformis have from 200 to over 1,400 and M. gulosa have nearly 1,600. A colony can last for a number of years. Foraging behaviour among smaller workers which never usually leave the nest can be a sign of a colony's impending demise.|$|E
40|$|We used {{radio-frequency}} identification (RFID) {{to record the}} duration and frequency of <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights</b> of honey bee queens (Apis mellifera carnica) at two mainland mating apiaries. We investigated {{the effect of a}} number of factors on flight duration and frequency: mating apiary, number of drone colonies, queen’s age and temperature. We found {{significant differences between the two}} locations concerning the number of flights on the first three days. We also observed an effect of the ambient temperature, with queens flying less often but longer at high temperatures compared to lower temperatures. Increasing the number of drone colonies from 33 to 80 colonies had no effect on the duration or on the frequency of <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights.</b> Since our results agree well with the results of previous studies, we suggest RFID as an appropriate tool to investigate the mating behavior of honey bee queens...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{species of}} ant {{disperse}} {{a large amount}} of sexual individuals in the air at once, synchronized with other colonies of the same species. This increases the mixing of individuals from different colonies, and therefore inhibits genetic instability through inbreeding. While in A. striatus, few individuals participate in <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights,</b> increasing the likelihood of mating with related individuals. Also, breeding time is extended over a period of months, not weeks. Sexual individuals are produced from October to January, with small numbers of individuals departing the nest every day while it is sunny. [...] Therefore, polyandry, which is the behavior of multiple fathers contributing their sperm, {{plays an important role in}} maintaining genetic diversity. We can see evidence of this theory in reality as there are more males than females on average in A. striatus <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{night after}} rain showers, {{such as in}} the weather in which {{termites}} undertake their <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights,</b> barking geckos commonly leave their burrows to hunt actively for prey. During the brief season when the termites take to flight, they form {{an important part of the}} geckos' nutrition. At other times of the year, the geckos are mainly ambush predators, awaiting prey at the burrow entrance and sallying forth opportunistically.|$|R
5|$|M.regularis {{is found}} in the {{south-western}} coastal regions, inhabiting eucalypt woodland and open forests. They nest underground and do not build mounds. Workers are active during the day and night, foraging on trees in search for prey and sweet substances such as sap and nectar. The larvae are strictly carnivorous and only eat insects that workers capture. <b>Nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> occurs around February to April, with queens shedding their wings inside the nest and mating near to their parent nest. Queens tend to look for food for their young before they hatch, taking as long as eight months to develop. Certain frog species are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> occurs after rain {{for several}} days, taking place between summer and mid-autumn (December to March). The males and virgin queens emerge from their nest, and unlike other species who mate {{on the ground}} or climb onto nearby trees or {{branches}} to fly off from, the reproductive alates will fly from the nest. Recorded nuptial flights usually took place on hilltops. M. nigriceps queens are not known to seal up their entrance during colony foundation, unlike other Myrmecia species such as M. regularis. Workers can live exceptionally long, with an average lifespan of 2.2 years; maximum longevity in workers varied from 2.1 to 2.4 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} caste of {{a mature}} colony includes a fertile female and male, {{known as the}} queen and king. The queen of the colony is responsible for egg production for the colony. Unlike in ants, the king mates with her for life. In some species, the abdomen of the queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity, a characteristic known as physogastrism. Depending on the species, the queen starts producing reproductive winged alates {{at a certain time}} of the year, and huge swarms emerge from the colony when <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> begins. These swarms attract a wide variety of predators.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a 26 -summer study of the ants on an 1146 acre (464 ha) natural history reserve in southeastern Michigan are presented. Habitat {{distribution}} and nest construction {{for each of the}} 87 species are recorded. The sites of collections of each species on the Reserve are shown on maps. In addition, records of colony populations, brood development and <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights</b> of many of the species are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Ants mate on the wing, so [...] "flying ants" [...] are {{males and}} elates (virgin queens). The mating (or <b>nuptial)</b> <b>flights</b> of Lasius niger usually occur around June to September {{throughout}} the species' range; in North America flights usually occur during the autumn, whereas in Europe they generally take {{place during the}} hot summer months of July and August. Flights can contain thousands of winged males and females.|$|R
25|$|Camponotus anderseni {{are rarely}} seen {{foraging}} {{which has led}} scientists to believe that these ants rely on another food source. Due to the high numbers of coccids, their main food source is most likely honeydew. Very {{little is known about}} the dispersion of coccids to new chambers. It seems unlikely that the new queens transport coccids during <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights,</b> because no coccids are ever found in chambers less than 6 weeks old.|$|R
5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight,</b> fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. Workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar, soiling either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes. The <b>nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer, as in extant relatives.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{workers are}} gamergates, meaning they can {{reproduce}} with winged males. With workers {{taking over the}} reproductive role, queens are relatively insignificant and are rarely produced in colonies. <b>Nuptial</b> <b>flight</b> begins in spring, with males mating {{with one or two}} females. Queens that establish their own colonies are semi-claustral, going out and forage to support their young. Another way colonies are formed is through budding, where a subset of the colony leaves the main colony for an alternative nest site. The green-head ant is known for its painful and venomous sting that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. However, they can also be beneficial to humans, acting as a form of pest control by preying on agricultural pests such as beetles, moths and termites.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} {{involved}} in ant keeping is capturing a fertilized queen ant. Ants engage in <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights</b> during spring and summer, and after these flights a fertilized queen ant will land and remove her wings before locating a spot to found her new colony. If a queen has already chewed her wings off, she is likely (but not certainly) fertilized. If a queen ant {{on the ground}} still has her wings, she is likely (but not certainly) unfertilized.|$|R
50|$|Neoitamus melanopogon is {{an insect}} predator. It can hunt {{many kinds of}} insects, such as Ant, bee or Butterfly. It jumps on their back and injects them a neurotoxin to paralyze them. After that, it sucks the organs inside its preys. The common robber fly can {{occasionally}} eat the queen of Solenopsis (ant) species during <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights.</b> Its larvae is also a predator in the soil (Macfarlane et al., 1999). This fly can also eat other Diptera and so other robber flies.|$|R
50|$|Some pairs nest year-round, but {{the primary}} {{breeding}} season is from December to May, during which pairs often engage in spectacular <b>nuptial</b> <b>flights.</b> The clutch size is usually eight. The female lays two to ten {{eggs in a}} well-concealed nest lined with down and breast feathers. Incubation lasts about four weeks. The young can take to the water soon after hatching, but cannot fly until about nine weeks of age. Offspring become sexually mature enough to reproduce after a year.|$|R
