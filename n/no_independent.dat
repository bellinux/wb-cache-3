5|$|A second {{demonstration}} ran between 15 December 2009 and February 2010 at the Waterways Visitor Centre in Dublin, and was streamed via Steorn's website. The demonstration was of {{a device}} powered by a rechargeable battery. Steorn said that the device produced more energy than it consumed and recharged the battery. No substantive details of the technology were revealed and <b>no</b> <b>independent</b> evidence of Steorn's claim was provided.|$|E
5|$|The authority's Board of Directors {{consists}} of two voting representatives each from the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and the U.S. federal government.

5|$|Born to {{a working-class}} Italian American family in Dudley, Massachusetts, {{he was raised}} Roman Catholic {{although}} became interested in esotericism as a teenager. He later claimed {{that when he was}} 21, relatives initiated him into a tradition of witchcraft inherited from their Sicilian ancestors; this conflicts with other statements that he made, and there is <b>no</b> <b>independent</b> evidence to corroborate his claim. During the 1950s, he was based in New York City, where he worked as a graphologist and hypnotist. After beginning to publish books on paranormal topics in the early 1960s, he publicly began identifying as Wiccan in 1969, and stated that he was involved in a New York coven.|$|E
50|$|The UK-based UK Independence Party {{announced}} in 2014 {{that it was}} planning on fielding candidates {{for the first time}} in Gibraltar's next general election. However, ultimately they did not field any candidates. There were also <b>no</b> <b>independents,</b> the first occasion on which <b>no</b> <b>independents</b> or members of any party outside of Parliament contested the elections.|$|R
50|$|The Conservatives {{retained}} {{control of}} the council in the 2007 elections with a majority of four over the Liberal Democrats; these being the only two groups with elected councillors in 2007. Labour lost their last two councillors. <b>No</b> <b>independents</b> were elected.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, <b>no</b> <b>independents</b> were {{successful}} in being elected with former councillor Peter Carr coming closest after losing by 66 votes. The other candidates from the Labour party, British National Party and Official Monster Raving Loony Party each failed to get more than 200 votes.|$|R
5|$|Of the 56 riders that {{signed up}} to {{participate}} in the 1912 Giro d'Italia, 54 of them began the race on 19 May. Since the race's general classification was to be based around team points there were <b>no</b> <b>independent</b> riders as in years past. The organizers allowed the participating teams to have up to four riders, with each team needing three riders to finish each stage to remain in the race. There were a total of fourteen teams that started the 1912 Giro d'Italia. A French team was planning on competing in the race, but opted not to and so all the teams that competed were based in Italy. This edition of the Giro d'Italia saw the first teams enter the race that were not sponsored by a bicycle related industry.|$|E
5|$|African {{elephants}} {{were listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008, with <b>no</b> <b>independent</b> {{assessment of the}} conservation status of the two forms. In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0million. By 1989, the population {{was estimated to be}} 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in eastern Africa, 204,000 in southern Africa, and 19,000 in western Africa. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern Africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%. Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork. The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012.|$|E
