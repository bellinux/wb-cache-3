40|$|Purpose: Laparoscopic pyeloplasty {{has been}} {{associated}} with long operative times. This study proposed to evaluate the feasibility of two different laparoscopic techniques for the performance of pyeloplasty repair of secondary ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. Materials and Methods: Sixteen female Yucatan minipigs underwent general anesthesia for cystoscopy, retrograde pyelography, urine culture and a baseline renal scan. Unilateral UPJ obstruction was created by ligating the UPJ over a 5 F catheter. Six weeks later a laparoscopic pyeloplasty was performed utilizing an intracorporeal suturing technique and the Lapra-Ty <b>suture</b> <b>clip</b> or the Endostitch device with intracorporeal knot tying.

30|$|Risk {{factors for}} the acute {{occurrence}} of an arterial failed puncture during {{the insertion of}} a dialysis catheter are prior irradiation of the implanted region or postoperative changes at the insertion site [7]. In addition, patient obesity and lack of expertise by the interventional radiologist play important roles [7]. The error rate of failed arterial puncture {{without the aid of}} ultrasound is 8.4  % [8]. The incidence of error is higher for the internal jugular vein (VJI) than for the subclavian vein (VS) [9]. Up to 30  % of failed arterial punctures can become symptomatic and cause complications, as seen with the onset of haematoma, haemothorax, and neurological deficits [9]. The optimal treatment management ranges from haemostasis by compression to vascular surgery or an endovascular intervention [10]. Since it is generally difficult to compress the subclavian artery manually, aside from a vascular surgical intervention, arterial occlusion by a <b>suture,</b> <b>clip,</b> or collagen-based closure system is possible [10].|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Barbed sutures are {{routinely}} used for laparotomy, peritoneal and mesenteric closure, but {{few studies have}} reported their use for intestinal anastomosis. We proposed their use for totally handsewn anastomosis during laparoscopic gastric bypass secured {{at the end of}} the suture with an absorbable clip. Materials and Method: Two totally hand-sewn single-layer extramucosal running sutures were performed for side-to-side gastrojejunal and jejuno-jejunal anastomosis during laparoscopic gastric bypass. Each run (anterior and posterior layer) was locked at the end by an absorbable poly-p-dioxanone <b>suture</b> <b>clip.</b> Results: A total of 96 hand-sewn anastomoses were performed. A total of two leaks occurred originating from the jejunaljejunal anastomosis. No cases of leakage from gastrojejunostomy were recorded. Two stenoses of the gastrojejunal anastomosis were recorded. They were successfully treated with three sessions of endoscopic balloon dilatation. No bleeding occurred. Conclusion: In our experience, the suture-related complication rate is comparable with the data reported in the literature. Further studies are needed to address the safety and efficacy of the self-maintained suture in digestive surgery...|$|R

The safety and effectiveness of barded sutures already has been demonstrated in two other studies [3, 6].

The impact of various factors in the different models was also analyzed, including learning curves, operative time, survival curves, and histopathological findings. RESULTS: According to anatomical results, models with 75 %, 80 %, and 90 % hepatectomy produced massive hepatectomy. Learning curves and operative times were most optimal with the clip technique. Each hepatectomy performed using the clip technique produced a reasonable survival curve, {{and there were no}} differences in histopathological findings between the <b>suture</b> and <b>clip</b> techniques.

40|$|Extract] Many {{surgical}} procedures are conducted each year. The {{majority of these}} procedures result in wounds that heal by primary intention, {{which means that the}} wound edges are approximated using <b>sutures,</b> staples, <b>clips</b> or glue. In wounds healing by secondary intention, the edges are not approximated and the wound heals by granulation, re-epithelialisation and contraction. Most wounds heal without complications but surgical site infections can occur after surgery in the site where the surgery took place. Most wound infections are caused by contamination during surgery with the patient’s own micro-organisms (Kulayalat 2007). They may be superficial and self-limiting, involving the skin only, or they may be deeper and life-threatening. Surgical site infection is classified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as superficial incisional, deep incisional and organ/space infections (CDC 2014; Mangram 1999) ...|$|R

30|$|TLH {{was carried}} out similar to a {{recently}} described technique [12]. Briefly, all classic surgical steps are carried out laparoscopically, using bipolar energy for dissection of the ligaments and coagulation of the vascular pedicles. The bladder peritoneum is dissected with ultrasonic energy and the cervico-vaginal fascia is identified anteriorly. Hereafter, the sacro-uterine ligament is dissected posteriorly and the vaginal fornix is opened circularly using ultrasonic energy, while cranial traction with the uterine manipulator is provided. To the surgeon's preference, during this step (additional), bipolar energy is used as well. The vaginal cuff is sutured transvaginally (interrupted sutures with Vicryl no. 0, Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson Medical GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany) or laparoscopically (interrupted sutures or a running suture, both single-layer). In every stitch, a full thickness bite of approximately 1  cm is obtained, containing recto-vaginal fascia and vaginal mucosa posteriorly and vaginal mucosa and pubo-cervical fascia anteriorly. In laparoscopic closure of the vaginal vault, Vicryl no. 0 {{is used for the}} interrupted sutures, which are secured with intracorporeal tied knots. In case of a running suture, two different suturing methods are used according to the surgeon's preference. In one method, a double-armed barbed suture (QuillTM Self-Retaining System; Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) is used, in which the barbs change direction at mid-point. This suture is bidirectionally sutured from the midline to both lateral angles of the vaginal cuff [13]. In the other, we adopted (off label) a suturing technique commonly used in transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). In this technique a regular Vicryl no. 0 with a suture staple placed at the distal end of the wire is sutured from the right to the left angle of the vaginal cuff, after which another suture staple is placed at the proximal end to secure the <b>suture</b> (<b>suture</b> <b>clip</b> forceps for TEM, Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany). In all suturing methods, both utero-sacral ligaments are incorporated in the repair and the peritoneum is unclosed.|$|R
30|$|Once the {{cultures}} were obtained, {{the skin was}} secured with either maxon <b>sutures</b> or towel <b>clips</b> to a sterile autoclave container for the Padgett Electric Dermatome turned upside down. The autoclave container was used to mount the skin specimens since it had holes that were approximately 0.5  cm apart that <b>sutures</b> or towel <b>clips</b> could be threaded through to apply tension. Given that the underlying subcutaneous tissue was uneven and therefore the surface of each specimen was sloped, clysis was performed on all specimens and was necessary to provide a flat surface for which to use the dermatome. The skin and Padgett Electric Dermatome were then wiped with mineral oil and specimens in the nominal depth range of 15 – 20 thousandths of an inch were procured. The specimens were then {{spread out on the}} remaining blades of the dermatome and in some cases with pieces of packaging material underneath to show that the specimen was thin enough such that words were legible underneath the specimen. The specimens were then photographed with a digital camera (Canon® PowerShot A 560, Canon USA, Inc., Melville, NY) and discarded. The approximate amount of time to prepare a specimen after cultures were obtained was about 40  min for suturing and 15  min for towel clips.|$|R
5000|$|Tying a {{surgical}} knot is done {{inside the body}} or outside the body. Learning to tie {{a surgical}} knot inside the body is slightly more difficult and has a steeper learning curve. This is because the surgeon uses laparoscopic instruments. Tying the knot outside the body is simpler for most because the suturing is with fingers as in traditional tying. When a surgical knot is formed outside the body it must be drawn into a laparoscopic cannula. Stronger braided suturing thread is preferred because the knot {{has a tendency to}} fray as it is slid down the cannula. At the end of the running <b>suture</b> line, <b>clips</b> can be placed across the suture tail. Barbed suture is a knotless surgical suture that has a pattern of barbs on its surface [...] These barbs lock the suture into the tissue, eliminating the tying of knots. Barbed sutures are typically used in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery. There are concerns that knot tying may be related to glove puncture but a current study demonstrated that instead friction from continuous suturing only left ‘marks’ on the little finger with no glove puncture.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the feasibility {{and safety of}} the treatment of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) submucosal tumor with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). METHODS: A total of 20 patients with esophageal and gastric submucosal tumors emerged from the muscular layer identified by endoscopic ultrasonography were collected from January 2009 to June 2010. Extramural or dumbbell-like lesions were excluded by an enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scan. All patients had intravenous anesthesia with propofol and then underwent the ESD procedure to resect these submucosal tumors. The incision was closed by clips {{as much as possible}} to decrease complications, such as bleeding or perforation, after resection of the tumor. All the specimens were collected and evaluated by hematoxylin, eosin and immunohistochemical staining, with antibodies against CD 117, CD 34, desmin, &#x 3 B 1;-smooth muscle actin and vimentin to identify the characteristics of the tumors. Fletch&#x 2019;s criteria was used to evaluate the risk of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). All patients underwent a follow-up endoscopy at 3, 6 and 12 mo and CT scan at 6 and 12 mo. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 5 men and 15 women aged 45 - 73 years, {{with a mean age of}} 60. 2 years. Three tumors were located in the esophagus, 9 in the gastric corpus, 4 in the gastric fundus, 3 lesions in the gastric antrum and 1 in the gastric angulus. Apart from the one case in the gastric angulus which was abandoned due to being deeply located in the serosa, 94. 7 % (18 / 19) achieved complete gross dissection by ESD with operation duration of 60. 52 1; 30. 32 min. The average maximum diameter of tumor was 14. 8 1; 7. 6 mm, with a range of 6 to 30 mm, and another lesion was ligated by an endoscopic ligator after most of the lesion was dissected. After pathological and immunohistochemical analysis, 12 tumors were identified as a GI stromal tumor and 6 were leiomyoma. Mitotic count of all 12 GIST lesions was fewer than 5 per 50 HPF and all lesions were at very low (9 / 12, 75. 0 %) or low risk (3 / 12, 25. 0 %) according to Fletch&#x 2019;s criteria. Procedure complications mainly included perforation and GI bleeding; perforation occurred in 1 patient and conservative treatment succeeded by a <b>suturing</b> <b>clip</b> and no post-operative GI bleeding occurred. All patients were followed up for 6. 5 1; 1. 8 mo (range, 3 - 12 mo) by endoscopy and abdominal CT. Local recurrence and metastasis did not occur in any patient. CONCLUSION: ESD shows promise as a safe and feasible technique to resect esophageal and gastric submucosal tumors and the incidence of complications was very low. Clinical studies with more subjects and longer follow-up are needed to confirm its treatment value...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Ten {{patients}} who underwent hydatid cyst surgery were evaluated retrospectively show {{the relationship between}} surgical technique and postoperative bile leakeage. Material and Methods: Ten cases with different number of cysts in different diamaeters operated for hepatic hydatid disease were evaluated retrospectively. Mean age of the patients was 52. 4 (14 - 75) with a male to female ratio of 3 / 7. Diagnosis was confirmed with serological tests, ultrasonography and computerized tomography. Results: A total number of 18 cysts were observed in 10 patients included in this study. Surgical operations applied were partial cystectomy for 11 cysts, cystotomy drainage for 3 cysts, intro-şexion for 2 cysts, and pericystectomy for 2 cysts. Of these 18 cysts, 13 cysts had clear şuid without intrabiliary rupture, and were treated by partial cystectomy or intro-şexion. After these procedures two patients had complications. External biliary fistula developed {{in one of them}} and bile peritonitis with subhepatic bilioma developed in the other. Bile fistula healed spontaneously on the tenth day. Bile peritonitis was managed by inserting a periton dialysis catheter into Douglas left for 48 hours. Subhepatic bilioma was drained percutaneously under computerized tomography and bile drainage persisted for two months, which ceased spontaneously. Conclusion: It is concluded that biliary leakage after partial cystectomy or cystotomy can be avoided by <b>suturing</b> or <b>clipping</b> cut edges of pericysts...|$|R
40|$|Background: Harmonic Scalpel and PlasmaKinetic {{have become}} {{popular with the}} promise of quick and {{effective}} vascular control. Their excellent outcomes encouraged surgeons to use these instruments for closure of the bile ducts with little or no data, establishing their efficacy or safety. Aim: The aim of this experimental study was to compare the safety and feasibility of different cystic duct closure methods (<b>suture</b> ligation, <b>clip</b> application, Harmonic Scalpel and PlasmaKinetic). Methods: Sixty non-perforated gallbladders extracted during laparoscopic cholecystectomy were studied in this ex vivo study. Gallbladders were randomly divided into four groups and the distal end of cystic ducts remaining with sacs was reclosed by one of the four different methods. By means of a catheter, air insufflation was administered into gallbladders with a pressure-controlled pump. Bursting pressure and lateral thermal injury were measured for each group, and groups were compared with each other. Results: In the Harmonic Scalpel group, a 1. 4 mm lateral thermal injury was detected, while it was 1. 6 mm in the PlasmaKinetic group. But, in terms of bursting pressure, there was not a statistically significant difference between the groups. Conclusion: Cystic duct closure with the new devices may be an alternative to surgical clips. Further trials are needed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of PlasmaKinetic usage in the clinical setting. [Arch Clin Exp Surg 2012; 1 (3. 000) : 168 - 171...|$|R
40|$|Thiel embalmed human cadavers are {{probably}} the best surgical training models available {{in terms of their}} adherence to reality. The absence of a lifelike circulation in the vascular system is, however, a shortage. As part of a wider surgical training program, this research aims to install an ongoing lifelike circulation in the total vascular system of Thiel embalmed human tissues. Initial experiments were performed in the pig model. After cannulation of a feeding artery and draining vein, red liquid paraffin was pumped through the arterial access into the vessels of a Thiel embalmed pig model until venous drainage. This closed-loop reperfusion procedure using liquid paraffin was established for several hours. This technique enabled to train basic surgical acts such as controlling subcutaneous bleedings after skin incision using coagulation devices and <b>suturing</b> or <b>clipping</b> bleeding points. But also lifelike advanced surgical procedures such as dissection, harvesting of the internal mammary artery, coronary artery bypass grafting, liver and kidney resections can be performed. Later, this technique was evaluated in human tissues and allowed to reperfuse and test surgical procedures on Thiel embalmed livers, kidneys and an arm (i. e. dissection, suturing, resection and anastomosis). Although this reperfused model is promising, validation is needed. Moreover, reperfusion of a total Thiel embalmed human body has not been performed yet and inter-organ variability of leakage of liquid paraffin into the interstitial space remains a limitation...|$|R

Eight VCDs occurred: one (1.3  %) after transvaginal interrupted closure, three (3.3  %) after laparoscopic interrupted suturing and four (2.4  %) after a laparoscopic running suture was used (p[*]=[*]. 707). With regard to the incidence of VCD, based on our data, neither a superiority of single-layer laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff with an unknotted running suture nor of the transvaginal and the laparoscopic interrupted suturing techniques could be demonstrated. We hypothesise that besides the suturing technique, other causes, such as the type and amount of coagulation used for colpotomy, may play a role in the increased risk of VCD after TLH.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} using monopolar thermal coagulation based on radiofrequency (RF) currents on intraoperative blood loss during liver resection.

RESULTS: No differences in demographic or clinical characteristics were found between groups. Mean blood loss during liver resection in the control group was more than twice that of the MRFC group (556 [*]±[*] 471 [*]ml vs. 225 [*]±[*] 313 [*]ml, p[*]=[*]. 02).

There is insufficient evidence on the most effective management of the appendix stump. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relative effectiveness and provide a treatment ranking of different options for securing the appendix stump. Methods. Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials comparing ligation methods of the appendix. The primary outcomes were organ/space infection and superficial operative site infection. We performed a network meta-analysis and estimated the pairwise relative treatment effects of the competing interventions using the odds ratio and its 95 % confidence interval. We obtained a hierarchy of the competing interventions using rankograms and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Results. Forty-three randomized controlled trials were eligible and provided data for > 5, 000 patients. Suture ligation seemed to be the most effective treatment strategy, in terms of both organ/space infection and superficial operative site infection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most incisions {{following}} surgery heal by primary intention, {{with the}} edges of the wound apposed with <b>sutures</b> or <b>clips.</b> However, some wounds may break open or be left to heal from the bottom up (i. e. healing by secondary intention). Surgical Wounds Healing by Secondary Intention (SWHSI) are often more complex to manage, and require additional treatments during the course of healing. There is significant uncertainty regarding the best treatment for these complex wounds, with limited robust evidence regarding the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different dressings and treatments; one such treatment is Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) which is frequently used in the management of SWHSI. Previous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NPWT have failed to recruit to time and target, thus we aimed to conduct a pilot RCT to assess the feasibility of conducting a future, full-scale RCT. METHODS: This pilot RCT will test the methods and feasibility of recruiting, randomising, and retaining participants into a larger trial of NPWT verses usual care for patients with SWHSI. Participants will be randomised to receive either NPWT or usual care (no NPWT) and will be followed up for 3 months. DISCUSSION: This study will provide a full assessment of methods for, and feasibility of, recruiting, randomising, and retaining patients with SWHSI in a trial of NPWT versus usual care. On the basis of this pilot trial, a full trial may be proposed in the future which will provide additional, robust evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of NPWT in the management of SWHSI.

Results: When Veriset™ hemostatic patch was used, hemostasis occurred within 5 minutes in 29 / 30 (96. 7 %) subjects and within 1 minute in 21 / 30 (70. 0 %) subjects. No device-related serious adverse events were recorded during the 30 days after surgery, and no reoperations for device-related bleeding complications were performed during the 5 days after surgery. Conclusions: Veriset™ hemostatic patch is a safe and effective hemostat for controlling soft tissue bleeding during a variety of surgical procedures.

30|$|VCD is a {{potentially}} severe adverse event. Internationally, {{the reason for}} the increased incidence of VCD after TLH is still a matter of concern. The used suturing method of the vaginal vault is mentioned as an aetiological factor. In our comparison of laparoscopic suturing of the vaginal cuff with a single-layer unknotted running suture and both laparoscopic and transvaginal closure with knotted interrupted sutures, we found the lowest incidence of VCD after transvaginal suturing (1.3  %). This was followed by both the barbed suture and the running vicryl <b>suture</b> with TEM <b>clips</b> (2.4  %), which proved to be an easy to adopt alternative. However, based on our data, no statistical superiority of either of these suturing methods could be proven. Regardless of these suturing techniques, the incidence of VCD after TLH remains high compared with abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy. Therefore, other steps of the procedure unique to TLH, such as the amount and type of coagulation used for colpotomy, should be assessed in future research as possible determinants for the onset of VCD.|$|R
40|$|Background Hadron and {{stereotactic}} radiotherapy with photons are both {{used to treat}} melanoma of the choroid in proximity to optic disc, optic nerve, and fovea centralis, a situation where plaque therapy is prone to complications. A comparative treatment planning study was done to assess the chances of both modalities to preserve vision. Material amp; Methods In 10 patients treated with protons as an alternative {{stereotactic radiotherapy}} SRT with 6 MV photons was planned. Structures most important for visual acuilty esp. fovea, optic disc, and optic nerv were contoured identically for both therapies. Supposing the same conditions existing for SRT as for proton treatment, i. e. tantalum <b>clips</b> <b>sutured</b> to the globe and orthogonal x ray verfication for setup and motion control, safety margins for SRT were reduced to 1 mm. Results Proton beam therapy was superior in 8 of 10 sitautions and this result {{did not differ significantly}} by changes in the weighting of the different paramters analysed. Conclusion When dose deposition to those structures most important for the preservation of vision is taken into acount, proton therapy offers a clear advantag...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{coronary}} anastomosis is {{the most}} difficult part of the coronary bypass procedure, particularly when using a minimally invasive technique. Methods to facilitate coronary anastomosis will make the minimally invasive approach to coronary bypass feasible. We sought preclinical validation and testing of the design and efficacy of a self-closing penetrating clip that can be used to facilitate the creation of graft-to-coronary end-to-side anastomosis. Methods: The nitinol U-Clip device (Coalescent Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif) was used in 13 consecutive calves (63 - 118 kg). In each animal, the device was (1) used to create an anastomosis of the right internal thoracic artery to a coronary artery with the heart beating and (2) compared to polypropylene suture when used to repair two carotid arteriotomies. Intraoperative, 1 -week, 8 -week, and 26 -week postoperative angiograms and detailed histopathologic examinations were used to evaluate anastomotic patency and healing characteristics. Results: The nitinol U-Clip device successfully created right internal thoracic artery–coronary artery anastomoses and repaired carotid arteriotomy sites in 13 consecutive calves. The clip was precisely placed by means of the integrated suture and needle in a fashion similar to that used for conventional <b>suture.</b> The <b>clip</b> met design specifications by reliable release and automatic closure, thereby eliminating knot tying and assisted suture management. At the time of harvest, angiography showed widely patent coronary anastomoses (FitzGibbon grade A criteria, n = 13) and carotid arteriotomy repair sites (n = 13). Histopathologic evaluation confirmed normal healing with smooth circumferential neointimal resurfacing at the anastomotic and repair sites. Conclusions: The nitinol U-Clip design and function was validated in the formation of bovine coronary anastomoses on the beating bovine heart with excellent graft patency and healing characteristics. The nitinol U-Clip device tests favorably when compared with conventional sutures in carotid artery repair. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 121 : 859 - 70...|$|R
30|$|To reduce {{surgical}} {{risk and}} post-surgical pain after the trans-obturator or trans-levator {{passage of the}} arms, it might be changed for suspension to the tendinous arch of pelvic fascia and also SSL by harpoon, Capio™ <b>suture</b> capture device, <b>clip</b> or vaginal device. These techniques are being evaluated. Suspension of a posterior prosthesis by harpoon (Elevate™) has been reviewed in 139 patients [64]. Authors report one rectal injury during dissection, two haematomas and two buttock pains. On 48 suspensions with Capio™, de Tayrac reports: one bladder injury during dissection, two embedded needles, three paravesical haematomas, two ureteral kinking, two major sciatic neuralgias and 54 % of patients had buttock pain during around 8  days (2 to 70  days) [57]. Carey suggests a post-surgical intra-vaginal device but has complications due to dissection: one rectal injury and one paravesical haematoma needing re-intervention [55]. In a multicentre study with the same technique (n[*]=[*] 136), authors also report two bladder injuries [62]. Intra-vaginal device was lost six times; two devices {{had to be taken}} away for infection and two for discomfort. Premature ablation of the device may generate more anatomic failures.|$|R
30|$|Internationally, the {{aetiology}} of VCD {{is still}} a matter of concern. Either in its technique (TLH) as in the used technology (electrosurgical colpotomy and/or suturing method), an explanation could be found for the higher incidence of VCD. In our quest to further improve vaginal vault closure, we have been using various suturing methods. At first, we switched from transvaginal closure of the vaginal vault to laparoscopic closure with interrupted sutures. Thereafter, we started using running sutures: both barbed suturing and an unknotted running <b>suturing</b> technique with <b>clips.</b> To compare these methods, a power analysis indicated {{that we would have}} needed 1, 349 cases in each arm to detect a desired reduction of 50  % in the VCD rate of 3.4  % [11] (80  % power, type I error 0.05). Since we regarded an adequately powered prospective study to be impossible to perform and given the need for more information, we conducted a retrospective cohort study based on prospectively collected data on this subject. This study aims to compare the incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence with transvaginal closure of the vaginal vault versus laparoscopic closure with knotted interrupted sutures versus laparoscopic closure with two different unknotted single-layer running suturing methods.|$|R
40|$|Liver {{transplantation}} is a technically {{complex and}} long surgical procedure. A large quantity of various {{materials such as}} catheters, <b>sutures,</b> needles and <b>clips</b> are frequently used during the procedure. These materials may enter in the liver from the vascular or biliary orifices inadver-tently. A 50 -year-old patient who had hepatic failure due to HBV underwent a deceased-donor liver transplantation. The deceased donor was a 75 -year-old HbsAg+ man. The recipient had subfebrile fever and leukocytosis post-operatively. A control computed tomography revealed a cuneiform ischemic area, and a foreign body inside the right anterior portal vein branch proxi-mal to this ischemic region. A 10 -F Nelaton catheter, 5 -cm long, {{was removed from the}} portal vein by surgery. Retrospectively, we understood that the portal vein was cut during the back-table procedure and the portal vein catheter was replaced with a larger one for better irrigation. Most probably, the original catheter was cut together with the portal vein, and the tip of the catheter was retained in the portal system and migrated into the liver. As far as we know, such a complication of liver transplantation has never been described previously...|$|R
40|$|THE ACUTE AND SUB-ACUTE EFFECTS OF ELECTROSURGICAL AND ULTRASONIC SURGICAL DEVICES ON THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES OF SCIATIC NERVE FUNCTION Since {{the dawn}} of medicine, blood loss during {{surgeries}} {{has been one of}} the major concerns for the surgeons. Iatrogenic blood loss can have several harmful effects on the patient condition. With the rapid development in technology, the blood loss can now be significantly minimized by using a variety of vessel sealing devices that use several energy sources to seal the blood vessels or tissue bundles instead of traditional <b>sutures</b> and <b>clips.</b> These devices can be used in several general, colorectal, gynecological and urological surgical procedures. The two types of vessel sealing techniques accepted worldwide are based on electrosurgical and ultrasonic technology. The electrosurgical technique uses electric energy while the ultrasonic technique uses ultrasonic energy to seal the blood vessels and simultaneously cut and coagulate tissues. In 2009, more than 17. 5 million electrosurgical procedures were performed in US alone. Also, ultrasonic devices have been used for over 10 million procedures worldwide. However, it is not clear to if these devices can cause nerve injury when applied near the nerve tissue. The safe distance to apply these devices from nerves has not been profoundly investigated. In the current study, a set of electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices were surgically tested in a rat model. These devices were applied on the muscle tissue at specific distances from the sciatic nerve. The consequent change in the nerve conduction function was neurophysiologically assessed and analyzed. Also, a developmental study was performed to determine a feasible surgical technique to use these devices to minimize nerve injury in the acute as well as sub-acute phase. The sensory nerve function was assessed by means of behavioral changes in the sub-acute phase. It was seen that electrosurgical devices produced a significant nerve dysfunction as compared to the ultrasonic devices. The ultrasonic devices appeared to be more safe, convenient and efficient during surgical applications close to the nerve tissue...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} reported our initial experience with sliding-clip renorrhaphy during open surgery [1]. This knotless suturing technique was first described by Bhayani and coworkers for use during robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy [2, 3]. Sliding-clip renorrhaphy mini-mizes ischemia time and aids in hemostasis bymaximizing lateral compressive {{forces on the}} renal capsule. This technique provides for closure of the renal defect by securing <b>sutures</b> with Hem-o-lok <b>clips</b> (Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) slid under tension against and competence of the assistant is crucial for minimizing ischemia time. To {{address the issue of}} assistant competency (both nurse and resident surgeon), we have developed a video that details the respective roles of the assistant and surgeon while performing sliding-clip renorrhaphy. This video was uploaded to the popular video sharing site YouTube for instructional viewing.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate whether robotic-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RALPN) is superior to laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) with regard to warm ischemia time and complications and, in addition, to report our novel technique of suturing in partial nephrectomy (PN). This was a prospective study carried out over a period of six years at our institute. A single surgeon performed PNs laparoscopically (17) and with robotic assistance (16). Only exophytic tumors were included and a novel technique of knotless and bolster-less <b>suturing</b> using Hem-o-loc <b>clips</b> was used to close the renal defect. There was no difference in intra-operative and post-operative blood loss between the two groups. However, LPN patients had significantly longer mean warm ischemia time (24. 1 vs. 30. 1 min, P < 0. 001) and operating time (157. 5 vs. 192. 5 min, P < 0. 001). Also, hospital stay was comparable between the two groups. RALPN is technically easier and also safer than LPN because of its advanced degrees of freedom, decreased warm ischemia time and reduction in the total operating time. However, these observations need further validation by larger and randomized trials. Based on our study, we recommend RALPN wherever there is availability of robot and if cost is not an issue...|$|R
40|$|In {{the search}} for better anastomosing techniques, an {{improved}} vascular stapler device (VCS clip applier system(R)) has been introduced. The system uses nonpenetrating clips to approximate everted vessel walls. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of nonpenetrating vascular clips on endothelial wound healing. Aortic end-to-end anastomoses were performed in male Wistar rats. A comparison was made between clipped (n = 12) and conventional hand-sewn (n = 6) anastomoses. Patency rates were verified at different time intervals (after 1, 4, and 8 weeks), after which the anastomotic sites were removed. Morphological evaluation was carried out using scanning electron microscopy, All rats survived the procedure. Closure with clips took less time than closure with conventional sutures, with decreasing aortic clamping times for the clipped procedures during the course of the experiments. Patency rates were 100 % in both the "clipped" and "sutured" groups. Microscopic examination showed favorable endothelial healing at the clipped anastomotic sites, with less inflammatory reaction at 1 week, and a more complete endothelial regeneration at 4 and 8 weeks follow-up, as compared with the <b>sutured</b> anastomoses. The <b>clip</b> applier holds the promise of a useful device in anastomosing small-caliber vessels, since clip closure takes less time than suturing, while patency rates are identical, and morphological results are favorable. Training is mandatory to obtain technical skills and to achieve optimal results. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the use of titanium ligation clips for dilated spermatic veins in microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy. Material and methods: In this retrospective study, eighty-four men with clinical varicocele underwent microsurgical varicocele repair. The patients were divided into two groups according to the ligation materials used for the varicocelectomy (silk <b>sutures</b> vs. titanium <b>clips).</b> Group 1 included 43 patients; these patients underwent microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy with the titanium clips. The 41 patients included in Group 2 underwent microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy with silk sutures. Microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy was performed in all patients. The two study groups were compared in terms of intra-operative and postoperative parameters. Results: The mean age of the patients was 28. 6 ± 4. 6 years, and the mean follow-up was 12. 3 ± 2. 7 months. The two groups exhibited comparable improvements in sperm motility and/or concentration: 79. 1 % and 82. 9 % in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively (p> 0. 05). The operation time in Group 1 (titanium clip) was significantly shorter than in Group 2 (silk sutures). None of the patients experienced any intra-operative complications. There were no significant differences between Group 1 and Group 2 with regard to postoperative recurrences, ligated veins, postoperative complications and hydrocele formation, hospitalization time, the requirement for postoperative analgesia or the time until the patient could return to work. Conclusion: Titanium ligation clips can be used for the ligation of dilated vessels during microsurgical subinguinal varicocelectomy, and the operation time is significantly reduced with the use of titanium ligation clips...|$|R
