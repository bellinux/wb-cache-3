50|$|Though the <b>northern</b> <b>rat</b> <b>flea</b> {{primarily}} parasitises the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, it has occasionally {{been observed}} feeding on humans and wild rodents.

50|$|Nosopsyllus fasciatus, the <b>northern</b> <b>rat</b> <b>flea,</b> is {{a species}} of flea found on {{domestic}} rats and house mice. Northern rat fleas are external parasites, living by hematophagy off the blood of rodents. It is the most widely spread of its genus, having originated in Europe, but has been transported to temperate regions all over the world.|$|E

50|$|Nosopsyllus fasciatus has an {{elongated}} body, 3 to 4 mm in length. It has a pronotal ctenidium with 18 to 20 spines (on the first thoracic tergite), but lacks a genal ctenidium.

5000|$|Trypanosoma lewisi is a {{parasite}} of Rattus species and other rodents such as mice and kangaroo rats in America. Among these host species are two endemic species of rats: Rattus macleari, now {{believed to be}} extinct, and Rattus nativitatis. It is not very clear {{whether or not the}} same lewisi parasite infects both species. However, both parasites are very similar. The <b>northern</b> <b>rat</b> <b>flea,</b> Nosopsyllus fasciatus acts as the vector for the parasite, harboring the epimastigote stage in its midgut. [...] The trypomastigote is the stage that is present in the main host, the rodent. The epimastigote form attaches itself to the rectum of the insect using its flagella to burrow through the rectal walls. [...] The parasites also appear in the flea's feces. Ingestion of either the flea or its feces during grooming infects the host rodent with the parasites. T. lewisi is normally non-pathogenic but is known to have produced fatal infections in rats.|$|E
40|$|The species Ctenocephalides felis and Ctenocephalides canis are {{competent}} vectors for zoonotic pathogens such as Rickettsia felis and Bartonella spp. Improved {{knowledge on}} {{the diversity and}} phylogenetics of fleas is important for understanding flea-borne pathogen transmission cycles. Fleas infesting privately owned dogs and cats from the Czech Republic (n= 97) and Romania (n= 66) were subjected to morphological and molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis. There were a total of 59 (60. 82 %) cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis felis), 30 (30. 93 %) dog fleas (Ctenocephalides canis), 7 (7. 22 %) European chicken fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae) and 1 (1. 03 %) <b>northern</b> <b>rat</b> <b>flea</b> (Nosopsyllus fasciatus) collected in the Czech Republic. Both C. canis and C. felis felis were identified in Romania. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing at the cox 1 gene on a cohort of 40 fleas revealed the cosmopolitan C. felis felis clade represented by cox 1 haplotype 1 {{is present in the}} Czech Republic. A new C. felis felis clade from both the Czech Republic and Romania is also reported. A high proportion of C. canis was observed from dogs and cats in the current study and phylogeny revealed that C. canis forms a sister clade to the oriental cat flea Ctenocephalides orientis (syn. C. felis orientis). Out of 33 fleas tested, representing C. felis felis, C. canis and Ce. gallinae, 7 (21. 2 %) were positive for R. felis using diagnostic real-time PCR targeting the gltA gene and a conventional PCR targeting the ompB gene. No samples tested positive for Bartonella spp. using a diagnostic real-time PCR assay targeting ssrA gene. This study confirms high genetic diversity of C. felis felis globally and serves as a foundation to understand the implication for zoonotic disease carriage and transmission by the flea genus Ctenocephalides...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground: Prisons in Madagascar are at {{high risk}} of plague outbreak. Occurrence of plague {{epidemic}} in prisonscan cause significant episode of urban plague through the movement of potentially infected humans, rodents andfleas. Rodent and flea controls are essential in plague prevention, by reducing human contact with plaguereservoirs and vectors. Insecticide treatment is the key step available for the control of <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> which transmit thedisease from infected rodents to human. The implementation of an adapted flea control strategy should rely on theinsecticide susceptibility status of the targeted population. For the purpose of plague prevention campaign inprisons, we conducted insecticide resistance survey on Xenopsylla cheopis, the <b>rat</b> <b>flea.</b> Methods: Fleas were collected on rats caught in six prisons of Madagascar. They were exposed to insecticidetreated filter papers and mortality was recorded following World Health Organization protocol. Results: The fleas collected in the prisons had different resistance patterns, while a high level of resistance toinsecticides tested was described in the Antanimora prison, located in the heart of Antananarivo, the capital ofMadagascar. Conclusions: This finding is alarming in the context of public health, knowing that the effectiveness of flea controlcould be jeopardized by insecticide resistance. In order to establish more accurate <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> control in prisons, themain recommendations are based on continuous monitoring insecticide susceptibility of flea, insecticide rotation,and {{the development of a new}} method for flea control...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} first three {{documented}} cases of murine typhus imported into Europe from Indonesia, discuss clues for the diagnosis of the disease, and urge that murine fever {{be considered in the}} diagnosis of febrile disease in travelers. One of the oldest recognized, most common, but least reported arthropod-transmitted zoonoses (1, 2), murine virus is caused by Rickettsia typhi, formerly named R. mooseri, a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium (1, 2). The main vector of murine typhus is the <b>rat</b> <b>flea</b> Xenopsylla cheopis, which maintains R. typhi in rodents. Flea bites and contamination of excoriated skin or the respiratory tract with infected flea feces are the major sources of human infection throughout the world (2). The classic reservoir and vector are the <b>rat</b> and <b>rat</b> <b>flea,</b> respectively (2); however, the role of cat fleas and opossums in maintaining this microorganism has been suggested in some areas of the United States where <b>rats</b> and <b>rat</b> <b>fleas</b> are absent (2, 3). Although murine typhus has a worldwide distribution, it is often unrecognized, and documented cases are rarely reported, particularly in tropical countries. Three recent cases of murine typhus in 2 months in patients returning to Europe from Indonesia indicate that murine typhus should be considered a possible cause of imported fever from Indonesia. Case 1 In October 1997, a 29 -year-old man living in France was hospitalized with a 2 -day history of fever. On admission, his temperature was 40 °C and his pulse, at 70 /min, was dissociated.
