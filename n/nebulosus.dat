500|$|Cirrostratus clouds {{can appear}} as a milky sheen in the sky or as a {{striated}} sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. Cirrostratus come in two species, fibratus and <b>nebulosus.</b> The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around [...] to , the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards {{the top of the}} cloud, at temperatures of around [...] to , the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later.|$|E
500|$|The {{bald eagle}} is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore {{with the capacity}} to consume {{a great variety of}} prey. Throughout their range, fish often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. In Southeast Alaska, fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-around diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents. Eagles living in the Columbia River Estuary in Oregon were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake. In the Pacific Northwest, spawning trout and salmon provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall. Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), coho salmon (O. kisutch) and, more locally, sockeye salmon (O. nerka), with chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), due to their large size ( [...] average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion. Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus). In Oregon's Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were largescale suckers (Catostomus macrocheilus) (17.3% of the prey selected there), American shad (Alosa sapidissima; 13%) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio; 10.8%). Eagles living in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland were found to subsist largely on American gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), threadfin shad (D. petenense) and white bass (Morone chrysops). Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on catfish, most prevalently the brown bullhead (Ameiurus <b>nebulosus)</b> and any species in the Ictalurus genus as well as mullet, trout, needlefish, and eels. Wintering eagles on the Platte River in Nebraska preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp. From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught live by the eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{stratiform}} group, high-level cirrostratus comprises two species. [...] Cirrostratus <b>nebulosus</b> has {{a rather}} diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail. [...] Cirrostratus fibratus is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional {{to or from}} cirrus. Mid-level altostratus and multi-level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species. Low stratus is of the species <b>nebulosus</b> except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus (see below).|$|E
2500|$|The 2 monitor species {{present in}} the wetlands, the Clouded Monitor (Varanus <b>nebulosus)</b> and the Asian Water Monitor (Varanus salvator) are both IUCN listed as Least Concern, however are {{protected}} in Thailand under the Wild Animal Reservation & Protection Act (WARPA). All other reptile species are classified as Least Concern and include: Elephant Trunk Snake (Acrochordus javanicus); Reticulated Python (Python reticulatus); Banded Krait (Bungarus fasciatus); Monocled Cobra (Naja kaouthia); [...] Striped Water Snake (Enhydris enhydris); [...] Rice Paddy Snake (Enhydris plumbea); [...] Puff-faced Water Snake (Homalopsis buccata) and several species of common terrestrial and water snakes, skinks and garden lizards.|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus <b>nebulosus.</b> The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.|$|E
2500|$|The wetland {{provides}} {{habitat for}} a {{diverse range of}} native freshwater fish, including a significant population of the threatened [...] black mudfish/waikaka (Neochanna diversus). It {{is also home to}} longfin and shortfin eel/tuna and other galaxiid species. Introduced invasive fish species are also present in Whangamarino Wetland; koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) and brown bullhead catfish (Ameiurus <b>nebulosus)</b> are a particular problem as their aggressive feeding behaviour stirs up bottom sediments, affecting bank stabilisation and aquatic plant life. A study of koi carp otiliths undertaken by University of Waikato MSc student Jennifer Blair found that Lake Waikare and the Pungarehu Stream appear {{to be a source of}} recruits, with koi carp moving from these areas into the Waikato River and Lake Waahi.|$|E
2500|$|All cloud {{varieties}} {{fall into}} one of two main groups. [...] One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus (thin translucent), perlucidus (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and opacus (thick opaque). [...] These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. [...] All three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. [...] However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus <b>nebulosus</b> whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. [...] Opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent, {{or in the case of}} cirrus spissatus, always opaque. [...] Similarly, these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.|$|E
60|$|The Horned Pout, Pimelodus <b>nebulosus,</b> {{sometimes}} called Minister, from the peculiar squeaking noise it makes when drawn {{out of the}} water, is a dull and blundering fellow, and like the eel vespertinal in his habits, and fond of the mud. It bites deliberately as if about its business. They are taken at night with a mass of worms strung on a thread, which catches in their teeth, sometimes three or four, with an eel, at one pull. They are extremely tenacious of life, opening and shutting their mouths {{for half an hour}} after their heads have been cut off. A bloodthirsty and bullying race of rangers, inhabiting the fertile river bottoms, with ever a lance in rest, and ready to do battle with their nearest neighbor. I have observed them in summer, when every other one had a long and bloody scar upon his back, where the skin was gone, the mark, perhaps, of some fierce encounter. Sometimes the fry, not an inch long, are seen darkening the shore with their myriads.|$|E
50|$|Leiopus <b>nebulosus</b> is {{a species}} of longhorn beetles of the {{subfamily}} Lamiinae. It was described by Linnaeus in 1758. It contains two subspecies; the first, L. <b>nebulosus</b> <b>nebulosus,</b> is known from Europe and Russia, and the second, L. <b>nebulosus</b> caucasicus, is endemic to the mountains of the Caucasus (from which its species epithet is derived). The beetles inhabit deciduous trees, including those in the genera Fagus, Quercus, Carpinus, Juglans, Acer, Ulmus, Betula, Salix, and Prunus. They measure 5-10 millimetres in length, and can live for approximately 1-2 years.|$|E
50|$|The brown {{bullhead}} (Ameiurus <b>nebulosus)</b> is a fish of the Ictaluridae family that is widely distributed in North America. It is {{a species of}} bullhead catfish and {{is similar to the}} black bullhead (Ameiurus melas) and yellow bullhead (Ameiurus natalis). It was originally described as Pimelodus <b>nebulosus</b> by Charles Alexandre Lesueur in 1819, and is also referred to as Ictalurus <b>nebulosus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cirrostratus <b>nebulosus</b> is {{a species}} of {{high-level}} cirrostratus cloud. The name cirrostratus <b>nebulosus</b> is derived from Latin, meaning [...] "full of vapor, foggy, cloudy, dark". Cirrostratus <b>nebulosus</b> {{is one of the}} two most common forms that cirrostratus often takes, with the other being cirrostratus fibratus. The <b>nebulosus</b> species is featureless and uniform, while the fibratus species has a fibrous appearance. Cirrostratus <b>nebulosus</b> are formed by gently rising air. The cloud is often hard to see unless the sun shines through it at the correct angle, forming a halo. While usually very light, the cloud may also be very dense, and the exact appearance of the cloud can vary from one formation to another. In the winter, precipitation often follows behind these clouds; however, they are not a precipitation-producing cloud.|$|E
5000|$|Synodontis <b>nebulosus,</b> {{known as}} the cloudy squeaker, or clouded squeaker, is a species of {{upside-down}} catfish that is native to the lower Zambezi River basin of Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. [...] It was first described by German naturalist and explorer Wilhelm Peters in 1852, from a specimen collected in the Zambezi River at Tete, Mozambique. [...] The species name <b>nebulosus</b> {{is derived from the}} Latin word <b>nebulosus,</b> meaning [...] "foggy", [...] "cloudy", or [...] "full of mist".|$|E
50|$|Stratus fractus are not {{divided into}} varieties, but stratus <b>nebulosus</b> {{on the other}} hand, are divided into two. The Stratus opacus variety appears as a nebulous or milky sheet of the <b>nebulosus</b> species, but are opaque enough to block the sun from view. Stratus Translucidus is another variety of the <b>nebulosus</b> species. These clouds are {{considered}} more thin than the opacus variety because this cloud is rather translucent, allowing {{the position of the}} sun or moon to be observed from earth's surface.|$|E
