50|$|Hartwell {{petition}}ed Chief Justice Charles Coffin Harris for Letters of Administration of the Kanaina Estate to {{be issued}} to William C. Parke on March 14, 1877. Harris ordered a hearing for April 5, 1877 to hear the petition pertaining to the estate of the late Charles Kanaina and anyone who could show reason not to grant it. Sanford B. Dole provided a sworn affidavit {{to the death of}} Charles Kanaina and of seeing his body at his home at the Palace walk. On March 16, 1877 another <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> Order <b>of</b> <b>Petition</b> was read and filed by Justice Lawrence McCully for William Stevens Pahukula from his attorney Edward Townsend O'Halloran. An order for a hearing on April 11, 1877 was made but canceled when the Justice discovered another hearing for another petition was already ordered. Pahukula stated that he was the sole heir to the Charles Kanaina estate through Kanaina's sister, who he states was his grandmother and that the estate was indebted to him for over $3000.00.|$|R

40|$|Why {{do people}} sign petitions? Do they {{genuinely}} {{care about the}} subject matter, or just feel pressured by the solicitor? I tested this question in a field experiment involving a door-to-door petition drive where {{the ability of the}} homeowner to avoid the solicitor was varied. Households in the Flyer treatment group received a flyer on their doorknob announcing that a solicitor would arrive the next day collecting signatures for a Greenpeace petition on global warming. The houses in the Opt-Out treatment group received flyers that were identical except for a “Do Not Disturb ” box at the bottom, which allowed homeowners opt out of the drive at no personal cost. The houses in the control group did not receive any <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the upcoming <b>petition</b> drive. I found that the houses in the treatment groups were 14 and 23. 5 percent, respectively, less likely to answer the door than the control group. The flyer treatments did not, however, significantly lower the percentage of people that signed the petition. These results indicate the presence of both social pressure and social engagement as motivating factors in the decision-making process. 2 I...|$|R

After years of evaluation, NHTSA released a formal <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> Proposed Rulemaking in 2004. This notice declared NHTSA’s intent to standardize EDRs. It was not until August 2006 that NHTSA released its final ruling (49 CFR Part 563).

40|$|On October 22, 1998, Edwards {{and two of}} his {{business}} partners filed their original complaint. In the complaint, Edwards and his partners alleged they were fraudulently induced into leasing restaurant space and brought claims against eleven defendants. While counsel initially represented Edwards and his partners, the lawyer was forced to withdraw, after being disbarred. In his amended complaint, Edwards, who was not authorized to practice law, named, on their behalf, both business partners. In fact, Edwards named one partner who wished to be removed. The district court ruled that the amended complaint would relate solely to Edwards and removed the business partners from the caption. The court later determined that the earlier complaint remained effective as to the business partners. In March 2000, one of the defendants filed for federal bankruptcy protection. Thus, the automatic bankruptcy stay was commenced. One year later, in April 2001, the federal bankruptcy court entered an order granting the parties in Edwards’ action relief from the bankruptcy stay. In June 2001, even though the automatic stay had by that time been lifted, the district court acknowledged the stay and ordered the proceedings in Edwards’ action stayed until the bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay. Edwards did not notify the district court that the automatic stay had been lifted until the court entered its own stay order. In April 2002, not aware of the true status of the bankruptcy stay, the district court entered an order refusing to consider any further pleadings until the bankruptcy stay was lifted. Later, realizing its error, the district court entered an order rescinding its previous stay orders. In an attempt to compel the district court to void all pleadings and orders filed after the bankruptcy, Edwards filed a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy <b>petition</b> and a motion to stay the district court proceedings. The court denied Edwards’s motion. In March 2004, the district court dismissed the action against the remaining defendants pursuant to the NRCP 41 (e) 2 five-year rule. The trial had not commenced before the period expired, on October 22, 2003. In April 2004, Edwards filed his <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> appeal from the district court’s NRCP 41 (e) dismissal order. Additionally, he filed a second complaint in the district court. This new complaint was nearly identical to his 1998 complaint. Therefore, the district court entered an order dismissing the second complaint, basing the dismissal on claim preclusion...|$|R

[...] The judges also noted that one day earlier the U.S. Supreme Court had issued a stay in McQuigg v. Bostic. The Tenth Circuit suspended further proceedings in the case on September 18.|$|R
40|$|Gathering and {{analyzing}} {{comments from the}} public {{is an important part}} of the Federal Communications Commission's rulemaking process. The FCC considers the public's input when developing rules and policies. By submitting comments, the public can take part in developing policies that affect telecommunications and broadcast issues. Following are some FCC-related terms and acronyms and some instructions that will help you in filing comments and understanding the FCC's decision-making processes. Acronyms and Terms The FCC issues a Public Notice (PN) to inform the public about an action or event. Sometimes a PN invites public comment. When a PN seeks public comment, it generally includes filing deadlines and information on how to file comments. A person outside of the FCC files a Petition for Rulemaking (Petition) to suggest new rules or changes to existing rules. Unless directed otherwise in the FCC’s Public Notice seeking comment on the petition, the public has 30 days from the date <b>of</b> the Public <b>Notice</b> to submit comments on whether the FCC should grant or deny the petition. After reviewing the comments received in response to the petition, the FCC issues an Order disposing <b>of</b> the <b>petition,</b> a <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> Inquiry (NOI), or a <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). Copies <b>of</b> <b>Petitions</b> for Rulemaking are available for viewing on the FCC’s Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS), and for inspection in the FCC’s Referenc...|$|R
