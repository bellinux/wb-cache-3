500|$|During an {{interview}} with entertainment website Digital Spy Dennis discussed Paul's later relationships in depth. Paul's relationship with Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) was short lived, he mistreated her but ultimately in a twist for the character, he did the right thing.

So he obviously cared about Lyn, but then she came back and haunted him." [...] His relationship with Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall) at times can be fiery, of this Dennis said: [...] "I want to see Paul and Rebecca be like Angie and Dirty Den. I think Rebecca is capable of that. She plays a fiery character and is a very strong.

2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or <b>no</b> <b>shit</b> like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound. That's what they was doin' and that's what they was talking about and that's what I was raised off of." ...|$|E

Most American sitcoms end with big group hugs and couples reuniting. But the Two and a Half Men finale is an utterly whacked-out tribute to the series it caps.

500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before.

Or maybe the part where she’s about to tell Derek about her sister but he’s being such a monumental McAss that she clams up like they’re stuck in season 2. See what I’m saying? I’m excited about a Meredith plot you guys. That means things are good." [...] also praised Callie Torres adding, [...] "The Callie/Owen screaming match gave me life.

5000|$|Ear Candy is {{the title}} of the tenth album release by Australian-American pop singer Helen Reddy: {{released}} May 1977 by Capitol Records, the album included a modern take on the doo-wop genre ("Long Distance Love"), a Cajun number that gave the Melbourne native her first and only appearance on Billboard magazine's Country chart ("Laissez les Bontemps Rouler"), and a dark self-parody on which Reddy proclaims: [...] "I don't take <b>no</b> <b>shit</b> from nobody" [...] ("Baby, I'm a Star" [...] - {{not to be confused with}} the Prince song of the same name).
