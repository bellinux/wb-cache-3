The second edition core rules include pre-career university and military academy education options. Skills specialisations have been reorganised to reduce skill bloat. Some equipment descriptions have been improved. Spacecraft operations and combat <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> new better approach. Additional supplements will flesh out rules further, including a revision to High Guard to handle all starship design.|$|E
25|$|Traffic {{using the}} river today {{consists}} of private cruisers making {{the journey to}} Jesus Lock, with the section above Baits Bite lock regularly in use by the University rowing clubs, both for practice and for races. Motorised craft can navigate along the Backs in winter, but headroom is severely restricted. The Conservators of the River Cam <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> office in the former lock-keepers cottage at Baits Bite, while the house at Clayhithe is now the residence of the foreman of the Conservators. The Conservators are still responsible for the river above Bottisham lock, while the lower river has been managed by the Environment Agency since its creation in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Bridge 8: Euler walks are {{possible}} if exactly zero or two nodes have an odd number of edges. If we have 2 nodes {{with an odd}} number of edges, the walk must begin at one such node and end at the other. Since there are only 4 nodes in the puzzle, the solution is simple. The walk desired must begin at the blue node and end at the orange node. Thus, a new edge is drawn between the other two nodes. Since they each formerly had an odd number of edges, they must <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> even number of edges, fulfilling all conditions. This {{is a change in}} parity from an odd to even degree.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} hosts {{a variety}} of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. Established in 1872, The Yale Record is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the Yale Daily News, which {{was first published in}} 1878, and the weekly Yale Herald, which was first published in 1986. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM & FM frequencies, they <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> Internet-only stream.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} episode aired, {{journalist}} Patrick Strudwick asked, [...] "Channel 4, why call your new documentary My Transsexual Summer? It sounds like gender tourism, a fun little trip to the other side." [...] Sarah Dean, an entertainment editor for The Huffington Post UK, called the title [...] "sensationalist". Although Sarah Lake of Trans Media Watch found the title contentious, she defended it {{by pointing out that}} transition is a temporary process like coming of age; even so, she believed the title to be [...] "only slightly better" [...] than the [...] "dire and totally inappropriate" [...] working title, Girls Will Be Boys and Boys Will Be Girls. Her overall assessment was that [...] "although the programme makers undeniably made some compromises to draw in viewers, millions will have enjoyed the company of these seven, shared in their lives and learned a lesson in diversity.… They will <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> entry point to broadening their understanding of the rich and joyful diversity of gender experience, something which has always existed but of which they were previously unaware." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Casson handle is {{constructed}} by [...] "thickening" [...] the 2-dimensional construction above {{to give a}} 4-dimensional object: we replace each disc D2 by a copy of D2R2. Informally {{we can think of}} this as taking a small neighborhood of the skeleton (thought of as embedded in some 4-manifold). There are some minor extra subtleties in doing this: we need to keep track of some framings, and intersection points <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> orientation.|$|E
2500|$|The games {{include a}} number of easter eggs, {{including}} {{a number of}} allusions to other Sierra games. For example, if a player types [...] "pick nose" [...] in the first game, (or clicks the lockpick icon on the player in the new version), if their lock-picking skill is high enough, the game responds: [...] "Success! You <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> open nose". If the skill is too low, the player could insert the lock pick too far, killing himself. Another example is Dr. Cranium, an allusion to The Castle of Dr. Brain, in the fourth game.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the title's announcement, Jack Sorensen, {{president}} of LucasArts, explained [...] "the Star Wars franchise will expand {{to a much}} broader audience who will <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to experience two cultural icons {{in a whole new}} way." [...] Meanwhile, Hasbro Interactive President Tom Dusenberry commented that [...] "both of these entertainment properties are so ingrained in our culture..together they create an even bigger, more thrilling entertainment experience". The game was officially previewed at the 1997 Children's Interactive Expo. Hasbro Interactive launched a companion website for the game in October–November 1997.|$|E

It is perhaps too much to hope that Iran's experience will prevent the rise of Mossadeghs in other countries, but that experience may at least strengthen the hands of more reasonable and more far-seeing leaders.
