2500|$|It can {{be shown}} that irrational numbers, when {{expressed}} in a positional numeral system (e.g. as decimal numbers, or with any other natural basis), do not terminate, nor do they repeat, i.e., do not contain a subsequence <b>of</b> <b>digits,</b> the repetition <b>of</b> which makes up {{the tail of the}} representation. For example, the decimal representation of the number [...] starts with 3.14159265358979, but <b>no</b> finite number <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> can represent [...] exactly, nor does it repeat. The proof that the decimal expansion of a rational number must terminate or repeat is distinct from the proof that a decimal expansion that terminates or repeats must be a rational number, and although elementary and not lengthy, both proofs take some work. Mathematicians do not generally take [...] "terminating or repeating" [...] to be the definition of the concept of rational number.|$|R
40|$|A 6 -year-old, spayed, female, {{domestic}} shorthair cat was presented for decreased activity. A nodular lesion {{was found in}} the skin extending into the subcutaneous tissue of the right abdominal flank. On lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs of the thorax, an opacity involving the entire right caudal lung lobe and pleural effusion were noted. Cytologic evaluation of cells in the thoracic fluid and in the mass revealed a population of atypical epipthelial cells with marked anisocytosis and high N:C ratios, organized in acinar-like clusters. Multinucleated cells and several mitotic figures were found. The cytologic interpretation was carcinoma. Because of the progressive severity of clinical signs, the cat was euthanized. Histologic evaluation of tissues obtained at necropsy indicated a bronchogenic adenocarcinoma in the lung, with metastasis to the skin of the right flank, but <b>no</b> involvement <b>of</b> the <b>digits.</b> Based on immunohistochemical stains, the neoplastic cells strongly co-expressed cytokeratin and vimentin, and were negative for S- 100 and actin-specific antigen. Bronchogenic adenocarcinoma is an uncommon neoplasm in cats, and the digits are the most common sites of metastasis. This case was unusual in that the skin of the abdominal wall was the primary site <b>of</b> metastasis, with <b>no</b> involvement <b>of</b> the <b>digits...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{concept of}} a normal number was {{introduced}} by Émile Borel in 1909. Using the Borel–Cantelli lemma, he proved the normal number theorem: almost all real numbers are normal, {{in the sense that}} the set of non-normal numbers has Lebesgue measure zero (Borel 1909). This theorem established the existence of normal numbers. [...] In 1917, Wacław Sierpiński showed that it is possible to specify a particular such number. Becher and Figueira proved in 2002 that there is a computable absolutely normal number, however <b>no</b> <b>digits</b> <b>of</b> their number are known.|$|R
40|$|The abelisaurid {{theropod}} Carnotaurus sastrei, {{from the}} Late Cretaceous of Argentina, is characterized for the unusual presence of frontal horns and extremely abbreviated forelimbs, among other curious features. In particular, the four <b>digit</b> hand <b>of</b> Carnotaurus shows highly derived features, as recognized in previous works on this animal. However, reexamination {{of the hands}} of the holotype -and only available- specimen of Carnotaurus sastrei, reveals interesting details that modify previous interpretations about its manual anatomy. For example, proximal phalanges <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> II and III are longer than their respective metacarpals, an unusual condition absent in other theropods, including abelisaurids (e. g., Aucasaurus). Bizarre features of Carnotaurus are mainly concentrated on metacarpal IV. This constitutes the largest bone of the hand. Moreover, metacarpal IV of Carnotaurus is conical-shaped, with a wide and gently concave proximal articular surface for the ulna, and an acute distal tip lacking of an articular surface for a phalanx. Notably, the aspect of metacarpal IV resembles that of an ungual phalanx. The robust condition of metacarpal IV of Carnotaurus is in sharp contrast with the splint-like condition present in basal theropods. Metacarpal IV is proportionally shorter in other abelisaurids (Aucasaurus and Majungasaurus) for which this bone is known. However, in both Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus metacarpal IV has a conical shape and <b>no</b> phalanges <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> IV are present, in contrast with Majungasaurus in which a phalanx fused with metacarpal IV has been reported. This information is congruent with recent information supporting closer relationships between Carnotaurusand Aucasaurus with respect to the Malagasy taxon. Differences noted above for these three genera suggest a certain degree of manual morphological diversity among abelisaurids...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a survey of}} phenotypic variation in the limbs of two species of Lerista, a diverse clade of Australian scincid lizards widely considered {{to provide the best}} available model for studying squamate limb reduction and loss. Abnormalities were observed in 4. 1 % of forelimbs and 5. 4 % of hind limbs in the tetradactyl species L. dorsalis, and 4. 5 % of forelimbs and 2. 4 % of hind limbs in the tridactyl species L. timida. Substantial malformation of the manus or pes, involving the complete absence or severe reduction <b>of</b> all <b>digits,</b> accounts for a considerable proportion of anomalies in both species. Almost all remaining anomalies involve the absence or severe reduction of one or two digits. Despite the moderate frequency of limb abnormalities recorded, <b>no</b> cases <b>of</b> supernumerary <b>digits</b> were observed. Patterns of phenotypic variation in both species are consistent with the conventional perspective that substantial limb reduction is effectively irreversible, and provide support for the conclusion that structurally reduced limbs have not been re-elaborated in Lerista.
