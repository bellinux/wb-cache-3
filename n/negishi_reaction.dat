50|$|Transmetalation {{is often}} used as {{a step in the}} {{catalytic}} cycles of cross-coupling reactions. Some of the cross-coupling reactions that include a transmetalation step are Stille cross-coupling, Suzuki cross-coupling, Sonogashira cross-coupling, and Negishi cross-coupling. The most useful cross-coupling catalysts tend to be ones that contain palladium. Cross-coupling reactions have the general form of R′-X + M-R → R′-R + M-X and are used to form C-C bonds. R and R′ can be any carbon fragment. The identity of the metal, M, depends on which cross-coupling reaction is being used. Stille reactions use tin, Suzuki reactions use boron, Sonogashira reactions use copper, and Negishi reactions use zinc. The transmetalation step in palladium catalyzed reactions involve the addition of an R-M compound to produce an R′-Pd-R compound. Cross-coupling reactions have a wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry including the area of medicinal chemistry. The Stille reaction has been used to make an antitumor agent, (±)-epi-jatrophone; the Suzuki reaction has been used to make an antitumor agent, oximidine II; the Sonogashira reaction has been used to make an anticancer drug, eniluracil; and the <b>Negishi</b> <b>reaction</b> has been used to make the carotenoid β-carotene via a transmetalation cascade.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project is multidisciplinary in nature. It {{involves the use}} of biomolecular design –peptide design – and the synthesis of small organic compounds to generate conformational switching in peptide structures. In this thesis, we demonstrate that we can design and synthesize de novo peptide sequences with the necessary information to assemble as α-helical coiled-coil structures when associated with their corresponding peptide partners. In addition, some of the peptide structures are designed to form both α-helical coiled-coils and fibrous systems. Since we aim to promote conformational changes in the initial folding states of our peptide assemblies, the design of these individual sequences that we refer to as chassis peptides includes tuneable positions which after being modified will help these changes to happen. We make use of the <b>Negishi</b> <b>reaction</b> to synthesize unnatural amino acids – pyridyl-alanine analogues – for metal-binding investigations. The insertion of these novel amino acids into our self-assembling peptide systems provides different conformational changes depending on the positions in which these amino acids are inserted. These experiments are an attempt to form novel metal-based chiral biocatalysts. They also allow us to investigate to what extent peptide self-assembly can control metal binding and to what extent the metal binding can control peptide self-assembly. This {{research project}} also includes the synthesis of an azobenzene derivative for trans-to-cis and cis-to-trans photoisomerization. We successfully attached an azobenzene linker to three different coiled-coil forming peptide structures, exhibiting different switching efficiency in each. By using these photoswitches we induce conformational changes in the secondary structure of the peptide structures by the use of light. Some of these are reversible structural changes which makes it a potential power source for protein motors. ...|$|E

This includes a highly regioselective <b>Negishi</b> <b>reaction</b> of dibromo-alkene 48 with an alkynylzinc reagent, and a palladium catalyzed alkyl-Suzuki coupling of the resulting enyne derivative 12 with the 9 -BBN-adduct derived from alkene 61. The latter was obtained via an asymmetric hydrogenation of the chlorinated β-ketoester 49 and an anti-selective oxyallylation of the functionalized aldehyde 53 as the key steps. The preparation of the bis-borylated allyl-donor 57 used in the oxyallylation step, however, required careful optimization and led to important insights {{into the nature of}} the classical hydroborating agent “di(isopinocampheyl) borane (Ipc 2 BH) ”. It was unambiguously shown by X-ray crystallography that in the solid state this compound is dimeric, but it is prone to undergo an essentially quantitative mono-deborylation when dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 or benzene; its composition in ethereal solvents is even more complex as evident from 11 B NMR data. Product 71 derived from 12 and 61 was elaborated into the enyne–yne derivative 75, which served as the substrate for an exquisitely selective ring closing alkyne metathesis reaction (RCAM) catalyzed by the molybdenum tris-amido complex 20 activated in situ with CH 2 Cl 2.

In this review only these cases are discussed where it seems highly likely that the technology is or has been used for ton-scale production. We document twelve cases where the Mizoroki-Heck reaction was used to arylate an alkene. In two of these cases allylic alcohols were arylated, leading to the aldehyde or the ketone. The Suzuki reaction has been used mostly to produce biaryl compounds from aryl halides and arylboronic acid derivatives. Twelve processes were recorded. Ortho-tolyl-benzonitrile, a biaryl compound produced via the Suzuki reaction, is used as an intermediate in six different pharmaceuticals all belonging to the Sartan group of blood pressure-lowering agents. The Kumada-Corriu reaction in which an aryl or alkenyl Grignard is coupled to an aryl or alkenyl halide was used nine times.

More recently, the remarkable role of halide salt additives in the <b>Negishi</b> <b>reaction</b> involving aryl zinc reagents has been reported (McCann and Organ 2014). It is ranked {{as one of the}} world’s top ten science and technology improvements in 2014 by Chemical & Engineering News. In our previous work, a positive effect of inorganic salts has been found for the synthesis of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane (Yin et al. 2015), and intensive studies have been carried out to explore the salt effect of various types of inorganic salt on the formation of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane (Yin et al. 2015). The results shows that higher yields of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane can be obtained in reaction solution by using the Cl−-based salts with smaller cation radius. It can be concluded that the enhancement in the yield of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane is attributed to hydration which can decrease the water activity. Though these investigations covered important aspects of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane synthesis, there is still something to be further explored, since the increase in the acid value by the addition of Cl−-based salts is still very remarkable compared to that observed for sulfuric acid alone. In addition, the presence of Cl−-based salts and the HCl formed may cause corrosion (Bao 2007). Therefore, in the present work we investigated the influence of organic salts on 1, 3, 5 -trioxane synthesis by batch reaction and continuous production experiments. In addition, UV–visible spectroscopy and vapor–liquid equilibrium experiments were also performed {{for the first time to}} investigate the mechanisms that control the effects of organic salts on the yield of 1, 3, 5 -trioxane in the reaction solution and in the distillate from the reaction.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} {{reactions}} of catalytically-capable trace metal impurities were investigated {{in the context}} of two separate reports of iron-catalysed Suzuki reactions. In both cases, the reported reactions were found to irreproducible and the likelihood of palladium contamination was discussed. In one of the cases, it was found that as little as 0. 0001 mol% of Pd(OAc) 2 could account for the observed activity. As a result of pressure from our group and others, both papers were retracted. The importance of testing for trace impurities and of conducting blank reactions is discussed. The roles of l, 2 -bis(diphenylphosphino) benzene (dpbz) and l, 3 -bis(diphenylphosphino) propane (dppp) ligands in the Fe-catalysed Negishi and Suzuki reactions were investigated through a structure/reactivity study. A series of modified dppp and dpbz analogues were prepared and characterised and some of their key structural differences analysed. The ligand library was then investigated in both the Fe-catalysed Suzuki and Negishi reactions. Despite the broad range of structurally-related but significantly different phosphine ligands tested, nearly all were shown to perform well in both of the test-bed reactions. Reasons for the unprecedented high activity of this class of catalysts are discussed and the importance of pre- forming iron complexes before their application to catalysis is highlighted. In parallel with a full kinetic study and the isolation of potential reactive intermediates conducted by other group members, the mechanism of the Fe-catalysed <b>Negishi</b> <b>reaction</b> was investigated. Kinetic analysis identified Fe(l) as the most likely lowest oxidation state in the catalytic cycle and efforts were made to isolate Fe(l) intermediates. A series of Fe(l) complexes had been isolated by other group members and these were tested in a range of representative Negishi reactions. An Fe(l) bromide complex was identified as a likely on-cycle intermediate and the implications of this in catalysis are discussed. The use of boron/zinc transmetallation for the generation of nucleophiles in Fe-catalysed coupling reactions was investigated. It was found that under forcing conditions, the aryl transfer reaction could be made to proceed without the need for additional catalysts. The mechanism of boron/zinc transmetallation was investigated using llB NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. It was demonstrated that {{the degree to which the}} alkyl groups from the zinc transferred to the boron was far higher than was previously thought and that the addition of stabilising solvents or ligands could dramatically alter the positions of the equilibria in transmetallation reactions. Two examples of 11 tetraarylborate salts formed in transmetallation reactions were isolated and structurally characterised. The implications of these observations on the catalyst-free aryl transfer and other reported aryl transfer reactions are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Second, dialkyl ketones undergo enantioselective coupling in good ee and yield. Third, readily available bis (oxazolines) are shown {{for the first time}} to be effective ligands for cross-couplings of alkyl electrophiles, thereby opening the door to new opportunities in asymmetric catalysis. Transition metal-catalyzed couplings of organic electrophiles with Grignard reagents (“Kumada reactions”) were among the first cross-coupling processes that were discovered. 1, 2 Like other families of cross-couplings, this versatile method for the synthesis of carbon– carbon bonds has been applied primarily to reactions of aryl and vinyl electrophiles. 3 It is nevertheless noteworthy that the earliest successes in cross-coupling alkyl electrophiles were Kumada-type reactions with Grignard reagents. 4, 5, 6 Despite that initial progress, to date there have been no examples of enantioselective Kumada couplings of alkyl electrophiles. 7, 8, 9 In this report, we begin to address this challenge, establishing that a Ni/bis(oxazoline) catalyst achieves asymmetric cross-couplings of α-bromoketones with aryl Grignard reagents (eq 1). 10, 11 With respect to enantioselective cross-coupling reactions of alkyl electrophiles, pybox ligands have proved to be useful for an array of nickel-catalyzed <b>Negishi</b> <b>reactions,</b> whereas 1, 2 -diamine ligands have found application in Hiyama and Suzuki reactions. 8 Unfortunately, non...|$|R

The key steps of the synthesis involve metallation and subsequent transmetallation of 2 -chloropyrazine derivatives followed by Sonogashira or <b>Negishi</b> cross-coupling <b>reactions.</b> The bipyrazine core was obtained with a Stille cross-coupling reaction between the 2 -chloro- 6 -tributylstannylpyrazine and the 2 -chloro- 6 -iodopyrazine. Functionalization of the 6, 6 ′-dichloro- 2, 2 ′-bipyrazine was performed by metallation, transmetallation and cross-coupling reactions. The light emitting properties of the so obtained molecules are then investigated in terms of absorption and emission spectra...|$|R

The role of nucleophilic borylzinc reagents in the reduction of the Pd pre-catalysts to Pd active species has been demonstrated. The non-innocent behavior of the PPh ligands of the [Pd(PPh) Cl] pre-catalyst under activation conditions has been probed both experimentally and computationally, revealing the formation of a trimetallic Pd species bearing bridging phosphide (PPh) ligands. Our studies also reveal the monoligated formulation of the Pd active species, which led us to synthesize related (η-indenyl) Pd-monophosphine catalysts which show improved catalytic performances under mild conditions. A complete mechanistic proposal to aid future catalyst developments is provided. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
