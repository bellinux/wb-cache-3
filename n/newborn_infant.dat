5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three <b>newborn</b> <b>infant</b> deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{prenatal}} and newborn screening, {{cystic fibrosis}} was often diagnosed when a <b>newborn</b> <b>infant</b> {{failed to pass}} feces (meconium). Meconium may completely block the intestines and cause serious illness. This condition, called meconium ileus, occurs in 5–10% of newborns with CF. In addition, protrusion of internal rectal membranes (rectal prolapse) is more common, occurring {{in as many as}} 10% of children with CF, and it is caused by increased fecal volume, malnutrition, and increased intra–abdominal pressure due to coughing.|$|E
25|$|The breast is {{susceptible}} to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are puerperal mastitis, fibrocystic breast changes and mastalgia. Lactation unrelated to pregnancy can occur as galactorrhea (spontaneous milk flow) from the adverse effects of drugs (e.g. antipsychotic medications), extreme physical stress, or endocrine disorders. In a <b>newborn</b> <b>infant,</b> the capability of lactation {{is a consequence of}} the mother's circulating hormones (prolactin, oxytocin, etc.) in his or her blood stream, which were introduced by the shared circulatory system of the placenta.|$|E
40|$|Background Bacterial {{colonization}} {{during and}} shortly after birth are common in <b>newborn</b> <b>infants.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the umbilical cord bacterial colonization in <b>newborn</b> <b>infants</b> rooming in with mothers and neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Materials and Methods In a cross-sectional study, 180 <b>newborn</b> <b>infants</b> were studied in three groups including: <b>newborn</b> <b>infants</b> born via normal delivery and stayed with their mothers (n= 60), <b>newborn</b> <b>infants</b> born by cesarean section and stayed with their mothers (n= 60), and <b>newborn</b> <b>infants</b> admitted in NICU (n= 60). Umbilical cord care was done as natural drying without use of any disinfectant or local antibiotic for all <b>newborn</b> <b>infants.</b> Bacterial culture was performed on the second day in three groups and in days of 5 - 7 only among the infants admitted in NICU. Results Among the subjects, 50 % (n= 90) were boy and 50 % (n= 90) were the first-time mothers. Normal gestational age (38 to 42 weeks) was seen in 67. 2 % (n= 121) of subjects. Three groups had no significant differences in terms of gender (p= 0. 247), and first-time mothers (p= 0. 344), but had a significant difference in terms of gestational age (p= 0. 001). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria responsible for the colonization in the first culture (n= 31, 17. 22 %), and second culture (n= 17, 13. 5 %).

Other groups, such as the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and American Academy of Pediatrics, also warn that raw milk is dangerous, especially for children.|$|E
500|$|The Vatican nativity {{scene for}} 2007 placed {{the birth of}} Jesus in Joseph's house, based upon an {{interpretation}} of the Gospel of Matthew. Mary was shown with the <b>newborn</b> <b>infant</b> Jesus in a room in Joseph's house. To the left of the room was Joseph's workshop while to the right was a busy inn—a comment on materialism versus spirituality. [...] The Vatican's written description of the diorama said, [...] "The scene for this year's Nativity recalls the painting style of the Flemish School of the 1500s." [...] The scene was unveiled on December 24 and remained in place until February 2, 2008 for The Feast of the Presentation of the Lord. [...] Ten new figures were exhibited with seven on loan from the town of Tesero and three—a baker, a woman, and a child—donated to the Vatican. The decision for the atypical setting was believed {{to be part of a}} crackdown on fanciful scenes erected in various cities around Italy. In Naples, Italy, for example, Elvis Presley and Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi, were depicted among the shepherds and angels worshipping at the manger.|$|E

500|$|The nativity scene may not {{accurately}} reflect gospel events. [...] With {{no basis in}} the gospels, for example, the shepherds, the Magi, and the ox and ass may be displayed together at the manger. [...] Some traditions bring other scriptural characters to the nativity scene such as Adam and Eve and the serpent, Noah and his animals, the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve prophets and the twelve apostles. [...] Mundane activities such as Mary washing diapers in the River Jordan, or a dove descending on the <b>newborn</b> <b>infant</b> may be depicted. The art form {{can be traced back}} to eighteenth-century Naples, Italy. Neapolitan nativity scenes do not represent Palestine at the time of Jesus but the life of the Naples of 1700, during the Bourbon period. Families competed with each other to produce the most elegant and elaborate scenes and so, next to the Child Jesus, to the Holy Family and the shepherds, were placed ladies and gentlemen of the nobility, representatives of the bourgeoisie of the time, vendors with their banks and miniatures of cheese, bread, sheep, pigs, ducks or grape, and typical figures of the time like gypsy predicting the future, people playing cards, housewives doing shopping, dogs, cats and chickens.|$|E
