40|$|AIM:To {{explore the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} combined surgery for <b>neovascular</b> angle-closure <b>glaucoma</b> secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR). METHODS:A prospective nonrandomized clinical study was performed. All enrolled patients were initially treated with intravitreal injection of ranibizumab at the dose of 0. 5 mg(0. 05 mL). After new vessels(NV) on the iris and the angle of anterior chamber regressed completely, all patients received phacoemulsification(PHACO), intraocular lens implantation(IOL), trabeculectomy(TRAB), pars plana vitrectomy(PPV) and endophotocoagulation(EPC). The changes of best corrected visual acuity(BCVA), intraocular pressure(IOP), NV and complications were observed, and followed up for 6 mo.

Methods: In this prospective non-randomized comparative study, a total of 26 eyes with cataracts (control group) and 92 glaucomatous eyes (POAG, 40 eyes; PXFG, 26 eyes; NVG, 26 eyes) were enrolled. Aqueous samples (0. 1 to 0. 2 ml) were obtained during phacoemulsification, trabeculectomy, phacotrabeculectomy, or Ahmed valve glaucoma implants. The aqueous concentration of EPO was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The mean±SEM aqueous level of EPO was statistically significantly higher in eyes with glaucoma (56. 7 ± 9. 3 mIU/ml) compared to the control group (0. 8 ± 0. 51 mIU/ml; p< 0. 001). Eyes with NVG had the highest aqueous level of EPO. Aqueous EPO concentrations remained considerably elevated even in eyes with controlled IOP in all three types of glaucoma. Eyes with PXFG displayed the greatest change in aqueous EPO concentration proportionate to the IOP level. In simple regression analysis, IOP, mean deviation, {{and the type of}} glaucoma were the factors that had a statistically significantly positive correlation with the aqueous level of EPO (p= 0. 011 and < 0. 001, respectively).

50|$|During the {{development}} of Visudyne, Miller and colleagues also examined the molecular mechanisms of ocular neovascularization. In 1994, using a primate model, Miller (along with Anthony Adamis, Patricia D'Amore, and others) {{were the first to}} correlate VEGF with ocular neovascularization in vivo. That same year, Miller and colleagues (including Adamis and Judah Folkman) were the first to report increased levels of VEGF in the eyes of patients with vascular eye disease (diabetic retinopathy). These findings were replicated in a larger study by Lloyd Paul Aiello and George King of Joslin Diabetes Center and Napoleone Ferrara of Genentech. Drs. Miller, Gragoudas, Ferrara, and Adamis also demonstrated that introducing VEGF into normal primate eyes could cause several intraocular vascular disorders, such as retinal ischemia and <b>neovascular</b> <b>glaucoma.</b> These studies strongly correlated VEGF protein with pathological ocular neovascularization both in patients and in experimental models.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} {{associated}} with disease processes in the retina, which involve the retina becoming starved of oxygen (ischaemic). The ischemic retina releases a variety of factors, {{the most important of}} which is VEGF. These factors stimulate the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Unfortunately, these new vessels {{do not have the same}} characteristics as the blood vessels originally formed in the eye. In addition, new blood vessels can form in areas that do not have them. Specifically, new blood vessels can be observed on the iris. In addition to the blood vessels in the iris, they can grow into the angle of the eye. These blood vessels eventually go through a process called fibrosis which closes the normal physiologic anatomy of the angle. The closing of the angle prevents fluid from leaving the eye resulting in an increase in intraocular pressure. This is called <b>neovascular</b> <b>glaucoma.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To review {{standard}} {{management of}} blind painful and non-painful eyes {{at risk for}} <b>neovascular</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> and report the management strategies of four cases. Method : Series of cases and literature review. Patients : The first two cases described are blind, painful eyes secondary to <b>neovascular</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> treated with intracameral bevacizumab injections. The third case, a blind, painful eye with uncontrolled glaucoma in a patient unsatisfied with her eye appearance due to white retained lens material at pupillary margin and a large prominent bleb, was treated {{with a combination of}} bleb revision, vitrectomy, lensectomy and endocyclophotocoagulation.

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Neovascular</b> <b>glaucoma</b> is {{a highly}} {{intractable}} form of secondary glaucoma caused {{by the development of}} a fibrovascular membrane in the angle of the anterior chamber.
