25|$|After {{experimenting with}} {{additive}} systems (including a camera with two apertures, {{one with a}} red filter, one with a green filter) from 1915 to 1921, Dr. Herbert Kalmus, Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a subtractive color system for Technicolor. The system used a beam splitter in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames contiguously onto film stock with half the <b>normal</b> <b>base</b> <b>thickness.</b> The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green, then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was Toll of the Sea (1922) starring Anna May Wong. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was The Black Pirate (1926), starring and produced by Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E
50|$|After experimenting from 1915 to 1921 with {{additive}} color systems that filmed and projected the two color components simultaneously, {{rather than in}} rapid alternation (thereby eliminating Kinemacolor's color flicker and false color fringes around rapidly moving objects), the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation developed a subtractive color print process. As in its last additive system, the camera had only one lens but used a beam splitter that allowed red and green-filtered images to be photographed simultaneously on adjacent frames of a single strip of black-and-white 35 mm film, which ran through the camera at twice the normal rate. By skip-frame printing from the negative, two prints were made, on film stock with half the <b>normal</b> <b>base</b> <b>thickness.</b> They were chemically toned (i.e., the silver particles forming the black-and-white images were proportionally replaced by coloring matter) to colors roughly complementary to the filter colors (red for the green-filtered images and vice versa), as subtractive color reproduction requires. They were then cemented together, base to base, into a single strip of film. No special projection equipment was needed.|$|E

Sulphoaluminate {{cement and}} Lead Niobium-Magnesium Zirconate Titanate ceramic (PMN) {{were used as}} matrix and {{functional}} component to fabricate 1 - 3 - 2 piezoelectric ceramic-cement composites by dicing and filling method.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{multiple}} ultrasound parameters in diagnosing patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Methods: A submental ultrasonography was performed to measure the distance between the lingual arteries, the diameter of the retropalatal space in the transverse dimension, and the tongue <b>base</b> <b>thickness</b> in the sagittal plane. The diameter of the retropalatal space and tongue <b>base</b> <b>thickness</b> were measured in the resting state and under Müller's maneuver. Analyses were based on the means of the triplicate measurements and the severity of OSAS. Results: Based on ultrasound data, patients with severe OSAS had a significantly larger mean tongue <b>base</b> <b>thickness</b> in the resting state and under Müller's maneuver and a larger mean distance between the lingual arteries. The mean tongue <b>base</b> <b>thickness</b> (≥ 60  mm, odds ratio 5. 18; 1. 07 – 25. 0) is the sole independent predictor for severe OSAS. The resting tongue <b>base</b> <b>thickness</b> (≥ 60  mm) had a diagnostic performance of 84. 9 % sensitivity, 59. 3 % specificity, 75. 0 % positive predictive value, 72. 7 % negative predictive value, and 74. 2 % accuracy for severe OSAS.

40|$|<b>Normal</b> <b>bases</b> and {{efficient}} arithmetic in finite fields Efficient arithmetic of finite fields {{is important in}} implementing cryptosystems, error-correcting codes and computer algebra systems. <b>Normal</b> <b>bases</b> offer considerable advantages. Optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> in finite fields were introduced at the University of Waterloo by Mullin et al., and are used in practical hardware implementation of public-key cryptosystems. In the same paper, Mullin et al. constructed two families of optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases</b> and, based on a computer experiment, they conjectured no more exist. This conjecture had remained open for several years before H. W. Lenstra, Jr. proved it for finite fields over F 2. Lenstra’s method, however, is not applicable to other fields. In [4], we confirmed the conjecture for all finite fields by using a substantially different argument. Together with Lenstra, we proved the conjecture holds even for any finite Galois extension of an arbitrary field and the proof for the general case is again different but simpler. The final result is published in [5]. By our classification in [5], not all finite fields have optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases.</b> For fields without optimal <b>normal</b> <b>bases,</b> it is desirable to have a normal basis of low complexity.
