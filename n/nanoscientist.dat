40|$|Even {{though there}} is a high degree of {{scientific}} uncertainty about the risks of nanotechnology, many scholars have argued that policy-making cannot be placed on hold until risk assessments are complete (Faunce, Med J Aust 186 (4) : 189 – 191, 2007; Kuzma, J Nanopart Res 9 (1) : 165 – 182, 2007; O’Brien and Cummins, Hum Ecol Risk Assess 14 (3) : 568 – 592, 2008; Powell et al., Environ Manag 42 (3) : 426 – 443, 2008). In the absence of risk assessment data, decision makers often rely on scientists’ input about risks and regulation to make policy decisions. The research we present here goes beyond the earlier descriptive studies about nanotechnology regulation to explore the heuristics that the leading U. S. <b>nanoscientists</b> use when they make policy decisions about regulating nanotechnology. In particular, we explore the relationship between nanoscientists’ risk and benefit perceptions and their support for nanotech regulation. We conclude that <b>nanoscientists</b> are more supportive of regulating nanotechnology when they perceive higher levels of risks; yet, their perceived benefits about nanotechnology do not significantly impact their support for nanotech regulation. We also find some gender and disciplinary differences among the <b>nanoscientists.</b> Males are less supportive of nanotech regulation than their female peers and materials scientists are more supportive of nanotechnology regulation than scientists in other fields. Lastly, our findings illustrate that the leading U. S. <b>nanoscientists</b> see the areas of surveillance/privacy, human enhancement, medicine, and environment as the nanotech application areas that are most in need of new regulations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and evaluates two advanced courses organised in Oxford {{as part of}} the European project Nanobio-RAISE and suggests using their format to encourage multidisciplinary engagement between <b>nanoscientists</b> and nanoethicists. Several nanoethicists have recently identified the need for ‘better’ ethics of emerging technologies, arguing that ethical reflection should become {{part and parcel of the}} research and development (R&D) process itself. Such new forms of ethical deliberation, it is argued, transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries and require the active engagement and involvement of both nanoethicists and <b>nanoscientists</b> with the broader issues surrounding technological developments. Whereas significant research efforts into multi- and interdisciplinary collaborations during R&D processes are now emerging, opportunities for encouraging multidisciplinary engagement through education have remained relatively underexplored. This paper argues that educational programmes could be a natural extension of ongoing collaborative research efforts ‘in the lab’ and analyses how the Nanobio-RAISE courses could be used as a model for course development. In addition to exploring how the elements that were conducive to multidisciplinary engagement in this course could be preserved in future courses, this paper suggests shifting the emphasis from public communication towards ethical deliberation. Further course work could thus build capacity among both <b>nanoscientists</b> and nanoethicists for doing ‘better’ nanoethics...|$|R

40|$|<b>Nanoscientists</b> {{have long}} conjectured that {{adjacent}} nanoparticles aggregate {{with one another}} in certain preferential directions during a chemical synthesis of nanoparticles, which is referred to the oriented attachment. For the study of the oriented attachment, the microscopy and nanoscience communities have used dynamic electron microscopy for direct observations of nanoparticle aggregation and have been so far relying on manual and qualitative analysis of the observations. We propose a statistical approach for studying the oriented attachment quantitatively with multiple aggregation examples in imagery observations. We abstract an aggregation by an event of two primary geometric objects merging into a secondary geometric object. We use a point set representation to describe the geometric features of the primary objects and the secondary object, and formulated the alignment of two point sets to one point set to estimate the orientation angles of the primary objects in the secondary object. The estimated angles are used as data to estimate the probability distribution of the orientation angles and test important hypotheses statistically. The proposed approach was applied for our motivating example, which demonstrated that nanoparticles of certain geometries have indeed preferential orientations in their aggregates.

By evaluating the science as it is presented in the museum and considering it within its German cultural context, we offer an analytical overview of NST in the public sphere. Secondly, we cast our eye toward discerning the ‘why’ of the exhibit. Is it designed to civilize and enlighten and thus empower the public in their understanding of NST as an emerging technology? Does the exhibit have a propagandistic aspect designed to sway the public in hope of avoiding the difficult struggles that have embroiled emergent technologies in the past?

40|$|Within recent years, {{scientific}} misconduct {{has become an}} increasingly important topic, {{not only in the}} scientific community, but in the general public as well. Spectacular cases have been extensively covered in the news media, such as the cases of the Korean stem cell researcher Hwang, the German <b>nanoscientist</b> Schön, or the Norwegian cancer researcher Sudbø. In Science's latest annual "breakthrough of the year" report from December 2006, the descriptions of the year's hottest breakthroughs were accompanied by a similar description of "the breakdown of the year: scientific fraud". Official guidelines for dealing with {{scientific misconduct}} were introduced in the 1990 s. At this time, research agencies, universities and other research institutions around the world developed guidelines for good scientific practice and formed committees to handle cases of scientific misconduct. In this process it was widely debated how to define scientific misconduct. Most definitions centered on falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism (the so-called FFP definition), but suggestions were also made for definitions that were broader and more open-ended, such as the 1995 suggestion from the US Commission of Research Integrity to replace FFP with misappropriation, interference and misrepresentation (the so-called MIM definition). The MIM definition was not adopted in the US, but MIM-like definitions have been adopted in several other countries. In this paper, I shall describe these MIM-related definitions of scientific misconduct and analyze the arguments that have been advanced in their favor. I shall discuss some of the difficulties inherent in the MIM-related definitions, such as the distinction between misrepresentation and mistake, and the demarcation of misrepresentation in areas characterized by uncertainty or by diverging research paradigms. I shall illustrate the problems inherent in the MIM-definition through a particular case: the ruling of the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) about Bjørn Lomborg's best-selling book The Skeptical Environmentalist in which he argued that contrary to what was claimed in the “litany” of the environmentalists, the state of the environment is getting better rather than worse. Lomborg was reported to the DCSD by several environmental scientists, and this controversial case from 2003 ended with a verdict that characterized Lomborg’s conclusions as misrepresentations, but acquitted Lomborg of misconduct due to his ignorance.

40|$|Nanotechnology is forging era-defining {{breakthroughs}} across {{science and}} engineering. In particular, one-dimensional nanostructures such as nanowires, nanotubes and nanobelts are {{widely regarded as}} critical building blocks for creating {{the next generation of}} devices in electronics, optics, energy and biomedicine. Motivated by a practical problem of sequential synthesis of nanowires, we propose a new statistical design augmentation method, called level-expansion. For a fractional factorial design at two levels, this method creates a follow-up design by expanding some of the factors in the initial design to four elaborately chosen levels and reversing the signs of the remaining factors. 1 The augmented design produced as such strikes a fine balance between dealiasing and entertaining nonlinear effects. Some statistical properties of the proposed method are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed method is successfully illustrated with a case study for growing a new type of zinc-oxide nanowire. The use of level-expansion in the case study unveils some previously unknown nonlinear relationships between the concentration of polyethyleneimine and the length of nanowires. This finding is important for <b>nanoscientists</b> to invent new zinc-oxide nanowires with better macroscopic transport properties. The proposed method is very general. Besides nanotechnology, it applies broadly to problems in many other scientific fields with similar traits where a follow-up design is needed for the dual purposes of investigating nonlinear effects and dealising. ...|$|R
40|$|Neuroscience is at a crossroads. Great {{effort is}} being {{invested}} into deciphering specific neural interactions and circuits. At the same time, there exist few general theories or principles that explain brain function. We attribute this disparity, in part, to limitations in current methodologies. Traditional neurophysiological approaches record {{the activities of}} one neuron or a few neurons at a time. Neurochemical approaches focus on single neurotransmitters. Yet, there is an increasing realization that neural circuits operate at emergent levels, where the interactions between {{hundreds or thousands of}} neurons, utilizing multiple chemical transmitters, generate functional states. Brains function at the nanoscale, so tools to study brains must ultimately operate at this scale, as well. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are poised to provide a rich toolkit of novel methods to explore brain function by enabling simultaneous measurement and manipulation of activity of thousands or even millions of neurons.

40|$|Abstract Scholars {{studying}} the ethical, legal, and so-cial issues (ELSI) associated with emerging technolo-gies maintain {{the importance of}} considering these issues throughout {{the research and development}} cycle, even during the earliest stages of basic research. Embedding these considerations within the scientific process re-quires communication between ELSI scholars and the community of physical scientists who are conducting that basic research. We posit that this communication can be effective on a broad scale only if it links societal issues directly to characteristics of the emerging tech-nology that are relevant to the physical and natural scientists involved in research and development. In this article, we examine nano-ELSI literature from 2003 to 2010 to discern the degree to which it makes these types of explicit connections. We find that, while the literature identifies {{a wide range of issues}} of societal concern, it generally does so in a non-specific manner. It neither links societal issues to particular forms or characteristics of widely divergent nanotechnologies nor to any of the many potential uses to which those nanotechnologies may be put. We believe that these kinds of specificity are essential to those engaged in nano-scale research. We also compare the literature-based findings to observa-tions from interviews we conducted with <b>nanoscientists</b> and conclude that ELSI scholars should add technical-and application-related forms of specificity to their work and their writings to enhance effectiveness and impact in communicating with one important target audience— members of the nanoscale science community...|$|R
40|$|Self-assembly is {{a process}} in which small objects au-tonomously {{associate}} with each other to form larger com-plexes. It is ubiquitous in biological constructions at the cellular and molecular scale and has also been identied by <b>nanoscientists</b> as a fundamental method for building molecular scale structures. Recent years see convergent interest and efforts in studying self-assembly from math-ematicians, computer scientists, physicists, chemists, and biologists. However most complexity theoretic studies of self-assembly utilize mathematical models with two lim-itations: 1) only attraction, while no repulsion, is stud-ied; 2) only assembled structures of two dimensional square grids are studied. In this paper, we study the complexity of the assemblies resulting from the cooper-ative effect of repulsion and attraction in a more general setting of graphs. This allows for the study of a more general class of self-assembled structures than the previ-ous tiling model. We dene two novel assembly models, namely the accretive graph assembly model and the self-destructible graph assembly model, and identify one fun-damental problem in them: the sequential construction of a given graph, referred to as Accretive Graph Assem-bly Problem (AGAP) and Self-Destructible Graph As-sembly Problem (DGAP), respectively. Our main results are: (i) AGAP is -complete even if the maximum degree of the graph is restricted to 4 or the graph is re-stricted to be planar with maximum degree 5; (ii) count-ing the number of sequential assembly orderings that re-sult in a target graph (#AGAP) is -complete; and (iii) DGAP is -complete even if the maxi...|$|R
40|$|Background Along {{with the}} {{intensified}} use of metal nanoparticles, growing concern of their adverse outcome {{on human health}} has also expanded, indicating that this work {{is an integral part}} of nanobioscience study. Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate varied effect of biosynthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on normal and cancerous mammalian cells. Methods AuNP synthesized and characterized by different characterization methods, here are produced by specifically isolated Aspergillus species, which is hardly explored in precious scientific findings. These bio-synthesized AuNP are then tested by MTT assay and further confirmed by different fluorescent staining methods. Results The AuNPs synthesized here are fairly monodispersed and uniform in shape as confirmed by the relatively tall and dominant UV spectroscopy peak at 540 nm and TEM images showing round shaped particles at a magnification of 20 and 50 nm size ranges. The crystalline powder formed peaks at 2 θ angles specific for AuNPs verifying their presence and FT-IR validates presence of side groups which help in stabilization of particulates. We have clearly proved that the less toxic nature of these AuNPs on mouse fibroblasts cells and comparatively elevated inhibiting effect on cancer cells at as low as 1 µg/mL concentration of AuNP. Condensation of nucleus and damage of cells seen in fluorescent images also substantiates the results. Conclusion This conclusion is encouraging to the <b>nanoscientists</b> to study elaborately their system pathways which might be responsible for varied toxicity levels of these AuNPs in mammalian cells and pursue different methods in biomedical applications...|$|R
