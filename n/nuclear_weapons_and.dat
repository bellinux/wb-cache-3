5|$|Emil Julius Klaus Fuchs (29 December 1911– 28 January 1988) was a German {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} atomic spy who, in 1950, {{was convicted of}} supplying information from the American, British, and Canadian Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union during and shortly after the Second World War. While at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Fuchs was responsible for many significant theoretical calculations relating to the first <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>and</b> later, early models of the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 for <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms {{to sustain the}} nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E

5|$|The alpha {{particles}} {{emitted by}} polonium {{can be converted}} to neutrons using beryllium oxide, at a rate of 93 neutrons per million alpha particles. Thus Po-BeO mixtures or alloys are used as a neutron source, for example, in a neutron trigger or initiator for <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> for inspections of oil wells. About 1500 sources of this type, with an individual activity of , have been used annually in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|While Radford {{remained}} Eisenhower's {{principal adviser}} for the budget, they differed {{on matters of}} foreign policy.

5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, the Soviet leader {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>and</b> policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E
5|$|Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, {{meaning that}} they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, leading to {{applications}} in <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> nuclear reactors. Plutonium-240 exhibits {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{by-products}} at Rjukan was {{the production}} of heavy water—a key component in <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>and</b> necessary for the Germany designs as a moderator. The hydrogen plant at Vemork was the first mass producer of heavy water, and in 1939 IG Farben, who owned 25% of Norsk Hydro at the time, asked to import five liters of heavy water, but was denied {{due to lack of}} an export license. In 1939–40 production at Vemork was 20 kilograms, by 1942 production had increased to five kilograms per day.|$|E

In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel from Project Alberta, known as the 1st Technical Detachment. The 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron was equipped with 15 Silverplate B-29s.

The Interim Committee was not specifically charged with making recommendations on the military use of nuclear weapons but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to the Interim Committee's involvement.|$|E

As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war. The United States developed the first <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; causing the Japanese to surrender on September 2, ending World War II. Parades and celebrations followed in what is known as Victory Day, or V-J Day.|$|E
5|$|Waldman was {{the head}} of Group TR-6 (Airborne Measurements) for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945.

He was then assigned to Project Alberta, the part of the Manhattan Project that oversaw the preparation of facilities to test and deploy <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>and</b> support their use during the actual missions. As such, he participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as a camera operator on the observation aircraft. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the camera shutter, and no film was exposed.|$|E
