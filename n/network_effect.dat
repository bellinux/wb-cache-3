50|$|Negative <b>network</b> <b>effects,</b> in the {{mathematical}} sense, {{are those that}} have the opposite effect on stability compared to normal (positive) <b>network</b> <b>effects.</b> Just like positive <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> cause positive feedback loops and exponential growth, negative <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> create negative feedback and exponential decay. In nature, negative <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> are the forces that pull towards equilibrium, are responsible for stability, and are the physical limitations preventing states from reaching infinity.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> affect the quality and price decisions of firms in a vertically differentiated market. As <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> increase, high-quality producers tend to raise quality while low-quality producers lower it. The degree of product differentiation is thus expanded. The price of high-quality products decreases first and then increases, but the price of low-quality product diminishes as <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> increase. Simultaneously, market demand and the market coverage rate expand. Profits and <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> are positively related. In addition, high-quality advantage still holds in the presence of <b>network</b> <b>effects.</b> vertical product differentiation, quality competition, <b>network</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>effects</b> {{ubiquitous}} {{with information}} goods (content, software) are a phenomenon being discussed {{more and more}} recently. Despite strong empirical support on <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> generally, {{there is a need}} in research regarding their operationalization and measurement. Our aim was to specify <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> in order to answer the question ‘What exactly are network effects?’. We have identified and developed a set of indicators that determine <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> and assessed them on the information good mobile operating system. Using the mobile operating systems iOS and Android as a case most of the indicators developed for measurement of <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> are measurable.

25|$|For example, in marketplaces such as eBay or Taobao, {{buyers and}} sellers are the two groups.

Therefore, the cross-side <b>network</b> <b>effect</b> is positive. On the other hand, a large number of sellers mean severe competition among sellers. Therefore, the same-side <b>network</b> <b>effect</b> is negative. Figure 1 depicts these relationships.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{number of}} {{products}} that display positive <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> are used in variable quantities by heterogeneous customers. Examples include corporate operating systems, infrastructure software, web services and networking equipment. In many of these contexts, the magnitude of <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> are influenced by gross consumption, rather than simply by user base. Moreover, the value an individual customer derives on account of these <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> {{may be related to}} the extent of their individual consumption, and therefore, the <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> may be heterogeneous across customers. This paper presents a model of nonlinear pricing in the presence of such <b>network</b> <b>effects,</b> under incomplete information, and with the threat of competitive entry. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> are modeled. Conditions under which a fulfilled-expectations contract exists and is unique are established. While <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> generally raise prices, it is shown that accompanying changes in consumption depend on the nature of the <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> — in some cases, it is optimal for the monopolist to induce no changes in usage across customers, while in others cases, <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> raise the usage of all market participants.

30|$|When {{the value}} of an {{innovation}} depends on the number of other users who adopt that innovation, positive adoption externalities, also known as <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> or <b>network</b> externalities, are said to exist [6, 34]. <b>Network</b> <b>effects</b> can be either direct <b>network</b> <b>effects,</b> which are the physical effects of being able to exchange information, or indirect <b>network</b> <b>effects,</b> which arise from the interdependencies with other organizations in the use of complementary goods [6, 34, 49].|$|R

25|$|Indirect network effects: Increases in {{usage of}} one product or network spawn {{increases}} {{in the value of}} a complementary product or network, which can in turn increase the value of the original. Examples of complementary goods include software (such as an Office suite for operating systems) and DVDs (for DVD players). This is why Windows and Linux might compete not just for users, but for software developers. This is also called a cross-side <b>network</b> <b>effect.</b> Most two-sided markets (or platform-mediated markets) are characterized by indirect network effects.|$|E

Because of the <b>network</b> <b>effect,</b> new IM users gained much more value by choosing to use the Mirabilis system (and join its large network of users) than they would using a competing system. As was typical for that era, the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling the company.|$|E
40|$|Railway {{operation}} is often affected by <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> as {{a change in}} one part of the network can influence other parts of the network. This influence can even be far away from where the original change was made. The <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> occur because the train routes (often) are quite long and that the railway system has a high degree of interdependencies as trains cannot cross/overtake each other everywhere in the network. First the article describes <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> in general (section 2). In section 3 the <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> for trains – and how they can be measured by queuing time is described. When the trains are affected by <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> also the passengers are affected.

The threat of entry generally lowers profits for the monopolist, and increases customer surplus. When <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> are homogeneous across customers, the resulting entry-deterring monopoly contract is a fixed fee and results in the socially optimal outcome. However, when the magnitude of heterogeneous <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> is relatively high, there are no changes in total surplus induced by the entry threat, and the price changes merely cause a transfer of value from the seller to its customers. The presence of <b>network</b> <b>effects,</b> and of a credible entry threat, are also shown to increase distributional efficiency by reducing the disparity in relative value captured by different customer types. Regulatory and policy implications of these results are discussed. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Network</b> <b>effects</b> are {{commonly}} mistaken for {{economies of scale}}, which result from business size rather than interoperability. To help clarify the distinction, people speak of demand side vs. supply side economies of scale. Classical economies of scale are on the production side, while <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> arise on the demand side. <b>Network</b> <b>effects</b> are also mistaken for economies of scope.|$|R
25|$|Many {{web sites}} {{benefit from a}} <b>network</b> <b>effect.</b> One example is web marketplaces and exchanges. For example, eBay {{would not be a}} {{particularly}} useful site if auctions were not competitive. However, as the number of users grows on eBay, auctions grow more competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which drives prices down again as this increases supply, while bringing more people onto eBay because there are more things being sold that people want. Essentially, as the number of users of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more and more people find the site to be useful.|$|E
25|$|<b>Network</b> <b>effect</b> {{relates to}} the {{intellectual}} commons in a positive way.

Through P2P networks people are able to share types of education like scholarly articles, becoming a new form of public commons. Network externality like Ted.com {{is an example of how}} intellectual commons with the use of network externality benefits society as a whole. Those who present intellectual property at Ted conferences are sharing their education on a public forum that benefits whoever will listen. Therefore, the larger Ted.com network becomes positively correlates to those who benefit from its common-pool resources.|$|E
25|$|Within a community, {{keyboard}} layout is generally quite stable, {{due to the}} high training cost of touch-typing, and the resulting <b>network</b> <b>effect</b> of having a standard layout and high switching cost of retraining, and the suboptimal QWERTY layout is {{a case study in}} switching costs. Nevertheless, significant market forces can result in changes (as in Turkish adoption of QWERTY), and non-core keys are more prone to change, as they are less frequently used and less subject to the lock-in of touch-typing. The main, alphanumeric portion is typically stable, while symbol keys and shifted key values change somewhat, modifier keys more so, and function keys most of all: QWERTY dates to the No. 1 (1874) (though 1 and 0 were added later), shifted keys date in some cases to the No. 2 (1878), in other cases to the Selectric (1961), and modifier key placement largely dates to the Model M (1985); function key placement typically dates to the Model M, but varies significantly, particularly on laptops.|$|E
40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>effects</b> {{appear to}} {{increase}} the benefits that consumers derive from a product as the user set expands. In platform products, they are {{known as one of}} key mechanisms of being successful on that business. This is mainly because they generate the incentives for users in choosing the platform. For examples, many business achievements, such as VHS video, Microsoft windows OS and NTT Docomo i-mode have exhibited <b>network</b> <b>effects.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to present a new elaborated concept of <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> and eight perspectives in platform products with layered structure which constructed by three players i. e. platform leaders, complementary products (complementors) and users. Firstly, there have been many studies about <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> and almost all studies have argued the influence to end-users, based on the network scale (the number of subscribers). However, the study alludes the necessity of <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> with the significance of linkages between members i. e. access frequency and weight, as well as the number of linkages between members. Secondary, the study classifies four categories and eight perspectives working between couples of layers among platform products, complementary products and users. Four categories are as follows, 1. <b>Network</b> <b>effects</b> between users, 2. <b>Network</b> <b>effects</b> between complementary products (complementors), 3. <b>Network</b> <b>effects</b> between a user and complementary products (complementors), 4. <b>Network</b> <b>effects</b> between a complementary product (complementor) and users. Consequently, the study offers two suggestions. The First one is a new elaborated concept regarding <b>network</b> <b>effects</b> i. e. the significance of linkages between members. The other one is four categories between couples of layers among platform products, complementary products and users, compared with two conventionally categories between products and users typically by Katz & Shapiro (1985).

25|$|<b>Network</b> <b>effect</b> is {{a benefit}} to {{society as a whole}} because it {{positively}} relates to and affects the Intellectual Commons, Property Rights, and Cultural Commons of the world. One form of network externality is social media, which is a peer-to-peer network ran by a privately held for profit business. Although the creation of a large network creates a barrier to entry according to Porters five forces and may prevent a few from creating a new form of P2P networking, it largely benefits society as whole and provides a new form of a common-pool resource so largely scalable that the entire world has the ability to use it. Although the barrier to entry may be high, there is no true form of monopoly in the P2P social sharing market. For example, Facebook holds a large stake in the P2P social sharing market, but it is not mutually exclusive, meaning users can have an account on Facebook and also have an account on Twitter. Furthermore, there becomes no true critical mass in this space due to the ability for technology and innovation to constantly adapt to different environments, market for underdeveloped countries to integrate with social sharing is unlimited.|$|E
