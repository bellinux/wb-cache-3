5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{environmental}} constraint hypothesis or Carbon <b>Nutrient</b> <b>Balance</b> Model (CNBM), states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nutrient</b> <b>balances</b> {{are useful}} tools as {{indicators}} of potential land degradation and for optimizing nutrient use, and are thus highly relevant in the African context. A comprehensive literature review on <b>nutrient</b> <b>balances</b> in Africa was carried out to illustrate the main approaches, challenges, and progress, with emphasis on issues of scale. The review showed <b>nutrient</b> <b>balances</b> being widely used across the continent. The collected dataset from 57 peer-reviewed studies indicated, however, {{that most of the}} balances were calculated at plot and farm scale, and generated in East Africa. Data confirmed the expected trend of negative balances in the continent for nitrogen and potassium, where > 75 % of selected studies had mean values below zero. For phosphorus only 56 % of studies showed negative mean balances. Several cases with positive <b>nutrient</b> <b>balances</b> indicated that soil nutrient mining cannot be generalized across the continent. Land use systems of wealthier farmers mostly presented higher nitrogen and phosphorus balances than systems of poorer farmers (p < 0. 001). Plots located close to homesteads also usually presented higher balances than plots located relatively farther away (p < 0. 05). Partial <b>nutrient</b> <b>balances</b> were significantly higher (p < 0. 001) than full balances calculated for the same systems, but the later carried more uncertainties. The change in magnitude of <b>nutrient</b> <b>balances</b> from plot to continental level did not show any noticeable trend, which challenges prevailing assumptions that an increasing trend exists. However, methodological differences made a proper inter-scale comparison of results difficult. Actually, the review illustrated the high diversity of methods used to calculate <b>nutrient</b> <b>balances</b> and highlighted the main pit-falls, especially when <b>nutrient</b> flows and <b>balances</b> were scaled-up. Major generic problems were the arbitrary inclusion/exclusion of flows from the calculations, short evaluation periods, and difficulties on setting of spatial-temporal boundaries, inclusion of lateral flows, and linking the <b>balances</b> to soil <b>nutrient</b> stocks. The need for properly describing the methods used and reporting the estimates (i. e. appropriate units and measure of variability and error) were also highlighted. Main challenges during scaling-up were related to the type of aggregation and internalization of nutrient flows, as well as issues of non-linearity, and spatial variability, resolution and extent, which have not been properly addressed yet. In fact, gathered information showed that despite some few initiatives, scaling-up methods are still incipient. Lastly, promising technologies and recommendations to deal with these challenges were presented to assist in future research on <b>nutrient</b> <b>balances</b> at different spatial scales in Africa and worldwide.

40|$|Historical {{context of}} the {{assessment}} of <b>nutrient</b> fluxes and <b>balances</b> Since the 1970 ies it appeared that poor soil organic matter content and limited nutrient availability to plants were key in explaining the low agricultural productivity and the limited adoption of improved management strategies by farmers. Similarly, the poor protein content and the low digestibility of the feed available to ruminants in the dry season were identified as the major limiting factors for livestock productivity. The droughts of the 70 ’s and 80 ’s aggravated human pressure on natural resources, accelerating the losses in soil fertility. Assessment of <b>nutrient</b> flows and <b>balances</b> were then attempted to consider these trends at all scales from plot to subcontinent.

40|$|A <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> {{approach}} {{is often used}} to quantify losses of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, that contribute to environmental problems such as eutrophication. A <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> generally is computed at farm level, implying that nutrient losses related to pre-farm processes, such as production of purchased feed, are neglected. Using a <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> at farm level to benchmark livestock systems or individual farms that differ in, for example, amount of purchased concentrates, however, may lead to biased conclusions. To determine whether a <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> that accounts for losses during production of purchased feed (i. e. a chain balance from cradle-to-farm-gate) are more suited to benchmark nutrient losses of milk production systems or individual farms than a <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> at farm level, we analysed 19 Irish grass-based dairy farms and 13 Dutch concentrate-based dairy farms. For each farm, we computed nitrogen and phosphorus losses at farm and chain level (i. e. from cradle-to-farm-gate, including losses from purchased feed production), and expressed these losses per ton fat-and-protein-corrected milk. An independent T-test and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test were used to examine the difference in mean losses at farm and chain level between Irish and Dutch systems. Regression analysis was used to determine if the ranking of the farms changes using a <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> at farm or chain level. Results show that on average, Irish farms had higher nitrogen losses per ton milk than Dutch farms, both at farm (Irish = 20; Dutch = 8 in kg N/ton milk) and chain level (Irish = 22; Dutch = 11 in kg N/ton milk). Phosphorus losses per ton milk, on the other hand, did not differ between Irish and Dutch farms at farm (Irish = 0. 3; Dutch = 0. 1 in kg P/ton milk) or chain level (Irish = 0. 8; Dutch = 1. 0 in kg P/ton milk). Regression analysis revealed that the <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> at chain level could be accurately predicted from the <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> at farm level (R 2 = 0. 992 for N; R 2 = 0. 910 for P); whereas in case of phosphorus, the slope tended to differ between Irish and Dutch farms (p < 0. 10). Ranking 32 farms based on the nitrogen balance at farm or chain level, therefore, showed a similar pattern, whereas the ranking pattern based on the phosphorus farm balance differed from the pattern based on the chain balance. We concluded, therefore, that to benchmark nutrient losses of dairy systems, a <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> at farm level can be used if differences in on-farm losses between systems are large, and pre-farm losses related to, e. g. production of purchased concentrates, are relatively unimportant. To benchmark individual farms, a <b>nutrient</b> <b>balance</b> at farm level can be used only if changes in pre-farm losses per unit change in on-farm losses are similar across farms.
