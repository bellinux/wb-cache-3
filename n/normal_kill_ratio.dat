F4U and FG pilots claimed 2,140 air combat victories against 189 losses to enemy aircraft, for an overall <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> of over 11:1. Against the best Japanese opponents, the aircraft claimed a 12:1 <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> against Mitsubishi A6M and 6:1 against the Nakajima Ki-84, Kawanishi N1K-J and Mitsubishi J2M combined during the last year of the war.

5000|$|The AVG's <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> was {{superior}} to that of contemporary Allied air groups in Malaya, the Philippines, {{and elsewhere in the}} Pacific theater. The AVG's success is all the more remarkable since they were outnumbered by Japanese fighters in almost all their engagements. The AVG's P-40s were superior to the JAAF's Ki-27s, but the group's <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> against modern Ki-43s was still in its favor. In Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941-1942, Daniel Ford attributes the AVG's success to morale and group esprit de corps. He notes that its pilots were [...] "triple volunteers" [...] who had volunteered for service with the U.S. military, the AVG, and brutal fighting in Burma. The result was a corps of experienced and skilled volunteer pilots who wanted to fight.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to interdicting {{the road and}} rail system of North Vietnam, Linebacker also systematically attacked its air defense system. The North Vietnamese Air Force, with approximately 200 interceptors, strongly contested these attacks throughout the campaign. Navy pilots, employing a mutually supporting [...] "loose deuce" [...] tactical formation and many with TOPGUN training, enjoyed a <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> of 6:1 in their favor in May and June, such that after that the North Vietnamese rarely engaged them thereafter. In contrast, the Air Force experienced a 1:1 <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> through {{the first two months}} of the campaign, as seven of its eventual 24 Linebacker air-to-air losses occurred without any corresponding North Vietnamese loss in a twelve-day period between 24 June and 5 July. Air Force pilots were hampered by use of the outdated [...] "fluid four" [...] tactical formations (a four-plane, two element formation in which only the leader did the shooting and in which the outside wingmen were vulnerable) dictated by service doctrine. Also contributing to the parity was a lack of air combat training against dissimilar aircraft, a deficient early warning system, and ECM pod formations that mandated strict adherence to formation flying. During August, however, the introduction of real-time early warning systems, increased aircrew combat experience, and degraded North Vietnamese ground control interception capabilities reversed the trend to a more favorable 4:1 <b>kill</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The U.S. {{military}} claimed 10,889 enemy dead, {{with only}} 242 soldiers killed in this operation {{from the period}} of December 1968 to 31 May 1969 (a <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> of 45:1), but only 748 weapons were recovered (a <b>ratio</b> of enemy <b>killed</b> to weapons seized of 14.6:1). The U.S. Army after-action report attributed this to the fact the high percentage of kills made during night hours (estimated at 40%), and by air cavalry and other aerial units, as well as asserting that [...] "many of the guerilla units were not armed with weapons". The commander of the 9th Division, Major General Julian Ewell, was allegedly known to be obsessed with body counts and favorable <b>kill</b> <b>ratios</b> and said [...] "the hearts and minds approach can be overdone....in the delta {{the only way to}} overcome VC control and terror is with brute force applied against the VC".|$|R
25|$|During the {{remainder}} of the Vietnam War, the Navy <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> climbed to 8.33 to 1. In contrast, the Air Force rate improved only slightly to 2.83 to 1.

50|$|For {{mid-range}} weapons, the SMLE {{was tested}} against the Springfield 1896 Krag in velocity, damage, recoil performance, and in eliminating 8 targets (3 static, 3 moving, and 2 pop-up) with 20 rounds during a simulated assault.

Data {{were obtained from}} 115 farmers spread over 3 districts {{in the area of}} study. Cross section data of socio-economics factors were obtained from the farmer and examined in the study. In addition, historical data of water quality were gathered from the institution. Cobb-Douglass production function was used to estimate the relationship among socio-economics variables and fish production. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimension of water quality dataset then examine water quality data and fish production, represented by fish <b>kill</b> <b>ratio.</b> The result revealed that„ÄÄsocio-economics factors affecting fish production in the area of study included feed (77 %, p< 0. 01), fingerlings (7 %, p< 0. 1), cost of production (7 %, p< 0. 05), number of cages (4 %, p< 0. 05), labor (6 %, p< 0. 05), and feeding time (10 %, p< 0. 01). Other socio-economics factors such as educational background, experiences, location, and number of dependents, have not significant affect to fish production in the study area. Bottom measurement of water quality was used to estimate water quality and fish <b>kill</b> <b>ratio.</b> According to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) result, the most variances of water quality parameters in Cirata Reservoir are TSS, DO, Nitrite and Turbidity. Fish <b>kill</b> <b>ratio,</b> as representative of production risk, in„ÄÄthe study area were examined by water quality data. The study revealed that Total Suspended Solid (TSS) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) has similar trend with fish <b>kill</b> <b>ratio.</b> Both parameters represent water quality and fish kill occurrence in the study area. Fish production in Cirata Reservoir is mainly determined by input factors than personality background of the farmers. However, this activity also determined by environmental condition, represented by water quality, which may lead to the production risk, such as fish kill occurrences. The number of fingerling stocked and feed used revealed that farmers are overstocked and overused compare to regulated amount. Therefore, decreasing intensity of amount of fingerling stocked and feed used are necessary. Further, better management for fish farming practice is recommended due to sustainable fish production in the study area. Farmers should be involved to take a role actively in reservoir„ÄÄmanagement...|$|R
