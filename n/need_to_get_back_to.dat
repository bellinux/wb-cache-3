Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear.

60|$|It {{has lost}} hold, but nothing has arisen {{to take its}} place. That is the gravest aspect of this matter.

And--this is the essence of what I am driving at--our modern communities are no longer cemented, they lack organized solidarity, they are not prepared to stand shocks and strains, they have become dangerously loose mentally and morally. That, I believe, is the clue to a great proportion of the present social and political troubles of the world. We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a cement. We want a Bible. We want a Bible so badly that we cannot afford to put the old Bible on a pinnacle out of daily use. We want it re-adapted for use.
