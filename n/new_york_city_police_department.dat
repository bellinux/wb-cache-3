He also convinced the NYPD Shomrim Society (the fraternal organization of Jewish members of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City</b> <b>Police</b> <b>Department)</b> to admit David Durk.

5|$|Some {{elements}} of the US board were unchanged, leading to apparent idiosyncrasies.

5|$|One of {{the changes}} made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the police cars; the {{original}} colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City</b> <b>Police</b> <b>Department.</b> It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} in the United States is primarily {{the responsibility of}} local police and sheriff's departments, with state police providing broader services. The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>City</b> <b>Police</b> <b>Department</b> (NYPD) is {{the largest in the}} country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws. At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law. State courts conduct most criminal trials; federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial.|$|E
