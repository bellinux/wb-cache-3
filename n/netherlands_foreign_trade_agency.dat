The Belgian establishment deemed it unnecessary to invest in Flanders and no less than 80% of the Belgian GNP between 1830 and 1918 went to Wallonia. This had as a consequence that Wallonia had a surplus of large coal mines and iron ore facilities, while Flanders, to a large extent, remained a rural, farming region. When Belgium became independent, the economy of Flanders was hard hit. Antwerp was now almost impossible to reach by ships (The Scheldt River was blocked by the <b>Netherlands)</b> and <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> was drastically affected.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is an {{analysis}} of the state monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> in a socialist economy. In first part of the article there is discussed an approach, lasting till now, to an essence and conception of socialist <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> monopoly. Until recently in economic literature prevailed the opinion that seems {{to be based on the}} assumption that a centralized <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> system is the only one possible solution, when the <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> is taken over by the state. The monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> and its monopolistic organization form were then identified as being one and the same. Nevertheless such a position may lead to various misapprehensions. For these reasons rejecting identification of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> monopoly with the far centralization of decisions in external trade the author makes a distinction between a monopolistic organizational structure of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> and the category of the monopoly in <b>foreign</b> <b>trade.</b> On the basis of this distinction an attempt is made to define term of the state monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> as a situation in which a right to realization <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> turnovers has not only the central economic authority, but all socialising sphere of national economy. Under such conditions break a principle of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> monopoly can be follow when leading external trade activités by private enterprises and persons will be admited. In this way understood the concept of the monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> creates generally conditions of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> monopoly for rational activités on external trade field. In the result within the framework of the state monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> can be apply a different types of mechanizmus, a different methods of organizations of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> turnovers, then to realize the different forms of this model. In the second part of this article it was shown an attempt of description of the most characteristic of the features of the state monopoly of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade.</b> These features can be derived from the general assumptions of the socialist economy, although different solutions for the <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> are possible. The features should define every <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> model in a socialist economy. They are as follows: 1. necessity of subordination of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade,</b> first of all to the realization of the physical proportions of the national economic plan, 2. need of control and regulation by the state all of <b>foreign</b> <b>trade</b> turnovers, 3. leading dual form of economic calculation in foreign trade: macroeconomic calculus on central level and microeconomic calculus in enterprises.
