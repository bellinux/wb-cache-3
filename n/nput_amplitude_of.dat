For example, with repeated exposure, <b>amplitudes</b> <b>of</b> chemosensory event-related potentials (ERP) decrease over time. However, long-term habituation has not been investigated so far and investigations of differences in habituation between trigeminal and olfactory ERPs are very rare.

The dependencies <b>of</b> the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> the quantum oscillations on <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> inducing ac current are measured at different temperatures below superconducting transition Tc on aluminum asymmetric loops and systems of the loops connected in series. The measured values <b>of</b> the maximum <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> the quantum oscillations, the <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> the ac current inducing this maximum dc voltage and the critical <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> the ac current decrease with temperature increase to Tc. The extrapolation of these measured dependencies to the region near superconducting transition allows to make a calibration of asymmetric superconducting loops as quantum detector of noise. The calibration restores an <b>amplitude</b> profile <b>of</b> the noise pulses from a measured temperature dependence <b>of</b> an <b>amplitude</b> <b>of</b> the quantum oscillations induced by this noise.
