Ptail data are separated out into three streams {{so they can}} eventually be sent to their own clusters in different data centers (Plugin impression, <b>News</b> <b>feed</b> impressions, Actions (plugin + <b>news</b> <b>feed)).</b> Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen {{the number of times}} needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and <b>news</b> <b>feed</b> impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a hash table.|$|E

25|$|On September 6, 2006, <b>News</b> <b>Feed</b> was announced, {{which appears}} on every user's {{homepage}} and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends. This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays {{to attract attention}} to their profile or cause. Initially, the <b>News</b> <b>Feed</b> caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users). In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users {{have been able to}} control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.|$|E

25|$|On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg {{announced}} Beacon, {{a social}} advertising system that enabled people {{to share information}} with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. For example, eBay sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the Facebook <b>news</b> <b>feed</b> as they listed items for sale. The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. Zuckerberg and Facebook {{failed to respond to}} the concerns quickly, and on December 5, 2007, Zuckerberg wrote a blog post on Facebook, taking responsibility for the concerns about Beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.|$|E
25|$|The Switch's user {{interface}} features tile-based access to games {{that are either}} present in the game card slot or stored within the unit's storage devices.

A single Switch console supports up to eight user profiles, which each can be tied to a Nintendo Account user ID. Profiles can be represented by either a pre-made avatar from an internal gallery, or using a Mii. The Mii creator was upgraded with increased color options for aspects such as hair styles; however, it is integrated into the system settings, rather than being an independent application.|$|E
25|$|On February 23, 2010, Facebook {{was granted}} a patent on certain aspects of its <b>News</b> <b>Feed.</b> The patent covers News Feeds in which links are {{provided}} so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user. The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as Twitter. One {{of the most popular}} applications on Facebook is the Photos application, where users can upload albums and photos. Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other image hosting services such as Photobucket and Flickr, which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200photos per album.|$|E

2500|$|On May 13, 2015, Facebook in {{association}} with major news portals launched a program [...] "Instant Articles" [...] to provide rich news experience. Instant articles provides users, access to articles on Facebook <b>news</b> <b>feed</b> without leaving the site. According to the technology news web site Gizmodo on May 9, 2016, Facebook curators routinely suppress or promote news that is deemed to meet a political agenda. For example, articles about Black Lives Matter would be listed {{even if they did}} not meet the trending criteria of <b>News</b> <b>Feed.</b> Likewise positive news about conservative political figures were regularly excised from Facebook pages. In January 2017, Facebook launched Facebook Stories for iOS and Android in Ireland. The feature, following the format of Snapchat and Instagram stories, allows users to upload photos and videos that appear above friends' and followers' News Feeds and disappear after 24 hours.|$|E
