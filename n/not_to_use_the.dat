5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} {{footwork}} and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E

5|$|The makers {{confirmed}} that the film's first trailer would be released on 22 June, coinciding with Vijay's birthday. However, Murugadoss announced that the teaser was to be released on 1 July, ten days later. Upon progression, the teaser and poster launch event was delayed, following an injunction order from the court, which had directed the makers of the film <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Thuppakki title in any form. With the court case ending on 5 October, the first teaser was released in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, the American {{government}} was becoming increasingly concerned {{at the lack}} of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate for Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} fissures {{in the water}} drums of her boilers {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.|$|E

5|$|Licence to Kill (1989) is {{the sixteenth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond film series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, and the last to star Timothy Dalton {{in the role of}} the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is the first one <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> title of an Ian Fleming story. It is also the fifth and final consecutive Bond film to be directed by John Glen. The story has elements of two Ian Fleming short stories and a novel, interwoven with aspects from Japanese Rōnin tales. The film sees Bond being suspended from MI6 as he pursues drugs lord Franz Sanchez, who has ordered an attack against his CIA friend Felix Leiter and the rape and murder of Felix's wife during their honeymoon. Originally titled Licence Revoked in line with the plot, the name was changed during post-production due to American test audiences associating the term with driving.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was able to compete, after the Ferrari crew was able to change his gearbox in time for the session. Not running was Jenson Button, after his team decided not to go out, since a 55-place grid penalty would have placed him {{at the back of the}} grid at any case. Marcus Ericsson was more than half a second quicker than teammate Felipe Nasr, who failed to proceed into Q2, as did both Manor Marussia drivers. With Button out of the running, just one more driver was eliminated, and that proved to be his McLaren teammate Alonso, who barely missed out on making the cut. At the front, Rosberg set the fastest time ahead of Vettel, while Hamilton was the only driver <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> soft compound tyre.|$|E
5|$|Raven, {{thinking}} McCoy is {{attracted to}} her in her natural form, tells him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> cure. When she later attempts to seduce Lehnsherr by taking the forms of various women, Lehnsherr tells her she is beautiful as she is, in her natural mutant form. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaw's exclusivist view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xavier's objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were {{made about the}} toll machines, due to their low height and needing the exact amount of the toll. In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property tax purposes, saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's negotiators {{hoped to}} reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon {{received}} astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault (at a July 1968 meeting in Nixon's New York apartment with South Vietnamese ambassador Bùi Diễm, he had been informed that Chennault would represent Nixon during the campaign). She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu {{not to go to}} Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected. Johnson was aware of what was going on, as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> information.|$|E
5|$|While {{approximately}} 35,000 Serb refugees, trapped {{with the}} surrendered ARSK Kordun Corps, were evacuated to Yugoslavia via Sisak and the ZagrebBelgrade motorway, {{the bulk of}} the refugees followed a route through the Republika Srpska, arriving there via Dvor in Banovina or via Srb in Likatwo corridors to Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina left as the HV advanced. The two points of retreat were created {{as a consequence of the}} delay of a northward advance of the HV Split Corps after the capture of Knin, and the decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> entire HV 2nd Guards Brigade to spearhead the southward advance from Petrinja. The retreating ARSK, transporting large quantities of weaponry, ammunition, artillery and tanks, often intermingled with evacuating or fleeing civilians, had few roads to use. The escaping columns were reportedly intermittently attacked by CAF jets, and the HV, trading fire with the ARSK located close to the civilian columns. The refugees were also targeted by ARBiH troops, as well as by VRS jets, and sometimes were run over by the ARSK Special Units Corps' retreating tanks. On 9 August, a refugee convoy evacuating from the former Sector North under the terms of the ARSK Kordun Corps' surrender agreement was attacked by Croatian civilians in Sisak. The attack caused one civilian death, many injuries and damage to a large number of vehicles. Croatian police intervened in the incident after UN civilian police monitors pressured them to do so. The next day, US ambassador Galbraith joined the column to protect them, and the Croatian police presence along the planned route increased. The refugees moving through the Republika Srpska were extorted at checkpoints and forced to pay extra for fuel and other services by local strongmen.|$|E
