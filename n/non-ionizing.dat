40|$|Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is an {{important}} commercial crop. High quality tomatoes for the local and export markets are grown hydroponically. In this study, the effect of electrically activated sodium bicarbonate and <b>non-ionized</b> sodium bicarbonate solutions on productivity and postharvest quality of hydroponically grown tomatoes was tested. Sodium bicarbonate is a ready source of bicarbonate. By using a novel technique obtained from Radical Waters (Pty) Ltd., ionized bicarbonate (anolyte) can be produced from sodium bicarbonate and applied to plants to stimulate photosynthesis, and improve yield and postharvest quality. The effect of ionized and <b>non-ionized</b> bicarbonate solutions on productivity and postharvest quality was studied by measuring the following: (1) Preharvest growth rate (leaf length, stem height and diameter); total yield; starch concentration in leaves; fruit count; leaf chlorophyll content; CO 2 -uptake; soluble solids and concentration of K+, Na+ and NO 3 ¯ in leaves. (2) Postharvest rate of respiration and transpiration; ethylene production; total soluble solids content; ascorbic acid content; pH; fruit firmness; fruit mass; fruit diameter; longevity; concentration of K+, Na+ and NO 3 ¯ at one-third towards maturity, two-thirds towards maturity, at maturity and during ripening, and rate of ripening at 12 and 23 °C. During the preharvest period, plants treated with anolyte showed increased growth rate, starch concentration, chlorophyll content, soluble solids content and improved yield. During the growth period, the concentration of K+ and NO 3 ¯ was higher in plants treated with anolyte than in plants treated with <b>non-ionized</b> sodium bicarbonate. The concentration of Na+ during the preharvest period was higher in plants treated with <b>non-ionized</b> sodium bicarbonate than in plants treated with anolyte. After harvest, fruits from plants treated with anolyte had a reduced rate of ethylene production, rate of respiration and transpiration, total increased soluble solids and ascorbic acid content than fruits from plants treated with <b>non-ionized</b> sodium bicarbonate. Fruits from plants treated with anolyte had reduced rate of ripening and were larger and heavier than fruits from plants treated with <b>non-ionized</b> sodium bicarbonate. Anatomical and ultrastructural studies revealed that treatment with anolyte stimulated cell growth and photosynthesis. These results were confirmed by comparing the CO 2 -uptake of treated and untreated plants. Application of anolyte stimulated photosynthesis, thus improving yield and fruit quality. Treatment with <b>non-ionized</b> sodium bicarbonate resulted in salt- stress and calcium deficiency. Some of the fruits on plants treated with <b>non-ionized</b> sodium bicarbonate suffered from blossom-end rot due to salt-stress. Prof. C. S. Whitehea...|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} protect the {{population}} living around base stations and users of mobile handsets, governments and regulatory bodies adopt safety standards, which translate to limits on exposure levels below a certain value. There are many proposed national and international standards, but that of the International Commission on <b>Non-Ionizing</b> Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is the most respected one, and has been adopted so far by more than 80 countries. For radio stations, ICNIRP proposes two safety levels: one for occupational exposure, another one for the general population. Currently there are efforts underway to harmonise the different standards in existence.|$|E
25|$|Serine octamer {{clusters}} {{are also}} contenders. These clusters of 8 serine molecules appear in mass spectrometry {{with an unusual}} homochiral preference, however {{there is no evidence}} that such clusters exist under <b>non-ionizing</b> conditions and amino acid phase behavior is far more prebiotically relevant. The recent observation that partial sublimation of a 10% enantioenriched sample of leucine results in up to 82% enrichment in the sublimate shows that enantioenrichment of amino acids could occur in space. Partial sublimation processes can take place on the surface of meteors where large variations in temperature exist. This finding may have consequences for the development of the Mars Organic Detector scheduled for launch in 2013 which aims to recover trace amounts of amino acids from the Mars surface exactly by a sublimation technique.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not <b>non-ionizing</b> {{radiation}} causes leukemia {{has been}} studied for several decades. The International Agency for Research on Cancer expert working group undertook a detailed review of all data on static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy, which occurs naturally and {{in association with the}} generation, transmission, and use of electrical power. They concluded that there is limited evidence that high levels of ELF magnetic (but not electric) fields might cause some cases of childhood leukemia. No evidence for a relationship to leukemia or another form of malignancy in adults has been demonstrated. Since exposure to such levels of ELFs is relatively uncommon, the World Health Organization concludes that ELF exposure, if later proven to be causative, would account for just 100 to 2400 cases worldwide each year, representing 0.2 to 4.9% of the total incidence of childhood leukemia for that year (about 0.03 to 0.9% of all leukemias).|$|E

Potassium dichromate was used as reference substance in two distinct periods of exposure and the mean LC(I) 50 - 48 h and LC(I) 50 - 96 h values were 55. 61 mg. L- 1 and 21. 70 mg.

This is particularly important for substances that are weakly amphoteric. The stomach's acidic pH and the subsequent alkalization in the intestine modifies the degree of ionization of acids and weak bases depending on a substance's pKa. The pKa is the pH at which a substance is present at an equilibrium between ionized and <b>non-ionized</b> molecules. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation {{is used to calculate}} pKa.|$|R

25|$|The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has {{established}} a TLV for UV-C exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254nm UV, this TLV is 6 mJ/cm² over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV {{is supported by the}} International Commission on <b>Non-Ionizing</b> Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When TUSS was planned, and until quite recently, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0 mJ/cm² dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2 μW/cm². Thus, 0.2 μW/cm² was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.|$|E
25|$|Ionic liquids {{are often}} {{moderate}} to poor conductors of electricity, <b>non-ionizing</b> (e.g., non-polar), highly viscous and frequently exhibit low vapor pressure. Their other properties are diverse: many have low combustibility, are thermally stable, with wide liquid regions, and favorable solvating properties {{for a range}} of polar and non-polar compounds. Many classes of chemical reactions, such as Diels-Alder reactions and Friedel-Crafts reactions, can be performed using ionic liquids as solvents. IL's can serve as solvents for biocatalysis. The miscibility of ionic liquids with water or organic solvents varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of anion. They can be functionalized to act as acids, bases, or ligands, and are precursors salts in the preparation of stable carbenes. They have recently been found to hydrolyse, affording acidic or basic media in the aqueous milieu. Because of their distinctive properties, ionic liquids are attracting increasing attention in many fields, including organic chemistry, electrochemistry, catalysis, physical chemistry, and engineering; see for instance magnetic ionic liquid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{radiation}} {{produced by}} a microwave oven is <b>non-ionizing.</b> It therefore {{does not have the}} cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation such as X-rays and high-energy particles. Long-term rodent studies to assess cancer risk have so far failed to identify any carcinogenicity from [...] microwave radiation even with chronic exposure levels (i.e. large fraction of life span) far larger than humans are likely to encounter from any leaking ovens. However, with the oven door open, the radiation may cause damage by heating.

2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. [...] Microwaves are {{a form of}} <b>non-ionizing</b> electromagnetic radiation with a frequency higher than ordinary radio waves but lower than infrared light. [...] Microwave ovens use frequencies {{in one of the}} ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are reserved for this use, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services. [...] Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 gigahertz (GHz)—a wavelength of —while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)—. Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, when dispersed as molecular vibration in solids and liquids (i.e. as both potential energy and kinetic energy of atoms), is heat. Sometimes, microwave heating is explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect; such resonances occur only at above 1 terahertz (THz). Rather it is the lag in response of the polar water molecule to the impinging electromagnetic wave. This type of dielectric loss mechanism is referred to as dipole interaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of {{particles}} of <b>non-ionizing</b> radiation {{is too small}} to produce charged ions when passing through matter.

The effect of <b>non-ionizing</b> forms of radiation on living tissue has only recently been studied. Nevertheless, different biological effects are observed for different types of <b>non-ionizing</b> radiation.|$|E

50|$|In Marklund's paper, {{the plasma}} convects {{radially}} inwards towards {{the center of}} a cylindrical flux tube. During this convection, the different chemical constituents of the plasma, each having its specific ionization potential, enters into a progressively cooler region. The plasma constituents will recombine and become neutral, and thus no longer {{under the influence of the}} electromagnetic forcing. The ionization potentials will thus determine where the different chemicals will be deposited. This provides an efficient means to accumulate matter within a plasma. In a partially ionized plasma, electromagnetic forces act on the <b>non-ionized</b> material indirectly through the viscosity between the ionized and <b>non-ionized</b> material. Hannes Alfvén showed that elements with the lowest ionization potential are brought closest to the axis, and form concentric hollow cylinders whose radii increase with ionization potential.
