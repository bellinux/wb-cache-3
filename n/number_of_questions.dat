Government scientists in both the U.S. and the USSR had insisted that fusion weapons, unlike fission weapons, were cleaner, as fusion reactions did not produce the dangerously radioactive by-products of fission reactions. While technically true, this hid a more gruesome point: the last stage of a multi-staged hydrogen bomb often used the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions to induce fissioning in a jacket of natural uranium, and provided around half of the yield of the device itself.|$|E

25|$|The {{judgment}} proposes {{several questions}} {{to be put to}} the Enlarged Board of Appeal in an effort to resolve perceived conflicts between the different decisions of the Boards of Appeal. In response to this, Alain Pompidou, then president of the European Patent Office (EPO), wrote to Lord Justice Jacob to say that while clarification of certain issues relating to excluded subject matter would be welcomed, there were currently insufficient differences between relevant Board of Appeal decisions that would justify a referral. Instead, a referral would be appropriate if the approach taken by one Board of Appeal would lead to the grant of a patent whereas the approach taken by another Board would not. On 22 October 2008, Pompidou's successor Alison Brimelow did refer a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> to the Enlarged Board. In its opinion G 3/08, the Enlarged Board rejected the referral as inadmissible.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, it was {{announced}} that the UK version was changing its format, reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> in the game from fifteen to twelve. The new payout structure was as follows: first going from £500 to £2,000 with the prize values doubling for each new question, then from £5,000 to £20,000 with the prize values doubling for each new question, then to £50,000, £75,000 and £150,000, and finally from £250,000 to £1,000,000 with the prize value doubling for each new question. Whereas the first safe haven remained at £1,000, the second safe haven was moved to £50,000. The new rules debuted in an episode that aired on 18 August 2007. Within a period of four years following its introduction to the British Millionaire, the 12-question format was subsequently carried over to a number of international versions, including the Arab, Bulgarian, Dutch, French, Polish, Spanish, and Turkish versions.|$|E

40|$|Are you {{interested}} in how to increase the security of data during transmitting data especially in e-assessment? The hypothesis {{of this article is}} how the proposed system makes sure that the transmitted data isn't interrupted by any intruder. So, the proposed system aims to secure e-assessment during transmitting data by ensuring that data is confidential, integrated and authentic. This means, the transmit data is authenticated from the correct source, there is no modification occurs at the communication channel between client and server and only the client who requested the data can see it, to achieve that the proposed system uses multiple-cryptography techniques. As a result of implementing the proposed system and comparing it with the other systems through execution time against RSA modulo length, execution time against <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>question</b> and data size against <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>question.</b> The proposed system shows a great result that is faster, smaller and more secure than the single cryptography systems and mix cryptography system...|$|R
25|$|The Petition {{was read}} {{in front of}} the members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) on 13 May 1980 in an effort to persuade the representatives to ask the {{president}} what he had meant by the two speeches. The delegation to the legislature was led by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Dr Azis Saleh. On 3 July 1980, 19 DPR produced a document containing two <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> to the president. They asked whether the president agreed that the Expression of Concern contained important issues deserving the attention of all sides, especially the legislature and the government, and whether the people of Indonesia deserved a comprehensive and detailed explanation about the issues raised. These questions were passed on to the president in a letter on 14 July. The questions provoked a variety of reactions in the House. One DPR member, Soedardji, did not agree the president had to answer the questions. However, his party colleague Anwar Nuris said it was a normal part of the constitutional process.|$|E
25|$|From 1974 until 1999, {{the exam}} had 30 {{questions}} and was 90 minutes long, scoring 5 points for correct answers. Originally {{during this time}} period, 1 point was awarded for leaving an answer blank, however it was changed in the late 1980s to 2 points for omitted questions. When the exam was shortened {{as part of the}} 2000 rebranding, the value of a correct answer was increased to 6 points (keeping 150 as a perfect score). In 2001, the score of a blank was increased to 2.5 to penalize guessing. The 2007 exams were the first with only 1.5 points awarded for a blank, to discourage students from leaving a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> blank in order to assure qualification for the AIME. For example, on the AMC 12, a student could advance with only 11 correct answers, presuming the remaining questions were left blank. Now, a student must answer at least 14 questions correctly to reach 100 points.|$|E
25|$|The {{header section}} {{contains}} the following fields: Identification, Flags, <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions,</b> Number of answers, Number of authority resource records (RRs), and Number of additional RRs. The identification field {{can be used}} to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a single bit which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second sub-field consists of four bits; if the value is 1, the present packet is a reply; if it is 2, the present packet is a status; if the value is 0, the present packet is a request. A single-bit sub-field indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname. Another single-bit sub-field indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query ("RD"). The next single-bit sub-field indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion ("RA"), since not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another sub-field indicates if the request was truncated for some reason ("TC"), and a four-bit sub-field indicates status. The question section contains the domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The answer section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.|$|E
