2500|$|When {{you write}} a song and you mean it one way, and someone comes up and says {{something}} about it that you didn't think of—you can't deny it. Like [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," [...] people came up and said, cunningly, [...] "Right, I get it. L-S-D," [...] and it was when papers were talking about LSD, but we <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|I {{dropped the}} I-76 or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine {{down into the}} mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor. And that was that. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> again {{particularly}} except to get mad at all the admirals I had to make reports to because of this thing, see? This was one out of seventy-nine separate actions that I had to do with. And it had no significance, see? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know, I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but {{of course}} she is lovely and I'm plain, {{so there is no}} {{possibility}} of comparison between us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Dad, I don't {{know what}} you mean by ribald songs. We sang hymns--it was a sacred concert, you know. What harm was that? I tell you we <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it's</b> being Methodist prayer meeting night. They used to have their meeting Tuesday nights and since they've changed to Thursdays it's hard to remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly know. I <b>never</b> much <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Something between both, I think. Brown--not fair, and--and {{not very}} dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Me think!' {{said the}} provost; 'I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> twice <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mr. Fairford; it was neither fish, nor flesh, nor salt herring of mine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, mamma!" [...] said poor Letta, [...] "why {{do you put}} it so--so--suddenly. I don't love him--that is--I don't {{know that}} I love him. I've <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> seriously. He has never opened his lips {{to me on the}} subject--and--and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mrs. Doolan," [...] Isobel said, roused to a smile by the earnestness {{with which}} Mrs. Doolan propounded the problem; [...] "and can give no reason except {{that we are}} {{attracted}} by natures the reverse of our own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I shan't refuse it; {{but what}} I {{mean is that}} I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> when I asked her to have me; and I shouldn't {{have been a bit}} more likely to ask her if she had ten times as much." ...|$|E
6000|$|Two days later, with pictures, wicker chairs, a rug, she {{had made}} the waiting-room habitable; and Kennicott admitted, [...] "Does look a lot better. <b>Never</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Guess I need being bullied." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to The Houston Chronicle, Schichter {{has stated}} that [...] "I had all the video footage from the interviews, but <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> {{compiling}} <b>it</b> all until last month ... I just went for it, hoping people would dig it".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--about the mill. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before, I {{always hated}} it," [...] she cried, {{dropping}} {{the papers and}} suddenly facing him. [...] "It was just drudgery. But now I want to learn everything, all I can, I'd {{like to see the}} machinery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My boy?" [...] {{the student}} {{repeated}} in tones of surprise. [...] "Oh, yes; Edgar, of course. What am I {{going to do}} with him? Well, I have <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Does he want anything? My housekeeper always sees to that. Do you think that he wants a nurse?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} {{thinking}} of this possibility {{for the last few}} weeks almost continuously, and yet now that it had come to him he felt that he had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before, that he must go off alone by himself to envisage this monstrous and terrible fact, without distraction or interruption.|$|E
60|$|Elinor, having once {{delivered}} {{her opinion}} on William's side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, {{did not see}} the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no opinion to give, as she had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5000|$|That summer, Moors {{hoped to}} be chosen {{as part of the}} five-member team that would {{represent}} Canada at the 2012 Summer Olympics. After she helped Canada qualify a full team in January, Moors said, [...] "I <b>never</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Now, I have my mind set and I'm motivated to get to the Olympics. I really want to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Major. A woman screamed for help, and {{it seemed}} to me that help should be given. I did not think of the risk, either from armed men inside--for I had no reason to believe that there were such--or of civil indictment for breaking in. We heard the cry, made straight for the house, and, as it turned out, all went well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before, but now dying doesn't seem dreadful at all--only solemn and beautiful. Somehow {{everybody}} seems to love everybody else more for it, {{and try to be}} kind and good and pious. I can't say what I mean, but you know, mother;" [...] and Frank went pacing on again with the bright look his eyes always wore when he listened to music or read of some noble action.|$|R
60|$|Cornelia had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before; {{she did not}} try {{to pretend}} that she had; it seemed a little fantastic to her, but it flattered her to have him talk to her about it, and she liked his seriousness. He did not keep up the kind of banter with her that he did with Charmian; he did not pay her {{compliments}}, and she hated compliments from men.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; I {{had no such}} notion. I only {{felt that}} her {{presence}} had the gladdening, inspiriting, calming effect of moonlight or starlight. I reverenced her as a dream of poetry walking the earth. Ha! now one hears the sound of it--that is like it! I {{did not think it}} was such a confirmed case. I should have gone on in peace but for this letter, and <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all.' ...|$|E
60|$|Little Joyce piloted Madame Laurin {{home and}} {{into the kitchen and}} up the back stairs to the kitchen chamber--a {{proceeding}} which would have filled Aunt Isabella with horror if she had known. But Madame Laurin did not seem to mind, and Little Joyce <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all. It was Little Joyce's awkward, unMarshall-like fashion to go to a place by the shortest way there, even if it was up the kitchen stairs.|$|E
500|$|Francesca died in 1992, aged two. Gunn {{played a}} match for Norwich against Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road just days after his {{daughter}} died; he said of it, [...] "When I ran out, I thought, wow, I could feel the whole stadium was with me. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> packing <b>it</b> in." [...] At {{the end of the}} season, Gunn won Norwich's Player of the Year award, as the club finished third in the Premiership, its highest ever league position.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Wait a while,' says Andy, 'and see {{how things}} turn out. We have taken up too noble a cause to draw out now. Besides, the further I gaze into the retail philanthropy {{business}} the better it looks to me. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> investigating <b>it</b> before. Come {{to think of it}} now,' goes on Andy, 'all the philanthropists I ever knew had plenty of money. I ought to have looked into that matter long ago, and located which was the cause and which was the effect.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was reading}} a book by Wally Lamb called The Hour I First thought. One of his {{characters}} was present at a horrific school massacre. There was {{a line in the}} book that mentioned that one of the shooters had an older brother. That just punched me in the gut; I realized I had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> what <b>it</b> would be like for the surviving sibling of someone who committed a horrific crime. From there, Jesse and Henry were born. Jesse, relentlessly bullied to the point of murder/suicide; Henry, the brother left behind".|$|R
6000|$|She was {{a little}} lady with snow-white hair beautifully wavy and thick, and {{carefully}} arranged in becoming puffs and coils. Beneath it was an almost girlish face, pink cheeked and sweet lipped, with big soft brown eyes and dimples [...] . actually dimples. She wore a very dainty gown of cream muslin with pale-hued roses on it [...] . a gown which would have seemed ridiculously juvenile on most women of her age, but which suited Miss Lavendar so perfectly that you <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{hit in the}} arm. I can't tell {{much about}} it. I only know that I went slap down; and there is {{certainly}} something the matter with my shoulder. Like an idiot I did not take shelter as you told me, but I was watching you so anxiously I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> If I {{had not been a}} fool I should have jumped up and got under cover at once; but I fancy I must have knocked my head as I fell. At any rate, I did not think about moving till I heard those two shots." ...|$|E
6000|$|Despite Aunt Bessie's nagging the Kennicotts rarely {{attended}} church. The doctor asserted, [...] "Sure, {{religion is}} a fine influence--got to have it to keep the lower classes in order--fact, it's {{the only thing that}} appeals to a lot of those fellows and makes 'em respect the rights of property. And I guess this theology is O.K.; lot of wise old coots figured it all out, and they knew more about it than we do." [...] He believed in the Christian religion, and <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he believed in the church, and seldom went near it; he was shocked by Carol's lack of faith, and wasn't quite sure what was the nature of the faith that she lacked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, yes; but Berkeley's curate of St. Fredegond's, not in {{virtue of}} his theology--I never heard he'd got any to speak of--but in {{virtue of his}} musical talents. He went into the Church, I suppose, on purely {{aesthetic}} grounds. He liked a musical service, and it seemed natural to him {{to take part in}} one, just as it seemed natural to a mediaeval Italian with artistic tendencies to paint Madonnas and St. Sebastians. There's nothing more in his clerical coat than that, I fancy, Edie. He probably <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> twice <b>about</b> <b>it</b> on theological grounds.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} that I must consult you first. As a matter of fact, I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> seriously <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all. The whole affair seemed to me so vague, and it didn't attract me in the least. I don't know whether you can {{understand}} what I mean, {{but to me it}} appeared to be an entirely artificial suggestion. If such a thing had been reasonable at all, I should have said that it was an offer invented {{on the spur of the}} moment by Herr Freudenberg, to get me out of Paris." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, you {{all know}} how full of curiosity Peter Rabbit is. Jenny Wren's busy tongue had set that curiosity fairly boiling over. He just couldn't sit still for {{wondering}} and wondering why Reddy Fox wears a red coat. He had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> anything <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before, but now he couldn't {{get it out of}} his head. He just had to know. So, making sure that Reddy Fox had disappeared in the Green Forest, Peter started for the Smiling Pool, lipperty-lipperty-lip, {{as fast as he could}} go. There he found Grandfather Frog setting on his big green lily-pad, just as usual.|$|R
60|$|I went to Australia {{to go into}} {{hospital}} and get tinkered up, after which I planned {{to go on with}} the voyage. And during the long weeks I lay in hospital, from the first day I never missed alcohol. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I knew I should have it again when I was on my feet. But when I regained my feet I was not cured of my major afflictions. Naaman's silvery skin was still mine. The mysterious sun-sickness, which the experts of Australia could not fathom, still ripped and tore my tissues. Malaria still festered in me and put me on my back in shivering delirium at the most unexpected moments, compelling me to cancel a double lecture tour which had been arranged.|$|E
60|$|Albert {{answered}} {{that he should}} carry his father's colours, namely, a red sash, and red and blue plumes. Edgar replied that he had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but that he would choose white and red plumes, and a scarf of the same colour. These the merchant purchased in the afternoon, {{and his wife and}} daughter fastened the plumes in their helmets. At the appointed hour in the morning they clad themselves in full armour, and when they went down they found the merchant's wife and daughter were already afoot, and these fastened the scarves over their shoulders. On going down to the courtyard they found, to their surprise, that their two horses both carried armour on the chest, body, and head.|$|E
6000|$|They {{all looked}} unhit, {{and said they}} didn't know; that they had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before, and it hadn't ever {{occurred}} to them that a nation could be so situated that every man could {{have a say in}} the government. I said I had seen one--and that it would last until it had an Established Church. Again they were all unhit--at first. But presently one man looked up and asked me to state that proposition again; and state it slowly, so it could soak into his understanding. I did it; and after a little he had the idea, and he brought his fist down and said he didn't believe a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down in the mud and dirt in any such way; and that to steal from a nation its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes. I said to myself: ...|$|E
30|$|In a sense, it is {{pointless}} to speculate why Rellich didn’t find Theorem 7.2, {{but it is}} difficult to resist. It is possible that he never considered the problem of esa of atomic Hamiltonians, settling for a presumption that using the Friedrichs extension suffices (as Kato suggests in [1]) but I think that unlikely. It is possible that he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the problem but dismissed it as too difficult and <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> hard <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Perhaps the most likely explanation involves Step 3 : once you understand it, it is trivial, but until you conceive that it might be true, it might elude you.|$|R
6000|$|... § 15. Now observe, the Lombardic workman {{did not do}} {{all this}} because he had thought it out, as you and I are doing together; he <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> a bit <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He simply saw the beast; saw it as plainly as you see the writing on this page, and of course could not be wrong in {{anything}} he told us of it.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{a year of}} {{arriving}} in the Las Vegas Valley, Mallory {{caught the attention of}} local media. KNPR said about him, [...] "He’s reaching out into the community to perform poetry and bring it to people who may <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before. In fact, he says, he wants to be the king of poetry in Las Vegas." [...] Las Vegas CityLife wrote, [...] "Recently transplanted from Orange County, where he reigned over the poetry scene and coordinated readings for two decades, Lee Mallory is wasting no time in establishing himself here." [...] And the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote, [...] "... he moved to Las Vegas a year ago and is trying to reinvigorate the poetry community." ...|$|R
