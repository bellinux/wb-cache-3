5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway opened Cullompton {{railway station}} when the railway opened on 1 May 1844. Around 1931 {{the lines were}} widened to provide two passing loops and a new goods shed and waiting room were constructed. It closed to {{passengers}} on 5 October 1964, the site <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> for the M5 motorway Cullompton services. The nearest railway station is now Tiverton Parkway open by British Rail.|$|E
5|$|A {{trading post}} was {{constructed}} {{on the south}} bank of the Tanana, at Bates Landing in April 1904 by a prospector named Ben Bennett on his claim of , but Bennett sold the post and land to Daniel G. McCarty in April 1905. However since E.T. Barnette, the founder of Fairbanks, and McCarty's former employer, had financed the goods in the post, Barnette retained ownership of them. The post property, <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> as a roadhouse, soon became known as McCarty's. Another prospector named Alonzo Maxey, and a friend, built Bradley's Roadhouse to compete with McCarty's and by 1907, McCarty's had been transferred to Maxey.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{experiments}} to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide animals of a known genetic background, {{an important tool}} for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s the {{installation}} of overhead electrification commenced between London Euston and both Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly. Phase 1 comprised electrification between Crewe and Liverpool and Manchester. Phase 2 involved the extension southwards from Crewe to London. The massive proportions of the Coronation Class resulted in their prohibition from operating under those wires. Camden's allocation was now run down (the remaining locomotives being transferred to nearby Willesden (1A)), whilst Polmadie's was dispensed with entirely. The bulk of the class was situated at either Crewe North or Carlisle, the Kingmoor shed (12A, 68A from 1958) <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> in addition to Upperby.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E

5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} synthetic virus was created in 2002. Although somewhat of a misconception, {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that Fizzwidget is {{unaware of}} the Protopet's flaws, Ratchet goes to warn him during a promotionary event being held on planet Boldan, only to {{discover}} {{it to be a}} trap by the Thugs-4-Less boss, after cancelling their contract with Angela to work with MegaCorp. Captured, the pair find themselves transported to Aranos and aboard the same vessel, <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>used</b> as a remote prison, but manage to escape confinement. Discovering that Angela was captured by them, the pair track the mercenaries to their hideout on planet Snivelak, defeating their boss and saving Angela. Intent on stopping Fizzwidget, the group head for MegaCrop's Headquarters, only to discover that the CEO is none other than disgraced hero Captain Qwark. In a bid to restore his reputation, Qwark took over MegaCorp as Fizzwidget, with the intention of unleashing the Protopet upon the galaxy, so he can use a device created by Angela to defeat the creatures and make himself famous again. When he demonstrates the device, however, it malfunctions and transforms the original Protopet into a gigantic beast that devours him. While Angela goes to rescue the real Fizzwidget, Ratchet subdues the Protopet and saves Qwark's life. With Clank's help, Angela fixes the device and broadcasts a signal through MegaCorp's TV transponders, neutralizing the Protopets and restoring peace to the Bogon galaxy.|$|E
