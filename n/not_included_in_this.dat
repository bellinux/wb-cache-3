5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness. This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness. While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of consciousness, they are <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> category.|$|E
5|$|Since 1991, Australia, Canada and New Zealand {{have created}} their own {{separate}} Victoria Crosses: the Victoria Cross for Australia, the Victoria Cross (Canada), and the Victoria Cross for New Zealand. Only five of these separate medals have been awarded, all for actions in the War in Afghanistan; Willie Apiata received the Victoria Cross for New Zealand on 26 July 2007; on 16 January 2009 Mark Donaldson, on 24 August 2010 Daniel Keighran, on 23 January 2011 Ben Roberts-Smith, and on 13 February 2014 Cameron Baird (posthumous award), were awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia.

5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj, the operator of the motorway, and {{is published by}} Hrvatske Ceste. As the motorway traffic volume is measured through an analysis of toll ticket sales, the southernmost section of the motorway, Jankomir - Zaprešić, is <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> report, as it is not tolled. However, since the section {{is a part of}} Zagreb bypass, it is considered to carry heavier traffic than any other section of the A2 motorway. In 2006, it carried more than 22,000 vehicles per day, and its traffic volume grew considerably since the completion of the motorway in 2007.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 262 species of bird have been {{recorded}} living in the wild {{on the island of}} Tasmania, nearby islands and islands in Bass Strait, 182 of which are regularly recorded, while another 79 are vagrants and one is extinct. Birds of Macquarie Island are <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> list. Twelve species are unique (endemic) to the island of Tasmania, and most of these are common and widespread. However, the forty-spotted pardalote is rare and restricted, while the island's two breeding endemic species, the world's only migratory parrots, are both threatened. Several species of penguin are late summer visitors to Tasmanian shores. Tasmania's endemic birds have led to it being classified as an Endemic Bird Area (EBA), one of 218 such areas worldwide. Priority regions for habitat-based conservation of birds around the world, they are defined by containing two or more restricted-range (endemic) species.|$|E
5|$|Short track {{speed skating}} is {{a sport that}} is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, {{included}} speed skating, but the first official short track speed skating events were not held until the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Before 1992, short track speed skating events were held at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport. At those games, events {{for both men and}} women were held in five disciplines: 500 metre, 1000 metre, 1500 metre, 3000 metre and the relay (3000 metres for women, 5000 metres for men). The Netherlands, United Kingdom and South Korea won two gold medals each, with Canada, Italy, Japan and China picking up a gold medal each. The results of those demonstration events are not considered official and are <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> list. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, there were four medal events: men's 1000 metres, men's 5000 metre relay, women's 500 metres and women's 3000 metre relay. Men's 500 metres and women's 1000 metres was added in 1994. The men's and women's 1500 metres were added in 2002 and all eight events have been held at every Olympic Games since.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Victoria Cross {{has been}} awarded to ninety-six Australians—91 were {{received}} for actions whilst serving with Australian forces, and another 5 were received for actions whilst serving with South African and British forces. The majority of the awards were for action in the First World War when a total of 64 medals were awarded. Nine of these awards were for action during the Gallipoli Campaign. 20 medals were awarded for action in the Second World War, 6 in the Second Boer War, 4 in the Vietnam War and 2 in the Russian Civil War. Twenty-eight Australians have been awarded the medal posthumously. Notably, one recipient—Captain Alfred Shout VC, MC (who was also Mentioned in Despatches)—was Australia's most decorated soldier of the Gallipoli campaign. His Victoria Cross was posthumously awarded after Shout died of his wounds during the Battle of Lone Pine. Another nineteen VCs have been awarded to soldiers who were either born in Australia, or died there, but did not serve in Australian units and as such these are <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> list.|$|E

5|$|This section {{lists the}} record {{transfer}} fees {{paid by the}} club for a player. The highest transfer fee received by the club {{is believed to be}} the reported £32.5 million fee paid by Liverpool F.C. for Christian Benteke during the Transfer window following the Premier League 2014-15 season. The record fee Aston Villa have paid for a player was £18 million (rising to £24 million with add ons) for Darren Bent from Sunderland in January 2011. In August 2008 Milner was bought from Newcastle United for an undisclosed fee. Milner's fee is officially undisclosed; various sources declare it to be between £1012 million. Also in August 2008, Aston Villa bought Curtis Davies for an undisclosed fee. Sources have speculated on the fee paid, and this has varied between £810 million. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these transfers they are <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> table at this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{virus has}} been {{identified}} in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants {{as far back as}} the 1970s. The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an Asian elephant was identified at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1995; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus. These cases have so far been identified as early as 1983. Since this date, there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe, nine of which were successfully treated. The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> calculation. This gives a fatality rate of over 80% among known symptomatic disease cases. In cases where antiviral medication was applied, treatment was effective in about one in three cases. As of 2005, there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used, eight of which were fatal. As a fraction of the overall population, it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007, 19 are known to have died of EEHV, and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication.|$|E
