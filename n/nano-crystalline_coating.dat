40|$|Abstract: Fe-based {{amorphous}} alloy coating with a composition of Fe 41 Co 7 Cr 15 Mo 14 C 15 B 6 Y 2 was prepared by high velocity fuel(HVOF) technique. The influence of heat treatment on crystalline behavior, the phase structure and corroded morphology of the coating was investigated by Differential Thermal Analysis(DTA), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy(SEM), respectively. The experimental {{results indicate that}} the {{amorphous alloy}} coating exhibited a two-step crystallization process with crystallization peak temperature at 698 째C and 822 째C, respectively. Amorphous coating exhibits excellent corrosion resistance than that of the corresponding <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>coating</b> with heat treatment at 700 째C for 2 h, 8 h and 12 h. Furthermore, the <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>coating</b> annealed 700 째C for 12 h suffers slight homogeneity corrosion, which did not exhibit obvious pitting on comparison with coating holding 2 h and 8 h...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} provides orthopedic prosthesis {{having at}} least one metallic component that includes a metallic substrate on which an integrally formed <b>nano-crystalline</b> <b>coating</b> is formed. The coating and the substrate have {{at least one}} metallic constituent in common having an average atomic concentration in the coating that differs from an average atomic concentration in the substrate by less than about 10 percent. Further, the nano-crystalline coatings includes crystalline grains with an average size in a range of about 1 to 999 nanometers, and more preferably in a range of about 10 to 200 nanometers. A transition region that exhibits a graded reduction in average grain size separates the coating from the substrate. The coating advantageously exhibits an enhanced hardness, and a high degree of resistance to corrosion and wear. In one application, the nanocrystalline coatings of the invention are utilized to form articulating surfaces of various orthopedic devices...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{great need}} to develop methods to {{regulate}} cellular growth {{in order to enhance}} or prevent cell proliferation, as needed, to either improve health or prevent disease. In this work we evaluated the adhesion, survival and growth of bone marrow stromal cells on the surface of several new ion beam engineered nano-crystals of ceramic hard coatings such as zirconium, titanium, tantalum and cerium oxides. Cell adhesion and growth on the ceramic coatings were compared to adhesion and growth on a <b>nano-crystalline</b> silver <b>coating</b> which is known to possess antibacterial properties. The initial results of a study to determine the effect of nanocrystalline titanium and silver coating on staphylococcus aureus biofilm growth is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The current {{research}} focuses on developing <b>nano-crystalline</b> nickel <b>coating</b> for engineering applications through pulse plating technique. Based on the literature survey, the current density, duty cycle and frequency were identified as important grain refining parameters. Coating was done over a mild steel sample after mechanical polishing, vapour degreasing and anodizing. Experiments were conducted using the three determining parameters and their influence on {{the properties of the}} coating was evaluated. Coatings were then characterized for the surface morphology and hardness. The XRD analysis for the surface morphology resulted in the grain size of 19 nm and the hardness measured from the microhardness tester was 677 HV which is higher than the hardness reported in the available literatures. The influence of the pulse plating parameters on the grain size and hardness of the coating has been listed out {{for the benefit of the}} scientific community...|$|R
40|$|A new {{atmospheric}} pressure plasma electrolytic deposition {{process has been}} developed {{for the production of}} crystalline titanium dioxide films on metal substrates. The process occurs in a liquid precursor composed of titanium tetraisopropoxide and absolute ethanol. A plasma discharge is created and confined around the cathode in a superheated vapour sheath surrounded by the liquid phase, inducing the production of a <b>nano-crystalline</b> TiO 2 <b>coating</b> at the surface of the cathode. The analysis of the structure and composition of these TiO 2 coatings have been carried out by Scannin...|$|R
40|$|A <b>nano-crystalline</b> PbO 2 <b>coated</b> carbon {{composite}} {{has been applied}} as an anode for an up-flow undivided bio-electrochemical reactor (UBER). This electrode provides an enhanced destruction of organic matter in synthetic wastewater in comparison to other anodic materials such as stainless steel, graphite and carbon felts or titanium. The cathode is a granular activated carbon coated with a film of autohydrogenotrophic bacteria. Denitrification occurs simultaneously at the cathode while organic matter is oxidized at the anode. Optimum conditions for the simultaneous removal of organic matter and nitrate from response surface methodology (RSM) studies are an inter-electrode spacing of 3. 2 cm, electric current of 18 mA and HRT of 45 h that gave organic matter removal efficiencies of 83 along with 99 removal of nitrate. Further studies on the mechanisms of denitrification and organic matter removal are envisaged...|$|R

The produced crystalline titanium dioxide coatings are very adherent to the substrate and present a dendritic-like structure. We have moreover demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} adjust easily its composition by a post-processing calcination. Such characteristics make these films very interesting for photocatalysis, solar cells and gas sensing applications, and promise therefore some useful industrial benefits...|$|R
