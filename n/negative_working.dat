We developed a task designed to modify this cognitive bias by having subjects repeatedly practice removing <b>negative</b> words from <b>working</b> memory, thereby enabling them to retain positive and neutral words. To assess the efficacy of this task, we recruited 60 adults who reported elevated repetitive negative thought (RNT) and randomly assigned them to receive a single administration of either the working memory bias modification (WMBM) task or a control task. Subjects in the WMBM condition exhibited greater reduction in proactive interference for negative information than did those in the control condition. These results suggest that the WMBM task reduces biased retention of <b>negative</b> information in <b>working</b> memory and, thus, may be useful in investigating the possible causal role of this cognitive bias in RNT or depression...|$|R

50|$|SexRisky sexual {{behaviour}} {{is defined as}} sexual contact with {{an increased risk of}} either unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection. In a study aimed at evaluating the evidence supporting six major risky sex theories, Leslie Simons and her colleagues found that only the social support and attachment theory had strong empirical support. In the attachment theory model, risk is enhanced in insecurely attached individuals due to <b>negative</b> <b>working</b> models of relationships, reduced closeness in intimate relationships and through decreased self-control. In terms of conscious motivations for sex, attachment anxiety is related to many attachment-related motivations including using sex for desire for emotional closeness, reassurance, self-esteem enhancement, stress reduction, the experience and exertion of power, elicitation of caregiving from a partner, protection from a partner’s anger or bad moods. Those high in attachment avoidance report using sex for power or partner manipulation and endorse a desire to use sex as a way of avoiding emotional closeness. Accordingly, there is evidence that attachment avoidance is associated with positive attitudes towards casual sex, a higher number of casual sex partners, and an interest in emotionless sex and one-night stands.|$|E
40|$|Continuous tone printing, either {{collotype}} or screenless lithography, are {{processes that}} are in limited use. The halftone method of reproduction {{is still the most}} economical way to reproduce a continuous tone original. This study dealt with the mechanism of screenless lithography, more specifically on how to make the use of <b>negative</b> <b>working</b> plates a feasible alternative to positive working plates. It is known that the positive working plate can print a longer range of tones than a <b>negative</b> <b>working</b> plate. So the main point of the experiment dealt with how to extend the range of a <b>negative</b> <b>working</b> plate. A negative plate is of high contrast, and so multiple <b>negative</b> <b>working</b> plates were used to print one image. Each plate in itself can print three to four steps of a continuous tone step wedge. In this experiment, three plates were used in the hopes of printing twelve steps in a continuous gradation. A continuous tone step wedge along with a black and white photograph were divided among the three plates. Twelve steps on the step wedge were identified, and so each film had four of the possible thirty steps which existed on the step wedge. These films were exposed to plates, and mounted on the press. Each image was run in registration with one another, and the solid ink density was varied to produce the continuous tone effect. From the press sheets examined, in which there are examples in this report, a high contrast image was produced. One of the main problems in the experiment was differences in emulsion coating on each individual plate. Which resulted in inconsistent exposure times from one plate to another. From repeated plate testing using a. 15 density increment continuous tone step wedge as a control guide, it was found that for the same exposure a hardening of the plate coating (and consequently of ink receptivity) corresponding to two steps equaling. 30 density difference was to be expected. This made it virtually impossible {{to get a handle on}} the correct exposure time needed for the plate. Results from this experiment show, that it is not possible to effectively print a continuous tone image with a <b>negative</b> <b>working</b> plate and or multiple negative plates. This is due to the high contrast of the <b>negative</b> <b>working</b> plate, thus making it suitable for mainly halftone lithographic purposes...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{related the}} extent to which {{professional}} workers participate in cross-functional teams (CFTs) to 3 facets of professional occupations: domain distinctiveness, accountability, and task autonomy. Furthermore, we investigated whether these relationships are moderated by 3 personality traits: extraversion, emotional stability, and openness to experience. The data were collected using a survey involving 2, 068 Dutch medical specialists.
