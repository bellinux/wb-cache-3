40|$|A lot {{has been}} written about Nobel and Nobel Prize winners. In {{literature}} it is common to describe patterns or trends in <b>Nobel’s</b> <b>peace</b> <b>prize</b> rewards. One aim with my study is to examine if the same is possible to distinguish in how the authors of textbooks have written about <b>Nobel’s</b> <b>peace</b> <b>prize.</b> The study show that is not a complete pattern to be seen in the school textbooks I have read. What has created a difficulty in my study of school textbook is that the information /facts about <b>peace</b> <b>prize</b> winners have been fragmentary or insufficient. There is only one textbook from the 1940 ´s, that has a chapter, which is called <b>peace</b> <b>prize</b> winners. This chapter has disappeared in the examined textbooks from the 1950 ´s up to today’s textbooks. The study shows however that from the 1980 ´s up to today’s it has become more common to mention <b>peace</b> <b>prize</b> in the school textbook...|$|R
