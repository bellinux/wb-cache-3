40|$|Objectives The Arabian Gulf {{region has}} limited {{epidemiological}} data related to sexually transmitted infections. The {{objective of this}} study was to estimate the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection among general population women in Doha, Qatar. Methods Endocervical swabs were collected from healthy women attending primary healthcare centres in Doha, June–December 2008. The specimens were tested for C trachomatis by a commercially available PCR-based assay. Data on basic socio-demographic characteristics, medical history and sexual behaviour were obtained using self-administered questionnaires. The prevalence of C trachomatis and of background variables were stratified by <b>nationality,</b> <b>Qatari</b> nationals versus non-Qatari residents. Results A total of 377 women were enrolled in the study, out of whom 351 (37. 9 % Qataris, 62. 1 % non- Qataris) were tested for the presence of C trachomatis in their specimens. The mean age of participants was 41. 2 years, and the vast majority (93 %, 95 % CI 90. 3 to 95. 7) were married. The mean age at sexual debut was significantly lower among Qatari women compared with non-Qatari women (19. 2 vs 22. 2 years, respectively p< 0. 001), but the mean number of reported lifetime sexual partners (1. 1 partner) was nearly the same in both groups (p= 0. 110). The prevalence of C trachomatis infection was 5. 3 % among Qatari women and 5. 5 % among non-Qatari women, with no statistically significant difference between both groups (p= 0. 923). Conclusions The prevalence of C trachomatis among women was higher than expected, with no significant difference between Qatari nationals and expatriate residents. The higher prevalence may reflect, in part, the limited access to and use of chlamydia screening and management.

40|$|Short tandem Repeats (STRs) are {{the most}} {{commonly}} genetic markers used in forensic human identification. However, {{in some cases they}} are not able to yield complete profiles because of DNA degradation and/or inhibition. The STR profiling of the degraded/inhibited DNA samples can result in allelic drop-outs and even no profile at all. Alternatively, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be used to address the issues of DNA degradation and inhibition due to their smaller amplicons. But their use in regular forensic case work is limited due to additional steps (sequencing based) and time consuming process. To bridge the gap between STRs and SNPs by combining their characteristics, another type of genetic marker, insertion deletion polymorphisms (INDELs), offer an effective way to analyze challenged DNA sample (degraded and inhibited ones). INDELs have short amplicons, low mutation rates, no stutter peaks and are analyzed using the same equipment and protocols as STR polymorphisms. In this study, the forensic efficiency of 30 autosomal INDELs contained within the Qiagen™ Investigator™ DIPplex kit were tested by using 500 samples from individuals belonging to five different <b>nationalities</b> (<b>Qatari,</b> Pakistani, Sudanese, Tunisian and Yemeni) based in Qatar. Population indices and forensic parameters were calculated. The results showed no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and no evidence of linkage disequilibrium for all of 30 markers was found after applying Bonferroni’s correction (P < 0. 00166). The Combined Power of Discrimination (CPD) for the 30 INDEL loci was 0. 9999999 for all of five populations which shows that these 30 markers are very efficient and suitable for forensic casework. The Combined Probability of Match (CPM) was calculated in the order of 10 - 13 which is a satisfactory value for forensic purposes. In addition to assess forensic efficiency of 30 autosomal INDELs, an effort was also made to derive ancestry information by using different statistical systems (Arlequin, Snipper and STRUCTURE). The results indicated that 30 INDELs contained in Qiagen™ Investigator® DIPplex kit, although useful for forensic identification, poorly differentiate five population groups of Qatar. The reason of failure in differentiating the populations, lies in the selection of INDEL markers, which were chosen for identification purpose (i. e. they have similar allele frequencies in different populations) rather than deriving the ancestry information (i. e. iii ancestry informative markers are chosen on the basis that their allele frequencies need to be different for different populations). In order to recover genetic information lost during DNA degradation, the concept of reduced sized PCR products (mini amplicons) has been developed. MiniFiler® kit (Applied Biosystems™) containing 8 mini-STRs (developed by re-designing the primers of 8 STRs contained in Identifiler Plus® kit) provide a possible solution of DNA degradation. By using similar mini-plex approach, a multiplex PCR assay for INDELs (named as mini-INDELs) has been developed in this research. A total of 14 autosomal INDEL markers were selected and short amplicons were designed for them keeping in view that they could perform efficiently on degraded samples. The multiplex of 14 INDELs was designed and optimized successfully in a single tube reaction. All the markers were amplified adequately with good peak balance and expected amplicon sizes. The sensitivity of mini-INDELs was found upto 0. 03125 ng of genomic DNA with complete and balanced profile. The concordance between mini-INDELs kit and Qiagen™ Investigator™ DIPplex kit (for the common loci) was observed in 99. 7...|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{emerging}} pearl trade, {{which has led to}} the first phase of migration {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century, Doha has witnessed a fairly early diversification of its population. The migration of merchant families from India and Iran as well as East-African slaves led to various social groups living in segregated areas. This first migrant generation was granted the <b>Qatari</b> <b>nationality</b> once Qatar declared independence in 1971 (Fromherz 2012). The main transformation process however was initiated by the oil production, which began in the 1940 s and led to a rigid and extensive modernisation period (Salama and Wiedmann 2013). The first modern infrastructural networks were planned by Western consultants and built by South-Asian labourers. The first schools were established and teachers from Egypt, North Africa and the Levant settled in Doha. The rapid urbanisation led to the end of desert and nomad communities while the rise of Doha as a capital city instigated a concentration of all major infrastructural developments in the new capital (Remali et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|Background: Out-of-hospital {{cardiac arrest}} (OHCA) studies from the Middle East and Asian region are limited. This study {{describes}} the epidemiology, emergency health services, and outcomes of OHCA in Qatar. Methods: This was a prospective nationwide population-based observational study on OHCA patients in Qatar according to Utstein style guidelines, from June 2012 to May 2013. Data was collected from various sources; the national emergency medical service, 4 emergency departments, and 8 public hospitals. Results: The annual crude incidence of presumed cardiac OHCA attended by EMS was 23. 5 per 100, 000. The age sex standardized incidence was 87. 8 per 100, 000 population. Of the 447 OHCA patients {{included in the}} final analysis, most were male (n = 360, 80. 5 %) with median age of 51 years (IQR = 39 - 66). Frequently observed <b>nationalities</b> were <b>Qatari</b> (n = 89, 19. 9 %), Indian (n = 74, 16. 6 %) and Nepalese (n = 52, 11. 6 %). Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was carried out in 92 (20. 6 %) OHCA patients. Survival rate was 8. 1 % (n = 36) and multivariable logistic regression indicated that initial shockable rhythm (OR 13. 4, 95 % CI 5. 4 - 33. 3, p = 0. 001) was associated with higher odds of survival while male gender (OR 0. 27, 95 % CI 0. 1 - 0. 8, p = 0. 01) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) (OR 0. 15, 95 % CI 0. 04 - 0. 5, p = 0. 02) were associated with lower odds of survival. Conclusions: Standardized incidence and survival rates were comparable to Western countries. Although expatriates comprise more than 80 % of the population, Qataris contributed 20 % of the total cardiac arrests observed. There are significant opportunities to improve outcomes, including community-based CPR and defibrillation training. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background: Type II {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) {{is one of}} the leading chronic diseases in Qatar as well as worldwide. However, the risk factors for DM in Qatar and their prevalence are not well understood. We conducted a case-control study with the specific aim of estimating, based on data from outpatients with DM in Qatar (cases) and outpatient/inpatient controls, the association between demographic/ lifestyle factors and DM. Methods: A total of 459 patients with DM from Hamad General Hospital (HGH) outpatient adult diabetes clinics, and 342 control patients from various outpatient clinics and inpatient departments within Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) (years 2006 – 2008), were recruited. The association between risk factors and DM was evaluated using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. In addition to odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI), we estimated the population attributable risk fractions for the DM demographic/lifestyle risk factors. Results: <b>Qatari</b> <b>nationality</b> was the strongest risk factor for DM (adjusted OR 5. 5; 95 % CI 3. 5 – 8. 6; p, 0. 0001), followed by higher monthly income (defined as $ 3000 Qatari Riyals...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{analyze the}} {{frequency}} and patterns of maxillofacial injuries in a young adult Qatari population, {{and to provide a}} reference point to improve health strategies in an attempt to reduce the incidence of these injuries. Patients and methodsThis is a retrospective study of young adult maxillofacial trauma patients, holding the <b>Qatari</b> <b>nationality,</b> treated in Hamad Medical Corporation during a 4 year period (2006 – 2009). The files and radiographs of patients enrolled were retrieved, reviewed, and analyzed. The following data were collected: the patient’s file number, age, gender, date and time of injury, mechanism of injury, details of maxillofacial injuries, associated injuries, hospital stay, intensive care stay and treatment modality. ResultsA total of 46 Patients’ files were reviewed, 43 males and 3 females. The motor vehicle collisions constituted the highest incidence as a cause of traumatic maxillofacial injuries, and assault was found to be present only among the age group between 17 – 20 years, more than half the patients presented with isolated maxillofacial injuries (56. 5 %). Four of the patients were found to have GCS of 8 or lower. Total of 12 (26 %) patients stayed in the hospital for more than 10 days two cases deceased, and two cases were shifted to the long term care unit for physical rehabilitation, while the other cases were discharged home. There was significant correlation between the FISS score and the outcome (p< 0. 0001). On the other hand we could not correlate FISS score with hospital stay, mechanism of injury or gender. ConclusionsMotor vehicle collision is the major cause of injuries in young Qataris. Maxillofacial and associated injuries are frequently encountered. Active treatment is indicated in almost half of the patients. A proximately one tenth of the group of patients included in this study, suffered from injuries that resulted in either needing long term rehabilitation services or death...|$|R
