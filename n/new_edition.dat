5|$|The 2010 third edition was {{reviewed}} in Lemur News by Alex Dunkel. He praised the increased {{level of detail}} in the <b>new</b> <b>edition,</b> which adds additional information on geology, the history of lemur research, and numerous aspects of lemur biology. Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel wrote, due to political and economic instability in Madagascar, and these challenges make the <b>new</b> <b>edition</b> especially important. However, he worried that the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.|$|E

5|$|A <b>new</b> <b>edition</b> of the soundtrack, Final Fantasy IV Original Soundtrack Remaster Version, was {{released}} by Square Enix on July 3, 2013. This version is expanded to two discs, allowing the tracks to play through two loops rather than just one, {{as well as the}} addition of a few short pieces that were left off of the original recording. Despite the name, the album features the original Super NES version of the music, rather than a more modern synthesizer sound. The album has the catalog number SQEX-10373~4, and its 57 tracks have a duration of 1:32:40. Joshua Bateman of RPGFan stated that while the remaster edition wasn't strictly necessary, given that Square Enix still sold the original version online, the <b>new</b> <b>edition</b> was still a superior version and an important step in preserving classic video game music.|$|E

5|$|During {{these early}} {{performances}} Verdi made substantial {{changes to the}} score. For some of these he altered his manuscript, but for others musicologists have {{had to rely on}} the numerous full and piano scores put out by Ricordi. Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894, which are also inadequately documented. Ricordi attempted {{to keep up with the}} changes, issuing <b>new</b> <b>edition</b> after <b>new</b> <b>edition,</b> but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory. The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible, leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety of options. In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees, believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source, augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score.|$|E
5|$|In response, Jacob Tonson and his associates, who {{controlled}} the copyright {{of the current}} edition of Shakespeare, threatened to sue Johnson and Cave in a letter written on 11 April 1745.
