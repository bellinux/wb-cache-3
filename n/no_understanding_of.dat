He had thrown his infantry into the teeth of gun fire; he compounded this folly by committing his cavalry piecemeal in pointless charges across soft, spongy ground that was divided by streams, requiring them to attack in long, drawn out lines, rather than en masse; of course, he could not send his cavalry en masse because several natural features—ponds, causeways, swamps—made this impossible on some of the terrain.|$|E

25|$|As Minister for Finance, Haughey on two {{occasions}} arranged foreign currency loans for the government which he then arranged to be left on deposit in foreign countries (Germany and the United States), in the local currencies, instead of immediately changing the loans to Irish punts and depositing them in the Exchequer. These actions were unconstitutional, because it effectively meant that the Minister for Finance was making a currency speculation against his own currency. When this was challenged by the Comptroller and Auditor General Eugene Francis Suttle, Haughey introduced a law to retrospectively legalise his actions.

25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of {{answering}} questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the twentieth century, the {{fundamental}} macroscopic laws of thermodynamics had been formulated and although techniques existed to measure temperature using empirical techniques, the scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} temperature was minimal.

[...] Within the metric system, temperature was expressed in degrees Centigrade with the definition that ice melted at 0°C and at standard atmospheric pressure, water boiled at 100°C.

500|$|Although {{encouragement}} to keep Indigenous languages alive {{was present in}} some schools, a key tactic used to assimilate Indigenous children into Canadian society was to suppress Indigenous languages and culture. Many students spoke the language of their families fluently when they first entered residential schools. Teachers responded by strictly prohibiting {{the use of these}} languages despite many students having little or <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> English or French. The practice of traditional and spiritual activities including the Potlatch and Sun Dance were also banned. Some survivors reported being strapped or forced to eat soap when they were caught speaking their own language. [...] The inability to communicate was further affected by their families' inabilities to speak English or French. Upon leaving residential school some survivors felt ashamed for being Indigenous as they were made to view their traditional identities as ugly and dirty.|$|E

[...] The unofficial mascot of the Redskins team was Zema Williams (aka Chief Zee), an African American man who attended games beginning in 1978 dressed in a red faux-"Indian" [...] costume, complete with feathered war bonnet and tomahawk. Other fans often dress in similar costume for the games.|$|E
500|$|An {{argument}} {{exists that}} the women's suffrage movement in Wales was not truly 'Welsh', {{based on the}} fact that it was organised and orchestrated by an Anglicised, English-speaking, middle-class movement that had little bearing on the true voice of the country. As it has been shown, the first people to embrace the suffrage movement were English-born and wealthy. Rose Mary Crawshay, was born in Berkshire before moving to Wales after her marriage; Millicent Mackenzie was born in Bristol and University educated. In addition, the societies that sprang up in the wealthier coastal towns of the north and south were run by middle-class women, normally of English background with little or <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the Welsh language. Ceridwen Lloyd-Morgan, writing in 2000, linked support for women's suffrage from an earlier campaigning group, the temperance movement, and although the temperance movement reached out through Welsh-language periodicals such as Y Frythones and Y Gymraes, she too concluded that the cross-over was [...] "dominated by immigrant middle-class women".|$|E

Two other English gold coins of the period survive, from two moneyers, Pendraed and Ciolheard: the former is thought to be from Offa's reign but the latter may belong either to Offa's reign or to that of Coenwulf, who came to the throne in 796. Nothing definite is known about their use, but they may have been struck to be used as alms.|$|E

500|$|Although not {{considered}} a [...] "ground breaking rule" [...] by some law reviewers, the case received responses from both proponents and opponents of gun control. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which was the only gun prevention group to file an amicus brief hailed the Court's decision as a victory over the “corporate gun lobby.” Dan Gross, {{the president of the}} Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, stated that the decision “will save lives by keeping guns {{out of the hands of}} dangerous people," [...] and that [...] "the Supreme Court rejected efforts by the corporate gun lobby to undermine federal gun laws, reaffirming that sensible laws can have a big impact while being consistent with the Second Amendment.” Adam Winkler, writing for New Republic, also supported the ruling, stating that it is a [...] "relief to law enforcement." [...] However, others, like the National Rifle Association (NRA), [...] criticized the ruling, stating that it [...] "seemingly allows the government to require virtually any information it wants from a person buying a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, whether or not that information has any relationship to public safety or the policies of federal law." [...] John Lott, a gun rights advocate, criticized the Court's statement that collecting this [...] "information helps to fight serious crime," [...] claiming that registration doesn’t help solve crimes, since registered guns are rarely left at the scene. He noted, for example, that Hawaii's requirement to register guns hasn't solved a single crime in 50 years, though Lott cited no evidence to support his claim. According to Lott, the Court [...] "confirmed a horrible injustice, with <b>no</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> how gun tracing works, and without producing any increased safety for Americans." [...] A Harvard Law Review case note contended that, as a matter of law, the word [...] "person" [...] was properly interpreted by the majority, thus avoiding [...] "gutting key provisions of the statute," [...] and argued, against the dissent, that the majority's interpretation is also consistent with common English. However, the case note argued that a narrower reading of the second count was more appropriate, because the statute explicitly requires the name age and residence, and not anything else. Thus, the law review concluded, the Supreme Court established an unnecessary precedent.|$|E
