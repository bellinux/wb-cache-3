5|$|<b>Noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> {{can form}} only under very {{restricted}} conditions during local summer; their occurrence {{can be used}} as a sensitive guide to changes in the upper atmosphere. They are a relatively recent classification. The occurrence of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> appears to be increasing in frequency, brightness and extent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> {{may be seen}} by {{observers}} at a latitude of 50° to 65°. They seldom {{occur at}} lower latitudes (although there have been sightings {{as far south as}} Paris, Utah, Italy, Turkey and Spain), and closer to the poles it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible. They occur during summer, from mid-May to mid-August in the northern hemisphere and between mid-November and mid-February in the southern hemisphere. They are very faint and tenuous, and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow, but the noctilucent cloud is illuminated by the Sun. They are best seen when the Sun is between 6° and 16° below the horizon. Although <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> occur in both hemispheres, they have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but fewer than 100 times in the southern. Southern hemisphere <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the southern hemisphere has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> {{were first}} {{detected}} from space by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations {{of a bright}} scattering layer over the polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds. A later satellite, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, mapped {{the distribution of the}} clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer. The clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, even when they were not visible to the naked eye. The first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the atmospheric condition of the polar mesosphere and the formation process of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> particles are discussed. The result suggests that the very low temperature found frequently in the summer polar mesosphere not only enables the <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> particles to grow by water vapor condensation but also the nucleus to form through the ion-induced nucleation...|$|R

5|$|Research {{published}} in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in June 2009 suggests that <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> observed following the Tunguska Event of 1908 are evidence that the impact was caused by a comet.|$|E
5|$|Tromp et al. {{also suggest}} that a {{transition}} to a hydrogen economy would result {{in an increase in}} the free hydrogen concentration of the atmosphere by 1 ppm, which would increase the number of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> {{are known}} to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds,</b> and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
40|$|The possiblity is {{investigated}} that {{a substantial}} change has occurred in middle-atmospheric water vapor {{as a result of}} the increase in atmospheric methane over the past century and a half. It is shown from modeling of mesospheric ice-particle formation that <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> brightness should be a sensitive indicator of the water content at the high-latitude summertime mesopause. From an examination of the historical record of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> occurrence, it is found that such clouds are absent from the record before 1885, a finding which is consistent with the hypothesis proposed in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|In 1882 Maunder (and {{some other}} European astronomers) {{observed}} {{what he called}} an [...] "auroral beam"; as yet unexplained, it had some similarity in appearance to either a <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> or an upper tangent arc. However, Maunder wrote that the phenomenon moved rapidly from horizon to horizon, which would rule out a <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> or upper tangent arc. Further, upper tangent arc cannot occur during nighttime when the observation was made. Since he made his observation during highly intense auroral activity, he assumed it was some extraordinary auroral phenomenon, though one he had never observed again before or after.|$|R

5|$|They may {{be studied}} from the ground, from space, and {{directly}} by sounding rocket. Also, some <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> {{are made of}} smaller crystals, 30nm or less, which are invisible to observers on the ground {{because they do not}} scatter enough light.|$|E
5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds.</b> A complementing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities produce more water vapour in the upper atmosphere. Methane concentrations {{have more than doubled}} in the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Night clouds or <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> are {{composed}} of tiny crystals of water ice up to 100nm in diameter and exist at a height of about , higher than any other clouds in Earth's atmosphere. Clouds in the Earth's lower atmosphere form when water collects on particles, but mesospheric clouds may form directly from water vapour in addition to forming on dust particles.|$|E
40|$|Study of {{the nature}} of cosmic dust {{particles}} collected by two recoverable rockets launched at Fort Churchill, Canada, in the spring of 1970, before the <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> season {{in order to avoid the}} interference of uplifted atmospheric aerosols during the determination of the concentration of background cosmic dust. The study was designed to verify the results of a previous study for which dust particles were collected in the summer of 1968 by a rocket launched through a <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> at the same location. The findings support the hypothesis that occasional high concentrations of dust in the mesosphere are due to uplifted aerosols which could be of a terrestrial or cosmic origin...|$|R

40|$|Details of {{the sample}} {{preparation}} and handling techniques of the electron microscope samples for the <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> sampling experiment are given.

Approximately 10 % {{of the total number}} of particles collected had a volat,ile coating which is believed to be ice. 1. Sample Preparation A number of stringent requirements must be met in the preparation of substrates for the collection of small particles. The surfaces must consist of a film thin enough for easy penetra-tion of an electron beam to permit their exami-nation in an electron microscope.

5|$|On April 25, 2007, the AIM {{satellite}} (Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere) was launched. It is {{the first}} satellite dedicated to studying <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds,</b> and made its first observations on May 25, 2007. Images taken by the satellite show shapes in the clouds {{that are similar to}} shapes in tropospheric clouds, hinting at similarities in their dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds,</b> it is not thought to be a major contributor to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5000|$|On September 19, 2009, a Black Brant XII {{that was}} {{launched}} to study clouds caused numerous {{calls from the}} northeastern U.S. reporting [...] "strange lights in the sky". NASA reported that the light came from an artificial <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket's fourth stage {{at an altitude of}} about 278 km.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the regular}} <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> {{observations}} near Moscow, Russia (56 °N, 36 °E), Vilnius, Lithuania (55 °N, 26 °E), and La Ronge, Canada (55 °N, 105 °W), during the period 1990 or 1992 to 2013, there is no statistically significant trend in either the NLC occurrence frequency nor in the NLC brightness when a weather correction to the NLC data is applied.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{observations}} {{carried out in}} the framework of two programs, the middle atmosphere electrodynamics campaign and the <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> (NLC) campaign, are reported. The measurements performed during overhead NLC and polar mesosphere summer echo (PMSE) conditions revealed a number of aerosol-related layering effects on the region's electrical structure. It was found that both polar components of electrical conductivity can be affected in NLC regions...|$|R
5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, {{there were few}} new {{insights}} into the nature of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds.</b> Wegener's conjecture, that they were composed of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed {{for the first time that}} the occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.|$|E
5|$|Night clouds or <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> are tenuous cloud-like {{phenomena}} {{in the upper}} atmosphere. They are made of ice crystals and are only visible in a deep twilight. Noctilucent roughly means night shining in Latin. They are most commonly observed in the summer months at latitudes between 50° and 70° {{north and south of}} the equator. These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and when the Sun is below the horizon for the observer, but while the clouds are still in sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds.</b> The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{simulation}} {{of the ring}} or halo patterns which {{were found in the}} electron microscopic examination of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> particles has been attempted. This was done by impacting ice coated nickel particles on collecting surfaces similar to those used in the 1962 rocket sampling of the clouds. Ring patterns similar to those observed on the rocket sampling surfaces have been produced. From the condition necessary to produce these patterns, a formation mechanism is inferred...|$|R

25|$|Kelly et al. (2009) {{contend that}} the impact {{was caused by a}} comet because of the {{sightings}} of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> following the impact, a phenomenon caused by massive amounts of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. They compared the noctilucent cloud phenomenon to the exhaust plume from NASA's Endeavour space shuttle.|$|E
25|$|The Earth's current orbital {{inclination}} is 1.57° (see above). Earth presently {{moves through the}} invariable plane around January 9 and July 9. At these times, there {{is an increase in}} meteors and <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds.</b> If this is because there is a disk of dust and debris in the invariable plane, then when the Earth's {{orbital inclination}} is near 0° and it is orbiting through this dust, materials could be accreted into the atmosphere. This process could explain the narrowness of the 100,000-year climate cycle.|$|E
40|$|On Aug. 8, 1970 at 0148 and 0354 local time, two Pandora {{sounding}} rocket payloads were launched from the ESRO range in Kiruna, Sweden, during a <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> display.
