5|$|As {{was common}} {{practice}} with upper-class {{children of the}} time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the <b>nanny</b> away. The <b>nanny</b> was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.|$|E

This commentary denotes some of the challenges robot <b>nannies</b> have to overcome, which are only briefly touched by Sharkey & Sharkey (2010), namely: taking into account child development (including interpersonal differences), providing robot <b>nannies</b> with senses, and taking context into account. Parallels are drawn with other branches of artificial intelligence, which illustrates the problems robot <b>nannies</b> have to face. This makes one wonder: robot <b>nannies,</b> future or fiction...|$|R

However, {{a lawyer for the}} <b>nannies</b> threatened to file suit, claiming that the <b>nannies</b> never spoke about such an encounter between Stern and Birkhead. After Stern filed a $60-million libel suit against Cosby and her publisher in October 2007, a spokesperson for the <b>nannies</b> claimed Cosby had offered bribes in an unsuccessful attempt to contact the <b>nannies.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{children}} {{were put into}} {{the care of a}} <b>nanny,</b> as was usual in upper-class families at the time. The first <b>nanny</b> was dismissed for insolence and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious to suggest that the children preferred her to anyone else, would pinch Edward and Albert whenever they were about to be presented to their parents so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her.

5|$|Five {{years after}} the original, Thompson {{returned}} to <b>Nanny</b> McPhee with 2010's <b>Nanny</b> McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during the Second World War, and incorporated a new cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal.

The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship. Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.|$|E

50|$|Mountain goats reach sexual {{maturity}} at about 30 months. <b>Nannies</b> in a herd undergo synchronized estrus in late October through early December, {{at which time}} males and females participate in a mating ritual. Mature billies stare at <b>nannies</b> for long periods, dig rutting pits, and fight each other in showy (though occasionally dangerous) scuffles. Young billies sometimes try to participate, but they are ignored by nannies; <b>nannies</b> also sometimes pursue inattentive billies. Both males and females usually mate with multiple individuals during breeding season, although some billies try to keep other males away from certain <b>nannies.</b> After the breeding season is over, males and females move away from each other, with the adult billies breaking up into small bands {{of two or three}} individuals. <b>Nannies</b> form loose-knit nursery groups of up to 50 animals.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{women from}} their 20s to 60s take up {{employment}} as <b>nannies.</b> Some are younger, though normally younger workers are nursemaids or au pairs rather than <b>nannies</b> {{in the traditional}} use of the term.|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} {{the concept of the}} crowd proposed by a Russian lawyer and public The article presents results of a social psychological study of professional interactions in modern Russian <b>nannies.</b> It provides the first ever descriptions of significant interactions between <b>nannies,</b> employers and children. Four types of professional interactions are identified empirically depending on work motivation of <b>nannies.</b> <b>Nannies</b> with an attitude of "the child's older friend" are focused on establishing a close psychological relationship with the child. Their professional interaction with the child can be defined as overprotective. "Nannies-intermediaries" are more aware of their employee status and avoid breaking the psychological distance both with the child and the parents. The choice of interaction strategies in <b>nannies</b> with a "neighbor babysitter" attitude is determined mostly by their desire to gain work experience in their free time. They generally prefer not to establish close relationships with the child. The most professional of all are <b>nannies</b> with an attitude of "servants". They know how to resolve conflicts between children, how to arrange game activities for children, and conform to the requirements set by the parents. However, <b>nannies</b> of this type are more likely to physically suppress the will of the child...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on 1  year {{of ethnographic}} {{fieldwork}} in Los Angeles, {{this article examines}} how Latina <b>nannies</b> create workplace solidarity in a public park. This article reveals how <b>nannies</b> use public spaces in the neighborhoods in which they work to establish ties similar to co-worker relations in other settings. This paper demonstrates how <b>nannies</b> create a community at the park by incorporating park staff into their activities, reinforcing group values such as sharing and reciprocity, and distinguishing themselves from their employers. Adding to previous research which highlights the atomization and stigmatization that comes with domestic employment, this article shows how <b>nannies</b> create co-worker relationships that are buffers against unfavorable job conditions such as solitary work settings and unappreciative employers...|$|R

50|$|<b>Nannies</b> {{can be very}} {{competitive}} and protective of their space and food sources. They fight with one another for dominance in conflicts that can ultimately include all the <b>nannies</b> in the herd. In these battles, <b>nannies</b> circle each other with their heads lowered, displaying their horns. As with fights between billies during breeding season, these conflicts can occasionally lead to injury or death, but are usually harmless. To avoid fighting, an animal may show a posture of nonaggression by stretching low to the ground.|$|R

40|$|Many second-generation Vietnamese {{immigrant}} {{children in the}} Czech Republic are brought up by Czech <b>nannies.</b> While their parents are incorporated into the labour market {{in order to provide}} their children with sufficient economic capital for their education, the role of caregivers is relinquished to <b>nannies.</b> Both parents and <b>nannies</b> become important actors in the children’s educational process, from the stage of acquiring first words, through primary school, to the moment they are admitted into university. This paper analyses the roles of parents and <b>nannies</b> in this educational process. It draws upon 60 interviews conducted with first-generation immigrant mothers, second-generation immigrants, and Czech <b>nannies.</b> The perspective of all three actors are presented here in order to reveal the interviewee’s understanding of the role of education in the parent-child and nanny-child relationships. How is education manifested in the definitions of parenting and caregiving? The paper illuminates the educational strategies taking place outside the educational institution as being an inherent part of everyday life. Simultaneously, the article reveals the meanings of education for the immigrant families as being linked both to past experience and future expectations. Key words:,,...|$|R
