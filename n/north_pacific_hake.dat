North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. Fishing for <b>Pacific</b> <b>Hake</b> Merluccius productus in the Gulf of California {{is carried out}} by shrimp trawlers. When the shrimp fishing season ends, these boats shift to catching <b>Pacific</b> <b>Hake</b> and other finfish. The <b>Pacific</b> <b>Hake</b> fishery is relatively new and {{has the potential to}} grow as an industry. Therefore, there is interest in defining management plans to create a sustainable fishery. One option is an individual vessel quota system. This paper estimates the pervessel quota in the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Hake</b> fishery that achieves a break-even operation and estimates the number of vessels that could enter the fishery to avoid overexploitation and overcapacity. Potential per-vessel quotas were estimated based on the cash flow of a representative trawler and the estimate of total <b>Pacific</b> <b>Hake</b> biomass. The results indicate that individual catch quotas for <b>Pacific</b> <b>Hake</b> should be 90. 4 or 100 tons to achieve a 30 % or 45 % increase, 15 respectively, in net cash. Additionally, with total allowable catch values equivalent to 25 % of the available biomass, the corresponding fleet size would be 74, 82, or 103 vessels based on different scenarios. Because the <b>Pacific</b> <b>Hake</b> fishery is under development, these approximations can be used during the planning stage to meet resource conservation and right-of-use standards...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{two versions of}} a flexible sorting grid rockfish excluder in the U. S. <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> fishery. The designs tested (design-A and design-B) were developed following a collaborative workshop held between gear researchers and <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> fishing industry participants. Tests occurred off Oregon and Washington during 2012 aboard the F/V Perseverance. A recapture net was used to quantify the escapement of <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> and nontarget species. Both designs retained a relatively high proportion of <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> (> 93 %). However, the two designs did not perform equally with design-B being much more effective at reducing bycatch. Results showed rockfish bycatch was reduced by 70. 2 % under design-B and only 15. 4 % under design-A. For both designs, the mean lengths of <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> caught between the codend and the recapture net did not differ significantly. A reduction in the catch of Pacific halibut and Chinook salmon, which are prohibited take species, was also noted. Unfortunately, both designs tested were only effective under slow-to-moderate fish volumes. Under heavy fish volumes both designs tended to clog.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Inclusion of {{substantial}} levels of raw-frozen <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius productus) in diets of ranch-raised mink (Mustela vison) causes {{a large percentage}} of animals to develop an abnormal condition termed "cotton fur" (CF), characterized by depressed body weight, microcytic-hypochromic anemia and a failure of under-fur pigmentation. Observations by several groups of researchers over the past decade indicate that this syndrome is the manifestation of an iron deficiency in the mink and among several causes may be induced by a heat-labile factor present in certain species of marine fish. Further observations suggest that the CF-causative factor in hake and other fish species is related to an antibacterial property of these fish. A series of feeding trials and tracer-iron absorption experiments with more than 650 experimental animals, including both rats and mink, were conducted to determine possible causes of this induced iron deficiency. Feeding black, Long-Evans, laboratory rats diets based on raw-frozen <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> resulted in decreased body weights, hematocrit levels and degree of hair pigmentation. Absorption of ⁵⁹ferric chloride in mink was significantly lowered when administered in the presence of raw-frozen as compared to either cooked-frozen or raw-unfrozen eggs of <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake.</b> These results parallel earlier observations that the factor in <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> responsible for its antibacterial activity was present in raw-frozen but not raw-unfrozen <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> and support observations that the CF-causative and antibacterial properties of <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> are related. Significant depressions in the absorption by rats of ⁵⁹ferric, ⁵⁹ferrous and hemoglobiniron- 59 were demonstrated when it was administered in preparations of raw-frozen, vs. either cooked-frozen or raw-unfrozen, whole <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake.</b> Similarly, mink absorbed significantly less ⁵⁹ferric and ⁵⁹ferrous iron in raw-frozen than in cooked-frozen <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> extracts. These data show that <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> in the raw-frozen state depresses absorption of iron- 59 in both rats and mink independently of iron form and provide substantial evidence that the anemia in Pacific hake-fed rats is a result of a failure of normal iron absorption. Norwegian researchers reported trimethylamine oxide, a normal, physiologically important constituent {{of a wide variety of}} marine fish, was anemiogenic when fed to mink. This observation, coupled with findings by Japanese workers that trimethylamine oxide is converted in the fish tissues to dimethylamine and formaldehyde by the actions of an enzyme present in the cod pyloric caeca, led to the hypothesis at this station that either trimethylamine oxide or one of its breakdown products was responsible for depressed iron absorption in animals fed <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake.</b> Trials with rats showed that added trimethylamine oxide or formaldehyde significantly depressed absorption of ⁵⁹ferric, ⁵⁹ferrous and hemoglobiniron- 59 in preparations of either cooked-frozen or raw-frozen <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> while trimethylamine and dimethylamine had no effect. Similar results were obtained when trimethylamine oxide and formaldehyde were added to either raw or cooked, chicken eggs. Additions of sodium bisulfite to either raw-frozen hake extracts, cooked-frozen hake extracts containing added formaldehyde or mink diets including raw-frozen <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> significantly increased absorption of ⁵⁹ferric and ⁵⁹ferrous iron in rats. Sodium bisulfite is known to react with the free aldehyde group of formaldehyde; consequently, it is assumed that this group is involved in the observed depression of iron absorption. These findings together with the fact that trimethylamine oxide is widely distributed in marine organisms suggests that formaldehyde and not trimethylamine oxide is responsible for the effects of <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> on iron absorption. In vitro experiments indicate that trimethylamine oxide reacts directly with both ferric and ferrous solutions forming insoluble iron hydroxide precipitates; whereas, formaldehyde has no detectable, chemical effect. Experiments also indicate that formaldehyde administered either in water or in extracts of raw rockfish had no effect on iron absorption in rats; however, supplemental trimethylamine oxide lowered iron absorption independently of substrate used. Addition of acetaldehyde to cooked-frozen <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> had no significant effect upon iron absorption in rats suggesting that not only the aldehyde group but also the specific organic compound is of importance. It is hypothesized that formaldehyde depresses iron absorption by interfering with normal absorption mechanisms, possibly by reacting with protein components of the gastro-intestinal tract. It is further theorized that some other unidentified compound(s) is necessary for formaldehyde to affect iron absorption since formaldehyde was without effect when administered in water solutions. Additionally, it is conceivable that raw rockfish carcass contains factors, possibly bisulfites, which are able to overcome the effects of formaldehyde on lowering iron absorption. Collectively, these experiments suggest that formaldehyde naturally occurring in raw-frozen but not cooked-frozen or raw-unfrozen <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> significantly depresses absorption of ⁵⁹ferric, ⁵⁹ferrous and hemoglobiniron- 59 in rats and mink and consequently is responsible for the CF-causative properies of this fish species...|$|R
40|$|<b>Pacific</b> <b>hake,</b> Merluccius productus, {{the most}} {{abundant}} groundfish in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), is a species of both commercial significance, supporting a large international fishery, and ecological importance, connecting other species as both predator and prey. Coastal <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> migrations are characterized by movements between northern summer feeding areas and southern winter spawning areas, with variations in annual abundance, distribution, {{and the extent of}} these movements associated with varying climate-ocean conditions. In general, warm (cool) years with enhanced (reduced) stratification and poleward (equatorward) transport are often related to good (poor) recruitment, increased (decreased) northward distribution, and reduced (enhanced) growth. However, the classic periodic pattern of annual migration and distribution may no longer be fully representative. Based on recent advances in the understanding of climate-ocean variability off the U. S. west coast, we hypothesize that the annual movements of <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> are more responsive to climate-ocean variability than previously thought, and further, that changes observed in <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> distributions may reflect long-term changes in climate-ocean conditions in the CCLME. Therefore, an updated model of these relations is key to effective monitoring and management of this stock, as well as to devising scenarios of future change in the CCLME as a result of climate variations.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Salmonid run {{sizes are}} {{strongly}} affected by their early marine stage. Fully understanding the life history of salmonids means understanding how {{they interact with}} their marine environment and with other fishes. Changes in the biological and physical environment off the Columbia River region affects the distribution and abundance of predatory fishes and their feeding, forage fishes, and juvenile salmonid marine survival. From 1998 - 2004, forage fish and predatory fish distribution and abundance off the Columbia River was quantified by surface trawling at night during spring/summer. The effect of predation on salmonids was measured by stomach analysis of predatory fishes. During the study period (1998 - 2004), forage fishes increased in abundance by orders of magnitude and were strongly related to the abundance of cold-water copepods the previous year. Higher forage fish populations were also linked to cooler ocean conditions and perhaps fewer predatory <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius productus). Most forage fishes were distributed nearshore while predators had a more offshore distribution. <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> was most abundant in 1998, 2003, and 2004; warm ocean years. Jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus) was most abundant during 1999 - 2002; relatively cool ocean years. Deep (50 -m) ocean temperatures and {{the date of the}} spring transition, when nearshore currents switched from northward to southward, were good predictors of <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> abundance in the study area. Forage fish or salmonid occurrence in a haul was negatively related to the occurrence of predators. <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> and jack mackerel ate primarily euphausiids and small fishes. Salmonids were rarely eaten by either predator. However, because the <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> population can be very large, hake predation can be a significant source of juvenile salmon mortality off the Columbia River during some years. A trophic model showed that marine mortality of Columbia River juvenile salmonids {{may be related to the}} abundance of <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> and forage fishes. A multiple regression using the predictions from the trophic model of annual numbers of juvenile salmonids eaten by hake and Columbia River spring flows as independent variables, accounted for much of the variation observed in the annual marine survival of Columbia River coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), the dependent variable.

Previous analysis showed an increase in grenadier abundance, in the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific,</b> which lagged epibenthic megafaunal abundance, mostly echinoderms, by 9 – 20 months. Subsequent diet studies suggested that carrion is the grenadier's most important food. Our goal was to evaluate if changes in carrion supply might drive the temporal changes in grenadier abundance. We analyzed a unique 17 year time series of abyssal grenadier abundance and size, collected at Station M (4100 m, 220 km offshore of Pt. Conception, California), and reaffirmed the increase in abundance and also showed an increase in mean size resulting in a ~ 6 fold change in grenadier biomass. We compared this data with abundance estimates for surface living nekton (<b>pacific</b> <b>hake</b> and jack mackerel) eaten by the grenadiers as carrion. A significant positive correlation between <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> (but not jack mackerel) and grenadiers was found. Hake seasonally migrate to the waters offshore of California to spawn.

50|$|Merluccius gayi is a merluccid hake of {{the genus}} Merluccius, with two subspecies, the South <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> (M. g. gayi) and the Peruvian hake (M. g. peruanus), found in the {{south-western}} Pacific Ocean, {{along the coast of}} South America, from Peru (Merluccius gayi peruanus) to the Chilean coasts north to the Chiloé Archipelago. During the Southern Hemisphere summer, it migrates southwards in shallow waters, while in the winter, it lives more to the north, in far deeper waters.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{consumption}} of adult euphausiids was estimated {{for the seven}} most abundant fish species found on the continental shelf off southwestern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Empirical data on fish feeding rates, diets and biomass were used to estimate euphausiid consump-tion in August for each year from 1985 to 1997. The fish community in August was estimated to consume an average 297 kt of euphausiids (124 t km– 2). <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius productus) and Pacific herring (Clupea harengus) accounted for 60 % and 30 %, respectively, of the total euphausiids consumed by fish. The total estimated {{consumption of}} euphausiids per tonne of fish averaged 0. 93, {{and there was no}} significant trend in the time series. In addition, there was no significant relationship between the total fish community consumption or euphausiids consumed per tonne of fish and euphausiid biomass, and there was no change in the fraction of euphausiids in the diet of small or large <b>Pacific</b> <b>hake.</b> Thus, it appears that predation pressure from the pelagic fish community was rela-tively constant and not responsible for the apparent fivefold decline in adult euphausiid biomass observed in the 1990 s...|$|R
50|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Current (sometimes {{referred}} to as the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Drift) is a slow warm water current that flows west-to-east between 30 and 50 degrees <b>north</b> in the <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. The current forms {{the southern part of the}} <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Subpolar Gyre and the northern part of the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Subtropical Gyre. The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Current is formed by the collision of the Kuroshio Current, running northward off the coast of Japan, and the Oyashio Current, which is a cold subarctic current that flows south and circulates counterclockwise along the western <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. In the eastern <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> off southern British Columbia, it splits into the southward flowing California Current and the northward flowing Alaska Current.|$|R
50|$|<b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> {{currently}} produces 4 models. The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 43 Pilothouse is a stout fiberglass trawler {{built on}} the original CHB 38 hull. The 43 Pilothouse cruises at 8- 10 knots produced by the yacht's 230 hp Cummins diesel, with twin engines available. Based largely {{on the success of}} the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 43 and the need for a smaller, more affordable pilothouse <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Yachts decided to produce the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 39 Pilothouse. Starting in the Spring of 2009 a new <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 38 will be available with a single or optional two stateroom layout. The <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 38 Sedan is based on the same proven hull as the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 43. The 38 ft. Sedan has the classic look of a traditional trawler with walk-around decks. They have recently added the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 28 Pilothouse trailerable pocket trawler with an 8.5 ft. beam, suitable for transportation to and from the water by their owners without a permit. The design for their new 28 footer came from Chesapeake Marine Design and was created by Karl Stambaugh. The design fit in well with the <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> fleet as well as with a growing demand for this type of boat and this particular design. <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> Yachts worked with Karl who modified the hull, adding stability and speed to the existing design. After months of planning and several minor design changes mold production began. The first <b>North</b> <b>Pacific</b> 28 is scheduled for delivery in August 2009.|$|R
