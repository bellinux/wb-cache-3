5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield {{returned}} to her NUGMW post. The TUC, suspicious of her perceived closeness to MacDonald, was cool towards {{her and she was}} not re-elected to the General Council. She remained Labour's candidate at Wallsend; in the general election of 1935 she was again defeated.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, and while living in northern France, Wodehouse was captured by the Germans and was interned for over a year.

During his junior year, he was replaced on the football team by freshman Frank Hinkey and <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> a starting position. The remainder of Crosby's time at Yale was successful and he enrolled at the New York Law School after graduation.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger {{than at any other time}} in history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E

He passed the Final Examination, and was registered as a pharmacist on 10 July 1918. He <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> the front, and his AIF appointment was terminated on 9 August 1918.|$|E
5|$|Stories {{were told}} of Boone making one last visit to Kentucky {{to pay off}} his creditors, {{although}} {{some or all of}} these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the woods of Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of its}} history, Istanbul has {{ranked among}} the largest cities in the world. By 500 CE, Constantinople had somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 people, edging out its predecessor, Rome, for world's largest city. Constantinople jostled with other major {{historical}} cities, such as Baghdad, Chang'an, Kaifeng and Merv for the position of world's most populous city until the 12th century. It <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> being the world's largest, but remained Europe's largest city from 1500 to 1750, when it was surpassed by London.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Antioch (he went to Sicily {{where he}} died in 1111), and the {{carefully}} constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He {{saw no reason to}} hand it over to someone who had not been involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a U.S. senator. His stance in favor of {{prohibition}} cost him the votes of four legislators {{in his own party}} and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican William O. Bradley, who had been governor in 1895-99. Six years later Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920 largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to women's suffrage. Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he <b>never</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in Louisville on January 9, 1940.|$|E
5|$|Following her father's {{advice on}} the {{importance}} of getting an education or a trade, Bancroft completed high school in Tenterfield before moving to Canberra in 1976 with her husband-to-be Ned Manning, who had also been her teacher.

Bancroft has three children: Jack was born in 1985, Ella in 1988. She separated from Manning when they were very young; her third child Rubyrose was born in 1999.
