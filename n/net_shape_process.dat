40|$|Abstract. During {{the recent}} years, alloys {{based on the}} {{intermetallic}} compound TiAl have attracted a considerable interest as potential competitors to steels and superalloys.

40|$|Superplastic forming is a near <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> <b>process</b> used {{to produce}} various items with complex geometry. However in many cases, only some {{portions}} of the workpiece undergo superplastic deformation. In these cases, instead of choosing expensive starting sheet material with superplastic properties, a low-cost conventional material can be chosen and a grain refinement process can be performed in the selected regions to enhance superplastic properties locally [1]. This process is known as "selective superplastic forming" [R. S. Mishra, M. W. Mahoney, US Patent 6, 712, 916, 2002].

40|$|There is {{a strong}} drive to near <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> <b>process</b> 7000 series {{aluminium}} alloys, which are currently machined from the wrought state with much waste. Semi-solid processing is one potential near net shaping route. It relies on the thixotropic behaviour of alloys with on-dendritic, spheroidal microstructures in the semi-solid state. If such alloys are sheared they thin and flow to fill the die. One route to spheroidal semi-solid microstructure is by reheating worked material into the semi-solid state. During the reheating, recrystallisation occurs and as liquid forms it penetrates the recrystallised boundaries to form spheroids. Here we examine the formation of spheroids in as-supplied 7075 aluminium alloy. It is generally known that 7075 is very resistant to recrystallisation in the solid state due {{to the presence of}} dispersoid particles pinning grain boundaries. In this work, we have reheated 7075 in the extruded and T 6 condition into the semi-solid state. As the temperature rises into the semi-solid regime there is a sudden increase in the appearance of spheroidal grains. The occurrence of recrystallised grains is closely associated with the location of the first liquid to form above the solidus. Fully spheroidal microstructures are obtained on reheating as-supplied material to temperatures in the region of 580 °C, although the fractions of liquid at that temperature are still low at around 5 %. Conventionally there is extra cost involved in obtaining spheroidal microstructure feedstock for semi-solid processing because additional steps are introduced into the process route. The advantage here is that as-supplied material can be directly thixoformed once appropriate liquid fractions are attained. Peer reviewe...|$|E

This process is generally divided into three main steps: feedstock manufacturing, reheating and forming. Feedstock has the main effect on the cost and quality of product.

Computer simulation has become widely used within the industry but use is not universal. Further, many key design decisions must be made before the simulation can be run and expense in terms of money and time often limits the number of decision iterations that can be explored. This work continues several years of work creating simple, very fast, design tools that can assist with the early stage design decisions so {{that the benefits of}} simulation can be maximized and, more importantly, so that the chances of first shot success are maximized. First shot success and better running processes contributes to less scrap and significantly better energy utilization by the process.

40|$|Ceramic matrix {{composites}} (CMC) {{are very}} promising materials {{for use in}} structural applica-tions when one considers their low mass, excellent thermal shock stability and strength at high temperatures. There are different processes for manufacturing complex shaped CMC components based on a fibre architecture of continuous carbon or silicon carbide fibres. DLR in Stuttgart has developed the liquid silicon infiltration (LSI) process which allows the fabrication of thin walled, extremely lightweight C/C-SiC structures. It is a three step pro-cess starting with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) manufacture followed by carboni-zation and conluding with liquid silicon infiltration. The advantage of the LSI process {{is that it is}} a near <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> <b>process</b> without reinfiltration steps. Moreover, the LSI process enables the joining of substructures in-situ without the need for additional metallic bolts or ceramic. An homogeneous, and therefore strong, joint can be produced by implementing molten silicon as a joining material which reacts with carbon, ei-ther from the joining specimen or introduced as a paste to the joining surfaces, to stoichiomet-rically form silicon carbide so the joint is as strong and thermally stable as the basis C/C-SiC material. The typical areas of application for CMC lie where metals, or superalloys, can no longer be taken into consideration due to high thermomechanical loading, and contains all areas of lightweight structures. However, if the application is in an oxidising atmosphere carbon burn-out of both the fibres and the matrix will start at temperatures as low as 450 °C. As a conse-quence, carbon based CMCs can only be utilised for limited lifetime applications. Even oxi-dation protective coatings will only reduce material degradation rather than to prevent oxida-tion completely. The LSI process and examples of CMC applications are discussed in this paper. Successful applications for the high temperature regime are space reentry structures. Commercially at-tractive applications within the medium temperature regime take advantage of the excellent tribological properties (e. g. brake disks) of the material. For temperatures below 450 °C (car-bon burn-out), CMCs are suitable for expansion sensitive applications due to their near to zero coefficient of expansion...|$|E
40|$|In {{the latest}} years 3 D {{printing}} have taken hold {{in a wide}} range of industrial applications. This fast diffusion is especially due to its characteristics of ﬂexible, rapid and cost-efﬁcient production of objects which have a complex geometry, not obtainable with traditional techniques, or prototypes to be tested. These features have urged a rapid development of increasingly efﬁcient materials in order to use additive manufacturing, not only for rapid prototyping, but also to build real industrial products. 3 D printing technology has gone from producing objects for rapid prototyping using common thermoplastic polymers up to additive manufacturing techniques which use metal alloys or some special carbon and glass ﬁbre reinforced composite materials. It is well known that in the aerospace ﬁeld structural design and manufacturing are a challenge; the choice of materials is a really critic aspect; in particular the materials choice represents a crucial phase. The polymeric matrix composite materials technology, combined with the advantages of 3 D printing, would represent an ideal industrial application in the aerospace sector in which the mass and cost reduction is often pursued. In particular this technology would be ideal for micro and nano-satellites for which miniaturization often requires near <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> <b>process</b> techniques and the mass reduction is desirable. The aim is to reduce the launch cost which represents the greater expense. In order to verify that an innovative material, such as a composite material for 3 D printing, is suitable for challenging space applications, it must be tested to verify it meets the space stringent requirements. Furthermore, an experimental investigation to know its thermo-mechanical behaviour in detail is mandatory in order to determineits physical and engineering properties.

A complete characterization of the material, which is already widely used in the automotive ﬁeld, is needed for the exploitation of its acctractive qualities for the aerospace industry. The thermal and mechanical characterization will also allow the development of detailed mathematical model, for example for ﬁnite element analysis, in order to provide fundamental tools for thermo-mechanical designers...|$|E

Three different process parameters (laser power, feed rate and scan speed) at two levels were used to fabricate the samples for L 4 orthogonal array of Taguchi method. The hardness obtained was 446 Hv with high laser power, low feed rate and high scan speed. With these process parameters, another set of nine samples were fabricated to apply heat treatment. Three heat treatment parameters (Solutionizing time, ageing temperature and ageing time) at three levels were used for L 9 orthogonal array.

40|$|Bulk {{shape memory}} alloys, such as Nitinol or CuAlZn, display strong {{recovery}} forces undergoing a phase transformation after being strained in their martensitic state. These recovery forces {{are used for}} actuation. As the phase transformation is thermally driven, the response time of the actuation can be slow, as the heat must be passively inserted or removed from the alloy. Shape memory alloy TiNi torque tubes have been investigated for at least 20 years and have demonstrated high actuation forces [3, 000 in. -lb (approximately equal to 340 N-m) torques] and are very lightweight. However, they {{are not easy to}} attach to existing structures. Adhesives will fail in shear at low-torque loads and the TiNi is not weldable, so that mechanical crimp fits have been generally used. These are not reliable, especially in vibratory environments. The TiNi is also slow to heat up, as it can only be heated indirectly using heater and cooling must be done passively. This has restricted their use to on-off actuators where cycle times of approximately one minute is acceptable. Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) has been used in the past to make porous TiNi metal foams. Shape Change Technologies has been able to train SHS derived TiNi to exhibit the shape memory effect. As it is an open-celled material, fast response times were observed when the material was heated using hot and cold fluids. A methodology was developed to make the open-celled porous TiNi foams as a tube with integrated hexagonal ends, which then becomes a torsional actuator with fast response times. Under processing developed independently, researchers were able to verify torques of 84 in. -lb (approximately equal to 9. 5 Nm) using an actuator weighing 1. 3 oz (approximately equal to 37 g) with very fast (less than 1 / 16 th of a second) initial response times when hot and cold fluids were used to facilitate heat transfer. Integrated structural connections were added as part of the <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> <b>process,</b> eliminating the need for welding, adhesives, or mechanical crimping. Inexpensive net-shape processing was used, which reduces the cost of the actuator by over a factor of 10 over nonporous TiNi made by hot drawing of tube or electrical discharge machining. By forming the alloy as an open-celled foam, the surface area for heat transfer is dramatically increased, allowing for much faster response times. The technology also allows for netshape fabrication of the actuator, which allows for structural connections to be integrated into the actuator material, making these actuators significantly less expensive. Commercial applications include actuators for concepts such as the variable area chevron and nozzle in jet aircraft. Lightweight tube or rod components can be supplied to interested parties...|$|E
40|$|Flow forming is a near <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> <b>process</b> for {{manufacturing}} of dimensionally accurate hollow components such as shaft in gas turbines, {{that is currently}} at its development stage for aerospace industry. The process has several advantages such as reducing material wastage, extremely fast manufacturing time, and eliminating extra manufacturing processes such as machining. Due {{to the nature of}} this complicated cold deformation process, significant magnitude of residual stress is introduced into the component. Understanding the magnitude and distribution of residual stress is essential to tailor the flow forming process to achieve parts within dimensional tolerances and desired mechanical properties. The present research is aiming to explore the generation and evolution of residual stress at various stages of flow forming process in a tubular component made from martensitic 15 Cr- 5 Ni stainless steel, using different techniques of neutron scattering, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and hole-drilling based on electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI). Residual stress measurements were carried out in pre-formed and flow formed components at surface, near-surface and in the bulk of components using XRD, ESPI based hole-drilling and neutron diffraction techniques. These measurements were conducted at different levels of reduction in the thickness of the original part (i. e. after 20 % and 40 %), by applying identical forming parameters for all samples. The XRD results show significant change in hoop and axial residual stress levels with a reduction in the wall thickness. This is more pronounced for the axial component where the average stress switches from relatively high tensile (~ 450 MPa) in the original part to significant compressive stress (~ - 600 MPa) in the formed part, after 20 % of reduction. The bulk residual stress components measured in the middle of thickness of the parts, using neutron scattering, show a general increase in the magnitude of residual stress by higher level of deformation (i. e. reduction in the wall thickness). The measured bulk stress components through the thickness were tuned to tensile after reducing the wall thickness by 40 %. The results of XRD and neutron diffraction stress measurements suggest that the residual stress {{along the length of the}} samples (i. e. axial direction) is consistent with ± 800 MPa and ± 400 MPa after 20 % and 40 % reduction by forming process, respectively. The results of ESPI based hole-drilling show tensile hoop residual stress (≈ 600 MPa) and an abrupt fluctuation (i. e. tension-compressive-tension) in the axial residual stress near the surface of the part following flow forming. The stresses measured by ESPI based hole-drilling are complementary to the results of the XRD on surface and neutron diffraction in the bulk to reconstruct the residual stress profile form the surface through to the bulk...|$|E
40|$|As a <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> <b>process,</b> {{die casting}} is {{intrinsically}} efficient {{and improvements in}} energy efficiency are strongly dependent on design and process improvements that reduce scrap rates so that more of the total consumed energy goes into acceptable, usable castings. A casting that is distorted and fails to meet specified dimensional requirements is typically remelted but this still results in a decrease in process yield, lost productivity, and increased energy consumption. This work focuses on developing, and expanding the use of, computer modeling methods {{that can be used}} to improve the dimensional accuracy of die castings and produce die designs and machine/die setups that reduce rejection rates due to dimensional issues. A major factor contributing to the dimensional inaccuracy of the casting is the elastic deformations of the die cavity caused by the thermo mechanical loads the dies are subjected to during normal operation. Although thermal and die cavity filling simulation are widely used in the industry, structural modeling of the die, particularly for managing part distortion, is not yet widely practiced. This may be due in part to the need to have a thorough understanding of the physical phenomenon involved in die distortion and the mathematical theory employed in the numerical models to efficiently model the die distortion phenomenon. Therefore, two of the goals of this work are to assist in efforts to expand the use of structural modeling and related technologies in the die casting industry by 1) providing a detailed modeling guideline and tutorial for those interested in developing the necessary skills and capability and 2) by developing simple metaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmodels that capture the results and experience gained from several years of die distortion research and can be used to predict key distortion phenomena of relevance to a die caster with a minimum of background and without the need for simulations. These objectives were met. A detailed modeling tutorial was provided to NADCA for distribution to the industry. Power law based metaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmodels for predicting machine tie bar loading and for predicting maximum parting surface separation were successfully developed and tested against simulation results for a wide range of machines and experimental data. The models proved to be remarkably accurate, certainly well within the requirements for practical application. In addition to making die structural modeling more accessible, the work advanced the state-of-the-art by developing improved modeling of cavity pressure effects, which is typically modeled as a hydrostatic boundary condition, and performing a systematic analysis of the influence of ejector die design variables on die deflection and parting plane separation. This cavity pressure modeling objective met with less than complete success due to the limits of current finite element based fluidÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂstructureÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinteraction analysis methods, but an improved representation of the casting/die interface was accomplished using a combination of solid and shell elements in the finite element model. This approximation enabled good prediction of final part distortion verified with a comprehensive evaluation of the dimensions of test castings produced with a design experiment. An extra deliverable of the experimental work was development of high temperature mechanical properties for the A 380 die casting alloy. The ejector side design objective was met and the results were incorporated into the metamodels described above. This new technology was predicted to result in an average energy savings of 2. 03 trillion BTUÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs/year over a 10 year period.

This research focusses on grain refinement of magnesium alloy AZ 91 D, which is a widely used commercial cast alloy. Recently, Al-B based master alloys have shown potential in grain refining AZ 91 D. A comparative study of the grain refinement of AZ 91 D by addition of 0. 02 wt%B, 0. 04 wt%B, 0. 1 wt%B, 0. 5 wt%B and 1. 0 wt%B of Al- 5 B master alloy and equivalent amount of solute element aluminium is described in this paper.

The aim of this study is the assessment of the effects of processing set-up and conditions on the structure and properties of low-density polyethylene/organically modifies layered silicate (OMLS) nanocomposites obtained by a two-step process by concentrate masterbatch route. Concentrate masterbatch formulation and dilution have been investigated to correlate processing parameters with final nanocomposites structure by means of morphological and physical characterization. Even if a good dispersion/intercalation occurred regarding concentrate masterbatch, the probability of a further OMLS dispersion during the masterbatch dilution process depends remarkably on the extruder mixing capacity, with important consequences for the industrial application of masterbatch technology in <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> forming <b>processes.</b> POLYM.

Using a highly localized laser beam, metal powders are used to produce very fine grain high strength structures. Results to date show that excellent mechanical properties can be achieved in alloys such as 316 stainless steel and Inconel 625. Significant increases in yield strength have been achieved with no loss in ductility. The current approach lends itself to produce components with a dimensional accuracy of {+-} 0. 002 inches in the deposition plane and {+-} 0. 015 inches in the growth direction.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to relate the laser-engineered <b>net</b> <b>shaping</b> (LENS) <b>process</b> parameters, laser power and laser travel speed, {{to the quality of}} LENS-produced parts, strain {{measurements}} were taken at several predetermined points within seven LENS AISI 410 thin plates using the neutron diffraction method. The residual stresses at these points were then calculated using the measured strain values to ascertain how the internal stress varies {{as a function of the}} input parameters and location. It is found that the component of the stress in the vertical direction (i. e., perpendicular to the raster direction of the laser/powder nozzle) is dominant, in agreement with previous reports, and relatively insensitive to variations in process parameters. This was confirmed with numerical simulations performed with a thermomechanical model developed using the commercial program SYSWELD. The simulations also showed a good qualitative agreement with the measured simulated stresses...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Advanced Near <b>Net</b> <b>Shape</b> Technology (ANNST) project is to radically improve near <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> manufacturing methods from the current Technology/ Manufacturing Readiness Levels (TRL/MRL 3 - 4) {{to the point where}} they are viable candidates (TRL/ MRL- 6) for shortening the time and cost for insertion of new aluminum alloys and revolutionary manufacturing methods into the development/improvement of space structures. Conventional cyrotank manufacturing processes require fabrication of multiple pieces welded together to form a complete tank. A variety of near <b>net</b> <b>shape</b> manufacturing <b>processes</b> has demonstrated excellent potential for enabling single-piece construction of components such as domes, barrels, and ring frames. Utilization of such processes can dramatically reduce the extent of welding and joining needed to construct cryogenic tanks and other aerospace structures. The specific focus of this project is to successfully mature the integrally stiffened cylinder (ISC) process in which a single-piece cylinder with integral stiffeners is formed in one spin/flow forming process. Structural launch vehicle components, like cryogenic fuel tanks (e. g., space shuttle external tank), are currently fabricated via multipiece assembly of parts produced through subtractive manufacturing techniques. Stiffened structural panels are heavily machined from thick plate, which results in excessive scrap rates. Multipiece construction requires welds to assemble the structure, which increases the risk for defects and catastrophic failures...|$|R
