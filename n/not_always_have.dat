5|$|Matrices do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{all their}} {{entries in the}} same ring– or even in any ring at all. One special but common case is block matrices, which may be {{considered}} as matrices whose entries themselves are matrices. The entries need not be quadratic matrices, and thus need not be members of any ordinary ring; but their sizes must fulfil certain compatibility conditions.|$|E
5|$|These later castles did <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a keep, {{but this}} may have been because the more complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation {{to make up for the}} loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway– although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances– and one or more portcullis.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} types of coupling do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> formal or official names, which makes descriptions of the couplings in use on any railway system problematic.|$|E

50|$|Though <b>not</b> <b>always</b> in sequence, some episodes were a {{continuation}} of the motif of episodes from the past. Those episodes sometimes (but <b>not</b> <b>always)</b> <b>had</b> Roman numerals in their title to signify their sequel status.|$|R
50|$|Common {{characteristics}} of Dutch colonial architecture are they typically, but <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> Gambrel roofs with flared eaves, Dutch doors and brick chimneys {{built at the}} gable ends.|$|R
25|$|The episodes do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{the same}} design, which {{is due to}} the fact that there were several studios of {{subcontractors}} (United States, Spain and Australia). On a few episodes the actor Bernard Haller was replaced by Roger Carel.|$|E
25|$|In Taiwan most {{middle and}} upper-class people {{have access to}} the Pap test and can choose to have one done annually. On the other hand, poor people, like those in the {{southern}} US study, may <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> access to the Pap test.|$|E
25|$|A key-point of {{the game}} is that the actions of the players do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> the {{expected}} outcome. For example, an Israeli proposal for medical aid shortly after an air strike will be turned down, and will detoriate even further the relation with the Palestinians.|$|E

25|$|The regions {{overlying}} the Ogallala Aquifer {{are some}} of the most productive regions in the United States for ranching livestock, and growing corn, wheat, and soybeans. The success of large-scale farming in areas that do not have adequate precipitation and do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> perennial surface water for diversion has depended heavily on pumping groundwater for irrigation.|$|E
25|$|Recent composers take {{advantage}} of more artistic freedom {{to give to the}} morna unusual characteristics. More recent mornas hardly follow the cycle of fifths scheme, there is a great freedom in chord sequences, the musical strophes do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a rigid number of verses, in the melody the reminiscences of the lundum have practically disappeared, and some composers try fusing the morna with other musical genres.|$|E
25|$|Zakāt is a {{compulsory}} charity in Islam {{but it does}} <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to be {{in terms}} of financial means. Taiwanese Muslims from the Taipei Grand Mosque often visit foreign workers under detention in Sanxia, Yunlin and other detention centers for usually overstaying their employment visa. The Muslims help them with their paperwork and other needs. Other Taiwanese Muslims visit the elderly, ill and poor in the community.|$|E
50|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the first}} {{documentary}} mention, the village’s name <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> its current form.

25|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{include a}} use for ovate hand-axes {{as a kind of}} hunting discus to be hurled at prey. Puzzlingly, there are also examples of sites where hundreds of hand-axes, many impractically large and also apparently unused, have been found in close association together. Sites such as Melka Kunturé in Ethiopia, Olorgesailie in Kenya, Isimila in Tanzania, and Kalambo Falls in Zambia have produced evidence that suggests Acheulean hand-axes might <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> had a functional purpose.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the church's construction, West Somers was a {{thriving}} agricultural community. Burials had begun in the cemetery almost a decade earlier; most of the area's congregants attended the established Mount Zion Methodist Church some distance away. One of West Somers's more prominent residents built the church so his neighbors would <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to travel so far; it was so small that circus pioneer Hachaliah Bailey, also a Somers resident, likened it to a tiger's cage.|$|E
25|$|Selznick lent Hitchcock to {{the larger}} studios more often than {{producing}} Hitchcock's films himself. Selznick made only a few films each year, as did fellow independent producer Samuel Goldwyn, so he did <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. Hitchcock was quickly impressed with the superior resources of the American studios compared with the financial limits that he had often faced in Britain.|$|E

25|$|The work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the other great historical novel of the Napoleonic Wars, Tolstoy's War and Peace. While Tolstoy's work has a greater emphasis on the historical detail and the effect the war has upon his protagonists, Thackeray instead uses the conflict as a backdrop to the lives of his characters. The momentous events on the continent do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> an equally important influence on the behaviours of Thackeray's characters. Rather their faults tend to compound over time. This is in contrast to the redemptive power conflict has on the characters in War and Peace. For Thackeray, the Napoleonic wars as a whole {{can be thought of as}} one more of the vanities expressed in the title.|$|E
25|$|Ferguson's {{research}} {{opened the}} way for many of the achievements of the Celtic Revival, especially those of Yeats and Douglas Hyde, but this narrative of Irish poetry which leads to the Revival as culmination can also be deceptive and occlude important poetry, such as the work of James Henry (17981876), medical doctor, Virgil scholar and poet. His large body of work was completely overlooked until Christopher Ricks included him in two anthologies, and eventually edited a selection of his poetry. Various in his means, cosmopolitan in his range and possessed of an acute wit, Henry shows the negative force of nationalism in Irish criticism: his omission from standard accounts and anthologies for over 100 years can only be due to his blithe disregard of the matter of Ireland. 'Irish poetry', James's example suggests, does <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to be about Ireland.|$|E
25|$|While the UN sanctioned {{military}} intervention has been implemented on humanitarian grounds, UN agencies seeking {{to ease the}} humanitarian crisis repeatedly rejected offers {{of support from the}} military to carry out the agencies' humanitarian operations. The conditions under which such support may be accepted are outlined in the Guidelines on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets to Support United Nations Humanitarian Activities in Complex Emergencies (MCDA), whereby military support can be used but only temporarily and as a last resort. Yet, there remains the concern that aid agencies' neutrality will be brought into question by accepting military support, putting aid staff at risk of being attacked and causing some parties to prevent the agencies accessing all the areas they need to. Furthermore, the military may <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> the technical skills required to assess the need for aid and to ensure its effective distribution. Despite this, offers continue for the creation of an aid corridor and aid agencies have accepted military logistical support in the past, for instance in the 2010 Pakistan floods response.|$|E

5000|$|The genus name, Trifolium, {{derives from}} the Latin , [...] "three", and , [...] "leaf", so called from the {{characteristic}} form of the leaf, which usually but <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>has</b> three leaflets (trifoliate); hence the popular name [...] "trefoil". The species name, , is Latin for [...] "creeping".|$|R
25|$|The scallop shell symbol {{found its}} way into {{heraldry}} as a badge of those who had been on the pilgrimage to Compostela, although later it became a symbol of pilgrimage in general. Winston Churchill and Diana, Princess of Wales' family, the Spencer family coat of arms includes a scallop, as well as both of Diana's sons Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry's personal coats of arms; also Pope Benedict XVI's personal coat of arms includes a scallop; another example is the surname Wilmot and also John Wesley's (which as a result the scallop shell is used as an emblem of Methodism). However, charges in heraldry do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> an unvarying symbolic meaning, and there are cases of arms in which no family member went on a pilgrimage and the occurrence of the scallop is simply a pun on the name of the armiger (as in the case of Jacques Coeur), or for other reasons. In 1988, the State of New York in the US chose the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians) as its state shell.|$|E
25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|E
500|$|Oil shale {{belongs to}} the group of {{sapropel}} fuels. [...] It does not have a definite geological definition nor a specific chemical formula, and its seams do <b>not</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> discrete boundaries. Oil shales vary considerably in their mineral content, chemical composition, age, type of kerogen, and depositional history and not all oil shales would necessarily be classified as shales in the strict sense. [...] Their common feature is low solubility in low-boiling organic solvents and generation of liquid organic products on thermal decomposition.|$|E
