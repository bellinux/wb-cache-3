25|$|Meier {{provides}} several {{arguments for}} believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when {{pointing to a}} person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There {{is nothing in the}} sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I <b>need</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go to the store and you to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), look different from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.|$|E

He also quotes the theme song from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, while proclaiming to be [...] "on his Brad Pitt". MTV News' James Montgomery wrote that [...] "there's certainly no shortage of Kanye's patented swagger, and the new remix also adds some clubby wallop to the laid-back track." [...] Henna Kathiya of MTV Rapfix remarked that West adds [...] "some classic Ye flavor" [...] to the original song. On December 4, a new remix leaked online.

500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I <b>need</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> tell me this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing {{the first and second}} verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And now every time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} generally positive reviews. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday {{described it}} as a barrage of artistic images that continued the song's theme of combining art with pop culture. Erin Coulehan of Rolling Stone magazine noted that the video was in [...] "typical Gaga fashion", further calling it a spectacle of flashing lights, vivid colors and intricate choreography. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly also echoed Coulehan's statements about the video being in Gaga fashion, adding that it [...] "makes the song sound infinitely better... It doesn't quite hit the high notes of 'Paparazzi' or 'Bad Romance', but it's definitely a step up from the middling clips from the Born This Way era." [...] A writer of Billboard described the video as [...] "a collection of arty postures and scenarios" [...] and compared the black-glove bra look to Janet Jackson's 1993 Rolling Stone magazine cover. Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times saw the video as [...] "basically like 20 different Vogue shoots documented and spliced. There is no plot other than the basic lyrical premise, [...] "I <b>need</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> pay more attention to me," [...] given heft by a syllabically rocky first-person observation about pop culture, fame and art that Andy Warhol noted 50 years ago." [...] Chiderah Monde of New York Daily News described the video as [...] "a straight-forward profile of the artist herself." ...|$|E
