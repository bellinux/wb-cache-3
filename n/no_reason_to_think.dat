5|$|Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is {{visited by}} Mindy O’Dell (Jamie Ray Newman), who {{tells him to}} {{investigate}} Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) death. Mac (Tina Majorino) is called in for tech support when an animal research lab is raided and a valuable monkey is stolen, and Mac asks Veronica for help. The researchers believe that a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, but there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle of scotch unopened. At the next PHAT meeting, Veronica is asked to take action for animal rights in any way she sees fit. Keith presents the bottle of scotch as evidence of a murder of Dean O’Dell. Back at the lab, Veronica notices a coworker being mean to the monkey researchers. After a slight hazing ritual, Veronica and Mac are accepted into the group. In order to impress {{the leader of the}} group, Veronica, Mac, and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) participate in a party.|$|E
25|$|While {{the murderer}} of Patrick's {{assistant}} {{was killed and}} immediately sent to heaven because he was forgiven by Patrick, future murderers were to be pardoned as Patrick would not be around to assure their forgiveness and ascent to heaven. There is, however, <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the events described actually occurred although they do provide insight into how the Brehons thought about their own law.|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} {{technological}} advances, {{the government has}} received the ability to invade privacy in more subtle ways; further, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that the rate of}} such technological advances will slow down. “Can it be that the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security?”, Brandeis asks. He answers that a clear negative answer is evident in Boyd v. United States.|$|E
25|$|The Greek text of this codex is a {{representative}} of the Byzantine text-type. The non-Byzantine readings are confirmed by Codex Monacensis and minuscule 1071, though there is <b>no</b> real <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they are related.|$|R
40|$|Richard Heck has {{recently}} drawn {{attention on a}} new version of the Liar Paradox, one which relies on logical resources that are so weak as to suggest that it may not admit of any “truly satisfying, consistent solution”. I argue that this conclusion is too strong. Heck's Liar reduces to absurdity principles that are already rejected by consistent paracomplete theories of truth, such as Kripke's and Field's. Moreover, the new Liar gives us <b>no</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that (versions of) these principles cannot be consistently retained once the structural rule of contraction is restricted. I suggest that revisionary logicians have independent reasons for restricting such a rule...|$|R
30|$|On balance, {{we found}} mild {{evidence}} of over-investment in electricity capacity in Europe and {{little evidence of}} under-investment. From these results, there was <b>no</b> particular <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that diverting investment towards electricity generation would contribute relatively more to productivity growth than investment in other assets.|$|R
25|$|Captain Turner gave {{evidence}} in Britain and now gave a more spirited defence of his actions. He argued that {{up until the}} time of the sinking he had <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that zig-zagging in a fast ship would help. Indeed, that he had since commanded another ship which was sunk while zig-zagging. His position was supported by evidence from other captains, who said that prior to the sinking of the Lusitania no merchant ships zig-zagged. Turner had argued that maintaining a steady course for 30minutes was necessary to take a four-point bearing and precisely confirm the ship's position, but on this point he received less support, with other captains arguing a two-point bearing could have been taken in five minutes and would have been sufficiently accurate.|$|E
25|$|In 1324, Odoric of Pordenone, a Franciscan missionary from Friuli, Italy, is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan, which is generally regarded as the first mass in the Philippines, by some 197 years. However, historian William Henry Scott concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that he celebrated mass.|$|E
500|$|The medieval {{churches of}} St Nicholas, Blakeney and St Margaret's, Cley, and the now ruined Blakeney friary, {{were not the}} first {{religious}} buildings in the area. An early church was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book at Esnuterle ("Snitterley" [...] was a former name for Blakeney, the current name first appearing in 1340), but the 11th-century church's location is unknown, and there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that {{it is on the}} site of the 'chapel'.|$|E
50|$|One counter-argument, {{advanced}} by philosopher Eric Reitan, is that belief in God {{is different from}} belief in a teapot because teapots are physical and therefore in principle verifiable, and that given {{what we know about}} the physical world we have <b>no</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that belief in Russell's teapot is justified and at least some <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it not.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{concerning the}} influence of siblings on the sex-role attitudes of adolescents is characterized by chaos {{and a lack of}} concensus. As a result, it is still unclear whether an influence is exercised by the sibling constellation and if so, what form this influence takes. The goal {{of this article is to}} find an answer to these questions. Data concerning 270 eleventh and twelfth grade students (fifth and sixth year of secondary school) from an academically oriented school in Ghent (Belgium) are analysed. The influence of four variables is studied: family size, order of birth, sex of the sibling(s) and sibling spacing. The conclusion is that there are <b>no</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the sibling constellation is an important factor in the development of the sex-role attitudes of adolescents...|$|R

500|$|Khrushchev had <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> himself {{immune from}} the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, {{according}} to Khrushchev, [...] "blanched" [...] (for his protégé's sins could affect his own standing) and {{advised him to}} tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post. Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking {{him in the eye}} and awaiting his response. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an enemy of the people then and there. Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the growing}} tension, Haynes {{remained}} a member and Betts returned. Their third post-reunion record, Where It All Begins (1994), was recorded entirely live. [...] "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year thing. There {{was no indication}} that it was capable of staying together for years to come. We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, and there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> otherwise," [...] said Haynes. The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech. Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup. [...] "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] I’m sitting there thinking, 'This is it. This is how it finally ends,'" [...] said Trucks. Haynes and Woody left to focus on Gov't Mule, feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.|$|E
2500|$|That {{suggestion}} prodded Streisand {{to think}} seriously about a singing career, {{in addition to}} acting. She asked her boyfriend, Barry Dennen, to tape her singing, copies of which she could then give out to possible employers. Dennen had acted with her briefly in an off-Broadway play, but had <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> she had any talent as a singer, and she never mentioned it. Nevertheless, he agreed and found a guitarist to accompany her: ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{achieving}} this goal presents a significant {{challenge for the}} design, manufacturing, and characterization of ultra-precise new physical mechanisms for computing, there is at present <b>no</b> fundamental <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that this goal cannot eventually be accomplished, allowing us to someday build computers that generate much less than 1 bit's worth of physical entropy (and dissipate much less than kT ln 2 energy to heat) for each useful logical operation that they carry out internally.|$|R
40|$|The {{publication}} {{presents the}} results of the research project “Religious Denominations in Vienna & Austria: Baseline study for 2016 – Scenarios until 2046 ” conducted by the Vienna Institute of Demography of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The aim of this study project was twofold: Firstly, to estimate the religious composition of the population of Austria and Vienna in 2016 taking into account the most recent migration movements; and secondly, to project the population of Austria and Vienna from 2016 to 2046 based on several scenarios related mostly to the three major forces affecting religious composition, migration (including asylum-seekers), differential fertility, and religious conversion. While the projections demonstrate some of the possible futures that Austria and its capital city could experience in the coming decades, and those are all quite dissimilar, they also show that religious diversity is bound to increase, and there are <b>no</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that any of the trends that have been in place already for several decades in the country will stop and that the country would move back to the situation of the early 1970 s...|$|R
40|$|There is <b>no</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that BSM-CP-odd phases(s) will {{necessarily}} cause large deviations in B-physics from {{predictions of the}} SM. Therefore, residual theory error in extraction of the unitarity triangle can undermine experimental efforts to search for BSM phase(s). We stress that final states containing D 0 or D 0 -bar in decays of charged and neutral B's can yield all the angles of the unitarity triangle with negligble theory error (i. e. O(0. 1 %)) ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the face}} of laws restricting public {{assembly}} and freedom of the media, restricting campaigning by the MDC for the 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, President Mbeki was quoted as saying: I have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that anything will happen … that anybody in Zimbabwe will act {{in a way that}} will militate against the elections being free and fair. [...] As far as I know, things like an independent electoral commission, access to the public media, the absence of violence and intimidation … those matters have been addressed.|$|E
2500|$|But {{the late}} Supreme Court Chief Justice, William H. Rehnquist had a {{somewhat}} different view. [...] He {{had this to say}} in his 1998 book All the Laws But One – Civil Liberties in Wartime, p.124: [...] "An entirely separate and important philosophical question is whether occasional presidential excesses and judicial restraint in wartime are desirable or undesirable. In one sense, this question is very largely academic. There is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that future wartime presidents will act differently from Lincoln, Wilson, or Roosevelt, or that future Justices of the Supreme Court will decide questions differently than their predecessors." ...|$|E
50|$|Unger concludes his {{examination}} {{of law and}} modernity by looking at two varieties of the modern state—the traditionalist state and the revolutionary socialist—then considering two possibilities {{for the development of}} law in the future. Seeing similar tensions within traditionalist and revolutionary socialist societies, Unger points out that the liberal state is only a special case of modernity. He concludes that there's <b>no</b> more <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that societies will converge toward similarity rather than grow in their differences.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{through a}} {{critical}} examination of Wray’s {{version of the}} argument from underconsideration against scientific realism, I articulate a modest version of scientific realism. This modest realist position, which I call “relative realism, ” preserves the scientific realist’s optimism about science’s ability {{to get closer to}} the truth while, at the same time, taking on board the antirealist’s premise that theory evaluation is comparative, and thus that there are <b>no</b> good <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that science’s best theories are close to the truth...|$|R
40|$|Nick Trakakis and Yujin Nagasawa (2004) criticise the {{argument}} in Almeida and Oppy (2003). According to Trakakis and Nagasawa, we are mistaken in our claim that the sceptical theist response to evidential arguments from evil is unacceptable because it would undermine ordinary moral reasoning. In their view, there is <b>no</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that sceptical theism leads to an objectionable form of moral scepticism. We disagree. In this paper, we explain why we think that {{the argument}} of Nagasawa and Trakakis fails to overthrow our objection to sceptical theism...|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference in}} Latin literature to a marriage between males {{occurs in the}} Philippics of Cicero, who insulted Mark Antony for being a slut in his youth until Curio [...] "established you in a fixed and stable marriage (matrimonium), {{as if he had}} given you a stola", the traditional garment of a married woman. Although Cicero's sexual implications are clear, the point of the passage is to cast Antony in the submissive role in the relationship and to impugn his manhood in various ways; there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that actual marriage rites were performed.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 September, Reina {{declared}} that his Liverpool career was over: [...] "At the moment it's difficult {{to think about}} being a Liverpool player next year. They have a young goalkeeper in Simon Mignolet and the manager prefers him to me. That's the reason why I'm here {{and he will be}} at the club next year as well. There's <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I'll be a Liverpool player from now on but we'll see where the future takes us. It's been a good move so far and I don't regret what happened.

40|$|Many {{people find}} {{the notion of}} {{blending}} humans and nonhumans together to create animals whose brains are composed entirely of human brain cells disturbing. I argue that these moral qualms lack adequate justification. I consider a number of <b>reasons</b> for objecting <b>to</b> the creation of such chimeras and argue {{that none of these}} reasons withstand scrutiny.

40|$|Dogmatists and phenomenal conservatives {{think that}} if it {{perceptually}} seems to you that p, then you thereby have some prima facie justification for believing that p. Increasingly, writers about these views have argued that perceptual seemings are composed of two other states: a sensation followed by a seeming. In this article we critically examine this movement. First we argue that there are <b>no</b> compelling <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of perceptual seemings as so composed. Second we argue {{that even if they}} were so composed, this underlying disunity in metaphysical or psychological structure would fall below the threshold of epistemic significanc...|$|R
40|$|If Locke is right, when I {{visually}} {{experience a}} cubical thing and judge rightly {{that it is}} in fact a cube, then there is a mind-independent thing out there the shape of which in some important way resembles my experience of its shape. If Kant is right, in contrast, we have <b>no</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that things in themselves are cubical; there's nothing independent of the human mind that has cubical properties that resemble the properties of my visual experience of cubes. I believe we can start {{to get a handle on}} this dispute empirically through introspection. Suppose that there are multiple different ways of veridically experiencing the same object and that it can sometimes be the case that there's <b>no</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that one of two different experiences more closely resembles things as they are in themselves. It would then seem to follow that there's a kind of looseness between features of experience and features of things in themselves. Things in themselves might be more like this or they might be more like that or somewhere in between; but we can no longer say that we know they are like this [...] a miniature Kantian victory over Locke. And then the question would be: How far can we push this type of argument? In this paper, I consider two test cases: convex passenger-side car mirrors and inverting lenses of the sort invented by George Stratton...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the Symposium is, like all of Plato’s dialogues, fiction.

[...] There is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they were not composed entirely by Plato.

2500|$|In writing such a broad phrase such as [...] "cruel and unusual", it is {{considered}} implausible by some that the framers intended for its very specific meaning {{at that time to}} be permanently controlling. The purpose of phrases such as [...] "cruel and unusual," [...] rather, is specifically not to specify which punishments are forbidden, but to create a flexible test that can be applied over future centuries. Stated alternatively, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the framers have a privileged position in making this determination of what is cruel and unusual; while their ban on cruel punishment is binding on us, their understanding of the scope of the concept [...] "cruel" [...] need not be.|$|E
60|$|In {{the same}} manner as in {{grafting}} trees, the capacity of one species or variety to take on another, is incidental on generally unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another, is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. There is <b>no</b> more <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature, than <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests.|$|R
500|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known whether}} the medial pallium plays a similar role in even more {{primitive}} vertebrates, such as sharks and rays, or even lampreys and hagfish. [...] Some types of insects, and molluscs such as the octopus, also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities, but these appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, so there is as yet <b>no</b> good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that they have a}} common evolutionary origin; nor is there sufficient similarity in brain structure to enable anything resembling a [...] "hippocampus" [...] to be identified in these species. Some have proposed, however, that the insect's mushroom bodies may have a function {{similar to that of the}} hippocampus.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the troubled}} period {{it was written}} in, and because of Burnell's later {{political}} career, some scholars have looked for political themes in the play. It {{has been suggested that}} Landgartha symbolises the old Anglo-Irish class to which Burnell belonged, and that Reyner represents the New English aristocracy who, by denying the Anglo-Irish their full share in public life, abandoned them. A more elaborate parallel suggests that Reyner represents King Charles I of England and that the plot reflects the political turbulence which led to the English Civil War. There is however <b>no</b> strong <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Burnell intended his play to be seen as anything more than a good story.|$|R
