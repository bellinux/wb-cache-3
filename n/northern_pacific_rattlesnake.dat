40|$|The strong size {{discrepancy}} between adults and neonates within {{many species of}} ectotherms results in drastically different rates of heating and cooling. For squamate reptiles, this may have important consequences for how individuals regulate their body temperature in nature. We hypothesized that since neonate snakes can heat and cool faster than adult snakes they would have more variation in body temperatures and may therefore show different thermal preferences than adult snakes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated thermal preferences of neonate and adult <b>Northern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rattlesnakes</b> in a laboratory thermal gradient at temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 35 °C. Hide boxes were placed (at intervals of 5 °C) throughout the gradient to offer snakes refugia at a range of temperatures. Snake body temperatures were recorded throughout the day using an infrared thermometer and behaviors associated with recorded body temperatures were also recorded. Neonate snakes had {{a broader range of}} body temperatures than did adults and were also active more often than adult snakes, using a wider range of locations throughout the gradient. These differences suggest that the thermal biology of neonate rattlesnakes differs from that of adults, which appears to translate into differences in behavior and microhabitat use. The ecological implications for these differences are important for each age class, as they may result in differences in activity patters, movements, and habitat use. Field studies to corroborate these findings are currently underway...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the reproductive cycle of <b>Northern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus oreganus) by quantifying steroid hormone concentrations and observing reproductive behaviors in free-ranging individuals. Additionally, we examined reproductive tissues from museum specimens. Plasma steroid hormone concentrations were quantified for {{both male and}} female snakes throughout the active season (March–October). We measured testosterone (T), 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and corticosterone (B) concentrations in both sexes and 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and progesterone (P) in females only. We observed reproductive behaviors (e. g., consortship, courtship, and copulation) in the field and measured testis and follicle size in male and female snakes from museum collections to relate steroid hormone concentrations to the timing of reproductive events. Our study revealed that C. oreganus in central California exhibits a bimodal pattern of breeding, with most mating behavior occurring in the spring and some incidences of mating behavior observed in late summer/fall. Each breeding period corresponded with elevated androgen (T or DHT) levels in males. Testes were regressed in the spring when the majority of reproductive behavior was observed in this population, and they reached peak volume in August and September during spermatogenesis. Although we did not detect seasonal variation in female hormone concentrations, some females had high E 2 in the spring and fall, coincident with mating and with increased follicle size (indicating vitellogenesis) in museum specimens. Females with high E 2 concentrations also had high T and DHT concentrations. Corticosterone concentrations in males and females were not related either to time of year or to concentrations of any other hormones quantified. Progesterone concentrations in females also did not vary seasonally, but this likely reflected sampling bias as females tended to be underground, and thus unobtainable, in summer months when P would be expected to be elevated during gestation. In females, P was positively correlated with T and DHT, and E 2 was positively correlated with T...|$|R
40|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{of birds}} and mammals {{plays a crucial role}} in spatial memory and navigation. The hippocampus exhibits plasticity in adulthood in response to diverse environmental factors associated with spatial demands placed on an animal. The medial and dorsal cortices of the telencephalon of squamate reptiles have been implicated as functional homologues to the hippocampus. This study sought to experimentally manipulate the navigational demands placed on free-ranging <b>northern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus o. oreganus) to provide direct evidence of the relationship between spatial demands and neuroplasticity in the cortical telencephalon of the squamate brain. Adult male rattlesnakes were radio-tracked for 2 months, during which time 1 of 3 treatments was imposed weekly, namely 225 -meter translocation in a random direction, 225 -meter walk and release at that day’s capture site (handling control) or undisturbed (control). Snakes were then sacrificed and the brains were removed and processed for histological analysis of cortical features. The activity range was larger in the translocated (Tr) group compared to the handled (Hd) and undisturbed control (Cn) groups when measured via 95 % minimum convex polygon (MCP). At the 100 % MCP level, Tr snakes had larger activity ranges than the Cn snakes only. The volume of the medial cortex (MC) was larger in the Tr group compared to the Cn group. The MC of Hd snakes was not significantly different from that of either of the other groups. No differences in dorsal cortex (DC) or lateral cortex volumes were detected among the groups. Numbers of 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) -labeled cells in the MC and DC 3 weeks after BrdU injection were not affected by treatment.

40|$|Stress is a {{physiological}} state induced by disturbance or {{adverse environmental conditions}} and is modulated by the glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone (CORT) in reptiles. Stressors can have various impacts on vertebrate trait expression and may affect survival or reproduction. Little {{is known about the}} effects of chronically elevated CORT in free-ranging reptiles, or the effect of disturbance stress on venom composition in captive snakes. In chapter 1, we investigated the effects of researcher induced disturbance on CORT levels and venom composition in a group of captive <b>Northern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus oreganus). Venom protein concentration and plasma CORT levels were compared before and after two weeks of unpredictable bouts of cage vibration, and to a non-vibrated control group. CORT levels were also assessed one week into vibration treatment. We found no effect of vibration treatment on CORT levels or on venom composition, and within-snake relative protein abundance was highly repeatable, although some variation was observed. We found a strong correlation between changes in relative abundance of several proteins and CORT. These results led us to believe that while differential forms of researcher-induced disturbance may not affect venom composition, significant changes in baseline CORT, or chronic stress, may affect the venom phenotype. In the next study, we investigated the effects of chronically elevated CORT in a wild population of radio-telemetered Southern <b>Pacific</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (C. helleri). Snakes were implanted intra-coelomically with either crystalline CORT or sham implants. Prior to implant and for two week periods thereafter, we sampled blood, venom, defensive behavior, and body temperature (Tb). Thermal data logger implants recorded snake Tb each hour. Snakes were tracked daily for one month, and detectability, defensive behavior, movement, home range size and thermal parameters were calculated for each group during the periods between samples. Stress reactivity was assessed as change in CORT from baseline after one hour of acute confinement stress. CORT implants led to elevated baseline CORT for at least two weeks in treatment snakes, showing that our treatment was successful. Chapter 2 describes the effects of CORT treatment on venom parameters. Increased baseline CORT was associated with increased activity of venom protein phospholipase A 2, indicating that CORT may have direct effects on regulating venom protein activity. Overall, venom activity was repeatable within individual snakes. Chapter 3 describes the effect of CORT on behavioral, ecological, and physiological variables. Implant treatment led to decreased average Tb in weeks two and three. We detected a trend for lower baseline CORT to predict a greater magnitude of acute stress response. Snakes with higher testosterone levels exhibited higher defensive behavior scores. Overall, there were no other effects of implant treatment. Our results suggest that rattlesnake thermoregulation is impacted by chronic stress, which could affect other aspects of their metabolism and ecology. Results of both studies suggest baseline CORT may direct both the activity and relative abundance of venom proteins in different manners, a hypothesis which deserves further investigation using proteomic tools. When responding to an acute stressor, rattlesnakes may secrete CORT until a threshold response is reached, regardless of baseline levels. Overall, rattlesnakes appear resilient to the effects of researcher-induced disturbance in the laboratory and to two weeks of chronically elevated CORT in the field, as no change was detected in many of the parameters investigated...|$|R
40|$|Hydration is a {{critical}} element for many physiological processes in vertebrates, such as protein production, innate immunity, and behavioral processes such as daily activity and thermoregulation. Few studies have directly assessed the effect of hydration on these animals in nature. While it seems intuitive that drought is stressful to animals, studies examining drought are typically observational and fail to assess how the hydration state of these animals influences their physiology and behavior. We tested for an effect of hydration on several physiological and behavioral parameters in <b>Northern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Crotalus oreganus oreganus) by experimentally manipulating hydration levels in the field. Two treatment groups were created: one of these received supplemental hydration twice a month from May to September (hydrated) while the other did not (control). Pregnant females {{were brought to the}} lab before parturition to collect data on litter characteristics. We radio-tracked snakes to examine any effects on movement, measured SVL and mass of each snake throughout the study for assessment of body condition, and collected blood samples for stress hormone physiology. Finally, we used intra-coelomic temperature data loggers to track body temperature data for each individual snake every two hours. Our results suggest that supplemental water and thus hydration has a significant effect on reproduction as all four hydrated females gave birth to a litter, while no control females gave birth. We saw no effect on movement parameters; however, males had larger home ranges and moved a larger total distance than females, regardless of hydration status. Interestingly, body condition was significantly higher in hydrated snakes, suggesting that hydrated individuals were acquiring more food than control snakes. We saw no effect on stress hormone physiology. There was no influence of hydration on any behavioral parameters such as time spent above or below ground, or time spent in a particular body position. Finally, there was a significant interaction of treatment group and sex on seasonal body temperature. Hydrated females had higher mean body temperatures than all other treatment group and sex combinations. However, all hydrated females were also pregnant, which confounds this result. Similar results were seen when body temperature was analyzed by time of day. Females overall had higher body temperature than males. These results suggest that hydration may have a profound influence on reproduction and has the potential to affect body condition and thermoregulation. The lack of an effect on movement and stress physiology should not be overlooked, however. This study is the first to experimentally manipulate hydration in free-ranging rattlesnakes {{and one of the few}} to manipulate hydration in vertebrates. More studies are needed to support a pivotal role of hydration in physiology and behavior of reptiles and we encourage the use of experimental field manipulations to answer these questions...|$|R

Adult male rattlesnakes were radio-tracked for two months, during which one of three treatments was imposed weekly: 225 meter translocation in a random direction, 225 meter walk and release at that day’s capture site (handling control), and undisturbed control. Snakes were then sacrificed and brains were removed and processed for histological analysis of cortical features. The volume of the medial cortex was significantly larger in the translocated group compared to undisturbed controls. No differences in dorsal or lateral cortical volume were detected among the groups. Numbers of 5 -Bromo- 2 ’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) -labeled cells in the medial and dorsal cortices three weeks after BrdU injection were not affected by treatment. The activity range was larger in the translocated group compared to handled and undisturbed controls. A causal relationship between increased navigation in a free-ranging reptile and changes in brain morphology was established. The use of translocation as a conservation strategy for reptiles is a controversial topic revisited many times. Previous studies have demonstrated the aberrant movement patterns and mortality caused by translocation and have established that short-distance translocation within an animal’s home range is best for the animal. In conjunction with the neuroplasticity study, we examined the physiological impacts that repeated short-distance translocation and handling have on reptiles. This is essential knowledge if the efficacy of the technique is to be properly evaluated. Baseline and stressed concentrations of corticosterone and testosterone were assayed in blood taken immediately upon capture and following one hour of confinement in a bucket. Neither baseline nor stressed concentrations of either hormone were impacted by translocation or handling. Body condition and change in mass were not affected. Translocated animals had larger MCP activity ranges than handled and undisturbed animals at the 95 %, but not 100 % levels, while an interaction between time and treatment impacted other movement parameters. Treatment had no effect on a number of behaviors observed during visits to each animal. We suggest that rattlesnakes are quite resistant to potential impacts on their physiology and behavior enacted by frequent short-distance translocation or handling. Additionally, studies that require frequent handling of reptilian subjects are not likely to severely alter stress physiology...|$|R

Northern Pacific Rattlesnakes are both {{important}} predators to many small vertebrates and prey to many carnivores, which make them of particular interest in conservation biology. I used temperature-sensing radio-transmitters and i-button data logger implants to monitor body temperatures of four individual rattlesnakes over the course of 11 months, from June 2012 to April 2013. I also recorded air temperatures and relative humidity using portable data loggers over the same period. Rattlesnakes actively thermoregulated at times during the day. At other times, they passively accepted environmental temperatures, especially during the winter. Rattlesnakes showed a body temperature of about 22 °C during the day for the summer months, which at times was 13 °C less than the ground temperature, as well as a minimum temperature of about 8 °C during overwintering in their hibernacula. Other times their body temperatures were within 1 °C of the ground temperature. My results suggest that rattlesnakes show changes in habitats and thermal environments over the year.

To investigate whether or not Northern Pacific Rattlesnakes choose habitats at random, we implanted radio transmitters into seven rattlesnakes at the beginning of June 2012 and tracked them through their habitats over the course of a year. Four individuals were tracked in the shrub-steppe outside of Ellensburg, WA, and the remaining three were tracked in the shrub-steppe and dry coniferous forest of the Methow valley in northern Washington.

In this study, I used radio-telemetry and mark-recapture methods to investigate the {{indirect effects}} of human disturbance and habitat development on the body characteristics, behaviour, and spatial ecology of a population of rattlesnakes (a threatened species) in Osoyoos, British Columbia. I collected data in 2010 and 2011 to augment a data set spanning 2002 to 2012. Individuals in highly disturbed landscapes had lower body condition than snakes in other areas, and lost body weight over the foraging season. Strong trends in spatial ecology parameters across disturbance gradients were not apparent, although snakes in disturbed sites tended to have smaller core areas, shorter range lengths, and took a greater number of days to travel a given distance than snakes in less-disturbed habitat. No major differences were observed in snake behaviour, exposure risk, or other spatial ecology parameters among habitats under different disturbance pressures.

Plasma steroid hormone concentrations were quantified for both male and female snakes throughout the active season (Mar-Oct). We measured testosterone (T), 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and corticosterone (B) concentrations in male and female snakes. 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and progesterone (P) were measured in females only. We also observed breeding behaviors (e. g. consortship, courtship, and copulation) in the field and measured testis and follicle size in male and female snakes from museum collections. Our results indicate that C. oreganus in central California utilizes a bimodal pattern of breeding, with mating and agonistic behavior occurring in the spring and the late summer/fall. Each breeding season corresponds with elevated or highly variable androgen (T and DHT) levels. Several female snakes had high E 2 concentrations in the spring and fall, coincident with vitellogenesis and mating. Females with high E 2 concentrations also had high T and DHT concentrations. Corticosterone concentrations in males are not related to either time of year or concentrations of any other hormones quantified. This suggests that the breeding season in this population may not demand a significant increase in energy mobilization by glucocorticoids. Measurements of testis volume show that testes are regressed in the spring when the majority of breeding was observed in this population and reach peak volume in August and September during spermatogenesis. Multiple regression analyses revealed that in female snakes, P is positively correlated with T and DHT, and E 2 is correlated with T.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 44). The recent renaissance in {{the development}} of multilocus coalescent-based species tree inference methods has transformed the study of systematics; however, coalescent-based methods require a priori knowledge of species limits. A variety of methods of multilocus species delimitation are now available which provide potentially objective approaches to assign individuals to putative species; however, these methods may require knowledge of the species tree. This dichotomy illustrates the necessity of studying species delimitation and species tree inference in concert. Here I demonstrate a method of simultaneous multilocus coalescent-based species delimitation and species tree inference that does not require prior assumption of species limits or the species tree. This method uses the Bayes factor to compare the fit of competing hypotheses of species delimitation to the data, and can be used to compare non-nested hypotheses. The multilocus Bayesian species tree is inferred under each competing hypothesis while the fit of the hypothesis to the data is quantified using marginal likelihood estimation. Marginal likelihood scores (as estimated using path sampling, stepping stone, and the smoothed harmonic mean estimator) are then compared using the Bayes factor. Here I apply this method to the Western Rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) species complex, a group for which the species limits are contentious and the species tree is unknown. I collected DNA sequence data for six loci (five nuclear introns and one mitochondrial coding gene) and 63 ingroup individuals. Hypotheses of species limits were generated using (1) historical subspecific designations and (2) clades on a guide mitochondrial gene tree that were iteratively clustered into increasingly inclusive groupings. For each hypothesis, the species tree and marginal likelihood were estimated (under three competing marginal likelihood estimators) using *BEAST. Resulting marginal likelihood scores were compared to one another using the Bayes factor. BPP was also used to delimit species within the C. viridis complex for comparison. Contrary to currently recognized taxonomy, I recovered very strong support using both the Bayes factor method and BPP that the C. viridis complex contains six independently evolving species, including cryptic species within the <b>Northern</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Rattlesnake</b> (currently C. o. oreganus). I applied this resulting taxonomy to infer the first dated multilocus species tree of the C. viridis complex, which is topologically discordant from the mitochondrial gene tree. This study successfully demonstrated a novel method of Bayesian multilocus species delimitation. The results presented here warrant revision of the taxonomy within the C. viridis complex and dramatically revise our understanding of the evolutionary history of this group...|$|E
