In this study we seek to understand the mechanism of the distributed heat on the curve surface {{with the goal of}} identifying preferred methods to predicting jet performance. The goals that have been achieved in the numerical results displayed are determine the influence of impingement jet characteristics on thermal and flow field on a curve surface, determine the variation of <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> (NuD) along the curve surface {{in order to understand the}} heat transfer characteristics and study the effect of position (in the center, in the mid and in the end) and angle (α= 90 °, 60 ° and 30 °) of jet impingement on curve surface, different Reynolds numbers (ReD) in range of (5000, 6000, 7000, 8000 and 9000). The program, which was extracted results it is (GAMBIT 2. 4. 6) and (FLUENT 6. 3), simulation is (2 -D) in submerged jet flow and the continuity, momentum and energy equations were solved by means of a finite volume method (FVM). This study covers the effect of different Reynolds numbers (ReD) on average <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> (Nuavg) and local <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> (NuD). From the result, the average <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> (Nuavg) increased with the increase of Reynolds numbers (ReD) for all cases, in comparison between different positions (center, mid and end), of nozzle on curve surface at angle (α= 90 °) the maximum value of average <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> (Nuavg= 388. 3) is found when the nozzle locate in the end followed by the mid position and smallest value of average <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> (Nuavg= 182. 25) in the center of curve surface.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{have been reported}} on steady-state natural convection from the outer surfaces of horizontal ducts with triangular cross sections in air. Two different horizontal positions are considered; in the first position, the vertex of the triangle faces up, while in the other position, the vertex faces down. Five equilateral triangular cross-section ducts have been used with cross-section side length of 0. 044, 0. 06, 0. 08, 0. 10, and 0. 13 m. The ducts are heated using internal constant-heat-flux heating elements. The temperatures along the surface and peripheral directions of the duct wall are measured. Longitudinal (perimeter-averaged) heat transfer coefficients {{along the side of}} each duct are obtained for natural convection heat transfer. Total overall averaged heat transfer coefficients are also obtained. Longitudinal (perimeter-averaged) <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> and the modified Rayleigh numbers are evaluated and correlated using different characteristic lengths. Furthermore, total overall averaged <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> are correlated with the modified Rayleigh numbers. Moreover, a dimensionless temperature group was developed and correlated with the modified Rayleigh number. For the upward-facing case, laminar and transition regimes are obtained and characterized. However, for the downward-facing vertex case, only the transition regime is observed. The local (perimeter-averaged) or the overall total <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> increase as the modified Rayleigh numbers increase in the transition regime.

40|$|Calculation of {{the blade}} tip {{clearances}} of the high-pressure-compressor rotors in aeroengines involves calculating the radial growth of the corotating compressor discs. This requires the calculation of the thermal growth of the discs, which in turn requires {{a knowledge of the}} disc temperatures and <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> for the buoyancy-induced flow in the cavity between the discs. This is a strongly conjugate problem in which the equations for the fluid flow and the disc temperature are coupled. In this thesis, the buoyancy-induced flow and heat transfer inside the compressor rotors is modelled assuming laminar Ekman-layer flow on the discs and compressible flow in the fluid core between the Ekman layers; conduction in the discs is modelled using a one-dimensional fin equation. The theoretical predictions are compared with <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> and temperatures obtained from two independent sets of temperature measurements, obtained on a multi-cavity compressor rig, and the ‘experimental’ <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> were calculated using a Bayesian model for the inverse solution of the fin equation. For most of the experimental cases, with Grashof numbers up to 1012, mainly good agreement was achieved between the theoretical predictions and experimental values of the disc temperatures and <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers.</b> As predicted by the model, increasing the rotational Reynolds number can, under certain conditions, cause a decrease in the <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers.</b> Importantly, the results suggest that laminar Ekman-layer flow could occur even at the high Grashof numbers found in the compressor rotors of aeroengines. An extension of the buoyancy model included empirical correlations for the <b>Nusselt</b> <b>numbers</b> for the compressor shroud and disc cobs. This extended model was used to predict the temperature rise of the axial throughflow of cooling air in the compressor rotor, and reasonable agreement was achieved between the predicted and measured throughflow temperatures. This is the first time a theoretical model (rather than CFD) has been used to predict the temperatures of a compressor disc and the axial throughflow, and the model takes only seconds to predict the temperatures that would take days or even weeks to predict using CFD. Some suggestions are made for future research to improve the extent and accuracy of the model...|$|R
