5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and <b>near-infrared</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E

This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse <b>near-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument.

5|$|The upper {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{can be measured}} from Earth when the planet crosses the sun in a rare event known as a solar transit. The last solar transit of Venus occurred in 2012. Using quantitative astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were able to analyse sunlight that passed through the planet's atmosphere to reveal chemicals within it. As the technique to analyse light to discover information about a planet's atmosphere only first showed results in 2001, {{this was the first}} opportunity to gain conclusive results in this way on the atmosphere of Venus since observation of solar transits began. This solar transit was a rare opportunity considering the lack of information on the atmosphere between 65 and 85km. The solar transit in 2004 enabled astronomers to gather a large amount of data useful not only in determining the composition of the {{upper atmosphere}} of Venus, but also in refining techniques used in searching for extrasolar planets. The atmosphere of mostly CO2, absorbs <b>near-infrared</b> <b>radiation,</b> making it easy to observe. During the 2004 transit, the absorption in the atmosphere as a function of wavelength revealed the properties of the gases at that altitude. The Doppler shift of the gases also enabled wind patterns to be measured.|$|E

30|$|Up-conversion {{materials}} {{have the ability}} to convert lower energy <b>near-infrared</b> <b>radiations</b> into higher energy visible radiations. These {{materials have}} gained considerable attention because of their use {{in a wide range of}} important applications, from solid compact laser devices operating in the visible region and infrared quantum counter detectors to three-dimensional displays, temperature sensors, solar cells, anti-counterfeiting, and biological fluorescence labels and probes [1 – 6]. Further efforts in development of methods for preparation of up-conversion (UC) materials are therefore justified with aims of enhancing their UC efficiency and reducing production costs. In addition, methods for UC nanoparticle (UCNP) synthesis are of particular interest for use in two-photon bio-imaging, sensitive luminescent bio-labels, and GaAs-coated highly efficient light-emitting diodes [7].|$|R

25|$|Earth {{receives}} {{energy from}} the Sun {{in the form of}} ultraviolet, visible, and <b>near-infrared</b> <b>radiation.</b> Of the total amount of solar energy available {{at the top of the}} atmosphere, about 26% is reflected to space by the atmosphere and clouds and 19% is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. Most of the remaining energy is absorbed at the surface of Earth. Because the Earth's surface is colder than the photosphere of the Sun, it radiates at wavelengths that are much longer than the wavelengths that were absorbed. Most of this thermal radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, thereby warming it. In addition to the absorption of solar and thermal radiation, the atmosphere gains heat by sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface. The atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the part radiated downwards is absorbed by the surface of Earth. This leads to a higher equilibrium temperature than if the atmosphere were absent.|$|E

Gold nanoshells strongly absorb <b>near-infrared</b> <b>radiations</b> and efficiently transform absorbed energy into heat. Temperature rise given by experiments and numerical calculations based on bioheat transfer are in good agreement. Our work improves the analysis of a recent study [Richardson et al., Nano Lett. 9, 1139 (2009) ] by including effects of the medium perfusion on temperature increase. The theoretical analysis {{can also be used to}} estimate the distribution of nanoparticles in experimental samples and provide a relative accuracy prediction for the temperature profile of new systems. This methodology would provide a novel and reliable tool for speeding up photothermal investigations and designing state-of-the-art photothermal devices.

50|$|Semiconductor {{quantum well}} EAM {{is widely used}} to {{modulate}} <b>near-infrared</b> (NIR) <b>radiation</b> at frequencies below 0.1THz. Here, the NIR absorption of undoped quantum well was modulated by strong electric field with frequencies between 1.5 and 3.9 THz. The THz field coupled two excited states (excitons) of the quantum wells, as manifested by a new THz frequency-and power- dependent NIR absorption line. The THz field generated a coherent quantum superposition of an absorbing and a nonabsorbing exciton. This quantum coherence may yield new applications for quantum well modulators in optical communications.|$|R

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are also used; they offer greater lifetime and spectral stability and reduced power requirements. For high precision spectroscopy, wavelength-scanned lasers and frequency combs have recently become powerful sources, albeit with sometimes longer acquisition timescales.

50|$|The {{choice of}} surface metal is also {{dictated}} by the plasmon resonance frequency. Visible and <b>near-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> (NIR) are used to excite Raman modes. Silver and gold are typical metals for SERS experiments because their plasmon resonance frequencies fall within these wavelength ranges, providing maximal enhancement for visible and NIR light. Copper's absorption spectrum also falls within the range acceptable for SERS experiments. Platinum and palladium nanostructures also display plasmon resonance within visible and NIR frequencies.|$|E

Analysis of issues of <b>near-infrared</b> <b>radiation</b> in a greenhouse with screens of a high coefficient of reflection concluded that installation of such screens reduced heat demand by about 8%, and application of dyes to transparent surfaces was suggested. Composite less-reflective glass, or less effective but cheaper anti-reflective coated simple glass, also produced savings.|$|E

30|$|In our {{previous}} paper [13], we proposed the method for local {{measurement of the}} frequency characteristics of electrolytes motion. In order to obtain the dynamic picture {{of the behavior of}} fluids that interact with metal surfaces over the volume of the medium in the vicinity of magnetized surfaces, we modified the proposed method by changing the geometry of filming and radiation source. The usage of the <b>near-infrared</b> scattered <b>radiation</b> allowed increasing the contrast of the resulting image due to a higher absorption of radiation by a medium under investigation. The developed method allows us to obtain the distributions of characteristic frequencies of fluids both over the volume and in the selected area of the medium under investigation.|$|R

40|$|The {{deposition}} of thin films of poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) {{by using the}} matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) technique is investigated. PDLLA is a highly biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, with wide applicability in the biomedical field. The laser wavelength used in the MAPLE process is optimized to obtain a good-quality deposition. The structure of the polymer film is analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It is found that the chemical structure of PDLLA undergoes little or no damage during deposition with <b>near-infrared</b> laser <b>radiation</b> (1064 nm).

Our results, while obtained for a non-rotationally-symmetric type of probe tip and thus specific for this situation, indicate that when an s-SNOM is employed for the investigation of plasmonic structures, the unintentional excitation of surface waves and anisotropic surface wave propagation must be considered in order to correctly interpret the signatures of plasmon polariton generation and propagation...|$|R
