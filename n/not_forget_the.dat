It was not until Saturday, 28 February 1953 that the last tram ran on the Champ de Courses line, 76 years after the network's first service. But the Rouennaise did <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> tram's services rendered, organising a first-class funeral: Just before the last scheduled run, a parade of honour made up of three trams ran from the Hôtel de ville to the Trianon depot, cheered by the crowds.|$|E
5|$|This {{bridge is}} {{named in honor}} and remembrance of Charles West Cullen (18651948), a man who {{dedicated}} his life to public service and {{to the citizens of}} Delaware. Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River Inlet. In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time. This, the fifth bridge to span the inlet waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As this bridge serves the public, let us <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> lifetime of service that he gave.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept for}} Radiant Historia {{was created by}} Takayashiki, who first pitched his {{proposal}} to Atlus in 2007. His initial concept was for a traditional RPG people would enjoy. Atlus was chosen due to Takayashiki's admiration for their past work. While {{the concept of the}} 3x3 grid-based battle system was conceived by Takayashiki in the initial proposal, many of the additional elements related to skills were contributed by Atlus staff. According to Hirata, Atlus were intrigued at the collaboration as Radiant Historia was the type of project that would not have appeared within the company. When designing the gameplay, the Atlus staff kept the basic proposal intact while streamlining through refining the mechanics and simplifying sprite animations to quicken the pace of standard battles. The enemy AI was also adjusted to be less punishing while adding field actions to give players an advantage. The time-travel element caused problems for the team as they worked out how to depict the White Chronicle as a game mechanic, while also putting in frequent text updates so players would <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> story despite the game's place on the portable Nintendo DS meaning interruptions were likely. Atlus later described Radiant Historia as their most challenging development for the DS platform.|$|E

500|$|According to scholar Robert Zecker, {{the novel}} depicts African-American poverty {{but does not}} {{illustrate}} its causes.

The African Americans do <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> years of oppression they have endured. However, the Greek Americans, like other whites, fail {{to remember that the}} African Americans were assaulted by whites in 1943 and faced over two decades of oppression after that. Instead, Zecker noted that the characters in the novel believe that the 1967 Detroit riots are [...] "inexplicable cataclysms that came out of nowhere".|$|E

In 1066, Edward died without an heir, and William the Conqueror emerged as the first Norman king of England following his victory over the English at the Battle of Hastings. Wearing a crown became {{an important part of}} WilliamI's efforts to cement his authority over his new territory and subjects. At his death in 1087, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported: [...] " [...] kept great state … He wore his crown three times a year as often as he was in England … He was so stern and relentless … we must <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> good order he kept in the land".|$|E
500|$|The five deities are {{addressed}} by chanting the five letters or syllables (Bijamantra {{which are the}} sounds of the Chakras) which are laṃ (...) , vaṃ (...) , raṃ (...) , yaṃ (...) , and haṃ (...) to become one with Parameshvara (God). Verses 8.11–15 state that a yogin should practice meditating on these respective body systems as deities, with the help of Om mantra, as this leads to dissolution, and realization of the Brahman-Purusha. After mastery is achieved with the aid of envisioning the five deities within one's body, the text mentions that the yogin overcomes three Dosha (दोष, faults). The chapter ends by reminding the yoga student to <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> daily duties and works, the virtuous self-restraints (yamas) and virtuous observances (niyamas) as he gains mastery to this level of yoga.|$|E
500|$|... "Half a Life" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} within the United States on May 6, 1991, in broadcast syndication. Keith DeCandido, {{in a review}} for Tor.com, commended Stiers' acting, saying that he gave [...] "a noble, nuanced performance as Timicin." [...] He also approved of the episode, {{saying that it was}} the first time that Lwaxana Troi was treated as a real character without causing him to cringe; at the same time, DeCandido did <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> problems with her previous appearances on the show. Noting [...] that it was one of the best episodes to feature a Prime Directive debate, DeCandido endorsed the writer's idea not to take sides regarding the suicide. [...] "This is a magnificent, tragic love story, one that takes a thin character and gives her depth, one that gives us a beautifully realized guest character in Timicin (casting Stiers was a masterstroke, as he always brings subtle nuance to his roles), and one that takes its issues seriously," [...] DeCandido wrote. He gave the episode a score of eight out of ten, later concluding that it featured [...] "one of the show's most tragic love stories." ...|$|E

500|$|While Weinberg did <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> breakup {{and long}} separation, he {{viewed it as}} [...] "at {{the same time the}} most horrifying {{experience}} I've ever been through and the most liberating." [...] In any case, he immediately felt comfortable playing with Springsteen once more: [...] "Right from the first downbeat of the first rehearsal, it was there again." [...] His drumming for the E Street Band was more relaxed and mature than before, showing more confidence and finesse, and his hands and fingers were in better shape for having done the daily Late Night work. When the tour concluded with ten shows at New York's Madison Square Garden, on several days Weinberg taped the Conan show at Rockefeller Center in the late afternoon, put his hands in ice and changed from his suit into jeans and a vest, and played with Springsteen at night. The experience of doing both left him [...] "professionally speaking, as alive as I've ever felt." [...] Of his position on the drum platform behind Springsteen, he says, [...] "I have the best seat in the house." [...] His energy level was no less, as he could be seen jumping a foot off his seat during some songs. His daughter Ali joined the band on keyboards several times during the tour.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{positively}} reviewed Shin-shiro, {{with both}} CDJournal and Vibe reviewers noting the strong contrast {{to their first}} two studio albums. Mio Yamada of Vibe wrote that the album was completely different direction to their previous albums, feeling it was more accessible, while CDJournal felt that the album was more [...] "colorful" [...] and [...] "radical". Yamada {{described it as a}} [...] "Sakanaction-style road movie" [...] about finding yourself, while being lonely, anxious and fed up with the tedium of everyday. Shirō Ise of Listen.jp noted the album's [...] "high sense and edgy sound" [...] based on [...] "electronica and guitar rock", while being inspired by a variety of genres such as 1990s alternative rock, new wave, technopop, house, ambient music and African-American music. He praised the fact that despite how many genres the music was inspired by, the band's music did <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> heart of songs. CDJournal praised the fact that each song stands on its own musically, instead of being drowned out by the album's overarching digital sound. Yuji Tanaka of CDJournal described the album as [...] "dynamic technotronica rock" [...] that fused the feel of live music with four on the floor beats. Alexey Eremenko of AllMusic gave the album four or of five stars, comparing it to the works of Asian Kung-Fu Generation. He felt that Sakanaction created [...] "a fresh version of new wave", and felt that the album was [...] "emotionally cohesive". He felt that none of the songs on Shin-shiro were [...] "big catchy numbers", but felt that this was beneficial for the musical flow. Eremenko, however, criticized the album for being [...] "too lightweight".|$|E
