25|$|The Nyquist–Shannon {{sampling}} theorem {{provides a}} sufficient {{condition for the}} sampling and reconstruction of a band-limited signal. When reconstruction is done via the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula, the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>criterion</b> is also a necessary condition to avoid aliasing, {{in the sense that}} if samples are taken at a slower rate than twice the band limit, then there are some signals that will not be correctly reconstructed. However, if further restrictions are imposed on the signal, then the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>criterion</b> may no longer be a necessary condition.|$|E
25|$|When the bandlimit is {{too high}} (or there is no bandlimit), the {{reconstruction}} exhibits imperfections known as aliasing. Modern statements of the theorem are sometimes careful to explicitly state that x(t) must contain no sinusoidal component at exactly frequency B, or that B must be strictly less than ½ the sample rate. The two thresholds, 2B and fs/2 are respectively called the Nyquist rate and Nyquist frequency. And respectively, they are attributes of x(t) and of the sampling equipment. The condition described by these inequalities is called the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>criterion,</b> or sometimes the Raabe condition. The theorem is also applicable to functions of other domains, such as space, {{in the case of}} a digitized image. The only change, in the case of other domains, is the units of measure applied to t, fs, and B.|$|E
25|$|As depicted, {{copies of}} X(f) are shifted by {{multiples}} of fs and combined by addition. For a band-limited function nbsp&(X(f) = 0 for all |f| ≥ B),nbsp& and sufficiently large fs, {{it is possible}} for the copies to remain distinct from each other. But if the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>criterion</b> is not satisfied, adjacent copies overlap, and it is not possible in general to discern an unambiguous X(f). Any frequency component above fs/2 is indistinguishable from a lower-frequency component, called an alias, associated with one of the copies. In such cases, the customary interpolation techniques produce the alias, rather than the original component. When the sample-rate is pre-determined by other considerations (such as an industry standard), x(t) is usually filtered to reduce its high frequencies to acceptable levels before it is sampled. The type of filter required is a lowpass filter, and in this application it is called an anti-aliasing filter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} {{in the design of}} newgeneration Multi-Gigabit wireless transmission systems without receive equalization is suppression of Inter-Symbol-Interference (ISI). For an optimal receiver performance, transmitted pulses must satisfy the first and second <b>Nyquist</b> <b>criteria.</b> By using a hybrid, digital-analog pulse shaping filter we gain full control over the form of generated pulses. However, an additional design issue is introduced by oversampling technique. Commonly utilized, integer-valued oversampling methods lead to extreme system clock frequencies in multi-gigabit systems.

40|$|Data {{transmission}} over bandlimited channels requires pulse shaping {{to eliminate}} or control Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). A widely used filter {{for this purpose}} is the raised cosine filter which satisfies <b>Nyquist’s</b> first <b>criterion.</b> We design a phase compensator so that the square-root raised-cosine filter also satisfies <b>Nyquist’s</b> first <b>criterion.</b> Such a technique is particularly useful to accommodate two different structures for the receiver, one with a filter matched to the transmitting filter and one without any matched filter. In {{the case of a}} raised cosine spectrum with full excess bandwidth, we show that the phase compensator corresponds to a pure time delay. We also extend the raised-cosine spectra to a more general family of Nyquist filters which their compensated square-root spectra satisfy <b>Nyquist’s</b> <b>criterion.</b> In practice, {{it is important that the}} transmitting and receiving filters be well approximated with short impulse responses.

5000|$|When a {{continuous}} function, x(t), is sampled {{at a constant}} rate, fs samples/second, there is always an unlimited number of other continuous functions that fit {{the same set of}} samples. But only one of them is bandlimited to ½ fs cycles/second (hertz), which means that its Fourier transform, X(f), is 0 for all |f| ≥ ½ fs. [...] The mathematical algorithms that are typically used to recreate {{a continuous}} function from samples create arbitrarily good approximations to this theoretical, but infinitely long, function. It follows that if the original function, x(t), is bandlimited to ½ fs, which is called the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>criterion,</b> then it is the one unique function the interpolation algorithms are approximating. In terms of a function's own bandwidth (B), as depicted above, the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>criterion</b> is often stated as fs > 2B. And 2B is called the Nyquist rate for functions with bandwidth B. When the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>criterion</b> is not met (B > ½ fs), a condition called aliasing occurs, which results in some inevitable differences between x(t) and a reconstructed function that has less bandwidth. In most cases, the differences are viewed as distortion.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} this criterion {{is applied to}} baseband filtering by regarding the symbol sequence as weighted impulses (Dirac delta function).

Localizing these lung sounds can provide information to the extent and location of the disorder. Difference in arrival times at a set of sensors and triangulation were previously proposed for acoustic imaging of the chest. We propose two algorithms for acoustic imaging using a set of eigen basis functions of the Helmholtz wave equation. These algorithms remove the sensor location contribution from the multi sensor recordings using either an orthogonality property or a least squares based estimation after which a spatial minimum variance (MV) spectrum is applied to estimate the source locations. The use of these eigen basis functions allows possible extension to a lung sound model consisting of layered cylindrical media. Theoretical analysis of the relationship of resolution to frequency and noise power was derived and simulations verified the results obtained. Further, a <b>Nyquist’s</b> <b>criteria</b> for localizing sources within a circular array shows that the radius of region where sources can be localized is inversely proportional to the frequency of sound.
