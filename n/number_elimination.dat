40|$|Phosphorylation-triggered {{degradation}} is {{a common}} strategy for elimination of regulatory proteins in many important cell signaling processes. Interesting examples include cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p 27 in human and Sic 1 in yeast, which play crucial roles during the G 1 /S transition in the cell cycle. In this work, we have modeled and analyzed the dynamics of multisite-phosphorylation-triggered protein degradation systematically. Inspired by experimental observations on the Sic 1 protein and a previous intriguing theoretical conjecture, we develop a model to examine in detail the degradation dynamics of a protein featuring multiple phosphorylation sites and a threshold site <b>number</b> for <b>elimination</b> {{in response to a}} kinase signal. Our model explains the role of multiple phosphorylation sites, compared to a single site, in the regulation of protein degradation. A single-site protein cannot convert a graded input of kinase increase to much sharper output, whereas multisite phosphorylation is capable of generating a highly switch-like temporal profile of the substrate protein with two characteristics: a temporal threshold and rapid decrease beyond the threshold. We introduce a measure termed temporal response coefficient to quantify {{the extent to which a}} response in the time domain is switch-like and further investigate how this property is determined by various factors including the kinase input, the total number of sites, the threshold site <b>number</b> for <b>elimination,</b> the order of phosphorylation, the kinetic parameters, and site preference. Some interesting and experimentally verifiable predictions include that the non-degradable fraction of the substrate protein exhibits a more switch-like temporal profile; a sequential system is more switch-like, while a random system has the advantage of increased robustness; all the parameters, including the total number of sites, the threshold site <b>number</b> for <b>elimination</b> and the kinetic parameters synergistically determine the exact extent to which the degradation profile is switch-like. Our results suggest design principles for protein degradation switches which might be a widespread mechanism for precise regulation of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression...|$|R

40|$|We are {{interested}} in single commodity stochastic network design problems under prob-abilistic constraint with discrete and continuous random variables. We use a stochastic programming model under probabilistic constraint (also called a chance-constrained model) to study these problems. The problem addressed in this research is how to find minimum cost optimal ca-pacities at the nodes and/or arcs subject to the constraint that the demands should be met on a prescribed probability level (reliability constraint). In our first problem formulation, we formulate the reliability constraint {{in terms of the}} Gale-Hoffman feasi-bility inequalities. In latter formulations, we allow system to meet the demand at least k-out-of-n and consecutive k-out-of-n periods.
