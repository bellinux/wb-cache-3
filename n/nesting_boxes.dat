40|$|In nature, mice live in burrows with nest {{chambers}} {{where they}} breed and may hide from predators. In the laboratory, a shelter or refuge is an easily applicable form of enrichment which may enhance {{the welfare of}} laboratory mice by giving them {{more control over their}} environment. Six <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> made of different materials were evaluated in a preference test with male and female mice of two strains (C 57 BL/ 6 J and BALB/c). In general, mice showed a preference for cages with a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> made of grid metal as compared to clear or white perspex <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> or no <b>nest</b> <b>box.</b> They also showed a preference for a cage with a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> of perforated metal as compared to <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> made of grey PVC or sheer metal, or no <b>nest</b> <b>box.</b> When offered a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> with one open side or a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> with two open sides, most mice preferred the <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> with one open side and were observed to lie in it with their heads directed towards the opening. The results of this study show that <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> may be used for enrichment purposes in caged mice, although it is not yet entirely clear what are the main features influencing the animals' preferences. When providing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> as shelters, the structure and design of this type of enrichment should be taken into account, because these may {{have an effect on the}} social structure of groups of mice...|$|R
40|$|Nest box {{selection}} in the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in Southern Norway was estimated from fieldwork in Trysil Municipality in 2007 and {{by use of}} additional field data from 2005 and 2006. Used versus not used <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> was used as response variables and tested against multiple explanatory variables. Time of hatching also was used as response variable in 2007, where early arrivals were hypothesized to select the best <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> or the best habitats. Microhabitat analyses within a 0. 1 ha quadrate around the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> and macrohabitat analyses outside this quadrate gave "general preference" over time, "year effect" preference and "early arrival" preference. Kestrels generally selected <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in open, flat habitats such as bogs and falling areas where there were not too many competing pairs nearby. Differences in vole numbers between years resulted in year effect when voles were scarce. Kestrels selected <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> {{in close proximity to}} developed areas in 2005 when voles were scarce, probably because of higher density of alternative prey, such as birds, lizards and insects. Neither <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> size nor construction was important for <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> selection, but kestrels seemed to prefer boxes where the entrance hole was not too big. Some degree of cover around the <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> tree, measured as number of trees around the <b>nest</b> <b>box,</b> also seemed to matter. In addition, south facing <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> were selected earlier than others.

5|$|In Malaysia, {{large areas}} of {{rainforest}} were felled {{to make way for}} oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the barn owl population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished.

40|$|Nest {{boxes are}} {{frequently}} used in conservation programs for tree-cavity dependent wildlife. There is growing {{concern that the}} poor insulation properties of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> may produce an ecological trap, because species may require microclimates less extreme or less variable than those experienced inside <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> I investigated the fitness consequences of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use in a non-flying mammal. Fifty-two of 104 squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) trapped over a 3 -year period used <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> Population modelling of the capture data revealed that the probability of apparent survival increased with increasing <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use. There {{was no difference in}} breeding frequency between females that used or did not use <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> There was no evidence that offspring development was hindered within <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> These findings may arise because: (1) gliders could access tree hollows during extreme temperatures, (2) ambient temperatures were mild during the study, (3) gliders construct leaf nests which insulate against low temperatures in winter, and (4) gliders breed between autumn and spring when temperatures are relatively benign. The estimate of annual survival of animals using <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (0. 60), was equivalent to estimates at locations where squirrel gliders were either reliant on <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> (0. 54) or on tree cavities (0. 55) for shelter.

40|$|Biodiversity {{offsetting}} {{is widely}} applied but its effectiveness is rarely assessed. We evaluated {{the effectiveness of}} a <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> program intended to offset clearing of hollow-bearing trees associated with a freeway upgrade in southern Australia. The offset targeted three threatened vertebrates: squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), brown treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus) and superb parrot (Polytelis swainsonii). Clearing led to the loss of 587 tree hollows and the offset was the placement of an equivalent number of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in nearby woodland (1 : 1 ratio). Of these, we monitored 324 <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> in six sample periods between 2010 and 2013, yielding 2485 individual checks of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes.</b> For the three target species, we found: (1) no records of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use by the superb parrot, (2) two records of the brown treecreeper (0 - 0. 76 % of accessible <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> used per survey period), and (3) seven records of use of <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> by the squirrel glider (0 - 2. 1 % of accessible <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> used per survey period). Rates of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> use by the superb parrot and squirrel glider were markedly lower than rates of use of hollow-bearing trees observed in other investigations. Low levels of use by target species coupled with the extent of <b>nest</b> <b>box</b> attrition suggest the offset program will not have counterbalanced the loss of the hollow-bearing trees. We make suggestions for improving future offset programs including a greater emphasis on: (1) avoiding impacts on hollow-bearing trees; (2) offset effectiveness as a measure of compliance; and (3) using realistic offset ratios...|$|R

A total of 566 pairs of seven bird species used the <b>nest</b> <b>boxes</b> from 1997 to 2006, 562 of which were secondarycavity-nesters. Sympatric tits such as varied tits (Parus varius), great tits (P. major), and marsh tits (P. palustris) were common breeding birds in <b>nest</b> <b>boxes,</b> and showed clear preferences for 4. 0 cm, 3. 5 cm and 3. 0 cm nestholes, respectively.
