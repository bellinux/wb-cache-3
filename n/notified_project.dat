40|$|Abstract. Many {{tools in}} {{software}} engineering projects support the visualization and collaborative modification of custom sets of artifacts. This includes tools for requirements engineering, UML tools for design, project management tools, developer tools and many more. A key factor {{for success in}} software engineering projects is the collective understanding of changes applied to these artifacts. To support this, there are several strategies to automatically <b>notify</b> <b>project</b> participants about relevant changes. Known strategies are limited to a fixed set of artifacts and/or make no use of traceability information to supply change notifications. This paper proposes a change notification approach based on traceability in a unified model and building upon operation-based change tracking. The unified model explicitly combines system specification models and project management models into one fully traceable model. To show the benefit of our approach we compare it to related approaches in a case study...|$|R
40|$|Software {{development}} {{can be thought}} of as the evolution of abstract requirements into a concrete software system. The evolution, achieved through a successive series of elaborations and refinements, is inherently a complex process. The complexity is not merely in the product [...] the complexity of managing the evolution of the product throughout the life of a project is proportional to the size and complexity of the product. Managing software project teams is a complex task complicated by the distribution of project teams. Distributed collaboration requires adequate support for team coordination and risk management. Human-computer interaction (HCI) combines technical concerns with human psychological concerns. Similarly, software project managers confront complexities in both of these dimensions. In this paper, we report on a collaborative design environment called LINK-UP being developed to guide the design process and facilitate reuse. We examine some web-based project management tools in terms of their support for collaborative design and virtual team processes. We present a notification system approach to making the design record a natural by-product of the design process and a lever for knowledge reuse. Knowledge from past projects could then be used to automatically <b>notify</b> <b>project</b> teams of potential problems and suggest possible solutions. 1...|$|R

50|$|Project cost {{management}} is traditionally a weak area of IT projects. IT project managers must acknowledge {{the importance of}} {{cost management}} and take responsibility for understanding basic cost concepts, cost estimating, budgeting, and cost control.Project managers must understand several basic principles of cost management {{to be effective in}} managing project cost. Important concepts include profits and profit margins, life cycle costing, cash flow analysis, sunk cost, and learning curve theory.Planning cost management involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost. The main output of this process is a cost management plan.Estimating costs is {{a very important part of}} project cost management. There are several types of cost estimates, including rough order of magnitude (ROM), budgetary, and definitive. Each type of estimate is done during different stages of the project life cycle, and each has a different level of accuracy. Several tool and techniques can help you develop cost estimates, including analogous estimating, bottom-up estimating, parametric estimating, and computerized tools.Determining the budget involves allocating costs to individual work items over time. It is important to understand how particular organizations prepare budgets so estimates are made accordingly.Controlling cost includes monitoring cost performance, reviewing changes, and <b>notifying</b> <b>project</b> stakeholders of changes related to cost. Many basic accounting and finance principles relate to cost project management. Earned value management is an important method used for measuring project performance. Earned value management integrates scope, cost, and schedule information. Project portfolio management allows organization to collect and control an entire suite of projects or investments as one set of interrelated activities.Several software products can assists with project cost management. Enterprise project management software and portfolio management software can help managers evaluate data on multiple projects.|$|R

In April 1995, we were <b>notified</b> that the <b>project</b> would be cancelled and we would all be laid off. But we were not to be laid off immediately. Apple wanted us to stay for 6 months so Dylan could be released as an experimental [...] "technology release". This was apparently done to avoid embarrassment at WWDC the following month.

40|$|Security {{remains a}} major {{roadblock}} to universal {{acceptance of the}} Web for many kinds of transactions, especially since the recent sharp increase in remotely exploitable vulnerabilities {{has been attributed to}} Web application bugs. Many verification tools are discovering previously unknown vulnerabilities in legacy C programs, raising hopes that the same success can be achieved with Web applications. In this paper, we describe a sound and holistic approach to ensuring Web application security. Viewing Web application vulnerabilities as a secure information flow problem, we created a lattice-based static analysis algorithm derived from type systems and typestate, and addressed its soundness. During the analysis, sections of code considered vulnerable are instrumented with runtime guards, thus securing Web applications in the absence of user intervention. With sufficient annotations, runtime overhead can be reduced to zero. We also created a tool named WebSSARI (Web application Security by Static Analysis and Runtime Inspection) to test our algorithm, and used it to verify 230 open-source Web application projects on SourceForge. net, which were selected to represent projects of different maturity, popularity, and scale. 69 contained vulnerabilities and their developers were <b>notified.</b> 38 <b>projects</b> acknowledged our findings and stated their plans to provide patches. Our statistics also show that static analysis reduced potential runtime overhead by 98. 4 %...|$|R
50|$|The {{studio was}} <b>notified</b> of the <b>project's</b> {{cancellation}} on December 7, 1999, {{as part of}} a range of cuts including several other games and an updated version of Atari's Combat. The Chapel Hill Hasbro Interactive studio was closed on January 7, 2000. The remaining Hasbro Interactive studios were closed shortly thereafter and Hasbro sold their remaining assets to Infogrames (Atari). In 2005, Take-Two Interactive acquired the rights to the X-COM series from Atari. Previous employees of the studio later formed a new studio called Vicious Cycle Software, developing a new 3D engine and a technology demo. Dave Ellis, leveraging contacts at Mattel, arranged for a demonstration of the demo to Mattel's management. Vicious Cycle would go on to make a Robotech game for Mattel to be published for the newly released PlayStation 2 and Xbox.|$|R
40|$|On 8 May 2012, the Commission adopted its Communication on State aid modernisation. Two years later, most {{elements}} of the reform have come into force. This was the most comprehensive overhaul {{in the history of}} State aid control. First, the Council quickly agreed to amendments of the Enabling Regulation, enlarging the scope of measures that can be exempted from notification, and of the Procedural Regulation, enhancing the investigative powers of the Commission and introducing the possibility for the Commission to intervene in national litigation. Second, the Commission issued new versions, based on a common structure, of its horizontal guidelines and frameworks: regional aid, risk finance, environmental protection with the addition of energy, research and development and innovation, rescuing and restructuring of undertakings in difficulty, a new document concerning important projects of common European interest, and some important sectorial instruments (broadband, aviation). Third, the Commission adopted a new de minimis regulation and a new, comprehensive block exemption regulation, intended to cover the majority of national aid measures. Fourth, a new notice on the notion of aid, yet to be finally adopted, should provide interpretative guidance. The result of the exercise is a considerable clarification of the rules, an improvement of the procedural tools and a limitation of the obligation to <b>notify</b> State aid <b>projects.</b> In turn, this should allow the Commission to work more efficiently, to reduce the duration of its procedures and to focus on the most distortive measures...|$|R
40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Tier 4 Emission control versus {{conventional}} engine {{design is}} what every design engineer???s challenge {{to be dealt}} with. To design an engine to current market standards and requirements has become very intricate. In order to make such an explicit design which meets the standards, every component of the engine plays as a vital role. Every component design and development to current engineering standards pushes the envelope of manufacturability to new limits, which constraints {{the cost of the}} product across the ease of manufacturability of it. In consideration of the complexity to be attained, every component design contributes to the existence of a complete standardized engine, such as integrated valve cover. With the new tier 4 final regulations for engine manufactures, every new engine produced needs to meet those regulations. Caterpillar Inc regulated to produce tier 4 final compatible engines for the market. The new drive for development of new engines identified the objective of this project to design a new integrated breather valve cover for large power engines. Valve Cover, the noun by name explains it covers valves. In explanation to the definition of the valve cover, it covers the cylinder head mechanism;this is a high speed operating valve. Valve Cover not only covers the head mechanism and should also be persistent to pressure, stress and heat dissipated during the operation of the engine. Valve cover design initiates and explains the intricacy of a complete engine design. All the functional requirements of valve cover would be designed, analyzed and validated in this project, that drive the process of execution of the project to several phases of product development. Process identified for execution initiates with correct manufacturing technique, design intent and analysis. Caterpillar Inc. Engineering standards have been taken as a reference for defining all form fit functions. Pro engineering, Abaqus, Gambit and Fluent are the computer aided design tools used in this project for the execution of design intent. Identification of a proper manufacturing technique, processed execution of design requirements and analysis of concepts of design are validated across the requirements in this project with a justification of value added solutions are <b>notified</b> in the <b>project.</b> Conclusion on complete product design of integrated breather valve cover with optimal solution of all the available techniques in every aspect of design, development and real time production of valve cover have been discussed in this project,Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
