50|$|There are {{two main}} types of treaty reinsurance, {{proportional}} and non-proportional, which are detailed below. Under proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer's share of the risk is defined for each separate policy, while under <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> the reinsurer's liability {{is based on the}} aggregate claims incurred by the ceding office. In the past 30 years there has been a major shift from proportional to <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> in the property and casualty fields.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> (or [...] "excess" [...] reinsurance), the {{reinsurer}} bears that part of insurer’s loss which exceeds an agreed threshold, while the insurer retains the risk or loss below the threshold, or else reinsures this with a different reinsurer.|$|E
40|$|Two {{numerical}} {{methods are}} proposed to numerically evaluate the survival {{function of a}} compound distribution and the stop-loss premiums associated with a <b>non-proportional</b> global <b>reinsurance</b> treaty. The first method relies on {{a representation of the}} probability density function in terms of Laguerre polynomials and the gamma density, the second is a numerical inversion of the Laplace transform. Numerical comparisons are conducted {{at the end of the}} paper. MSC 2010 : 60 G 55, 60 G 40, 12 E 10...|$|R
50|$|A co-insurance, which {{typically}} governs <b>non-proportional</b> treaty <b>reinsurance,</b> is an excess {{expressed as a}} proportion of a claim in percentage terms and applied to the entirety of a claim. Co-insurance is a penalty imposed on the insured by the insurance carrier for under reporting/declaring/insuring the value of tangible property or business income. The penalty is based on a percentage stated within the policy and the amount under reported. As an example: a vessel actually valued at $1,000,000 has an 80% co-insurance clause but is insured for only $750,000. Since its insured value is less than 80% of its actual value, when it suffers a loss, the insurance payout will be subject to the under-reporting penalty, the insured will receive 750000/1000000th (75%) of the claim made less the deductible.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{some aspects of}} {{modelling}} catastrophic risk and with its application to non- -life insurance claims. First, we formulate the problem of generalization of classical Cramér-Lundberg collective risk model. Then using some well-known extreme value results we study two methods for extremal claims registration. Finally, we apply the theoretical results for real insurance data. As suitable mathematical models for large insurance claims are used heavy-tailed distributions (subexponential, stable and max-stable distributions). The main reason why {{we are interested in}} stable distributions is, that for the extreme value distributions the classical central limit theorem (CLT) condition (finite mean and variance) doesn‘t hold. Instead of CLT we use the Fisher-Tippett theorem which specifies the limit laws for maximum of independent identically distributed (iid) random variables as Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. For recording extreme insurance claims we use two approaches. The first one is based on modelling maximum of the sample and called method of block-maxima. This method is based just on the Fisher-Tippett theorem and in non-life insurance we can use it for <b>non-proportional</b> Largest Claim <b>Reinsurance</b> (LCR). The second approach is based on modelling excess values over the chosen threshold. This approach is called Peaks Over Threshold method and is based on the Picands theorem which specifies the limit law for the exceedances as Generalised Pareto Distri- bution (GPD). This method is used in <b>non-proportional</b> Excess-of-Loss <b>Reinsurance</b> (XL). In the end, we apply these methods for modelling real fire insurance claims. We find an optimal exceedance level for reinsurance and identify lognormal distribution for all data and Pareto distri- bution for the tail. The empirical data are compared with considered theoretical distribution using chi-squared and Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests. For detailed statistical analysis of data we use STATGRAPHICS and its procedure Distribution fitting...|$|R
5000|$|Truncating and {{censoring}} of {{data can}} also be estimated using stochastic models. For instance, applying a <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> layer to the best estimate losses will not necessarily give us the best estimate of the losses after the reinsurance layer. In a simulated stochastic model, the simulated losses {{can be made to}} [...] "pass through" [...] the layer and the resulting losses assessed appropriately.|$|E
5000|$|Under <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> the {{reinsurer}} only pays out if {{the total}} claims suffered by the insurer in a given period exceed a stated amount, which is called the [...] "retention" [...] or [...] "priority". For instance the insurer may be prepared to accept a total loss up to $1 million, and purchases a layer of reinsurance of $4 million in excess of this $1 million. If a loss of $3 million were then to occur, the insurer would bear $1 million of the loss and would recover $2 million from its reinsurer. In this example, the insured also retains any excess of loss over $5 million unless it has purchased a further excess layer of reinsurance.|$|E

Iva Justová, Ph. D. Supervisor's e-mail address: iva justova@hotmail. com Abstract: The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> of {{non-life}} insurance. Taking into account the latest Quantitative Impact Study QIS 5, we calculate the capital requirement under Solvency II and {{we focus on the}} premium and reserve risk. The first part of this work describes basic concepts and formulas. Furthermore, in the main part we describe the standard formula for the calculation of the capital requirement from which we derive a formula for the calculation of the capital requirement but this time taking into account the impact of reinsurance. In the last chapter, we apply the approach on an example, in which we examine the influence of parameters on the capital requirement.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} bachelor's thesis {{is the price}} of {{proportional}} reinsurance. Firstly, the thesis is focused on general definition of reinsurance. It tries to provide basic information to distinguish differences between obligatory and facultative reinsurance and proportional and <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance.</b> Then it follows up with the structure of price in proportional reinsurance, in detail analyzes individual components and shows the calculations on model examples. Practical part deals with the use of particular commissions and their comparison. Thesis points out the situations when the selected commission is more convenient for insurer or reinsurer...|$|E
40|$|In excess-of-loss reinsurance, only claims with {{incurred}} loss above a reporting threshold speci_ed {{in the treaty}} are noti_ed to the reinsurer. The data available for reinsurance pricing and reserving are, thus, incomplete and failing to account for this limitation may bias the actuarial analysis. The collective approach based on aggregate development triangles cannot deal {{with this kind of}} incompleteness. This is why we develop here an individual reserving method combining paid and {{incurred loss}}es which can cope with any <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> treaty. Extensive numerical illustrations performed on a motor third party liability reinsurance data set demonstrate the relevance of the approach proposed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method to}} compute bivariate probability distributions from their Laplace transforms is presented. The method consists in an orthogonal {{projection of the}} probability density function {{with respect to a}} probability measure that belongs to a Natural Exponential Family with Quadratic Variance Function (NEF-QVF). A particular link to Lancaster probabilities is highlighted. The procedure allows a quick and accurate calculation of probabilities of interest and does not require strong coding skills. Numerical illustrations and comparisons with other methods are provided. This work is motivated by actuarial applications. We aim at recovering the joint distribution of two aggregate claims amounts associated with two insurance policy portfolios that are closely related, and at computing survival functions for reinsurance losses in presence of two <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> treaties...|$|E
40|$|We study {{stochastic}} differential games {{between two}} insurance companies who employ reinsurance to reduce risk exposure. We consider competition between two companies and construct a single payoff function of two companies' surplus processes. One company chooses a dynamic reinsurance strategy {{in order to}} maximize the payoff function while its opponent is simultaneously choosing a dynamic reinsurance strategy so as to minimize the same quantity. We describe the Nash equilibrium of the game and prove a verification theorem for a general payoff function. For the payoff function being the probability that the difference between two surplus reaches an upper bound before it reaches a lower bound, the game is solved explicitly. <b>Non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> HJB equation Ruin probability Stochastic control Stochastic differential game...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} reserve estimation by {{an insurance}} company {{is based on the}} aggregated data. However, new trend is to utilize all the information available and analyse each claim separately. This way the application of claims specific features, such as <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> or policy limits, is possible. The aim of this thesis is to construct the reserving model based on the individual claims. Following the recent legislative changes, the reserve risk has been redefined from ultimate claim horizon to a one-year risk horizon. Hence, the next task is to setup simulation model to calculate one year horizon reserve risk by updating the estimates based on new observations collected over one year. This is a typical task for Bayesian approach, therefore the model components are estimated using the tools of Bayesian statistics...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the final amount after settlement of Motor and General Third Party claims incurred during an under-writing year is of considerable inll) ortance for direct writing com-panies, {{as well as}} for reinsurers. While methods of considerable precision have been proposed for direct writing companies ' business (ref. 1, 2), a less exact but simpler method, which is applicable, i. a., to <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance,</b> could also be of interest. The method uses the so-called "chain relatives " (ref. 3) computed from the figures for incurred losses similar to those quoted on p. 157, ref. I. The year hi which losses Si,j have occurred is desig-nated by the subscript i, whilst the years in which the corresponding amount of losses paid plus outstanding has been ascertained (or estimated) are designated by the subscript j. "Chain relatives " are defined as a ratio S~,j =; i = 1, 2, 3, [...] . n...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of human society is placing ever increasing demands on their production. This action brings the company not only positive but also negative impacts. Along with the {{development of}} industrial production, people have to face the risks posed their activity brings. The accidents, which occurred in the recent past, they still have a negative impact not only on humans but also on the environment and the economy. In this paper, we address the issue of major accidents. Major accidents are meant only accidents caused induced by human activities. The paper presents the best known major accidents {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century. They have come in the European Union to modify the legislation that is valid for the all EU Member States. In the Czech Republic, these rules are enshrined in Act No. 59 / 2009 Coll., on the prevention of major accidents. For human society is a necessary protection against the effects arising from major accidents. One of the possibilities is the insurance of major accidents. Since in major accidents frequently occurs very high damage is therefore utilized modelling and simulation of extreme values. One of the options that can be used is modelling using the quantile function. The paper recalled model and process simulation of extreme values. It is possible to estimate the values of the damage amounts thanks to the help of the simulation of the quantile function, and it is also possible to estimate the maximum limit of the interval of damage. This knowledge can be used in deciding on the appropriate type of <b>non-proportional</b> <b>reinsurance</b> and also for the management of catastrophic risk insurance...|$|E
