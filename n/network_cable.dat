5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) and the <b>network</b> <b>cable</b> up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB {{has no such}} requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and in fact it connects the peripheral and host grounds. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E

25|$|Alpine {{is home to}} {{the tower}} and {{laboratory}} built by Edwin Howard Armstrong after RCA evicted him from the Empire State Building. Armstrong's experimental FM station, W2XMN, used various frequencies to broadcast from the tower, first on 42.8 MHz; later on 44.1MHz; and finally on 93.1MHz in the modern FM band. The laboratory building and the tower still stand; the 400-foot (122-m) tower is home to many two-way radio users, one modern FM station (Fairleigh Dickinson University's WFDU), and backup transmitters for several of New York's television stations. The tower served as a primary tower for the stations after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks destroyed the World Trade Center. There was some local opposition to this scheme, but the move was temporary, as the stations affected moved their primary broadcast facilities to the Empire State Building. The original lab building is home to a static display of historic communications equipment and offices; the USA <b>Network</b> <b>cable</b> channel operated from this building in the late 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|Loudspeakers with {{integrated}} CobraNet {{help keep}} the signal chain digital for an even longer span. [...] In a typical unpowered speaker application, the amplifier would be housed {{far away from the}} speaker, and a long speaker cable (analog) would be run between the speaker and the amplifier. The speaker cable would be subject to interference and signal loss from electrical resistance. However, a powered speaker, powered by an electrical cable and fitted with integrated CobraNet inputs, eliminates the speaker cable and replaces it with a <b>network</b> <b>cable.</b> Since a speaker will only use one audio channel out of the bundle, many speakers with CobraNet will also have a number of analog outputs {{for the rest of the}} channels in the bundle, which is useful in speaker cluster applications.|$|E

By 1955 the Telegraphy proposed that the radio network be established using 26 FM transmitters. One on top of Gaustatoppen would cover central Eastern Norway while the rest would be built in areas without acceptable AM coverage. Transmission to the FM transmitters would be carried out using telephone lines. Construction of the FM and television transmission network was estimated to take ten to fifteen years. NRK rejected the plan, both because of the long time frame and {{because they wanted to}} prioritize Eastern Norway and Trøndelag, which had the most concentrated populations. The Telegraphy Administration also proposed that cable radio be installed, in part because it would accelerate the construction of the telephone <b>network.</b> <b>Cable</b> radio was installed in Setesdal, Rana and Sulitjelma.|$|E
