50|$|Soil, {{consisting}} of polyanionic clays and silicates, generally has a net anionic charge. Consequently, ammonium (NH4+) binds tightly {{to the soil}} but nitrate ions (NO3−) do not. Because nitrate is more mobile, it leaches into groundwater supplies through agricultural runoff. Wildlife such as amphibians, freshwater fish, and insects are sensitive to nitrate levels, and {{have been known to}} cause death and developmental anomalies in affected species. In addition, because they easily leach into groundwater, contributing to eutrophication, a process in which large algal blooms reduce oxygen levels in bodies of water and lead to death in oxygen-consuming creatures due to anoxia. Nitrification is also thought to contribute to the formation of photochemical smog, ground level ozone, acid rain, changes in species diversity, and other undesirable processes. In addition, <b>nitrification</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have also been shown to suppress the oxidation of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, to CO2.

50|$|In particular, thiophosphoryl triamide {{has been}} a notable {{addition}} where it has the dual purpose of inhibiting both the production of urease and nitrification. In a study of inhibitory effects of oxidation by the bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea, the use of thioethers resulted in the oxidation of these compounds to sulfoxides, where the S atom is the primary site of oxidation by AMO. This is most strongly correlated {{to the field of}} competitive inhibition. N-heterocyclic compounds are also highly effective <b>nitrification</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and are often classified by their ring structure. The mode of action for these compounds is not well understood: while nitrapyrin, a widely used inhibitor and substrate of AMO, is a weak mechanism-based inhibitor of said enzyme, the effects of said mechanism are unable to correlate directly with the compound’s ability to inhibit nitrification. It is suggested that nitrapyrin acts against the monooxygenase enzyme within the bacteria, preventing growth and CH4/NH4 oxidation. Compounds containing two or three adjacent ring N atoms (pyridazine, pyrazole, indazole) tend to have a significantly higher inhibition effect than compounds containing non-adjacent N atoms or singular ring N atoms (pyridine, pyrrole). This suggests that the presence of ring N atoms is directly correlated with the inhibition effect of this class of compounds.|$|E

40|$|Nitrification, a {{key process}} in the global {{nitrogen}} cycle that generates nitrate through microbial activity, may enhance losses of fertilizer nitrogen by leaching and denitrification. Certain plants can suppress soil-nitrification by releasing inhibitors from roots, a phenomenon termed biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). Here, we report the discovery of an effective <b>nitrification</b> <b>inhibitor</b> in the root-exudates of the tropical forage grass Brachiaria humidicola (Rendle) Schweick. Named ‘‘brachialactone,’’ this inhibitor is a recently discovered cyclic diterpene with a unique 5 - 8 - 5 -membered ring system and a -lactone ring. It contributed 60 – 90 % of the inhibitory activity released from the roots of this tropical grass. Unlike nitrapyrin (a synthetic <b>nitrification</b> <b>inhibitor),</b> which affects only the ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) pathway, brachialactone appears to block both AMO and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzymatic pathways in Nitrosomonas. Release of this inhibitor is a regulated plant function, triggered and sustained by the availability of ammonium (NH 4) in the root environment. Brachialactone release is restricted to those roots that are directly exposed to NH 4. Within 3 years of establishment, Brachiaria pastures have suppressed soil nitrifier populations (determined as amoA genes; ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea), along with nitrification and nitrous oxide emissions. These findings provide direct evidence for the existence and active regulation of a <b>nitrification</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (or inhibitors) release from tropical pasture root systems.
