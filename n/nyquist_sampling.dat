40|$|International audienceRecently, sub-Nyquist {{sampling}} of wideband signals has gained much attention in wireless communications. One {{of the main}} reasons for this popularity is the reduction in energy consumption in the ADCs. In this paper, we present an overview of the best known non-uniform sub-Nyquist sampling techniques and the associated spectral analysis. Spectral analysis using sub-Nyquist samples can be done in two ways. We can reconstruct the original <b>Nyquist</b> <b>samples</b> from the sub-Nyquist samples and then by using Fourier transform we can obtain the estimated power spectral density using classical methods like Welch method. We can also obtain the power spectral estimate directly from the sub-Nyquist samples without reconstructing the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>samples.</b> Both approaches can be used based on the application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Traditionally, {{the channel}} used for {{differential}} multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems is constant dur-ing one frame and changes randomly from one frame to another. This channel behavior is too simple to be realistic. In this paper, we propose a new time selective channel model for differential space-time modulation (DSTM) schemes. A {{sufficient number of}} Rayleigh channel matrices are randomly generated, and the other channel matrices are sinc interpolated according to the <b>Nyquist’s</b> <b>sampling</b> theorem. The performance of DSTM schemes with two, four and eight transmit antennas are evaluated over this time selective channel model.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that analog-to-information con- version (AIC) is an {{efficient}} scheme to perform sub-Nyquist sampling of pulsed radar echoes. However, it is often impractical, if not infeasible, to reconstruct full-range <b>Nyquist</b> <b>samples</b> because of huge storage and computational load requirements. Based on the analyses of AIC measurement system, this paper develops a novel segment-sliding reconstruction (SegSR) scheme to effectively reconstruct the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>samples.</b> The SegSR per- forms segment-by-segment reconstruction in a sliding mode and can be implemented in real-time. An important characteristic that distinguish the proposed SegSR from the existing methods is that the measurement matrix in each segment satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) condition. Partial support in the previous segment can be incorporated into the estimation of the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>samples</b> in the current segment. The effect of interference intro- duced from adjacent segments is theoretically analyzed, and it is revealed that the interference consists of two interference levels having different impacts to the signal reconstruction performance. With these observations, a two-step orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) procedure is proposed for segment reconstruction, which takes into account different interference levels and partially known support of the previous segment. The proposed SegSR achieves nearly optimal reconstruction performance with a signi- ficant reduction of computational loads and storage requirements. Theoretical analyses and simulations verify its effectiveness. Comment: 13 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt is well {{proved that}} the signals {{transmitted}} through a mutipath channel experience Rayleigh fading. The channel also varies due to the moving of user end or the scatters and Doppler shift effect is generated. Researchers have to consider these two effects in their studies of wireless communications. Some researchers use step channel model which is too idealized to simulate MIMO systems. Besides, sum-of-sinusoid based simulators are widely used among which Jakes' simulator is the most well-known. However this kind of simulator has to strive for the deficiencies in higher-order statistics due to the approximation of random variables by determinants. In this paper, we propose a time selective channel model used for laboratory simulations from a new sight which can avoid the above drawbacks. The channel is reconstructed by sinc function based on <b>Nyquist's</b> <b>sampling</b> theorem. The performance of DSTM scheme is evaluated in this new channel model.

50|$|The Nyquist {{frequency}} {{should not}} be confused with the Nyquist rate, which is the minimum sampling rate that satisfies the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>sampling</b> criterion for a given signal or family of signals. The Nyquist rate is twice the maximum component frequency of the function being sampled. For example, the Nyquist rate for the sinusoid at 0.6 fs is 1.2 fs, which means that at the fs rate, it is being undersampled. Thus, Nyquist rate is a property of a continuous-time signal, whereas Nyquist frequency is a property of a discrete-time system.|$|E

50|$|In practice, radio astronomers rarely {{recover the}} {{brightness}} distribution of a source by directly taking the inverse Fourier transform of a measured visibility function.

Astronomers therefore take advantage of physical constraints on the brightness distribution of astronomical sources {{to reduce the number of}} observations which must be made. Because the brightness distribution must be real and positive everywhere, the visibility function cannot take on arbitrary values in unsampled regions. Thus, a non-linear deconvolution algorithm like CLEAN or Maximum Entropy may be used to approximately reconstruct the brightness distribution of the source from a limited number of observations.|$|E

5000|$|A bank of {{receivers}} can {{be created}} by performing a sequence of FFTs on overlapping segments of the input data stream. A weighting function (aka window function) is applied to each segment to control {{the shape of the}} frequency responses of the filters. The wider the shape, the more often the FFTs have to be done to satisfy the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>sampling</b> criteria. [...] For a fixed segment length, the amount of overlap determines how often the FFTs are done (and vice versa). Also, the wider the shape of the filters, the fewer filters that are needed to span the input bandwidth. Eliminating unnecessary filters (i.e. decimation in frequency) is efficiently done by treating each weighted segment as a sequence of smaller blocks, and the FFT is performed on only the sum of the blocks. This has been referred to as multi-block windowing and weighted pre-sum FFT (see Sampling the DTFT).|$|E
5000|$|Conventional CS {{reconstruction}} uses sparse signals (usually sampled {{at a rate}} {{less than}} the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>sampling</b> rate) for reconstruction through constrained [...] minimization. One of the earliest applications of such an approach was in reflection seismology which used sparse reflected signals from band-limited data for tracking changes between sub-surface layers. [...] When the LASSO model came into prominence in the 1990s as a statistical method for selection of sparse models, this method was further used in computational harmonic analysis for sparse signal representation from over-complete dictionaries. Some of the other applications include incoherent sampling of radar pulses. The work by Boyd et al. has applied the LASSO model- for selection of sparse models- towards analog to digital converters (the current ones use a sampling rate higher than the Nyquist rate along with the quantized Shannon representation). This would involve a parallel architecture in which the polarity of the analog signal changes at a high rate followed by digitizing the integral {{at the end of}} each time-interval to obtain the converted digital signal.|$|E
50|$|Data {{acquisition}} hardware for {{acoustic measurements}} typically utilizes 24-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), anti-aliasing filters, and other signal conditioning. This signal conditioning may include amplification, filtering, sensor excitation, and input configuration. Another consideration is the frequency {{range of the}} instrumentation. It should {{be large enough to}} cover the frequency range of signal interest, taking into account the range of the sensor. To prevent aliasing, many devices come with antialiasing filters, which cut the maximum frequency range of the device to a little less than one-half the maximum sampling rate, as prescribed by the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>sampling</b> theorem. Dynamic range is a common way to compare performance from one instrument to another. Dynamic range is a measure of how small you can measure a signal relative to the maximum input signal the device can measure. Expressed in decibels, the dynamic range is 20 log (Vmax/Vmin). For example, a device with an input range of ±10 V and a dynamic range of 110 dB will be able to measure a signal as small as 10 µV. Thus, the input range and the specified dynamic range are important for determining the needs of your instrumentation system.
