5|$|Northern Laos, however, was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{priority}} for the Americans. It was decided at the Honolulu Executive Conference of April 1965 that U.S. aircraft {{could be used for}} interdiction in Laos only after close air support needs were met in South Vietnam. General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial South Vietnam. That decision placed Barrel Roll behind South Vietnam, Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger in order of precedence. Only an estimated two percent of the total U.S. aerial effort in Southeast Asia was going to be utilized in northern Laos.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} that she was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> success on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over {{the next few months}} she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just big enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and {{people have the right to}} defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fugitive, instead her husband {{was going to go to}} the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{way of doing business}} was to make the product as and when it was ordered. This style was very slow, As Deere realized that this was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.|$|E
25|$|What {{is often}} {{overlooked}} {{is that the}} contractor is now financing the project when they perform work and do not receive prompt payment for that work. The contractor is now tying up valuable capital {{that could be used}} elsewhere while waiting for the end of a project. In addition, the contractor must bear the cost of litigation in order to enforce their mechanic's lien rights. For disputes of a minor value, a mechanic's lien is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cost-effective method of obtaining payment for services.|$|E

25|$|A real The Last Starfighter arcade game by Atari, Inc. is {{promised in}} the end credits, but was never released. If released, the game would have been Atari's first 3D {{polygonal}} arcade game to use a Motorola 68000 as the CPU. Gameplay would have been taken from game scenes and space battle scenes in the film and would have included the same controller that was used on the first Star Wars arcade game. The game was abandoned once Atari representatives saw the film in post-production and decided it was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> financial success.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} officially {{unveiled}} on November 20, when Activision {{announced it was}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> direct adaptation of the film, but a stand-alone story which takes place after {{the events of the}} film. The 360° combat system was also demonstrated for the first time. The game was next shown at E3 in May 2002, where the Rage system was revealed. On May 23, IGN published a full preview. Writer Jeremy Dunham liked the idea of the 360° combat system but found it difficult to get used to, and especially difficult to switch from one target to another. He also found the camera system to have faults, often getting caught behind walls and doors. However, he praised the game for capturing the spirit of the film well (something which he felt the first game had failed to do) and admitted he was looking forward to the final build.|$|E

Harrison commented: [...] "I decided... I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great sitar player... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier." [...] Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre.

In March 2014, playwright Rolin Jones told the Hartford Courant that he was writing a new screenplay for the film. Comparing it to the musical, Jones said, [...] "The {{idea is to get}} it a little dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms. There's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lot of dialogue and it probably should be a little shorter, too. After that, it just takes its 'movie time' in getting done".

500|$|When Asche {{reached the}} major leagues, he was {{regarded}} as having decent potential at the plate, perhaps comparable to Mariners' third baseman Kyle Seager. While he hit for power in the minor leagues, his big league power {{was expected to be}} adequate, perhaps averaging 12–14 home runs per season. Baseball Prospect Nation reported that he [...] "gets pull happy when he sells out for power and ultimately swings too hard at times." [...] Like most left-handed hitters, Asche performed better against right-handed pitchers than left-handed pitchers, hitting [...]238 off the former and [...]219 off the latter in the major leagues during 2013. FanGraphs columnist Michael Barr summarized Asche's offensive potential by writing, [...] "He's certainly <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> world beater, but having double digit home run and speed potential while hitting something in the [...]275 range is likely the kind of hitter than many of you could use at third base." ...|$|E

Though Mori possesses a strength and fury that should serve well against the Kaiju, Pentecost is reluctant to use her, partly because of a fatherly bond and partly because he knows she is still fighting the terror of her childhood. Del Toro stated: [...] "I was very careful how I built the movie. One {{of the other things}} I decided was that I wanted a female lead who has the equal force as the male leads. She's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sex kitten, she's not going to come out in cutoff shorts and a tank top, and it's {{going to be a real}} earnestly drawn character."

Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t {{know what kind of}} mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 8, 2006, Lonsdale {{got into}} a {{physical}} altercation with a Scientologist while filming the Church of Scientology in Clearwater. A spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology told Bay News 9 that Lonsdale had been harassing their staff members, and that the fight {{was not related to}} the church. Lonsdale stated [...] "Basically, I'm filming a pseudo-documentary for one of our free-access Pinellas web channels," [...] and said that while filming a Scientologist came out of a coffee shop and yelled that Lonsdale was a religious bigot. Lonsdale stated [...] "I picked up the camera again and started filming him ... He went right for my face and my head, backed me up into a pole to which I had no other choice but to defend myself." [...] The Scientologist was arrested by Clearwater police and charged with battery, but the State Attorney's Office of Florida decided not to pursue charges. After the incident the Clearwater police Deputy Chief viewed a videotape of the altercation, and concluded that Lonsdale was the victim and that his police officers made the right decision in arresting the Scientologist. After viewing the videotape, the Assistant State Attorney stated [...] "it is just <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> prosecutable case," [...] and said that the video shows [...] "pretty much mutual aggression" [...] between Lonsdale and the Scientologist. The Assistant State Attorney stated that the video showed aggression on both sides, and that Lonsdale's criticism of Scientology on the internet made the case [...] "unprosecutable". Lonsdale's attorney Luke Lirot stated [...] "It is another example of the State Attorney's Office's historical reluctance to tangle with Scientology." [...] Scientology spokeswoman Pat Harney said that church members had been told to avoid Lonsdale, and told the St. Petersburg Times that Scientologists had complained to police that they felt Lonsdale was stalking them. The police did not charge Lonsdale, stating that he had the right to take photos and video in public places.|$|E

Much of the damage is worse than initially thought, and the lift's 36-tonne haul rope will have to be replaced.
