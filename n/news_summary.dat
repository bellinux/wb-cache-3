25|$|Throughout its run as an {{independent}} station, The 10 o'clock News was the only news program on KTVU. The station first began programming news outside its established 10:00p.m. slot in September 1986, when it debuted 2 at Noon. Originally anchored by Barbara Simpson and Bob MacKenzie, the hour-long midday news-talk program—which replaced syndicated game shows in the noon time slot—featured a hybrid of in-depth interviews and various lifestyle features, preceded by a <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> during the first half-hour. The program was reformatted into a more traditional newscast in 1990, as The Noon News, at which time it was shortened to a half-hour (the newscast would eventually revert to an hour on April 7, 2016). In September 1989, the station debuted a half-hour 6:00p.m. newscast, The 6:00 News, which lasted until its cancellation in 1991.|$|E

T. Shakespeare, Sir Patrick McGovern and station manager George Barlin also assisted with the opening proceedings. An introduction to CTC's on-screen personalities was followed by a <b>news</b> <b>summary.</b> Viewers were then treated to a film of the Queen's Birthday Procession from the military barracks at Duntroon (filmed earlier that day), followed by an hour of variety with The B.P. Super Show hosted by Margaret Fonteyn. The detective series Michael Shayne made its premiere on CTC then a kinescope of the opening ceremony was screened. The first night's programming concluded with an epilogue and a preview of the following day's programmes before ending transmission at 10:30pm.|$|E

Halsema, former mayor of Baguio, swatted flies and mopped floors; his wife Marie prepared vegetables for cooking; married daughter Betty Foley prepared baby food, washed clothes, and supervised school study halls; her husband, Rupert, cut and hauled firewood; and brother James Halsema, a graduate of Duke University, edited a daily <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> and helped push a garbage wagon. “…work assignments followed an elaborate ‘Master Sheet’, drawn up by internee Gus Skerl, that would have done credit to the operational studies of a major corporation.” Dr. Augustus (Gus) Skerl, a British mining geologist, also grew yeast on banana skins gleaned from the garbage to provide vitamin B to those suffering from beri-beri. When soap ran short, Skerl made soap from alkali derived from peanut shells.|$|E

[...] His daily assignments included developing political strategy, publishing the President's Daily <b>News</b> <b>Summary,</b> and preparing briefing books for news conferences. [...] He accompanied Nixon on his trip to China in 1972 and the summit in Moscow, Yalta and Minsk in 1974.
