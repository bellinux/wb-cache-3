40|$|Aim : {{several studies}} have shown that supracondylar {{fractures}} could be treated with two or three lateral pins. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the stability of lateral pinning with two or three pins with two pins bridged with a small <b>non-invasive</b> <b>device,</b> which would allow the operator to use only two pins instead of three. Methods : fifteen synthetic humerus were cut at the level of the center of the olecranon fossea to simulate supracondylar fractures. All the samples were fixed with parallel pins (Kirschner, diameter 1. 6 mm) with lateral entry. Three different pins configurations were tested : two pins, two bridged pins and three pins. Each sample was tested in internal and external rotations using a MTS 809 axial / torsional Test System to measure the torsional stiffness and the torque needed to reach an angle of 10 degrees. A statistical analysis using the Student Law was performed. Results : configurations with two pins, bridged with the <b>non-invasive</b> <b>device</b> or not, had identical mechanical properties. The configurations with three pins demonstrated the following change in mechanical properties, respectively over two pins and over two bridged pins : an increase in internal torsional stiffness of 21. 2 % and 25. 3 %, an increase in external torsional stiffness of 15 % and 6. 8 %; concerning the maximum torque needed to reach an angle of 10 degrees, the increase for internal rotation was 15. 1 % and 16. 4 % and the increase for external rotation was 12. 4 % and 13. 3 %. The bridging device did not provide an increase in mechanical properties, which could have avoided the use of a third pin. However, this study showed that the third pin increased all four mechanical properties measured, increase that is needed to fix unstable reduced supracondylar fracture. Our samples showed a statistically significant result (P< 0. 05) for the torsional stiffness in external rotation between two and three pins. No statistical difference was made between two pins configurations. Clinical relevance : the opportunity to bridge two pins configuration with a small <b>non-invasive</b> <b>device</b> to reach a mechanical stability equivalent to a configuration with three pins would avoid one invasive pinning procedure and its iatrogenic complications...|$|E
