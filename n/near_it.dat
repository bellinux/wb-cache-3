5|$|Mud Creek {{is named}} for its muddiness. An area <b>near</b> <b>it</b> was settled as early as 1772 and several bridges were built across it and its tributaries in the 20th century. The creek is {{designated}} as a warm-water fishery.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its length, {{the highway}} gently climbs the Niagara Escarpment, {{reaching}} the top east of Stanley Avenue before crossing the Niagara Gorge. The highway {{is surrounded by}} forest to either side {{for most of its}} length, and the only settlement <b>near</b> <b>it</b> is the village of Queenston.|$|E
5|$|An ephemeral natural pool {{system is}} located in the {{vicinity}} of Scotch Run. In the past, a reservoir was created on the stream by damming it. In the 21st century, a small residential area and a number of roads are present <b>near</b> <b>it.</b> The forests and vernal pools on Scotch Run are fragmented by dirt roads. The habitat quality of the area may also be impaired by All Terrain Vehicles. Additionally, the vernal pools may be used as breeding grounds for mosquitos.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or <b>near</b> <b>it.</b> Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they <b>near</b> <b>it</b> and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E
5|$|Other than tourist venues, Arad's {{commerce}} {{is mostly}} {{concentrated in the}} central commerce area, as envisioned in the original plan. There is one shopping mall in the city, the Arad Mall, in the northern block of the commerce sector. In addition to the main area, there are small shop clusters in most neighborhoods in the city, notably a building called The Star (HaKokhav) in the Tlalim quarter. A lone supermarket outside the center, Mega in the City, {{is located in the}} industrial zone, near the entrance to the city, and a major shopping complex is planned <b>near</b> <b>it</b> by a real estate company called Zim Centers. The Arad Market, open on Mondays, is located in the light industry zone.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star {{to the south}} celestial pole. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times the diameter of our Sun. Lying <b>near</b> <b>it</b> is VW Hydri, {{one of the brightest}} dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus have been found to have exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.|$|E
5|$|Dana discovers Em {{was killed}} by Lester Majak, an aging local celebrity. Majak was a {{physical}} trainer who was convinced his fitness regime would extend his life. When he began to notice his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em <b>near</b> <b>it</b> in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal and South India, Shashthi is worshipped on {{the sixth}} day after {{childbirth}} and on Aranya-Shashthi (also called Jamai-Shashthi), the sixth day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Jyeshtha. Her worship can be performed in the house, where she is symbolised as an earthenware pitcher; she may also be worshipped outdoors in a natural, open space consecrated to her, termed a shashthitala. In honour of Shashthi, women tie a stone in a small rag to the branch of a tree in the shasthitala: a mother does this to ask for long life for her child, while a barren woman does so to entreat the goddess to aid her in conceiving. The vrata (ritual) performed {{on the day of}} Jamai-Shashthi is also prescribed to be performed by pregnant women at least once on any Monday, Tuesday, Friday or Saturday in the month of Jyestha. Dough images of Shashthi and her black cat are prepared and worshipped, along with a water pitcher with a banyan tree branch <b>near</b> <b>it.</b> Betel nuts and leaves, fruits, sweets and kheer are offered to her in units of six. In North India, Shashthi is worshipped {{in the form of the}} banyan tree, which is sacred to her.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the brick schoolhouse that faces west onto Constitution Square and stands between the Watts-Bell House and Grayson's Tavern. Local {{tradition}} holds that it dates to approximately {{the same time as}} the buildings <b>near</b> <b>it</b> and that it housed a private school. According to the Danville-Boyle County Convention and Visitors Bureau, it was constructed around 1820 and was the first brick schoolhouse west of the Allegheny Mountains. The single-story, two-room edifice is built upon a fieldstone foundation with brick laid in common bond and an off-center entrance with a transom above. While Constitution Square was a part of the state park system, the park manager lived in the schoolhouse. After the park's transfer to Boyle County, the schoolhouse was converted into a conference center with meeting space.|$|E
5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's animations, including animations that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as reaching out for a cart handle as the player moved the boy <b>near</b> <b>it.</b> Jensen felt this was important as the character was always {{at the center of the}} player's screen, and the most important element to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy's {{two main}} companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint {{elliptical}} galaxies that lie <b>near</b> <b>it.</b> M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes, compared to M110, appears superimposed {{on the larger}} galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge, M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy; M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core. M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0. M110 is classified as either a dwarf spheroidal galaxy or simply a generic elliptical galaxy. It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of user-made scenarios or series of scenarios (campaigns) {{for the game}} was made possible using the Scenario Builder. This tool is simpler and easier to learn than comparable editors used in more modern games, but it has fewer capabilities as a result. Ensemble Studios used the Scenario Builder to make the single-player campaigns which shipped with the retail game. Various unofficial sites exist where custom scenarios can be submitted and downloaded. In late 2005, {{it was discovered that}} by modifying various data files, units present in the beta versions of the game could be made available in the editor. Some obscure units include a spaceship and a hero that changes ownership when units move <b>near</b> <b>it.</b> Through data editing, the rules of unit placement can also be modified. This allows units to be placed on any terrain and on top of other units, which creates new possibilities for design. Other significant discoveries include new terrain templates, a mode to triple each unit's hitpoints and a tool to edit map sizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{urban area}} has a {{population}} density of 3035/km2 (7,864/mi²), while the rural and suburban areas have a density of 355.5/km2 (920/mi²). The rural areas {{away from the city}} tend to be scarcely populated, becoming denser <b>near</b> <b>it.</b> During the summer the resident population in the city triples; this seasonal movement from neighbouring cities is due to the draw of the beach and 29.9% of homes had seasonal use in 2001, the highest in Greater Porto. Póvoa de Varzim is the youngest city in the region with a birth rate of 13.665 and mortality rate of 8.330. Unlike other urban areas of greater Porto, it is not a satellite city. Significant commuting occurs only with Vila do Conde, an urban expansion area of Póvoa since the 18th century.|$|E
