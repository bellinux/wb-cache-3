5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E
5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have <b>not</b> <b>improved.</b> Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E

5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some, however further research is necessary. It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> with medications and for whom surgery is not an option. About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability. Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are <b>not</b> <b>improved.</b> VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{worked through the}} {{procedures}} and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers on the ground closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had <b>not</b> <b>improved.</b> Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E

5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still <b>not</b> <b>improved,</b> and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Philosophers {{in antiquity}} used {{the concept of}} force {{in the study of}} {{stationary}} and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 3 was {{released}} for the Microsoft Windows and Dreamcast platforms in 2000, featuring enhanced 3D character models and higher resolution graphics. The Dreamcast version includes more alternate costumes {{than in the}} PlayStation version. Critical reception for these ports was not as positive. The Microsoft Windows version was criticized for not being optimized for keyboard and mouse and for not letting players save their progress at any time. Critics noted {{that some of the}} pre-rendered backgrounds in the Dreamcast version of the game were <b>not</b> <b>improved,</b> resulting in them looking not as good as the PlayStation version's due to the Dreamcast's higher graphic fidelity. CVC generally praised the Dreamcast version, but admitted that the difference in graphical quality between Resident Evil 3 and Code: Veronica was very large.|$|E
5|$|Since Sri Lanka gained {{independence}} from Britain in 1948, {{relations between the}} majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities have been strained. Rising ethnic and political tensions, along with ethnic riots in 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983, {{led to the formation}} and strengthening of militant groups advocating independence for Tamils. The ensuing civil war resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000people and the forced disappearance of thousands of others. The civil war ended in 2009 but there are continuing allegations of atrocities being committed by the Sri Lankan Military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during its final months. A United Nations panel found that as many as 40,000 civilians may {{have been killed in the}} final months of the civil war. The end of the civil war has <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> conditions in Sri Lanka, with press freedom not being restored and judiciary coming under political control.|$|E
5|$|The Principia was {{published}} on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe {{the relationship between}} any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements {{continue to be the}} underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.|$|E

5|$|What {{became known}} as the King's Highway were a series of foot paths which the Mohawk had long used to get from west in the valley through the Pine Bush to trade with other tribes at the {{confluence}} of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers. This area was later the site of the Dutch Fort Orange. After the founding of Schenectady, the name was used for what became a major route between the two settlements but, until the mid-18th century, it was <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> beyond a foot path. During the war from 1699 to 1707, Albany residents collected firewood from the Pine Bush for the large army that was camped at Fort Frederick.|$|E
5|$|Ipswich {{were finally}} {{relegated to the}} Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1985–86 season. Terry Butcher, their last {{remaining}} key player from the successful 1981 team, was sold to Rangers that summer. Ferguson, who had remained in charge despite the relegation, resigned in May 1987 after reaching the promotion play-offs but failing to return the club to the first division. Ipswich Town were then managed by John Duncan for three years until he was replaced by former West Ham boss John Lyall in May 1990, with Ipswich still in the Second Division. Lyall guided Ipswich to the Second Division title and promotion to the new FA Premier League, ready for the 1992–93 season. Suffering only two league defeats before the New Year, Ipswich started the season well and were fourth in the Premier League in January 1993, but a dip in form during the final weeks of the season saw Ipswich finish in a disappointing 16th place. Poor form continued into the following season and Ipswich only avoided relegation that year when Sheffield United suffered a last-gasp 3–2 defeat at Chelsea on the final day of the season. Six months later, fortunes on the pitch had <b>not</b> <b>improved,</b> and Lyall was sacked as Ipswich manager in December 1994 with the club rooted to the bottom of the Premiership.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E

5|$|Remaining {{in such a}} {{position}} would require Mercedes-Benz to produce a competitive car for the 1936 season. Although the chassis of the W25 was shortened, and the engine was significantly upgraded to 4.74litres, the car proved inferior to the Type C developed by Auto Union. Mercedes had <b>not</b> <b>improved</b> the chassis to match the engine, and the W25 proved uncompetitive and unreliable. Despite this, Caracciola opened {{the season with a}} win in the rain at the Monaco Grand Prix, after starting from third position. He led the Hungarian Grand Prix early but retired with mechanical problems. At the German Grand Prix, he retired with a failed fuel pump, before taking over his teammate Hermann Lang's car; he later retired that car with supercharger problems. Caracciola led the Swiss Grand Prix for several laps, Rosemeyer trailing him closely, but the Clerk of the Course ordered Caracciola to cede the lead to Rosemeyer on the ninth lap after he was found to be blocking the Auto Union. The two had a heated argument after the race despite Caracciola's later retirement with a rear axle problem. Mercedes were so uncompetitive in 1936—Caracciola won only twice, in Monaco and Tunis—that Neubauer withdrew the team mid-season, leaving Rosemeyer to take the Championship for Auto Union.|$|E
5|$|Schuyler's health declined, so Montgomery assumed {{command of}} the daily {{functions}} of the army. On September 10, a larger force of 1,700 men led by Montgomery moved toward the fort. In the swampy area around the fort, it was so dark that two parties of Americans ran into each other; each feared the other to be the British, and both fled. Montgomery ran to intercept them and ended the flight. As they advanced toward the fort, the force came under British grapeshot fire. One party of Americans attacked the British breastworks, inflicting 2 casualties, after which they fell back. The next morning, Montgomery called a council of war, {{in which it was}} agreed to make another attack on the fort. However, word spread that a British warship was advancing up the river, and half the New England troops fled out of fright. Montgomery, believing his force could no longer take the fort, retreated back to Île aux Noix. Montgomery, furious at the flight of the New England troops, asked Schuyler to appoint a court-martial board. Meanwhile, Schuyler's health had <b>not</b> <b>improved.</b> He left for Ticonderoga on the 16th to recover, giving full control of the operation to Montgomery.|$|E
