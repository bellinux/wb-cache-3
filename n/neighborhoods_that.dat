5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days.

Specific locations included Greenwich Village, the East Village, Times Square, and Washington Square Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors sang to pre-recorded tracks. In order to save money on hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late at night with a handheld camera. The rooftop location near the Empire State Building is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E

5|$|Route 70 {{crosses the}} Pennsauken Creek into Evesham Township, Burlington County, running east through more {{commercial}} areas within the Marlton {{section of the}} township. A short distance later, the route intersects Route 73 at an interchange that was formerly the Marlton Circle. After the Marlton Circle, the road heads east passing through some more commercial areas and then into residential <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>that</b> are separated from the road by trees, narrowing into a two-lane undivided road. It continues into a mix of suburban development and rural woods and farms as it crosses into Medford Township, coming to a crossroads with CR 618. From this intersection, Route 70 continues east through the Medford area, passing a couple shopping centers before crossing CR 541. After the CR 541 intersection, the route leaves the suburban development and runs through a mix of woodland and farmland with occasional homes. It enters Southampton Township, where the road enters more wooded surroundings before coming to U.S. Route 206 at the Red Lion Circle.|$|E
5|$|M-85 {{starts a}} {{directional}} interchange with I-75 in near Rockwood; traffic {{to or from}} southbound I-75 must use Gibraltar Road instead. M-85 runs north from this interchange to Gibraltar Road as a full freeway; north of that intersection the highway becomes a boulevard.

The highway runs northeasterly through Gibraltar to Trenton, where it turns due north. Fort Street forms the boundary between Riverview and Trenton in the area near the Riverview Landing Shopping Center between King and Silbey Roads; north of here, Riverview extends along both sides of the road. At Pennsylvania Road, Fort Street crosses into the city of Southgate and curves to the northeast near the Southgate Tower office building. The highway returns to a due northerly course near Memorial Park and continues along the Southgate–Wyandotte city line.
