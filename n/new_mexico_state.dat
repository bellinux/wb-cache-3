5|$|Before 1926, all {{of modern}} US491 existed as state routes. In New Mexico, US666 absorbed {{a portion of}} State Road 32 (NM32) from Gallup to Shiprock, and {{completely}} replaced NM121 from Shiprock to the Colorado state line. The portion in Colorado was numbered State Highway108 (SH108) from the <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> <b>state</b> line to Cortez, and SH10 from Cortez to Utah. At the time, SH10 traversed the southern portion of Colorado. While most of this route was absorbed by the U.S. Highway System, a portion of it still exists. In Utah, the route was originally numbered State Route 9 (SR9), which also included what is now US191 from Monticello to Crescent Junction. Utah has since re-used the SR9 designation for a different road.|$|E

5|$|US-64 {{was one of}} the {{original}} United States Numbered Highways designated at the highway system's creation on November 11, 1926. It stretched from the <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> <b>state</b> line in the Oklahoma panhandle east to the Arkansas state line near Fort Smith. The original route included two sharp, right-angle turns near the city of Freedom. On February 19, 1934, the Oklahoma Highway Commission approved the re-routing of US-64 onto a roadway a bit further west to eliminate these turns. On November 9, 1937, the highway was re-routed through the city of Tulsa, as well. Later, in 1943 just south of the city of Muskogee, US-64 and SH-2, which was then concurrent with US-64, were relocated slightly to the west to allow for the new Davis Field air base to be constructed at the place the highways had run before relocation.|$|E
