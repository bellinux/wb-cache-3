5|$|A row {{of fifty}} <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce</b> trees lines the main {{driveway}} {{leading to the}} farm. These trees represent the fifty U.S. states, and were given to Eisenhower as birthday presents {{from each of the}} state Republican Party chairmen in 1955. The furthest one from the house was the tree representing Texas, and it was seen as a mark of Eisenhower's recovery {{that he was able to}} walk that far after his heart attack.|$|E
5|$|The Fortingall Yew is {{an ancient}} tree in the churchyard of the village of Fortingall in Perthshire. Various {{estimates}} have put its age at between 2,000 and 5,000 years; recent research into yew tree ages {{suggests that it is}} likely to be nearer the lower limit of 2,000 years. This still makes it the oldest tree in Europe, although there is an older <b>Norway</b> <b>Spruce</b> root system in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce.</b> Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E

5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (<b>Norway</b> <b>spruce)</b> woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies grow on the ground. Phellodon species, {{like all}} members of the order Thelephorales, are thought to be mycorrhizal, forming {{symbiotic}} relationships with trees. Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae. The ectomycorrhizae that P.niger forms with <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope ratio analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P.niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host.|$|E
5|$|Russula densifolia is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Descriptions {{have been}} published of the morphology of the ectomycorrhizae that it forms with European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies). Its mushrooms grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups in both mixed and deciduous forests, and tend {{to appear in the}} summer and autumn. In Spain, it is common in dune pine forests. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the fungus Asterophora lycoperdoides. Widely distributed, Russula densifolia is known from Asia (including China, India, Japan, and Thailand), Europe and North America.|$|E

50|$|Isorhapontin is a stilbenoid. It is the {{glucoside}} of isorhapontigenin. It can {{be found}} in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots of <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> (Picea abies), in the bark of Picea sitchensis or in white spruce (Picea glauca).|$|R
5|$|Amanita gemmata is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with <b>Norway</b> <b>Spruce</b> (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E
5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce,</b> but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E
5|$|Maple {{and lime}} forests {{are found in}} gulleys. These forests are only present in {{isolated}} areas and {{are at risk of}} extinction. Downy oak woods are more common in the Aosta Valley area than in the Piedmont area because of its higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Oak is not a typical species in the park and it is often found mixed with Scots pine. The park's chestnut groves have been affected by human cultivation for wood and fruit. It rarely grows above 1,000 metres (3,280ft), and the most important chestnut forests are in the park's Piedmontese side. The park's conifer woods include Scots pine groves, spruce forests dominated by the <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce,</b> often mixed with larch. Larch and Swiss stone pine woods are found up to the highest sub-alpine level (2200–2300 metres (7,217-7,546ft)).|$|E
5000|$|... p-Hydroxybenzoic acid {{glucoside}}, picein, piceatannol and its glucoside (astringin), isorhapontin (the isorhapontigenin glucoside), catechin and {{ferulic acid}} are phenolic compounds found in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots of <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces.</b> Piceol and astringin {{are also found}} in P. abies.|$|R
50|$|A {{branch and}} stem canker {{associated}} with the fungus Valsa kunzei Fr. var. picea was reported on white and <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> in Ontario (Jorgensen and Cafley 1961) and Quebec (Ouellette and Bard 1962). In Ontario, only trees of low vigour were affected, but in Quebec vigorous trees were also infected.|$|R
50|$|Piceatannol and its glucoside, astringin, are {{phenolic}} compounds found in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots of <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> (Picea abies). It {{can also be}} found in the seeds of the palm Aiphanes horrida and in Gnetum cleistostachyum. The chemical structure of piceatannol was established by Cunningham et al. as being an analog of resveratrol.|$|R
5|$|Other Mycenas that {{resemble}} M.adscendens include M.alphitophora and M.stylobates. The former is distinguished from M.adscendens by a stem base {{that is not}} swollen or disc-like, the latter by its larger and sturdier fruit body and lack of granules on the cap. A poorly known Japanese species, M.cryptomeriicola, is similar to M.adscendens, but has non-amyloid spores and lacks clamps. M.nucicola is most reliably distinguished from M.adscendens by microscopic characteristics: M.nucicola has four-spored basidia, clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of the gill tissue, and the spores are less broad (typically 4.2–5µm). The Finnish species M.occulta grows on the decaying needles of <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce</b> and Scots pine. It differs from M.adscendens in that its gills do not form a pseudocollarium, it lacks clamps in the hyphae and cells of the hymenium, and the terminal cells in its cap cuticle are densely covered with protuberances.|$|E
25|$|The Jamtish flora {{is heavily}} {{characterized}} by temperate coniferous forest, taiga, a forest inhabited by <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce</b> and pine trees. Among the two the <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce</b> is more common. The <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce</b> actually grows most densely in Jämtland {{together with the}} southern parts of Lapland. Here roughly 60 percent of the forests consist of spruces.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{two thirds}} of the park are covered with forests, mainly with spruce and <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea abies). The most {{widespread}} tree is the <b>Norway</b> <b>spruce,</b> followed by the Scots pine, Swiss pine (Pinus cembra), European larch (Larix decidua), and mountain pine. Leafy trees, especially maples, mainly grow in the Belianske Tatras.|$|E
50|$|Arppe {{promoted}} afforestation {{in order}} to maintain availability of the natural resource. He planted a larch forest between Koivikko and Puhos. The 1847 planted 12-ha forest included 3,000 saplings which were Siberian and European larch, and some local Scots pines and <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> for reference. The forest is the largest larch forest of Finland and it is nowadays natural reserve.|$|R
50|$|Rhizosphaera infects white spruce, {{blue spruce}} (Picea pungens), and <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> {{throughout}} Ontario, causing severe defoliation and sometimes killing small, stressed trees. White spruce is intermediately susceptible. Dead needles show rows of black fruiting bodies. Infection usually begins on lower branches. On white spruce, infected needles are usually retained {{on the tree}} into the following summer. The fungicide Chlorthalonil is registered for controlling this needle cast (Davis 1997).|$|R
30|$|Supportive to Timo’s {{contribution}} are {{two additional}} studies from Finland. Olavi Laiho et al. (2014) present “Height increment of understorey <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> under different tree canopies” and Sauli Valkonen et al. (2014) “Ingrowth, survival and height growth of small trees in uneven-aged Picea abies stands in southern Finland”. There is renewed interest {{to test the}} potential of continuous cover forestry (CCF) in Scandinavian countries, and studies on growth survival of small trees are essential.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the species composition of insect assemblages colonising stumps of Picea abies (L.) Karst. in mountain conditions. Investigations were carried out in the Eastern Sudetes (south–western Poland) in forest stands situated at 600 – 700 m above sea level.

40|$|The main {{hypothesis}} {{tested in}} this paper is whether heavy thinnings affect the correlations among ring width, wood density, and mean tracheid length. Within-tree correlations were calculated between time series of yearly measurements. Among-tree correlations were computed (1) between averages over a growing period and (2) year by year. Correlations were analyzed on 20 fast-grown and 20 slow-grown <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) from an even-aged, plantation-grown stand near Rendeux, Belgian Ardennes. In the within-tree approach, fast-grown spruces showed a stronger negative correlation between ring width and fiber length. In among-tree approach 1, the widely held negative correlation between ring width and wood density vanished when the spruce growth rate was above 2. 2 cm/year in circumference. Among-tree approach 2 demonstrated that the magnitude and sign of the correlations also depended on the year; a few years showed a significant correlation between ring width and wood density for the fast-grown <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces,</b> whereas the correlation was systematically negative and significant on many years for the slow-grown spruces. This study may explain part of the contradictory results {{reported in the literature}} concerning hypotheses similar to ours...|$|R

50|$|Cytospora canker was {{observed}} by Ouellette et al. (1965) {{in all the}} plantations of white and <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> examined in the Province of Quebec, {{as well as in}} some natural stands of indigenous spruce. Disease incidence was particularly high in the Grand-Mère and Saint-Lazare plantations where it had been present since at least 1943 and 1955, respectively. Periods favourable to infection had occurred at fairly regular intervals, and the aggressiveness of canker development varied year by year. Rainfall, temperature, and disease intensity were not clearly correlated.|$|R
50|$|The montane {{zones are}} {{relatively}} {{rare in the}} park, as its upper limit is about 500 m below most altitudes in these northern latitudes. The flora of this zone is constituted by old-growth forests of conifers, with mainly Scots pines and including <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces.</b> The pines can become very tall, particularly those around Lake Rittak, in the south part of the park. The undergrowth is mostly covered with mosses and lichens, in particular reindeer lichen, and also with Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum and cowberry.|$|R
40|$|Fourteen <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ], {{randomly}} sampled as 7 fast-grown and 7 slow-grown trees, {{were used}} to test whether an increased tree growth rate in circumference affects the intra-ring and inter-ring trajectories of the microfibril angle in the S- 2 layer of the tracheid wall. Those trajectories describe the fluctuations of the S- 2 microfibril angle, respectively, from earlywood to latewood within rings and from pith to bark among rings. Using the cross-field pit apertures, intra-ring measures of microfibril angle were made at 11 equally-spaced sampling sites over each of 8 growth rings, following an 11 x 8 doubly repeated measures design with the tree as the 'subject' on which repeated measures were made. All the intra-ring trajectories of microfibril angle decreased linearly from earlywood to latewood, whereas the intra-ring trajectories showed significant year effects. Both types of trajectories are significantly affected by the growth rate after first thinning, as the fast-grown spruces showed a systematically larger microfibril angle and a mean microfibril angle of 29 degrees compared to 21 degrees for the slow-grown spruces. Thus, lower tensile and tear strengths of tracheids {{as well as some}} modifications of the mechanical properties of solid wood and paper can be expected from <b>Norway</b> <b>spruces</b> growing faster than 2. 2 cm/year in circumference...|$|R
