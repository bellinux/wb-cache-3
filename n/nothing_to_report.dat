25|$|The {{peace talks}} in Paris, the {{viability}} of South Vietnam, of its military and its government, {{and its effect on}} American disengagement, became the prime stories during this period for the news media. The reportage of the Tet/Khe Sanh period had been unique, and after it was over reportage settled back into its normal routines. According to Clarence Wyatt, the American disengagement was:like watching a film running backward. American troops were leaving, until there were only a handful of advisers left. The communists were once again on the advance, spreading their influence {{closer and closer to the}} major cities. The South Vietnamese military was once again on the defensive, and the leadership of the nation was isolated and increasingly paranoid... Nixon's goal, like Kennedy's, was for the press to have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>report.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although SIGINT {{had earlier}} alerted Jackson to the {{possible}} {{presence of a}} strong Viet Cong force {{in the vicinity of}} Nui Dat 2, patrols of the area revealed nothing and as a consequence B Company did not expect to meet significant opposition. Stepping off early on 17 August they believed they would not be out long and were only lightly equipped in patrol order, lacking sleeping gear and rations. With just 80 men—including many due to commence leave in Vung Tau the following day—they were significantly under-strength. Crossing the Suoi Da Bang creek, the firing point of the mortars was soon located as were signs of the Viet Cong withdrawal as they pushed further east. Meanwhile, A Company, 6 RAR under Captain Charles Mollison continued its patrol north of Nui Dat 2, and was involved in three minor clashes, killing one Viet Cong and wounding two. B Company was subsequently tasked to remain in the area to search to the north and east the following day and was met by porters that afternoon to supply them with rations. 9 Platoon, C Company returned to Nui Dat with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>report,</b> leaving A and B Company to harbour in their night locations. Speculation {{about the size of the}} Viet Cong in the area increased. Captain Bryan Wickens, the 6 RAR Intelligence Officer, assessed that the presence of medium mortars, RCLs and artillery likely indicated a significant force. Due to growing uncertainty about Viet Cong intentions, Jackson agreed the patrol scheduled for 18 August should be increased from platoon to company size. D Company, 6 RAR under command of Major Harry Smith had previously been detailed for a three-day patrol south-east of Nui Dat and was instead ordered to relieve B Company the next day to continue the search. Despite this, neither Townsend nor Smith were warned of the possible presence of the 275th Regiment.|$|E

500|$|Johnson was, in {{the words}} of Steven Lynn, [...] "more than a {{well-known}} writer and scholar"; for it is said of his poetry, 'small in amount, its quality excellent', and regrets were expressed that he had not written much more'. He was a celebrity for the activities and the state of his health in his later years were constantly reported in various journals and newspapers, and when there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>report,</b> something was invented. According to Bate, [...] "Johnson loved biography," [...] and he [...] "changed the whole course of biography for the modern world. One by-product was the most famous single work of biographical art in the whole of literature, Boswell's Life of Johnson, and there were many other memoirs and biographies of a similar kind written on Johnson after his death." [...] These accounts of his life include Thomas Tyers's A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson (1784); Boswell's The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides (1785); Hester Thrale's Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, which drew on entries from her diary and other notes; John Hawkins's Life of Samuel Johnson, the first full-length biography of Johnson; and, in 1792, Arthur Murphy's An Essay on the Life and Genius of Samuel Johnson, which replaced Hawkins's biography as the introduction to a collection of Johnson's Works. Another important source was Fanny Burney, who described Johnson as [...] "the acknowledged Head of Literature in this kingdom" [...] and kept a diary containing details missing from other biographies. Above all, Boswell's portrayal of Johnson is the work best known to general readers. Although critics like Donald Greene argue about its status as a true biography, the work became successful as Boswell and his friends promoted it {{at the expense of the}} many other works on Johnson's life.|$|E

At [...] the leading British infantry stood up and moved forwards through a mist, with just enough light to recognise German troops. The German infantry were surprised by the intensity and brevity of the bombardment and the rapid onset of the British infantry behind a creeping barrage of high-explosive shells. The II Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16 in Longueval had been alerted and sent out four patrols; one disappeared, one ran into a British patrol and two returned with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>report.</b> The first wave reached the German wire without a shot and passed over the front line, some of the following waves being engaged by Germans who emerged from underground shelters.

The story, however, continued in the next episode, when Kathy reached the police station and received very sympathetic treatment from a male detective and a WPC. Tony McHale had researched the subject in depth with the police and was determined to portray the broad range of ways that the police dealt with the serious subject of rape. A senior woman police officer later congratulated the programme on its even-handed and honest portrayal of the incident.|$|R

This {{is one of the things}} which I really admire about General Buck. He possesses what people used to mean by 'the humility of the man of science,' that is, he learns steadily from his mistakes.

At JELIA' 90 I described one such logic, action logic, a single-sorted finitely based equational conservative extension of the equational logic of regular expressions, with the language part of the extension consisting of new operations preimplication A!B (had A then B) and postimplication B/A (B if-ever A) [Pra 90 a].

Although I had <b>nothing</b> new <b>to</b> <b>report</b> on this subject {{it seemed to me that}} a walk around the neighborhood of action logic should be of some interest.
