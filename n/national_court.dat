In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement, the Hungarian authorities then extradited them to Yugoslavia, where they underwent a fourth trial in Novi Sad in October 1946. They were all sentenced to death and executed the following month.|$|E

These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot. Other advancement and recognitions—such as the 50-miler award, Crime Prevention Awards, Emergency Preparedness Award and World Conservation Award—are available to Scouts who show proficiency in special areas. BSA's <b>National</b> <b>Court</b> of Honor is responsible for lifesaving and meritorious awards. All Courts of Honor for Eagle Scout rank are convened as National Courts of Honor also.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the interactions between}} <b>national</b> and international <b>courts.</b> It begins by discussing the four roles that <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> can perform in relation to international adjudication: substitution, implementation, contestation, and normative development. It then distinguishes between the multiple functions exercised by international courts in relation to <b>national</b> <b>courts.</b> These include substitution, review, and normative development. It is argued that the interactions between international and <b>national</b> <b>courts,</b> like the interactions between international and national legal orders, may range from cooperative dialogue and willingness toward recognition and accommodation, to outright competition...|$|R

5|$|Eldred did {{not have}} a troop board of review, a review by the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a {{thorough}} National Board of Review consisting of West, Baden-Powell, Ernest Thompson Seton, Daniel Carter Beard, Arthur R. Forbush, and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who wrote in the Handbook for Boys on life-saving and swimming. At the time there had still not been a council-level system for Eagle Scouts boards of review. Largely due to delays caused by Baden-Powell's visit, the <b>National</b> <b>Court</b> of Honor did not convene until March 29, 1912. A press announcement was released on or about April 10, 1912, leading to a century of confusion wherein it was believed Eldred's Board of Review had been held in April. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated August 21, 1912. Another reason for the delays was that the Boy Scouts of America felt no one would ever earn the Eagle Scout award and at the time of Eldred's Board of Review, the Eagle Scout medal had not yet been designed. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused {{by the fact that the}} design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was presented Eagle Scout on Labor Day, September 2, 1912, becoming the first to earn Scouting's highest rank, just two years after the founding of the BSA itself.|$|E

40|$|According to {{decentralized}} {{character of}} the EU legal system, <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> are the ordinary courts in matters of EU law and should as such guarantee effective legal protection of individual’s rights deriving from EU law. To ensure uniform application of EU law provisions and especially to prevent possible divergent interpretations, a preliminary ruling procedure was created, found in Article 267 TFEU. On the basis of mentioned Article <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> may, and sometimes must, refer a question to the CJEU and ask for clarifi cation of the meaning or review {{of the validity of}} an act of EU law which is of relevance to the case upon which <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> need to adjudicate, since the CJEU has an exclusive monopoly of interpretation on questions of EU law. This Paper deals with a question, when <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> have the right and when the duty to refer questions to the CJEU and which are the exceptions to this obligation. Possible legal consequences, that may follow if <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> do not fulfi l their obligations, are discussed in short as well...|$|R

25|$|Article 13 {{provides}} for the right for an effective remedy before national authorities for violations of rights under the Convention.

25|$|A {{decision}} of the EPO to revoke a European patent is final (when the opportunity to appeal before the EPO is exhausted), which makes the opposition proceedings at the EPO especially attractive for opponents. In contrast, a {{decision of}} the EPO not to revoke a European patent (the decision instead maintaining the patent as granted or in an amended form) leaves the way open for revocation by the <b>national</b> <b>court.</b> The EPO decision does not create an estoppel precluding a subsequent challenge by an unsuccessful opponent {{at the national level}} (at least before the English courts). The validity of a European patent can be scrutinised both at the national level, before a <b>national</b> <b>court,</b> and at the international level, before the European Patent Office during opposition. The same is not true for infringement proceedings, upon which national courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} {{international}} organizations, {{courts and tribunals}} have been created raises the difficult {{question of how to}} co-ordinate their activities with those of <b>national</b> <b>courts.</b> If the two sets of bodies do not have concurrent jurisdiction but, {{as in the case of}} the International Criminal Court (ICC), the relationship is expressly based on the principle of complementarity, i.e., the international court is subsidiary or complementary to <b>national</b> <b>courts,</b> the difficulty is avoided. But if the jurisdiction claimed is concurrent, or as in the case of International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the international tribunal is to prevail over <b>national</b> <b>courts,</b> the problems are more difficult to resolve politically.|$|R
