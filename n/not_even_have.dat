5|$|If Cuthbert was at Hereford, {{he served}} in that {{capacity}} for four years before his elevation to the See of Canterbury in 740. He is credited with the composition of an epitaph for the tomb of his three predecessors at Hereford. The cathedral church of the see may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> been located at Hereford by Cuthbert's time.|$|E
5|$|Marchant {{began at}} the Chelsea Amateur Cycling Club, which did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> a banked cycling track and was trained by Norton and Maurie Cramer. Marchant rose to {{prominence}} by winning the 500metres (m) time trial at the 1955 Victorian Championships for juniors in only his second year of competition. He then won the 5 mile title and the 500m time trial at the Australian Junior Championships. He added a silver medal in the sprint.|$|E
5|$|A {{century later}} he was already a legendary figure; William of Tyre {{believed}} that it was Peter who had planted the idea for the crusade in Urban's mind (which was taken as fact by historians until the 19th century). It is commonly believed that Peter's followers consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> any idea where Jerusalem was, but indeed there were many knights among the peasants, including Walter Sans Avoir, who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound {{that was to}} be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of the}} sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, many units of the 4th Army were still at their {{mobilisation}} centres or in their concentration areas, and {{only a small number of}} units had actually deployed into their planned positions to defend the border. A significant number of conscripts did not report to their mobilisation centres. The logistics of the 4th Army were in a poor state, mainly due to a lack of livestock and vehicles for transport, but also due to fifth column sabotage by the Ustaše and their sympathisers, to the extent that many units did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> 10 per cent of their transport needs. It was also equipped poorly, lacking in many tools of modern warfare, including tanks, light artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and air support. These deficiencies affected both its fighting power and morale.|$|E
5|$|Despite his wealth, he was {{not known}} for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E

5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow does not believe that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|The new Queen of Hungary {{subjected}} herself {{entirely to}} her controlling mother-in-law, Elizabeth of Poland. The {{fact that the}} young queen's retinue consisted of the same individuals who had served the queen mother indicates that Elizabeth of Bosnia may <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> had her own court. Her mother-in-law's influence prevailed until 1370, when Louis succeeded his maternal uncle, CasimirIII, as King of Poland. Elizabeth's maternal uncle, Vladislaus the White, had also been {{a candidate for the}} Polish throne. Following his coronation in Poland, Louis brought Casimir's underage daughters, Anne and Hedwig, to be raised by Elizabeth. Elizabeth, though Queen of Poland, was never crowned as such.|$|E
5|$|Zeus used {{mechanically}} steered radars, {{like the}} Nike SAMs before it, {{limiting the number}} of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated that the Soviets had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did have hundreds of missiles, they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.|$|E

5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E

When the newly elected Socred MLAs held their first caucus meeting, {{the first order of}} business was to select a leader and premier-designate. Aberhart was the obvious choice, but had to be prodded to take the job. He was sworn in as premier on September 3.|$|R

25|$|The modern {{numerical}} digit 0 {{is usually}} written as a circle or ellipse. Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter O more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0. Typewriters originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> a separate key for the digit 0. The distinction came into prominence on modern character displays.|$|E

According to NBC News, a senior British official contended that an attack was not imminent, noting that the suspects had not yet purchased airline tickets and some did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> passports; he had urged that the investigation continue to collect more evidence.|$|E
25|$|Labyrinth of Reflections, a book heavily {{based on}} various {{internet}} subcultures and cyberpunk mythos, is another product of this period. Although Labyrinth is often labeled as cyberpunk, it {{is a rather}} straight romance story, hardly meeting Dozois criterion, and, more to the fact, was written when the author did <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> an Internet connection; all his internet knowledge was limited to FIDONet membership.|$|E

This suggests that late Cretaceous pterosaur faunas were far more diverse than previously thought, possibly <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>having</b> declined significantly from the early Cretaceous.|$|R

The stadium has eight entrances and a well-built pavilion.|$|E

In his calculation, Kelvin assumed that photosynthesis was {{the only source of}} free oxygen; he did not know all of the components of the oxygen cycle. He could <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>have</b> known all of the sources of photosynthesis: for example the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus—which accounts {{for more than half of}} marine photosynthesis—was not discovered until 1986.|$|E
