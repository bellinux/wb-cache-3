5|$|Cortana can {{no longer}} be fully hidden, as it was made the default search {{experience}} in the Windows shell for all users (on previous revisions, a generic search experience without any Cortana branding and functionality is used if it is disabled). As with previous builds, users must still opt-in and grant permission for the software to perform data collection and tracking in order to fully enable Cortana's personalized features. If this functionality is <b>not</b> <b>enabled,</b> Cortana operates in a feature-limited mode with basic web and device search functionality, nearly identical to the non-Cortana search experience on previous builds.|$|E

When enabled, every website the user visits is checked against a master list of known phishing sites. If a site is listed, the user is informed. In light of the privacy implications of this feature, it is <b>not</b> <b>enabled</b> automatically; the user is asked when they start Internet Explorer 7 if they want it enabled. Microsoft is working in conjunction with companies that specialize in identifying phishing schemes to ensure the list of known sites is accurate and quickly updated.|$|E
500|$|In April 2003, the ROM hacking group Demiforce {{released}} a fan translation rendering Radical Dreamers in English. The patch works by modifying the ROM image of Dreamers used for playing console-based video games on personal computers through emulation. The ability to save games was <b>not</b> <b>enabled</b> {{with the first}} patch, and some minor typos were left in, later remedied by successive releases. On Christmas Day 2005, Demiforce and Radical R released the final version (1.4) of the translation, which fixed remaining minor bugs. The French team Terminus Traduction made a French translation patch soon after. Masato Kato did not perceive significant demand to include Radical Dreamers as a bonus {{with the release of}} Chrono Trigger DS, and omitted it to preserve continuity between Trigger and Cross. He expressed concern in 2009 over re-releasing Radical Dreamers [...] "as-is", citing a need to revise the work.|$|E

2500|$|Build 5219, {{also known}} as CTP1 and September CTP, was {{distributed}} among 2005 PDC attendees on September 13, 2005, and has been released to Microsoft Beta testers and MSDN subscribers. This was the first public [...] "Ultimate Edition" [...] build, and included Super Fetch. Although <b>not</b> <b>enabled</b> by default, this refresh saw {{the return of the}} Windows Sidebar, which had been removed as part of the development reset, and the introduction of Desktop Gadgets, both of which are part of Microsoft gadgets line of mini-applications. Microsoft stated that they intended to make additional gadgets available for download from a web site over time. This build also supported a new version of Windows Media Center code-named [...] "Diamond".|$|E
2500|$|Until version 5.0, Android used Dalvik as {{a process}} virtual machine with trace-based {{just-in-time}} (JIT) compilation to run Dalvik [...] "dex-code" [...] (Dalvik Executable), which is usually translated from the Java bytecode. [...] Following the trace-based JIT principle, in addition to interpreting the majority of application code, Dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select frequently executed code segments ("traces") each time an application is launched. Android4.4 introduced Android Runtime (ART) as a new runtime environment, which uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application. [...] In Android4.4, ART was an experimental feature and <b>not</b> <b>enabled</b> by default; it became the only runtime option in the next major version of Android, 5.0.|$|E

2500|$|Pre-compiled {{binaries}} {{are provided}} for some applications with long build times, such as LibreOffice, Apache OpenOffice and Mozilla Firefox, but users lose {{the ability to}} customize optional features. There are configuration options to reduce compilation times by enabling [...] parallel compilation and using pipes instead of temporary files; package compilation may also be distributed over multiple computers. In addition, the user {{may be able to}} mount a large filesystem in RAM to greatly speed up the process of building packages. Some of these approaches have drawbacks and so are <b>not</b> <b>enabled</b> by default. When installing the same package on multiple computers with sufficiently similar hardware, the package may be compiled once and a binary package created for quick installation on the other computers.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013 it was {{discovered}} that the Firefox browsers in many older versions of the Tor Browser Bundle were vulnerable to a JavaScript attack, as NoScript was <b>not</b> <b>enabled</b> by default. Attackers used this vulnerability to extract users' MAC and IP addresses and Windows computer names. News reports linked this to a United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operation targeting Freedom Hosting's owner, Eric Eoin Marques, who was arrested on a provisional extradition warrant issued by a United States court on 29 July. The FBI is seeking to extradite Marques out of Ireland to Maryland on four charges— distributing, conspiring to distribute, and advertising child pornography— as well as aiding and abetting advertising of child pornography. The warrant alleges that Marques is [...] "the largest facilitator of child porn on the planet". The FBI acknowledged the attack in a 12 September 2013 court filing in Dublin; further technical details from a training presentation leaked by Edward Snowden revealed the codename for the exploit as [...] "EgotisticalGiraffe".|$|E
2500|$|Third, the EU is {{formally}} <b>not</b> <b>enabled</b> {{to legislate}} on collective bargaining, although the EU, with all member states, is {{bound by the}} jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on freedom of association. In Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom the Court held that any detriment for membership of a trade union was incompatible with article 11, and in Demir and Baykara v Turkey the Court held [...] "the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, {{become one of the}} essential elements" [...] of article 11. This approach, which includes affirmation of the fundamental right to strike in all democratic member states, has been seen as lying in tension with some of the Court of Justice's previous case law, notably ITWF v Viking Line ABP and Laval Un Partneri Ltd v Svenska Byggnadsarbetareforbundet. These controversial decisions, quickly disapproved by legislative measures, suggested the fundamental right of workers to take collective action was subordinate to business freedom to establish and provide services. More positively, the Information and Consultation Directive 2002 requires that workplaces with over 20 or 50 staff have the right to set up elected work councils with a range of binding rights, the European Works Council Directive 2009 enables work councils transnationally, and the Employee Involvement Directive 2001 requires representation of workers on company boards in some European Companies. If a company transforms from a member state corporation to incorporate under the European Company Regulation 2001, employees are entitled to no less favourable representation than under the member state's existing board participation laws. This is practically important as a majority of EU member states require employee representation on company boards. Fourth, minimum job security rights are provided by three Directives. The Collective Redundancies Directive 1998 specifies that minimum periods of notice and consultation occur if more than a set number of jobs in a workplace are at risk. The Transfers of Undertakings Directive 2001 require that staff retain all contractual rights, unless there is an independent economic, technical or organisational reason, if their workplace is sold from one company to another. Last, the Insolvency Protection Directive 2008 requires that employees' wage claims are protected in the event that their employer falls insolvent. This last Directive gave rise to Francovich v Italy, where the Court of Justice affirmed that member states which fail to implement the minimum standards in EU Directives are liable to pay compensation to employees who should have rights under them.|$|E
