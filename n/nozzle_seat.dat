40|$|Dimethyl ether (DME) is an {{alternative}} fuel which, of late, has shown tremendous potential in reducing the pollution emissions of automobiles. Simultaneously, electronic actuated fuel injectors, {{with the use of}} solenoids, have repeatedly demonstrated superior performance with respect to needle movement control. This thesis, in order to combine the advantages of both electronic actuation and DME fuel, presents an adaptation of the novel use of solenoid operated fuel injectors with DME. The thesis also sets to reduce injector <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> wear, by reducing the bouncing of the injector needle at the bottom of its stroke. The injector design presented incorporates a lengthened elastic rod, a new driving circuit for the solenoid, and incorporates them into a common rail system. The thesis also presents, {{for the first time in}} the literature, a methodology for measuring the force acting on the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> in injector closing. Through modeling, simulation and testing, an injector compatible with DME fuel was designed, where injector needle movement was properly controlled, and <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> force reduced. As such, an important step has been taken in developing technology allowing DME to be a more common alternative fuel in automobiles...|$|E
40|$|The near nozzle exit {{flow and}} spray {{structure}} generated by an enlarged {{model of a}} second generation pintle type outwards opening injector have been investigated under steady flow conditions {{as a function of}} flow-rate and needle lift. A high resolution CCD camera and high-speed video camera have been employed in this study to obtain high-magnification images of the internal nozzle exit flow in order to identify the origin of string ligaments/droplets formation at the nozzle exit. The images of the flow around the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> area showed clearly that air was entrained from outside into the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> area under certain flow operating conditions (low cavitation number, CN); the formed air pockets inside the annular nozzle proved to be the main cause of the breaking of the fuel liquid film into strings as it emerged from the nozzle with a structure consisting of alternating thin and thick liquid filaments. As the flow rate increased, the air pockets were suppressed, reduced in size and pushed towards the exit of the nozzle resulting in a smoother spray. The results showed that the number of strings increased linearly, within the measured range, with liquid exit velocity and that the spray cone angle was smaller or larger than the nominal value depending on the attachment of air pockets to the cartridge or needle surfaces, respectively; these two distinct small and large cone angles were found to be dominant at low and high lifts. Increasing the flow rate further so that CN exceeds the critical value, gave rise to pockets of vapour that started to emerge in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> region and disintegrated rapidly as they were convected towards the nozzle exit. The analysis of the near nozzle flow visualizations has shown the existence of air entrainment and cavitation as two different phenomena occurring under different operating condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of couples deterioration of high-pressure fuel pump, {{as well as}} details of the valve and <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> depends on the lubricating ability of diesel fuel, which is greatly influenced by sulfur and oxygen contents in the fuel. The {{reduction of}} sulfur contents in the fuel results in {{the reduction of the}} lubricating ability of the fuel and, consequently, increase in the rate of parts deterioration of fuel equipment. We propose to add an antiwear magnetic additive, made on the micellar basis in order to improve the lubricating ability of the fuel. The size of additive particles must be 10 – 7 m or less, i. e. approaching nano-sizes, in order not to precipitate in the filter cleaning diesel fuel and not to deposit {{on the walls of the}} pipes of the fuel system...|$|E

Use: Especially for an IC engine oil or fuel filter...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{cylindrical}} <b>nozzle</b> and <b>seat</b> of a Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) {{the surface}} form and waviness is modelled using actual metrological data i. e. average surface form and waviness (Wa and Wsm) in a 1 / 4 symmetry manner. To model the surface waviness the technique used {{is based on}} the summing technique created by Tsukizoe & Hisakado (1965) for micro contact analysis. Due to the actual surface form measurements being in the micro-meter range, the model is required to incorporate micro and macro-meter dimensions. The material in question is stainless steel. The deformed finite element analysis model is then transferred into a CAD geometry allowing the void space to be meshed and solved using computational fluid dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} lapping has been long {{considered}} an art {{due to the}} tremendous amount of variability and subjectivity involved. The quality of lapping differs from operator to operator {{and the results are}} highly inconsistent. The material removal rate, surface finish, and flatness all depend on the proper control of lapping parameters such as lapping pressure, lapping speed of rotation, lap ring material, weight and size, abrasive size and type, workpiece material and hardness. To attain the desired outcomes, it is imperative to select proper values for the lapping control parameters. Moving the art of lapping into a science and quantifying the results can solve many of the above problems. In this research, a portable mechanical lapping tool was designed and tested along with manual lapping. Lapping processes were studied by conducting designed experiments, literature search, and consulting experts. The results from the experiments were explored in detail using various statistical techniques to explain the relationships among potential parameters and to see the possibility of lapping model development. A preliminary intelligent computerized lapping system (advisory system) was also developed as a framework for future work. Representative qualitative models and rules for lapping were proposed based on lapping literature and lapping experts' knowledge. However, {{it was found that the}} domain knowledge obtained from different sources was often clouded by imprecision and uncertainty, and the available data of manufacturing problems were frequently imprecise and incomplete. To overcome this problem, fuzzy logic concepts were applied in developing a protocol for the knowledge-based system. This research is an initiative of well-designed experiments and data analyses in investigating potential parameters of flat surface lapping with an application on reconditioning valve discs and <b>nozzle</b> <b>seats...</b>|$|R
40|$|Pelton turbine is {{an engine}} that {{facilitates}} continuous {{power as a}} wheel or a rotor continually turns due to the pressure of fast moving water through the bucket, where a bucket receives water from the surging nozzle. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the highest efficiency among different types of Pelton turbine through the modification of bucket volume, bucket angle attack, nozzle needle seat ring, and nozzle needle seat tip. The experiment was conducted at Energy Conversion Laboratory of Sebelas Maret University. The comparative study among the different parameters shows that the value of maximum efficiency was 21. 65 %, which was obtained at 90 ° needle seat ring and 45 ° needle seat tip, and + 15 % bucket size and 92 ° angle of attack. It was gained likely due to the lightness of the + 15 % bucket compared to the standard bucket and the collision produced by the jet water {{in the middle of the}} bucket, in which the water loading occupied the large area on the surface of the bucket and promoted the increasing speed. It is expected that the result on the appropriate size and angle attack of bucket at specific <b>nozzle</b> <b>seat</b> ring and seat tip of this experiment can be manufactured commercially in the future for achieving maximum Pelton turbine efficiency...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the limited}} {{success of the}} 150, drastic changes were {{introduced}} to improve performance and ease of maintenance. The RD-10 engine, rated at [...] of thrust, {{was moved to the}} front of the nose and its cowling formed the bottom of the forward fuselage. This position minimized thrust losses due to the length of the intake duct and allowed the engine to be changed much more easily than its predecessor. The cockpit was widened and moved to a position over the mid-set wings, even with the engine's exhaust <b>nozzle.</b> The pilot's <b>seat</b> back was armored and he was protected by an armor plate to his front and a bulletproof windscreen. Three fuel tanks were positioned ahead of the cockpit and one behind it with a total capacity of [...] of fuel. The removable, mid-mounted wings used several different laminar flow airfoils over their span. Each wing had a single spar, slotted flaps and ailerons. The tricycle undercarriage retracted into the fuselage, which meant that the aircraft had a very narrow ground track. The aircraft was armed with three [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, two on the starboard side of the aircraft's nose and the other on the port side. Each gun had 50 rounds of ammunition.|$|R
