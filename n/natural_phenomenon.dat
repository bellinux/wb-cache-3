5|$|An eclipse is a <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> However, in {{some ancient}} and modern cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. A total solar eclipse can be frightening {{to people who are}} unaware of its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes.|$|E
5|$|Ilaiyaraaja's {{first two}} non-film albums were explorations in {{the fusion of}} Indian and Western {{classical}} music. The first, How to Name It? (1986), {{is dedicated to the}} Carnatic master Tyāgarāja and to J. S. Bach. It features a fusion of the Carnatic form and ragas with Bach partitas, fugues and Baroque musical textures. The second, Nothing But Wind (1988), was performed by flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia and a 50-piece orchestra and takes the conceptual approach suggested in the title— that music is a <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon</b> akin to various forms of air currents (e.g., the wind, breeze, tempest etc.).|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have been prevented. According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster was a <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Horton Plains are the {{headwaters}} of three major Sri Lankan rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe. In Sinhala the plains are known as Maha Eliya Plains. Stone tools dating back to Balangoda culture have been found here. The plains' vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest and includes many endemic woody plants. Large herds of Sri Lankan sambar deer feature as typical mammals and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species not only endemic to Sri Lanka but restricted to the Horton Plains. Forest dieback {{is one of the}} major threats to the park and some studies suggest that it is caused by a <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Hebrews still {{saw each}} major event as a divine act.

25|$|The {{preservation}} of bog bodies in peat bogs is a <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> {{and not the}} result of human mummification processes. It is caused by the unique physical and biochemical composition of the bogs. Different types of bogs can affect the mummification process differently: raised bogs best preserve the corpses, whereas fens and transitional bogs tend to preserve harder tissues such as the skeleton rather than the soft tissue.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of wine components are dissolved in the wine: certain components, however, may take an insoluble form during ageing or storage of wine – {{this is the}} case with tartaric acid. A salt containing potassium, potassium bitartrate {{is in the form of}} crystals at the bottom of the bottle. This is a <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon</b> but many producers seek to avoid this as dealers and uninformed consumers take these crystals as a fault. It is caused or accelerated by cold storage: low temperature reduces its solubility. The habit of refreshing white wine makes this wine particularly sensitive to this phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Sulfate aerosol (SO42− and {{methanesulfonic acid}} droplets) act as CCNs. These sulfate {{aerosols}} form partly from the dimethyl sulfide (DMS) produced by phytoplankton {{in the open}} ocean. Large algal blooms in ocean surface waters occur {{in a wide range}} of latitudes and contribute considerable DMS into the atmosphere to act as nuclei. The idea that an increase in global temperature would also increase phytoplankton activity and therefore CCN numbers was seen as a possible <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that would counteract climate change. An increase of phytoplankton has been observed by scientists in certain areas but the causes are unclear.|$|E
25|$|From 1955-60 Kipling {{studied at}} the Vancouver School of Art (now Emily Carr University of Art and Design).

In the 1960s {{she moved to the}} Lynn Valley where she lived and worked for a number of years.

25|$|Larramendi {{refused to}} join Francoist {{structures}} and criticized those who did; he verbally assaulted Julio Muñoz Aguilar, co-editor from La Voz de España, for an article supporting Franco. In 1937 he closed {{himself for a}} month in a San Sebastián hotel and wrote El sistema tradicional. The work was an orthodox lecture of political Traditionalism, stemming from assumption that traditionalist system {{does not need to}} be implemented: it exists as a <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> It is not clear whether Larramendi hoped to get the work published; it was not possible before 1952, when it went to print as Cristiandad, Tradición y Realeza. In 1938 he agreed that two of his sons, aged 17 and 16, enlist to Requeté.|$|E

25|$|Physics {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{academic}} disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of astronomy. Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry, certain branches of mathematics, and biology, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 16th century, the natural sciences emerged as unique research programs in their own right. Certain research areas are interdisciplinary, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, which means that the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries physicalism emerged as a major unifying feature of the philosophy of science as physics provides fundamental explanations for every observed <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening to new research areas in mathematics and philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Andersen {{was the son}} of Knut Severin Andersen b. Grothaug (1882–1948), from Hornindal in Nordfjord, who was a {{gardener}} in Stavanger, and Elise Andersen b. Rafoss (1890–1987) from Stavanger (Kvinesdal). Because his father was {{a gardener}} they had a car, which was rare at the time, and using this they went on skiing in the winter and fishing in the summer. He enjoyed going for long skiing tours in the mountains in Stavanger, when he was young, and several times he crossed Trollgaren in Ryfylke, this marvelous moraine that is appropriate to its name. He wondered how it was formed, and was told by the local farmer that it was really Trolls that had set up the meandering fence of huge boulders, far above the tree line. The curiosity for this <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in addition to many others in turn led to his interest for the Ice Age.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{interest}} in power-law relations stems partly from {{the ease with}} which certain general classes of mechanisms generate them. The demonstration of a power-law relation in some data can point to specific kinds of mechanisms that might underlie the <b>natural</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in question, and can indicate a deep connection with other, seemingly unrelated systems; see also universality above. The ubiquity of power-law relations in physics is partly due to dimensional constraints, while in complex systems, power laws are often thought to be signatures of hierarchy or of specific stochastic processes. A few notable examples of power laws are the Pareto's law of income distribution, structural self-similarity of fractals, and scaling laws in biological systems. Research on the origins of power-law relations, and efforts to observe and validate them in the real world, is an active topic of research in many fields of science, including physics, computer science, linguistics, geophysics, neuroscience, sociology, economics and more.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{theories}} of religion suggest that belief in supernatural agents finds a {{basis in the}} human tendency to (over) detect agency in the environment. The present research investigated whether activation of religious concepts enhances the attribution of agency in <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena.</b> In two experiments we administered a religion prime (a religion questionnaire in Experiment 1; a subliminal God prime in Experiment 2) and measured the amount of intentionality and free will that participants ascribed to images of <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena</b> and agents. In both experiments participants ascribed more agency to <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena</b> {{if they had been}} presented with a religion prime. Item analyses for both experiments furthermore revealed that the effect of religious priming was most pronounced for items of <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena</b> that were perceived as beyond personal control. These findings provide empirical support for the hypothesized relation between religion and agency detection...|$|R
