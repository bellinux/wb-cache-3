5|$|A North–South divide {{remains in}} {{education}} at all levels.

5|$|At the 2016 EU {{membership}} referendum, {{all three}} <b>Northern</b> England regions voted to leave, as did all English regions outside London. The largest <b>Northern</b> Remain vote was 60.4% in Manchester; the largest Leave vote was 69.9% in North East Lincolnshire. In total, the Leave {{vote in the}} <b>Northern</b> England regions was 55.9% – {{higher than in the}} Southern England regions and the other Home Nations, but lower than in the Midlands or the East of England. The Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) positioned themselves as the main challenger to Labour in <b>Northern</b> constituencies, and came second in many at the 2015 general election. UKIP originally struggled in the region due to vote splitting with the far-right British National Party (BNP), who exploited racial tensions {{in the wake of the}} 2001 Bradford riots and other riots in <b>Northern</b> towns. In 2006, 40% of BNP voters lived in <b>Northern</b> England and both BNP MEPs elected at the 2009 European elections came from <b>Northern</b> constituencies. After 2013, BNP support in the region collapsed as most voters swung to UKIP. The <b>Northern</b> UKIP vote in turn collapsed following the EU referendum, with most UKIP voters returning to their former allegiances.|$|E

5|$|The {{flagship}} {{train on}} the <b>Northern</b> Pacific Railway ("NP") main line was the North Coast Limited, which had begun running in 1900.
