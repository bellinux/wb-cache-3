5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, Boston College was ranked 26th <b>nationally</b> <b>in</b> total defense, and 2nd <b>nationally</b> <b>in</b> run defense. Its pass defense, however, was ranked 106th in the country, and since Boston College was without senior cornerback DeJuan Tribble, who was {{recovering}} from a sprained knee ligament, it was expected that the Eagles' linebackers would have to play a very good game to stop Virginia Tech's passing offense. Jo-Lonn Dunbar, who had been named to the preseason watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy (awarded to the top defensive player in the country) was expected to fill the gaps and stop both rushing and passing elements of Virginia Tech's offense.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was 28th <b>nationally</b> <b>in</b> scoring offense (number {{of points}} scored) and 55th in total offense. Most of the Hokies' success {{came on the}} ground: Tech was 16th <b>nationally</b> <b>in</b> rushing offense but 98th in passing offense. A large reason for Virginia Tech's {{offensive}} success was running back Ryan Williams, who broke Virginia Tech's single-season rushing record that year. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, he had 1,538 yards, only 110 short of the record. Tech running back Darren Evans, who tore his left anterior cruciate ligament before the season began, was held out of the Chick-fil-A Bowl, even though his recovery had progressed {{to the point that}} he could have participated.|$|E
