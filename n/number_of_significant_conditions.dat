5000|$|In telecommunication, a n-ary code is a {{code that}} has n {{significant}} conditions, where n {{is a positive}} integer greater than 1. The integer substituted for n indicates the specific <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>significant</b> <b>conditions,</b> i.e., quantization states, in the code. For example, an 8-ary code has eight significant conditions and can convey three bits per code symbol. A prefix that indicates an integer, e.g., [...] "bin", [...] "tern," [...] or [...] "quatern", {{may be used in}} lieu of a numeral, to produce [...] "binary", [...] "ternary", or [...] "quaternary" [...] (2, 3, and 4 states respectively).|$|E

40|$|While our {{understanding}} of the molecular events leading to disease onset and progression have increased exponentially, our capacity to therapeutically intervene in these events with new chemical diversity has clearly fallen short of that pace. In the quest to readdress this situation, the drug discovery sector is slowly but increasingly exploring sources of alternative chemical matter, such as the ones provided by material science and nanotechnology. While new functional nano-sized materials hold great promise for the future, our lack of understanding of the long term safety implications associated with systemic exposure as well as the unclear regulatory path ahead hamper their present impact in drug development. Paradoxically, the exploitation of novel, functionally active micron-sized, synthetic, non-absorbable chemical matter, for the treatment or prevention <b>of</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> epidemiologically <b>significant</b> <b>conditions</b> remains clearly underexplored. A combination of pre-existing evidence and future potential indicates that micron-sized mesoporous silica materials could be an untapped source of new drug candidates. These are free from both the dreaded high attrition associated with small molecule drug discovery and the uncertainties of nano-size technologies. This, together with the coming of age of synthetic methodologies to control particle size and shape; pore size and geometry; surface chemistry, bioconjugation and formulation, open up exciting possibilities to exploit this novel chemistry-biology therapeutic interface. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The Resources for Health trial evaluates a social-ecologically based {{lifestyle}} (physical {{activity and}} diet) intervention targeting low-income, largely Spanish-speaking patients with multiple chronic conditions. Design: A randomized controlled trial {{was conducted with}} 200 patients recruited from an urban community health center and assigned to intervention and usual care conditions. Intervention involved 2 face-to-face, self-management support and community linkage sessions with a health educator, 3 follow-up phone calls, and 3 tailored newsletters. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes measured at 6 -months were changes in dietary behavior and physical activity. Changes in multilevel support for healthy living were evaluated as a secondary outcome. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, language, and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> chronic <b>conditions,</b> <b>significant</b> intervention effects were observed for dietary behavior and multilevel support for healthy lifestyles but not for physical activity. Conclu-sion: The Resources for Health intervention provides an effective and practical model for improving health behavior among low-income, Spanish-speaking patients with multiple chronic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Propionibacterium acnes forms part of {{the normal}} flora of the skin, oral cavity, large {{intestine}} and the external ear. Historically, P. acnes {{is considered to be}} of low virulence; however, in recent years it has been found as the aetiological agent in various pathologies including acne vulgaris, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, sarcoidosis, prosthetic hip infections and sciatica. It currently remains unclear why this normally harmless commensal can cause infection and contribute to a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> clinically <b>significant</b> <b>conditions.</b> This thesis has sought to investigate the phenotypic, genetic and antigenic properties of P. acnes strains isolated from sciatica patients undergoing microdiscectomy, normal skin, blood cultures, prosthetic hips and acne lesions. Isolates' phenotype was examined by determining their biotype by analytical profile index, antimicrobial susceptibility, virulence factor expression and serotype. A molecular typing method for P. acnes was developed using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Patient serum was used to screen P. acnes strains for antigens expressed in vivo and the chemical composition determined. The serodiagnostic potential and inflammatory properties of identified antigens were assessed. The optimised and reproducible RAPD protocol classified strains into three major clusters and was found to distinguish between the serotypes I and II for a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> clinical isolates. Molecular typing by RAPD also enabled the identification of a genotype that did not react with the type I or II monoclonal antibodies and these strains may therefore constitute a previously undiscovered subspecies of P. acnes with a genetic background different from the type I and II serotypes. A major cell associated antigen produced by all strains was identified and characterised. A serological assay based on the antigen was used to measure IgG and IgM levels in serum from patients with acne, sciatica and controls. No difference in levels of antibodies was detected. Inflammatory properties of the antigen were measured by exposing murine macrophage-like cells and measuring the release of nitric oxide and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Only TNF-α was elicited in response to the antigen. The phenotypic, genotypic and antigenic properties of this organism may provide a basis for future studies on P. acnes virulence and provide an insight into its mechanisms of pathogenesis...|$|R
