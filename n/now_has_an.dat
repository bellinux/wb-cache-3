25|$|In 1940 the Antonescu regime imprisoned a {{large number}} of Pentecostalists and Baptists, even {{planning}} to send them to concentration camps in Transnistria; the church was outlawed from 1942 until after the King Michael Coup of 1944. It received provisional recognition in 1946 and was finally granted official state recognition in 1950, at which point membership stood at 36,000. A merger took place among at least three different groups, one of which practiced ritual foot washing. The group held its first nationwide congress in July 1951 and moved its main administrative offices to Bucharest in 1954. Bradin was its first president, succeeded after his death in 1962 by Pavel Bochian. Largely a rural phenomenon until the 1950s, it <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> established presence in cities as well, with about a 60%-40% rural-urban split in 2002.

25|$|The Höllentalferner lies {{northeast}} of the Zugspitze in a cirque below the Jubilee Ridge (Jubiläumsgrat) {{to the south and}} the Riffelwandspitzen peaks to the west and north. It has a northeast aspect. Its accumulation zone is formed by a depression, in which large quantities of avalanche snow collect. To the south the Jubiläumsgrat shields the glacier from direct sunshine. These conditions meant that the glacier only lost a relatively small area between 1981 and 2006. In recent times the Höllentalferner reached its greatest around 1820 with an area of 47 hectares. Thereafter its area reduced continually until the period between 1950 and 1981 when it grew again, by 3.1 hectares to 30.2 hectares. Since then the glacier has lost (as at 2006) an area of 5.5 hectares and <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> area of 24.7 hectares. In 2006 the glacier head was at 2,569 m and its lowest point at 2,203metres.|$|E
500|$|Riley {{considers}} that the coda's repeated chord sequence (I-VII-IV-I) [...] "answers all the musical questions raised at the beginnings and ends of bridges", since [...] "The flat seventh that posed dominant turns into bridges <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> entire chord built on it." [...] This three-chord refrain allows McCartney [...] "a bedding ... to leap about on vocally", so he ad-libs his vocal {{performance for the}} rest of the song. In Riley's estimation, the song [...] "becomes a tour of Paul's vocal range: from the graceful inviting tones of the opening verse, through the mounting excitement of the song itself, to the surging raves of the coda".|$|E
500|$|Standing 1ft 4 in (0.4m) tall, Pikachu {{were the}} first [...] "Electric-type" [...] Pokémon created, their design {{intended}} to revolve around the concept of electricity. They appear as Pika-like creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity. In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; a female Pikachu <b>now</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> indent {{at the end of}} its tail, giving it a heart-shaped appearance. They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets. Within the context of the franchise, a Pikachu can transform, or [...] "evolve" [...] into a Raichu when exposed to a [...] "Thunderstone". In later titles an evolutionary predecessor was introduced named [...] "Pichu", which evolves into a Pikachu after establishing a close friendship with its trainer.|$|E
