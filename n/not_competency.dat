40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{was to investigate the}} critical factors that impact on the confidence of assessors in making assessment judgements. The project grew from concern being voiced by assessors and registered training organisations about consistency in assessment decisions. For mutual recognition of qualifications to work successfully between registered training organisations, there needs to be widespread confidence in the consistency of assessment decisions. Assessment against competency standards involves collecting evidence and then forming a judgement about whether or <b>not</b> <b>competency</b> has been achieved. Several factors impact on these judgements, including the skill and experience of assessors and the clarity of the particular competency standards themselves, and these can influence the assessment decisions made. This research project identified a range of strategies for validating assessment currently being used by assessors in training providers, and identified critical areas where strategies are essential to increase assessor confidence. In addition to this report on the research process and findings, a resource kit for assessors and managers in registered training rganisations was also developed as part of the project. The resource kit includes a set of recommended strategies for registered training organisations to assist them with the quality assurance aspects of assessment. This was developed from material collected as part of the research project and based on recommendations made by practitioners consulted during the research...|$|E
40|$|The National Diploma in Surveying (NDS) was {{successfully}} delivered by Unitec {{for the first}} time in 1999 after replacing the New Zealand Certificate in Land Surveying (NZCLS). The ongoing challenge for Unitec has been to maintain the viability of a programme with only 50 equivalent full time students. Ten years on the NDS continues to operate with a steady number of students, however, to increase the sustainability of the programme it is proposed to integrate the first year of study with a New Zealand Diploma in Engineering (Civil) programme with a number of common courses and also specialist land survey papers. In 2011 the updated programme will still be called the National Diploma in Surveying (NDS) and will utilise the latest Version 5 Unit Standards from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA). The next phase of the review will assess a number of other options including maintaining the status quo, changing the name to a New Zealand Diploma in Surveying (NZDS) or a New Zealand Diploma in Engineering (Surveying), but for all grade based assessment, (e. g. A, B, C) will be utilised and <b>not</b> <b>competency</b> based, (e. g. Pass or Incomplete). Both will include an increased focus on engineering surveying whilst maintaining a cadastral component. This paper details both the challenges and opportunities, and how capacity can be built to provide long-term sustainable technician training for New Zealand. It also will discuss the suitability for international students from countries with similar educational and professional profiles, and opportunities for a 3 year Bachelors degree in Land or Engineering Surveying...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} {{decision}} of Indiana v. Edwards the Supreme Court {{held that the}} right to represent oneself may be denied to defendants who are competent to stand trial if they "still suffer from severe mental illness {{to the point where they}} are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves. " Edwards was a surprise, given the Court's holding 15 years earlier in Godinez v. Moran that Nevada courts did not err when they permitted a mentally ill person who had been found competent to stand trial to waive the right to counsel, plead guilty and waive the presentation of mitigation evidence at capital sentencing. A cynic might note that a desire for efficiency could easily explain these decisions: If a defendant with mental illness wants to plead guilty, Godinez suggests, a finding of competency is usually appropriate, but if such a defendant wants to represent him or herself at trial, Edwards advises, a finding of incompetence is probably best. Even if the Court's motivation in Edwards was benign, however, it erred. For there was another path it could have taken that more satisfactorily resolves the tension between the defendant's interest in autonomy on the one hand and, on the other, society's interests in reliable and fair outcomes and in avoiding farcical proceedings that bring the criminal justice system into disrepute. First, the Court should have reaffirmed, rather than ignored, Godinez' explicit holding and Faretta's suggestion that the key issue is competency to choose, <b>not</b> <b>competency</b> to represent oneself. Second, contra to Godinez, it should have recognized that one needs greater capacity to choose to waive counsel than to surrender other rights, which would have better protected both the defendant's autonomy interest and the state's interest in fair proceedings. Third, it could have further protected those interests by requiring an inquiry that Godinez did not consider: an investigation of the reasons the defendant wants to proceed pro se. If those reasons are delusional or non-existent, then the autonomy that gives rise to a right to self-representation does not exist. But otherwise the defendant who understands the risks of waiving the right to counsel should be allowed to represent himself; no competency-to-represent-oneself test, a la Edwards, should be required. If the pro se defendant becomes disorderly during trial, the state's interest in avoiding circus-like proceedings can be accommodated through application of Illinois v. Allen, which permits the trial judge to take steps to maintain the decorum of the courtroom...|$|E

These skills are presented without discussing fundamental, personal variables, such as the mediator’s mindset fundamental to conflict reconciliation. In that way, these skills become mere techniques – <b>not</b> <b>competencies.</b> In order to become true competencies, the tools must not only emanate in a transparent way from the mediator’s inner attitude and correspond with his/her mindset. In order to fully ‘own’ these tools, {{and to be able to}} use them sensitively, the mediator must also be aware of their roots and of their deeper origins.

50|$|In this case, {{the manager}} and {{employee}} identify the key competencies {{required to achieve}} each performance goal / objective (typically 1 to 3 competencies per goal/objective). At {{the end of the}} performance cycle, the employee's performance is evaluated in relation to the performance goals/objectives as well as the key competencies associated with each goal. Using this approach, the competencies included in the employee's performance plan may or may not completely coincide with the standard competency profile for the employee's role/job. The advantage of using this method is that the competencies being assessed are entirely consistent with the employee's performance goals for the performance review cycle.
