5|$|<b>Neurolinguistics</b> {{research}} {{is carried out}} in all the major areas of linguistics; the main linguistic subfields, and how <b>neurolinguistics</b> addresses them, are given in the table below.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neurolinguistics</b> {{research}} investigates several topics, including where {{language information}} is processed, how language processing unfolds over time, how brain structures {{are related to}} language acquisition and learning, and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology.|$|E
5|$|The {{study on}} how {{language}} is represented, processed, and {{acquired by the}} brain is called <b>neurolinguistics,</b> which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience, cognitive linguistics, and psycholinguistics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neurolinguistics</b> {{is closely}} related to the field of psycholinguistics, which seeks to {{elucidate}} the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology; today, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another, and there is much collaboration between the two fields.|$|E
5|$|Another {{topic is}} the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some <b>neurolinguistics</b> research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} sees language {{primarily as}} the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and {{to produce and}} understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of {{the view that the}} drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which {{can be traced back to}} the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in <b>neurolinguistics.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, {{all of which}} inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, descriptive linguistics examines the grammar of single languages, theoretical linguistics develops theories {{on how best to}} conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, sociolinguistics studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, <b>neurolinguistics</b> studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, computational linguistics builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and historical linguistics relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the comparative method.|$|E
5|$|Early work in <b>neurolinguistics</b> {{involved}} {{the study of}} language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neurolinguistics</b> is {{the study}} of the {{structures}} in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in <b>neurolinguistics</b> is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of <b>neurolinguistics,</b> the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.|$|E
25|$|EEG, and {{the related}} study of ERPs are used {{extensively}} in neuroscience, cognitive science, cognitive psychology, <b>neurolinguistics</b> and psychophysiological research. Many EEG techniques used in research are not standardised sufficiently for clinical use. But research on mental disabilities, such as auditory processing disorder (APD), ADD, or ADHD, is becoming more widely known and EEGs are used as research and treatment.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{generative}} semantics spawned {{an alternative}} linguistic paradigm, known as cognitive linguistics, which attempts to correlate {{the understanding of}} language together with the biological function of specific neural structures. Whereas generative semanticists function {{on the premise that}} the mind has a unique and independent module for language acquisition, cognitive linguists deny this. Instead, they assert that the processing of linguistic phenomena is informed by conceptual deep structures—and more significantly—that the cognitive abilities used to process this data are similar to those used in other non-linguistic tasks. Much of this work is published today under <b>neurolinguistics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stylistics also {{involves}} {{the study of}} written, signed, or spoken discourse through varying speech communities, genres, and editorial or narrative formats in the mass media. In the 1960s, Jacques Derrida, for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself. Palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language. The formal study of language also led {{to the growth of}} fields like psycholinguistics, which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; <b>neurolinguistics,</b> which studies language processing in the brain; biolinguistics, which studies the biology and evolution of language; and language acquisition, which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages.|$|E
25|$|Psycholinguistics or {{psychology}} of language {{is the study}} of the psychological and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend and produce language. The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms in which languages are processed and represented in the brain. Initial forays into psycholinguistics were largely philosophical or educational schools of thought, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and information science to study how the brain processes language, and less so the known processes of social sciences, human development, communication theories and infant development, among others. There are a number of subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, <b>neurolinguistics</b> has become a field in its own right.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in January 1971 {{scientists}} {{administered a}} series of <b>neurolinguistics</b> tests on Genie, making her the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed brain examinations. Based on tests and observations in everyday situations, doctors concluded that she was right-handed and that her brain was extremely right-hemisphere dominant for all functions. On tests specifically measuring Genie's language, her results were congruous with adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients. On a tachistoscopic test in 1975, Genie had little difficulty when asked to point to words which rhyme. Genie also did very well on one evoked response test involving familiar homophones, demonstrating that, similar to these patients, her receptive language comprehension was significantly better than her expressive comprehension. An EEG consistently picked up more activity from her right hemisphere than they did from the normal locations of the Broca's area and Wernicke's area in a right-handed person, especially finding {{a high level of}} involvement from her right anterior cerebral cortex.|$|E
500|$|The coining of {{the term}} [...] "neurolinguistics" [...] is {{attributed}} to Edith Crowell Trager, Henri Hecaen and Alexandr Luria, in the late 1940s and 1950s; Luria's book [...] "Problems in Neurolinguistics" [...] is likely the first book with <b>Neurolinguistics</b> in the title. Harry Whitaker popularized <b>neurolinguistics</b> in the United States in the 1970s, founding the journal [...] "Brain and Language" [...] in 1974.|$|E
500|$|Since {{one of the}} focuses of {{this field}} is the testing of {{linguistic}} and psycholinguistic models, the technology used for experiments is highly relevant {{to the study of}} <b>neurolinguistics.</b> Modern brain imaging techniques have contributed greatly to a growing understanding of the anatomical organization of linguistic functions. [...] Brain imaging methods used in <b>neurolinguistics</b> may be classified into hemodynamic methods, electrophysiological methods, and methods that stimulate the cortex directly.|$|E
500|$|<b>Neurolinguistics</b> is {{the study}} of the neural {{mechanisms}} in the human brain that control the comprehension, production, and acquisition of language. As an interdisciplinary field, <b>neurolinguistics</b> draws methods and theories from fields such as neuroscience, linguistics, cognitive science, neurobiology, communication disorders, neuropsychology, and computer science. [...] Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in <b>neurolinguistics</b> is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. [...] Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and computer modeling.|$|E
500|$|The {{brain is}} the {{coordinating}} {{center of all}} linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, {{our knowledge of the}} neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called <b>neurolinguistics.</b>|$|E
500|$|Another area of <b>neurolinguistics</b> {{literature}} {{involves the}} use of electrophysiological techniques to analyze the rapid processing of language in time. [...] The temporal ordering of specific patterns of in brain activity may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing; for example, one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses (the ELAN, N400, and P600) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing.|$|E
500|$|In many <b>neurolinguistics</b> experiments, {{subjects}} do {{not simply}} sit {{and listen to}} or watch stimuli, but also are instructed to perform some sort of task {{in response to the}} stimuli. [...] Subjects perform these tasks while recordings (electrophysiological or hemodynamic) are being taken, usually {{in order to ensure that}} they are paying attention to the stimuli. At least one study has suggested that the task the subject does has an effect on the brain responses and the results of the experiment.|$|E
500|$|Much work in <b>neurolinguistics</b> has, like Broca's and Wernicke's early studies, {{investigated}} {{the locations of}} specific language [...] "modules" [...] within the brain. [...] Research questions include what course language information follows through the brain as it is processed, whether or not particular areas specialize in processing particular sorts of information, how different brain regions {{interact with one another}} in language processing, and how the locations of brain activation differs when a subject is producing or perceiving a language other than his or her first language.|$|E
500|$|Although {{aphasiology}} is {{the historical}} core of <b>neurolinguistics,</b> {{in recent years}} the field has broadened considerably, {{thanks in part to the}} emergence of new brain imaging technologies (such as PET and fMRI) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques (EEG and MEG), which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks; electrophysiological techniques, in particular, emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the N400, a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension. [...] The N400 was the first language-relevant brain response to be identified, and since its discovery EEG and MEG have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research.|$|E
500|$|In {{psycholinguistics}} and <b>neurolinguistics,</b> priming {{refers to}} the phenomenon whereby a subject can recognize a word more quickly {{if he or she}} has recently been presented with a word that is similar in meaning or morphological makeup (i.e., composed of similar parts). If a subject is presented with a [...] "prime" [...] word such as doctor and then a [...] "target" [...] word such as nurse, if the subject has a faster-than-usual response time to nurse then the experimenter may assume that word nurse in the brain had already been accessed when the word doctor was accessed. Priming is used to investigate a wide variety of questions about how words are stored and retrieved in the brain and how structurally complex sentences are processed.|$|E
500|$|<b>Neurolinguistics</b> is {{historically}} {{rooted in the}} development in the 19th century of aphasiology, the study of linguistic deficits (aphasias) occurring {{as the result of}} brain damage. [...] Aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing. [...] One of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was Paul Broca, a French surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies, and found that most of them had brain damage (or lesions) on the left frontal lobe, in an area now known as Broca's area. Phrenologists had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain, but Broca's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship, and has been described as [...] "epoch-making" [...] and [...] "pivotal" [...] to the fields of <b>neurolinguistics</b> and cognitive science. [...] Later, Carl Wernicke, after whom Wernicke's area is named, proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks, with Broca's area handling the motor production of speech, and Wernicke's area handling auditory speech comprehension. [...] The work of Broca and Wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain. [...] Early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of Korbinian Brodmann, who [...] "mapped" [...] the surface of the brain, dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area's cytoarchitecture (cell structure) and function; these areas, known as Brodmann areas, are still widely used in neuroscience today.|$|E
500|$|Much work in <b>neurolinguistics</b> {{involves}} {{testing and}} evaluating theories {{put forth by}} psycholinguists and theoretical linguists. [...] In general, theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized, psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind, and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures (populations and networks of neurons) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms. [...] For example, experiments in sentence processing have used the ELAN, N400, and P600 brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists, such as Janet Fodor and Lyn Frazier's [...] "serial" [...] model, and Theo Vosse and Gerard Kempen's [...] "unification model". [...] Neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain, by [...] "generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure".|$|E
500|$|Many {{studies in}} <b>neurolinguistics</b> take {{advantage}} of anomalies or violations of syntactic or semantic rules in experimental stimuli, and analyzing the brain responses elicited when a subject encounters these violations. For example, sentences beginning with phrases such as *the garden was on the worked, which violates an English phrase structure rule, often elicit a brain response called the early left anterior negativity (ELAN). Violation techniques have been in use since at least 1980, when Kutas and Hillyard first reported ERP evidence that semantic violations elicited an N400 effect. [...] Using similar methods, in 1992, Lee Osterhout first reported the P600 response to syntactic anomalies. Violation designs have also been used for hemodynamic studies (fMRI and PET): Embick and colleagues, for example, used grammatical and spelling violations to investigate the location of syntactic processing in the brain using fMRI. Another common use of violation designs is to combine two kinds of violations {{in the same sentence}} and thus make predictions about how different language processes interact with one another; this type of crossing-violation study has been used extensively to investigate how syntactic and semantic processes interact while people read or hear sentences.|$|E
