40|$|Master of Engineering ThesisAn image {{processing}} software package {{was designed to}} assign clearly distinguishable colors to DNA <b>nanobarcode</b> probes labeled with varying ratios of red and green fluorescent dyes. The DNA <b>nanobarcode</b> probes were produced using novel tri-strand Y-shaped DNA secondary structures. These Y-shaped DNA structures are multivalent and anisotropic, allowing for specific and controlled hybridization to other Y-shaped DNA building blocks to create a dendrimer-like DNA structure (DL-DNA). Here, the {{image processing}} of fluorescence-intensity-encoded nanobarcodes was explored using the MATLAB software environment. DNA nanobarcodes were created with varying green:red intensity ratios: 4 G 1 R (4 green : 1 red), 2 G 1 R, 1 G 1 R, 1 G 2 R and 1 G 4 R. Additionally, these nanobarcodes incorporated specific molecular probes to target the DNA of bacillus anthracis (anthrax), francisella tularensis (?rabbit fever?), Ebola virus, a positive control and corona virus (SARS) respectively. Fluorescence was amplified by attaching DL-DNA to polystyrene beads through biotin-avidin interactions. The nanobarcodes were visualized using a fluorescent microscope and pseudocolor images were obtained. These images were easy to distinguish for 4 G 1 R (bright green) and 1 G 4 R (bright red), but were difficult to distinguish for other ratios which showed up as different shades of yellow, green and orange. Using the image processing software, these nanobarcodes were assigned highly distinguishable colors based on their green:red intensity ratio, allowing for easy and fast visual identification of the pathogens targeted. With further development, this software package {{will be able to}} assign at least 25 different and visually distinguishable colors for two and three fluorescent dyes arranged in varying ratios to create high throughput visual screening of harmful pathogens.

40|$|Determination of {{the fate}} of {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) in a biological system, or NP biodistribution, is critical in evaluating a NP formulation for nanomedicine. Unlike small-molecule drugs, NPs impose unique challenges {{in the design of}} appropriate biodistribution studies due to their small size and subsequent detection signal. Current methods to determine NP biodistribution are greatly inadequate due to their limited detection thresholds. There is an overwhelming need for a sensitive and efficient imaging-based method that can (1) detect and measure small numbers of NPs of various types, ideally single NPs, (2) associate preferential NP uptake with histological cell type by preserving spatial information in samples, and (3) allow for relatively quick and accurate NP detection in in vitro (and possibly ex vivo) samples for comprehensive NP biodistribution studies. Herein, a novel method for improved NP detection is proposed, coined 2 ̆ 2 nanobarcoding. 2 ̆ 2 Nanobarcoding utilizes a non-endogenous oligonucleotide, or 2 ̆ 2 <b>nanobarcode</b> 2 ̆ 2 (NB), conjugated to the NP surface to amplify the detection signal from a single NP via in situ polymerase chain reaction (ISPCR), and this signal amplification will facilitate rapid and precise detection of single NPs inside cells over large areas of sample such that more sophisticated studies can be performed on the NP-positive subpopulation. Moreover, nanobarcoding {{has the potential to be}} applied to the detection of more than one NP type to study the effects of physicochemical properties, targeting mechanisms, and route of entry on NP biodistribution. The nanobarcoding method was validated in vitro using NB-functionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (NB-SPIONs) as the model NP type for improved NP detection inside HeLa human cervical cancer cells, a cell line commonly used for ISPCR-mediated detection of human papilloma virus (HPV). Nanotoxicity effects of NB-SPIONs were also evaluated at the single-cell level using LEAP (Laser-Enabled Analysis and Processing, Intrexon, San Diego, CA), and NB-SPIONs were found to be less toxic than its precursor, carboxylated SPIONs (COOH-SPIONs). ...|$|E

EZZ protein, which can bind to almost all IgG antibodies, was selected to be conjugated to DNA linker. Different methods of DNA-protein conjugation were used to develop universal adapters between IgG antibodies and DNA. Using DNA <b>nanobarcodes,</b> {{which is based on}} the color ratios of two colors rather than using different colors, a library of IgG-based <b>nanobarcodes</b> were generated through a simple mixing step. The IgG-based <b>nanobarcodes</b> were used as a platform to simultaneously detect target proteins in different systems, including microbead-based, membrane-based, and tissue-based.

40|$|Trisha Eustaquio, James F LearyWeldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USABackground: Determination of {{the fate}} of {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) in a biological system, or NP biodistribution, is critical in evaluating an NP formulation for nanomedicine. Current methods to determine NP biodistribution are greatly inadequate, due to their limited detection thresholds. Herein, proof of concept of a novel method for improved NP detection based on in situ polymerase chain reaction (ISPCR), coined &ldquo;nanobarcoding,&rdquo; is demonstrated. Methods: <b>Nanobarcoded</b> superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (NB-SPIONs) were characterized by dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, and hyperspectral imaging measurements. Cellular uptake of Cy 5 -labeled NB-SPIONs (Cy 5 -NB-SPIONs) was imaged by confocal microscopy. The feasibility of the <b>nanobarcoding</b> method was first validated by solution-phase PCR and &ldquo;pseudo&rdquo;-ISPCR before implementation in the model in vitro system of HeLa human cervical adenocarcinoma cells, a cell line commonly used for ISPCR-mediated detection of human papilloma virus (HPV). Results: Dynamic light-scattering measurements showed that NB conjugation stabilized SPION size in different dispersion media {{compared to that of}} its precursor, carboxylated SPIONs (COOH-SPIONs), while the zeta potential became more positive after NB conjugation. Hyperspectral imaging confirmed NB conjugation and showed that the NB completely covered the SPION surface. Solution-phase PCR and pseudo-ISPCR showed that the expected amplicons were exclusively generated from the NB-SPIONs in a dose-dependent manner. Although confocal microscopy revealed minimal cellular uptake of Cy 5 -NB-SPIONs at 50 nM over 24 hours in individual cells, ISPCR detected definitive NB-SPION signals inside HeLa cells over large sample areas. Conclusion: Proof of concept of the <b>nanobarcoding</b> method has been demonstrated in in vitro systems, but the technique needs further development before its widespread use as a standardized assay.

40|$|Masters ThesisMethods for {{producing}} DNA building blocks with high purity and yield were investigated, including solid-phase DNA synthesis and plasmid amplified DNA synthesis (PADS). In addition, {{an analysis of}} the properties of dendrimer-like DNA (DL-DNA) as nanobiosensor was conducted to explore the viability of its real-world application. Four-armed dsDNA building blocks (X-DNA's) were successfully acquired using solid-phase synthesis. X-DNA consisted of 4 oligonucleotides that are partially complementary such that a cross-shaped dsDNA molecule is formed upon annealing. It was ligated to a 30 bp dsDNA spacer immobilized onto micrometer-sized 6 % cross-linked agarose beads via biotin-avidin interactions. A subsequent washing step was performed to rid the sample of non-X-DNA structures, and X-DNA was released from the spacer by restriction enzyme digestion. Gel electrophoresis of the product showed higher purity, 72 % compared to 67. 5 % shown in the solution-hybridized X-DNA prior to solid-phase. Characterization of X-DNA was performed by ligation of 4 complementary hairpin loops which serve to close off all open dsDNA ends and prevent the structure from exonuclease digestion. Unchanged DNA concentration after 15 and 30 min of ExoIII digestion at 37 oC was observed, confirming the synthesis of X-DNA. Plasmid amplified DNA synthesis takes advantage of the natural DNA producing system in Escherichia coli for high-yield production of plasmids containing sequence for three-armed DNA building blocks (Y-DNA). A nicking enzyme was used to produce a single-stranded break in the plasmid. ExoIII digestion at 37 oC was performed to produce ssDNA plasmids. Annealing at 70 oC causes a branched hairpin (Y-shape) to form on each ssDNA strand. Simultaneous digestion of the Y-shape hairpin by three enzymes produces Y-DNA. Single and combinational of enzyme digestion was applied to characterize the ssDNA plasmid, and determined to be a Y-shape structure. Lastly, fluorescent DNA <b>nanobarcodes</b> were analyzed for their purity, coding capability, compared to concentration-based coding method, as well as differential bleaching of green (G) and red (R) fluorescence. Pure populations of DNA <b>nanobarcodes</b> (4 G 1 R, 2 G 1 R, 1 G 1 R, 1 G 2 R, 1 G 4 R) and multi-code mixtures, immobilized on 5. 5 um polystyrene beads, were obtained. The fluorescent intensities (R and G) were measured from 12 -bit images taken by a wide-field microscope; the illumination source is a Mercury arc lamp and respective fluorescent colors obtained using green and far-red filters. The purity of each population was assessed by analyzing the magnitude of R/G fluorescent ratio standard deviation for each pure barcode populations (N> 50 beads). Comparison of the mean for each codes to a theoretical R/G ratio yield their codability. The DNA <b>nanobarcodes</b> were determined to be pure and their experimental R/G ratios conform to theoretical values, unlike concentration-based DNA barcodes. Bleaching analysis of red and green fluorodyes reveal that red dye bleach faster than green, however the ratio of R/G, and <b>nanobarcodes,</b> did not change significantly over time...|$|R

Nanotechnology is now invading the food industry and establishing great potential. Nanotechnology applications in food industry include: encapsulation and delivery of substances in targeted sites, increasing the flavor,introducing antibacterial nanoparticles into food, enhancement of shelf life, sensing contamination, improved food storage, tracking, tracing and brand protection. Nano food processing and products can change the color, flavor, or sensory characteristics; they also change the nutritional functionality, removes chemicals or pathogens from food. Nano food packaging materials may extend food life due to high barrier packaging, improve food safety, alert consumers that food is contaminated or spoiled, repair tears in packaging, and even release preservatives to extend the life of the food in the package. <b>Nanobarcodes</b> are used for safety labeling and monitor distribution of food products.

40|$|Gas sensors are {{devices that}} can convert the {{concentration}} of an analyte gas into an electronic signal. Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an important n-type metal oxide semiconductor which has been utilized as sensor for several decades. In recent years, there have been extensive investigations of nanoscale semiconductor gas sensors. The size reduction of ZnO sensors to nanometer scale provides {{a good opportunity to}} dramatically increase their sensing properties in comparison with their macroscale counterparts. In this work, two kinds of ZnO nanostructures (nanowires and nanorods) were studied. ZnO nanowires were synthesized by electrodeposition while porous anodic aluminum oxide served as a growth template. Three types of ZnO nanowires with different diameters were obtained. Meanwhile, ZnO nanorods were prepared by a hydrothermal route from ZnO nanoparticle seeds. However, the aspect ratio (length/width) of nanorods was significantly smaller than that of nanowires. Both nanowires and nanorods were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The sensing performance of the synthetic ZnO nanostructures were investigated by three gases: saturated water vapour in air, saturated ethanol vapour in air, and carbon monoxide in air. Both ZnO nanostructures showed good sensitivity and selectivity to ethanol vapour. At high temperature, the ZnO nanosensors were up to seven times more responsive to ethanol vapour than water vapour and over 200 times more responsive to ethanol vapour than CO. Due to the size dependence, ZnO nanowires with the smallest diameter is considered the best sensor candidate among ZnO nanowires. On the basis of previous work, Au/ZnO/Au multimetallic <b>nanobarcodes</b> were also synthesized by electrodeposition, and their sensing characteristics are to be investigated in the future...|$|R

Extremelly small size (1 - 100 nm) enables them to enter the human body through usual or unusual routes, pass through cell membranes, or cross the blood-brain barrier. Gravity loses impact and importance, surface tension and Van der Waals constants has more importance in system of nano particles. Nanotechnology is already used in various applications, with potential tobe applied at any stage in food industry: production, preservation, processing, packaging,transport, <b>nanobarcodes</b> for food authenticity and tracing, labelling, keeping the quality of food products, extend the products shelf-life, removal of undesirable tastes, flavours or allergens from food products, nano (bio) sensors for food safety, water filtration. Risks of nanotechnology are still unknown and unpredictable. Initial scientific studies showed negative effects on living organisms and a potential for serious threat to human health. Authorities of the most developed countries, have set up, guidance documents and procedures for nanoenabled products based on existing regulations, appropriate in vitro and in vivo ADME studies (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) and requirements for standardised and harmonised analytical test methods for proper risk assesments, clear identification and characterization of nano-hazards. Nanotechnology in medicine (Nanomedicine) apply for rapid and sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria {{and low levels of}} viruses, in small sample volumes, at lower costs than current in-use technologies. This advance in early detection enables accurate and prompt treatment. Nano-robots to make repairs at the cellular level are under development.
