40|$|This thesis investigates lossy {{wireless}} networks, {{which are}} wireless communication networks consisting of lossy wireless links, where the packet transmission via a lossy wireless link is successful {{with a certain}} value of probability. In particular, this thesis analyses all-to-all broadcast in lossy wireless networks, where every node has a native packet to transmit to all other nodes in the network. A challenge of all-to-all broadcast in lossy wireless networks is the reliability, which {{is defined as the}} probability that every node in the network successfully obtains a copy of the native packets of all other nodes. In this thesis, two novel <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> are proposed, which are the neighbour <b>network</b> coding <b>scheme</b> and the random neighbour <b>network</b> coding <b>scheme.</b> In the two proposed <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes,</b> a node may perform a bit-wise exclusive or (XOR) operation to combine the native packet of itself and the native packet of its neighbour, called the coding neighbour, into an XOR coded packet. The reliability of all-to-all broadcast under both the proposed <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> is investigated analytically using Markov chains. It is shown that the reliability of all-to-all broadcast can be improved considerably by employing the proposed <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes,</b> compared with non-coded networks with the same link conditions, i. e. same probabilities of successful packet transmission via wireless channels. Further, the proposed schemes take the link conditions of each node into account to maximise the reliability of a given network. To be more precise, the first scheme proposes the optimal coding neighbour selection method while the second scheme introduces a tuning parameter to control the probability that a node performs network coding at each transmission. The observation that channel condition can {{have a significant impact on}} the performance of <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> is expected to be applicable to other <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> for lossy wireless networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Several {{wireless}} <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> apply either inter-flow traffic or intra-flow traffic, but not both. This paper {{proposes a}} novel batched <b>network</b> coding <b>scheme</b> {{to deal with}} both inter-flow and intra-flow traffics, which attempts to combine the advantages of both network coding approaches. Based on the idea in the well-known <b>network</b> coding <b>scheme</b> COPE, our batched <b>network</b> cod-ing <b>scheme</b> allows each node {{to make use of}} intra-flow network coding technique to improve the transmission reliability in a lossy environment, consequently obtaining higher throughput. Moreover, we also utilize the multiple-path transmitting scheme to further increase the throughput of wireless networks with low link delivery probability. Finally, using a simplified network topology model, we show theoretically that our proposed scheme outperforms COPE significantly, particularly when the link quality is low...|$|R

Regarding robustness, especially rateless network coding was shown to be beneficial. However, the vulnerability of mere network coding against attacks requires introducing security mechanisms, and as known, security implies costs. Within this paper, we evaluate the efficiency of secure <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> applied in a rateless manner. Our results show that secure rateless <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> can still outperform routing. The actual efficiency depends on parameters like generation size, packet size, or network topology. Since conflicting efficiency parameters cannot be fulfilled in equal measure, selection of a secure <b>network</b> coding <b>scheme</b> and its parameters should be done adapted to the actual communication requirements...|$|R

50|$|His {{research}} has focused on the extraordinary capability of the brain to control movement. Early on he demonstrated that networks within the mammalian spinal cord can produce the detailed motor pattern of locomotion involving the coordination of hundreds of different muscles. In a paper published in 1987, he and James Buchanan provided a putative <b>network</b> <b>scheme</b> of interacting interneurons in the lamprey spinal cord, a model vertebrate system. The level of detail gained in this work was claimed to be unique in that it allowed changes in behaviour to be related to changes occurring at the cellular and network level, such that the cellular basis of locomotion, steering and posture is understood in this biological model system. Given the issues and difficulties of linking cellular effects to behaviour, these claims are unique. However, the claims lack the necessary experimental support, even for the simplest aspect, the organisation of the locomotor network output, where connections that are incorporated into models have not been identified in the actual system. The gaps in the proposed network organisation necessarily weaken any claims to understanding the cellular mechanisms of behaviour (see Parker 2006, 2010).|$|E

40|$|International audienceNetwork Coding (NC) is a {{technique}} used for effective and secure communication by improving the network capacity, throughput, efficiency, and robustness. In network coding, data packets are encoded by intermediate nodes and are then decoded at the destination nodes. Network coding has been successfully applied {{in a variety of}} networks including relay networks, peer-to-peer networks, wireless networks, cognitive radio networks, and wireless sensor networks. Cognitive radio network (CRN) is an emerging field which exploits the utilization of unused spectrum or white spaces, effectively and efficiently. In CRNs, <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> are also applied to maximize the spectrum utilization, as well as to maintain the effective and secure transmission of data packets over the network. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> in cognitive radio networks, highlighting the motivations for and the applications of network coding in CRNs. We provide typical case studies of <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> in CRNs, as well as the taxonomy of <b>network</b> coding <b>schemes</b> in CRNs.
