40|$|The {{developing}} {{nervous system}} is {{particularly vulnerable to}} chemical insults. Exposure to chemicals can result in neurobehavioural alterations, and these {{have been used as}} sensitive readouts to assess neurotoxicity in animals and man. Deconstructing <b>neurobehaviour</b> into relevant cellular and molecular components may allow for detection of specific neurotoxic effects in cell-based systems, which in turn may allow an easier examination of neurotoxic pathways and modes of actions and eventually inform the regulatory assessment of chemicals with potential developmental neurotoxicity. Here, current developments towards these goals are reviewed. Imaging genetics (CB) provides new insights into the neurobiological correlates of cognitive function that are being used to delineate neurotoxic mechanisms. The gaps between in vivo <b>neurobehaviour</b> and real-time in vitro measurements of neuronal function are being bridged by ex vivo measurements of synaptic plasticity (RW). An example of solvent neurotoxicity demonstrates how an in vivo neurological defect can be linked via the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) -glutamate receptor as a common target to in vitro readouts (AB). Axonal and dendritic morphology in vitro proved to be good correlates of neuronal connectivity and <b>neurobehaviour</b> in animals exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls and organophosphorus pesticides (PJL). Similarly, chemically induced changes in neuronal morphology affected the formation of neuronal networks on structured surfaces. Such network formation may become an important readout for developmental neurotoxicity in vitro (CvT), especially when combined with human neurons derived from embryonic stem cells (ML). We envision that future in vitro test systems for developmental neurotoxicity will combine the above approaches with exposure information, and we suggest a strategy for test system development and cell-based risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{effect of}} {{administration}} of Amodiaquine (AQ) on some parameters of <b>neurobehaviour</b> of Wistar rats was carried out. Twenty adult Wistar rats weighing between 160 - 190 g were divided equally into four groups. Group 1 {{served as the}} control, while groups 2, 3 and 4 were the experimental groups. The control group received distilled water. Groups 2 and 3 were treated with 8. 75 mg/kg and 17. 50 mg/kg respectively of AQ for three days, while group 4 was treated with 8. 75 mg/kg of AQ for six days. <b>Neurobehaviour</b> test using the open field was carried out twelve hours after the last administrations. There {{were no significant differences}} between the control and the experimental groups in total locomotor activity (TLA), central square duration (CSD), stretch-attend (SA) and defecation. In the central square frequency (CSF), group 3 was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than all the groups, while the control was the same as group 4, but higher than group 2, with the difference not being significant. In conclusion, AQ increased TLA and exploration, while simultaneously reducing anxiety in Wistar rats and these were dose dependent...|$|E
40|$|Serotonergic fibres have a {{pervasive}} innervation of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) -affected {{areas in the}} neonatal brain and serotonin (5 -HT) is pivotal in numerous <b>neurobehaviours</b> that match many HI-induced deficits. However, {{little is known about}} how neonatal HI affects the serotonergic system. We therefore examined whether neonatal HI can alter numbers of serotonergic raphe neurons in specific sub-divisions of the midbrain and brainstem since these nuclei are the primary sources of serotonin throughout the central nervous system (CNS). We utilised an established neonatal HI model in the postnatal day 3 (P 3) rat pup (right common carotid artery ligation + 30 min 6 % O(2)) and determined the effects of P 3 HI on 5 -HT counts in 5 raphe sub-divisions in the midbrain and brainstem one and six weeks later. After P 3 HI, numbers of 5 -HT-positive neurons were significantly decreased in the dorsal raphe dorsal, dorsal raphe ventrolateral and dorsal raphe caudal nuclei on P 10 but only in the dorsal raphe dorsal and dorsal raphe ventrolateral nuclei on P 45. In contrast, P 3 HI did not alter counts in the dorsal raphe interfascicular and raphe magnus nuclei. We also discovered that P 3 HI significantly reduces brainstem SERT protein expression; the key regulator of 5 -HT in the CNS. In conclusion, neonatal HI injury caused significant disruption of the brainstem serotonergic system that can persist for up to six weeks after the insult. The different vulnerabilities of serotonergic populations in specific raphe nuclei suggest that certain raphe nuclei may underpin neurological deficits in HI-affected neonates through to adulthood.

40|$|Background: Infants born < 30 weeks' {{gestation}} are {{at increased}} risk of long term neurodevelopmental problems compared with term born peers. The predictive value of neurobehavioural examinations at term equivalent age in very preterm infants has been reported for subsequent impairment. Yet there is little knowledge surrounding earlier neurobehavioural development in preterm infants prior to term equivalent age, and how it relates to perinatal factors, cerebral structure, and later developmental outcomes. In addition, maternal psychological wellbeing has been associated with child development. Given the high rate of psychological distress reported by parents of preterm children, it is vital we understand maternal and paternal wellbeing in the early weeks and months after preterm birth and how this influences the parent-child relationship and children's outcomes. Therefore this study aims to examine how 1) early <b>neurobehaviour</b> and 2) parental mental health relate to developmental outcomes for infants born preterm compared with infants born at term. Methods/Design: This prospective cohort study will describe the <b>neurobehaviour</b> of 150 infants born at < 30 weeks' gestational age from birth to term equivalent age, and explore how early neurobehavioural deficits relate to brain growth or injury determined by magnetic resonance imaging, perinatal factors, parental mental health and later developmental outcomes measured using standardised assessment tools at term, one and two years' corrected age. A control group of 150 healthy term-born infants will also be recruited for comparison of outcomes. To examine the effects of parental mental health on developmental outcomes, both parents of preterm and term-born infants will complete standardised questionnaires related to symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress at regular intervals from the first week of their child's birth until their child's second birthday. The parent-child relationship will be assessed at one and two years' corrected age. Discussion: Detailing the trajectory of infant <b>neurobehaviour</b> and parental psychological distress following very preterm birth is important not only to identify infants most at risk, further understand the parental experience and highlight potential times for intervention for the infant and/or parent, but also to gain insight into the effect this has on parent-child interaction and child development.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the developmental neurotoxic {{effects of exposure}} to low-dose ionizing radiation (IR), alone or together with xenobiotics, during a critical period of neonatal brain development in mice. During mammalian brain development there is a period called the brain growth spurt (BGS), which involves extensive growth and maturation of the brain. It is known that neonatal exposure during the BGS to xenobiotics can {{have a negative impact}} on neonatal brain development, resulting in impaired cognitive function in the adult mouse. In humans, the BGS starts during the third trimester of pregnancy and continues for approximately 2 years in the child. Â  The present thesis has identified a defined critical period, during the BGS, when IR can induce developmental neurotoxicity in mice. The observed neurotoxicity was not dependent on sex or strain and manifested as altered <b>neurobehaviour</b> in the adult mouse. Furthermore, fractionated dose exposures appear to be as potent as a higher acute dose. The cholinergic system can be a target system for developmental neurotoxicity of IR, since alterations in adult mouse cholinergic system susceptibility were observed. Co-exposure to IR and nicotine exacerbated the behavioural disturbances and cholinergic system dysfunction. Furthermore, co-exposure with the environmental agent paraquat has indicated that the dopaminergic system can be a potential target. Â  In this thesis, clinically relevant doses of IR and a sedative/anesthetic agent (ketamine) were shown to interact and exacerbate defects in adult mouse <b>neurobehaviour,</b> learning and memory, following neonatal exposure, at doses where the single agents did not have any impact on the measured variables. This indicates a shift in the dose-response curve for IR, towards lower doses, if exposure occurs during the neonatal brain development. In addition, co-exposed mice, showing cognitive defects, expressed elevated levels of tau protein in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, exacerbation of neurochemical deviations were observed following co-exposure compared to irradiation alone. Further investigations of neurotoxic effects following fractionated or acute low-dose IR, modelling the clinical situation during repeated CT scans or levels of radiation deposited in non-target tissue during radiotherapy, and possible interaction effects with xenobiotics, is of great importance in the field of radioprotection. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{chlorinated}} {{organic compounds}} comprise {{a large group of}} compounds with a complex diversity of biologic effects and mechanisms of action. Based on the persistence and high toxicity of dioxins, PCBs, and DDT, this chapter focuses primarily on the toxicology of these organochlorine compounds. Not even these groups of compounds can be regarded as homogenous since the individual congeners show diverse environmental fates and toxicities. In this chapter, primarily the critical effects suspected to occur at human exposure at background levels are discussed, i. e. cancer, and effects on reproduction, <b>neurobehaviour</b> and the immune system. In recent years, interactions between these compounds and hormonal systems have received increasing attention. They have also been shown to be particularly toxic to the develop-ing embryo, fetus and infant. In order to conduct risk assessment with a higher degree of accu-racy, {{there is a need for}} further mechanistical data, and additional epidemiological studies, espe-cially with regard to effects on reproductive, neurobehavioural and immune systems. The data presently available suggest that such effects already occur in the human population and thus, in order to reduce the exposure to these compounds, further release into the environment should be prevented...|$|E

Many species of animals {{have been described as}} 'Vahanas,' that is, animals ridden by various Hindu deities. The sculptures and drawings of a number of deities also include these mounts with their characteristic behavioural patterns. However, scientific investigations on animal behaviour is a recently developed branch of biological science in India, initiated in the late 1950 's. Systematic ethological research on various species of Indian animals was begun only in early 1970 's, after the formation of the Ethological Society of India. At present a variety of topics such as foraging and feeding behaviour, habitat selection, social and reproductive behaviour, chronobiology, chemical communication signals and <b>neurobehaviour</b> are being investigated by Indian ethologists, who are mainly zoologists, and a few psychologists. A wide range of species from lower metazoa to higher vertebrates are observed by ethologists in India. An analysis of the development of ethology in India indicates that the progress of this discipline as a major field of research and teaching in India is satisfactory. Further, if the present trend is maintained, ethology should develop as a major discipline of animal research in India by the year 2000...|$|E
40|$|ArtÃ­culo de publicaciÃ³n ISIOestrogens play an {{important}} role in development and function of the brain and reproductive tract. Accordingly, it is considered that developmental exposure to environmental oestrogens can disrupt neural and reproductive tract development, potentially resulting in long-term alterations in <b>neurobehaviour</b> and reproductive function. Many chemicals have been shown to have oestrogenic activity, whereas others affect oestrogen production and turnover, resulting in the disruption of oestrogen signalling pathways. However, these mechanisms and the concentrations required to induce these effects cannot account for the myriad adverse effects of environmental toxicants on oestrogen-sensitive target tissues. Hence, alternative mechanisms are assumed to underlie the adverse effects documented in experimental animal models and thus could be important to human health. In this review, the epigenetic regulation of gene expression is explored as a potential target of environmental toxicants including oestrogenic chemicals. We suggest that toxicant-induced changes in epigenetic signatures are important mechanisms underlying the disruption of ovarian follicular development. In addition, we discuss how exposure to environmental oestrogens during early life can alter gene expression through effects on epigenetic control potentially leading to permanent changes in ovarian physiology.

40|$|New {{information}} on the lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and fipronil on organisms is presented in this review, complementing the previous WIA in 2015. The high toxicity of these systemic insecticides to invertebrates has been confirmed and expanded to include more species and compounds. Most of the recent {{research has focused on}} bees and the sublethal and ecological impacts these insecticides have on pollinators. Toxic effects on other invertebrate taxa also covered predatory and parasitoid natural enemies and aquatic arthropods. Little, while not much new information has been gathered on soil organisms. The impact on marine coastal ecosystems is still largely uncharted. The chronic lethality of neonicotinoids to insects and crustaceans, and the strengthened evidence that these chemicals also impair the immune system and reproduction, highlights the dangers of this particular insecticidal classneonicotinoids and fipronil., withContinued large scale â mostly prophylactic â use of these persistent organochlorine pesticides has the potential to greatly decreasecompletely eliminate populations of arthropods in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.

Effects of maternal exposure to 2, 2 â², 4, 4 â² tetrabromo diphenylether (BDE 47) was investigated, alongside the potential ameliorating impact of seafood nutrients, through assessment of <b>neurobehaviour</b> and gene expression in brain and liver. Developing mice were exposed during gestation and lactation via dams dosed through casein- or salmon-based feed, spiked with BDE 47. Two concentrations were used: a low level (6 Â Î¼g/kg feed) representing an environmentally realistic concentration and a high level (1, 900 Â Î¼g/kg feed) representing a BDE 47 intake much higher than expected from frequents consumption of contaminated seafood. Experimental groups were similar with respect to reproductive success, growth and physical development. Minor, transient changes in neurobehavioural metrics were observed in groups given the highest dose of BDE 47. No significant differences in behaviour or development were seen on postnatal dayÂ  18 among maternally exposed offspring. Cerebral gene expression investigated by microarray analyses and validated by RT-qPCR showed low fold changes for all genes, despite dose-dependent accumulation of BDE 47 in brain tissue. The gene for glutamate ammonia ligase was upregulated compared to control in the casein-based high BDE 47 diet, suggesting potential impacts on downstream synaptic transmission. The study supported a previously observed regulation of Igfbp 2 in brain with BDE 47 exposure. Genes for hepatic metabolic enzymes were not influenced by BDE 47.

40|$|Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an {{intermediate}} filament protein {{expressed in the}} astrocyte cytoskeleton that {{plays an important role}} in the structure and function of the cell. GFAP can be phosphorylated at six serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residues but little is known about the role of GFAP phosphorylation in physiological and pathophysiological states. We have generated antibodies against two phosphorylated GFAP (pGFAP) proteins: p 8 GFAP, where GFAP is phosphorylated at Ser- 8 and p 13 GFAP, where GFAP is phosphorylated at Ser- 13. We examined p 8 GFAP and p 13 GFAP expression in the control neonatal pig brain and at 24 and 72 h after an hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated pGFAP expression in astrocytes with an atypical cytoskeletal morphology, even in control brains. Semi-quantitative western blotting revealed that p 8 GFAP expression was significantly increased at 24 h post-insult in HI animals with seizures in frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices. At 72 h post-insult, p 8 GFAP and p 13 GFAP expression were significantly increased in HI animals with seizures in brain regions that are vulnerable to cellular damage (cortex and basal ganglia), but no changes were observed in brain regions that are relatively spared following an HI insult (brain stem and cerebellum). Increased pGFAP expression was associated with poor neurological outcomes such as abnormal encephalography and <b>neurobehaviour,</b> and increased histological brain damage.

40|$|Neuroinvasive larvae of the {{worldwide}} occurring zoonotic roundworms Toxocara canis and T. cati may induce neurotoxocarosis (NT) in humans, provoking a variety of symptoms including cognitive deficits as well as neurological dysfunctions. An association with neuropsychological disorders has been discussed. Similar symptoms have been described in T. canis-infected mice, whereas data on T. cati-induced NT are rare. Therefore, it was aimed to obtain insights into the impact on <b>neurobehaviour</b> as well as progression of neurological symptoms and behavioural alterations {{during the course of}} NT directly comparing T. canis- and T. cati-infected mice as models for human NT. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were orally infected with 2000 embryonated T. canis or T. cati eggs, respectively, the control group received tap water. Mice were screened weekly for neurobehavioural alterations and memory function starting one day prior infection until 97 days post infection (pi; T. canis-infection) and day 118 pi (T. cati-infection, uninfected control). Mostly motoric and neurological parameters were affected in T. canis-infected mice starting day 20 pi with severe progression accompanied by stereotypical circling. In contrast, T. cati-infected mice mostly showed reduced response to sudden sound stimulus (indicator for excitability) and flight behaviour starting day 6 pi. Interestingly, enhanced grooming behaviour was observed exclusively in T. cati-infected mice, indicating a possible role of neurotransmitter dysregulation. Reduced exploratory behaviour and memory impairment was observed in both infection groups with delayed onset and less severe progression in T. cati- compared to T. canis-infected mice. Results highlight the need to consider T. cati beside T. canis as causative agent of human NT. Findings provide valuable hints towards differences in key regulatory mechanisms during T. canis- and T. cati-induced NT, contributing to a comprehensive picture and consequently a broader understanding of NT, which will aid in developing strategies towards prevention in addition to novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} Alzheimerâs disease poses a considerable socioeconomic {{challenge in the}} years ahead. There are few clinical treatments available and none capable of halting or slowing the progressive nature of the condition. Despite decades of experimental research and testing over 300 interventions in transgenic mouse models of the condition, clinical success has remained elusive.

Therefore I performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on interventions tested in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimerâs disease. My systematic search was performed by electronically searching for publications reporting the efficacy of interventions tested in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease. Across these publications I extracted data regarding study characteristics and reported study quality alongside outcome data for pathology (i. e. plaque burden, amyloid beta species, tau, cellular infiltrates and neurodegeneration) and <b>neurobehaviour.</b> From these data I calculated estimates of efficacy using random effects meta-analysis and subsequently investigated the potential impact of study quality and study characteristics on observed effect size. My search identified 427 publications, 357 interventions and 55 transgenic models representing 11, 688 animals and 1774 experiments. There were a number of principal concerns regarding the dataset: (i) the reported study quality of such studies was relatively low; less than 1 in 5 publications reported blinded assessment of outcome or random allocation to group and no studies reported a sample size calculation, (ii) the depth of data on any individual intervention was relatively poor-only 16 interventions had outcomes described in 5 or more publications and (iii) publication bias analyses suggested 1 in 5 pathological and 1 in 7 neurobehavioural experiments remain unpublished. Where I inspected relationships between outcomes, meta-regression identified a number of notable associations.

40|$|Lysine Specific Demethylases (LSD 1 and LSD 2 {{also known}} as KDM 1 A and KDM 1 B) are histone {{modifiers}} known to specifically demethylate dimethyl and monomethyl H 3 K 4. They play roles in development and cancer mechanisms through regulation of the cell cycle and progenitor differentiation pathways but {{have not yet been}} characterised in the circadian system. LSD 1 and LSD 2 were shown {{to play a role in}} circadian oscillation in vitro in unpublished preliminary work. Knockdown of either gene caused dampened circadian oscillations of gene and protein expression. However, circadian rhythms could not be assessed in vivo as the Kdm 1 a -/- animal was embryonic lethal and the Kdm 1 b -/- animal displayed reproductive deficits. In order to generate a viable animal model of LSD disruption for assessment of adult circadian phenotypes in vivo the Harwell ENU mutant archive was screened for ENU-induced point mutations in non-catalytic domains of the two genes. The mutations found in the screen were investigated in vitro and in silico, and subsequently four mutations chosen for re-derivation by IVF (Kdm 1 a E 440 G, Kdm 1 a L 491 H, Kdm 1 b T 357 M and Kdm 1 b P 281 L). LSD 1 and LSD 2 were found to interact with circadian clock proteins in vitro. The LSD 1 mutations were found to decrease the ability of LSD 1 to bind to its primary cofactor CoREST and to CLOCK, BMAL 1 and PER 1 and PER 2. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies were used to investigate LSD 1 mutant binding of circadian promoters and demethylation of histone H 3. Non-significant impairment of demethylase activity and binding suggest that the resulting phenotype is more subtle than in knockout cells. In vivo, adult LSD 1 and LSD 2 mutant animals were shown to display background strain-dependent circadian phenotypes. Kdm 1 a E 440 G/E 440 G animals displayed a deficit in circadian masking but a normal phase response to nocturnal light pulses and normal pupillary constriction. This suggests that LSD 1 plays a role in phase resetting. Kdm 1 b T 357 M/T 357 M animals displayed an increased phase shift in response to 15 -minute light pulses at CT 22 indicating a phase resetting phenotype. Gene expression in mutant animal livers was assessed and only subtle changes in circadian gene expression were observed. In neurobehavioural phenotyping, Kdm 1 a E 440 G/E 440 G mutants were hyperresponsive to handling, showed impaired learning and memory, and displayed subtle discrepancies in anxiety and social dominance parameters. Kdm 1 b T 357 M/T 357 M animals displayed less neurobehavioural abnormalities, including an increase in time freezing in response to foot shock in fear conditioning. Histological examination revealed a hypogonadal phenotype in Kdm 1 aM E 440 G/E 440 G animals which may be accounted for by disruption of the previousl established developmental roles of LSD 1. Finally a screen of epigenetic modifier compounds revealed that small molecule demethylase inhibitors alter circadian period in fibroblasts and in the SCN itself. This investigation lends an insight into the roles of LSD 1 and LSD 2 in the circadian system and <b>neurobehaviour</b> and identifies future avenues of investigation that could clarify these roles further. </p...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim domain protein 4 (Npas 4) is an activity-dependent {{transcription}} factor {{belonging to the}} basic Helix-Loop-Helix-PAS family of regulatory proteins. Npas 4 has been demonstrated {{to play a role}} in regulating both inhibitory and excitatory synapse formation in a neuronal cell type-specific manner and controlling the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophin that is important for neuronal survival, differentiation and synaptic plasticity. Studies have also revealed a functional role for Npas 4 in hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent learning and memory formation, as well as cognitive and social <b>neurobehaviour.</b> Due to its central role in homeostasis of neuronal excitation and inhibition, Npas 4 has been linked to a host of psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder and cognition-related disorders. Upregulated Npas 4 expression has been documented following various brain insults, including ischaemia. Although previous studies have demonstrated a role for Npas 4 in the protection of neurons against several types of neurodegenerative insult, little is known about its neuroprotective role in response to ischaemic brain injury. Chapter 2 demonstrates that Npas 4 has a neuroprotective role in ischaemia since Npas 4 deficiency increased the susceptibility of cultured neurons to cell death by oxygen and glucose deprivation and aggravated the severity of brain injury after photochemical stroke in mice. Furthermore, ablation of Npas 4 caused an increase in activated astrocytes and microglia, pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin- 6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha levels and a switch from apoptotic to necrotic cell death following focal cerebral ischaemia. These findings suggest that the mechanism underlying the in vivo protective effect of Npas 4 after ischaemic insult could be due to its capacity to limit progressive neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Npas 4 is a brain-specific {{transcription factor}} whose expression has been reported to be enriched in neurogenic regions of the brain, implicating a role for Npas 4 in neurogenesis. Using two independent in vitro models of neurogenesis, we recently demonstrated that Npas 4 expression is dynamic and highly regulated during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the factors responsible for regulating Npas 4 expression during this process remain to be elucidated. Given that increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play central roles in both embryonic and adult neurogenesis, we reasoned that miRNAs are good candidates for the regulation of Npas 4 expression during neural differentiation of ESCs. Chapter 3 provides insight into the underlying mechanisms by which Npas 4 expression is regulated during neural differentiation of mouse ESCs (mESCs). In this study, we utilized the 'next-generation' or 'deep' sequencing method to profile miRNA expression during neural differentiation of mESCs. Two differentially expressed miRNAs were identified to be able to significantly reduce reporter gene activity by targeting the Npas 4 3 'UTR, namely miR- 744 and miR- 224. More importantly, ectopic expression of these miRNAs during neural differentiation resulted in downregulation of endogenous Npas 4 expression. Subsequent functional analysis revealed that overexpression of either miR- 744 or miR- 224 delayed neural differentiation, reduced GABAergic neuron production and inhibited neurite outgrowth. Taken together, the data presented indicate that Npas 4 not only plays a role at the early stages of neural differentiation of mESCs but may also, at least in part, influence neuronal subtype specification and neurite development. Given the significant role of miRNA in regulating gene expression, knowledge of the miRNA profile across different time points during neural differentiation of mESCs will be crucial to better understanding of the mechanisms governing neurogenesis. Chapter 4 further examines the next-generation sequencing data generated from the second results chapter in an attempt to identify isomiRs and novel miRNAs expressed during neural differentiation of mESCs and assess their expression pattern throughout the differentiation process.
