He {{brings up the}} issues of widely interpreted memory; of preservation, superseding, continuation and disappearance of historical and visual reality. Jakubowicz's best-known work is Arbeitsdisziplin: a video in which a uniformed guard is walking behind a wire <b>netting</b> <b>set</b> {{in front of a}} massive factory with Volkswagen logo; a lightbox with the view of the factory emerging from behind a barbed wire, and postcards showing the same theme. Referring to Volkswagen's shameful role in Nazi Germany, he shows an oppressive side of this place, and tells about the levers of power which penetrate the reality and determine our everyday life. They exist in the society's subconscious, awaiting an opportunity to come to light in extreme conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{utility of}} Potential Future Exposure (PFE) for {{counterparty}} trading limits {{is being challenged}} by new market developments, notably widespread regulatory Initial Margin (using 99 % 10 -day exposure), and netting of trade and collateral flows. However PFE has pre-existing challenges w. r. t. portfolios/distributions, collateralization, <b>netting</b> <b>set</b> seniority, and overlaps with CVA. We introduce Potential Future Loss (PFL) which combines expected shortfall (ES) and loss given default (LGD) {{as a replacement for}} PFE. With two additional variants Adjusted PFL (aPFL) and Protected Adjusted PFL (paPFL) these deal with both new and pre-existing challenges. We provide a theoretical background and numerical examples.

40|$|XVA is a {{material}} {{component of a}} trade valuation and hence it must impact the decision to exercise options within a given <b>netting</b> <b>set.</b> This is true for both unsecured trades and secured / cleared trades where KVA and MVA play {{a material}} role even if CVA and FVA do not. However, this effect has frequently been ignored in XVA models and indeed in exercise decisions made by option owners. This paper describes how XVA impacts the exercise decision and how this can be readily evaluated using regression techniques (Longstaff and Schwartz 2001). The paper then assesses the materiality {{of the impact of}} XVA at the exercise boundary on swaption examples. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, 3 table...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of some different European methods of estimating {{the numbers of}} fish in a lake using different fishing gear is described. The different gears used were 1. surface trawl used by night 2. bottom trawl used by day 3. trammel <b>nets,</b> <b>set</b> {{in the evening and}} lifted in the morning 4. surface seine net used by night 5. bottom seine net used by day 6. Fyke nets, emptied each morning and evening 7. gill <b>nets,</b> <b>set</b> in the evening and lifted in the morning. The most variable catches were from those gears used by day on the bottom and the least variable were those used by night at the surface. The work continued by examining the use of acoustic systems for pelagic fish stock assessment. This gear gave reasonable population estimates for pelagic fish 10 m and more below the surface. The advantage of the accoustic method is that it is quick and requires little labour. Its disadvantage {{is that it is not}} possible to identify the species and so it must be supplemented by another, conventional method...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} catch efficiency, it {{is necessary}} to understand the habitat utilization of the target fish around fishing gear. A biotelemetry study using coded ultrasonic transmitters and set receivers was conducted to understand the habitat utilization of largemouth bass around a <b>set</b> <b>net</b> in Lake Biwa, Japan. Three receivers were installed on leader <b>nets</b> of the <b>set</b> <b>net</b> at short intervals by design to understand the fine scale movement of fish. Four fish were implanted with a coded ultrasonic transmitter and released near the <b>set</b> <b>net.</b> Two fish were monitored for over 50 days and showed diurnal habits. Just before the fish left the <b>set</b> <b>net.</b> the main current direction was southwestward and the current velocity was over 5 m/sec.
