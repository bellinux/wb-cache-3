The computation of Lagrange resolvents of a univariate polynomial has significance for Galois theory. Since Lagrange's algorithms, many other algorithms for computing some particular resolvents, called absolute, were developed from the fundamental theorem of symmetric functions. The algebraic algorithms for <b>non</b> <b>absolute</b> resolvents are few and recent because they use galoisian ideals that were introduced recently. However these algorithms become time and space consuming when the degree of the polynomial increases. This motivates their parallelisation. In 2004 N. Rennert presented a multimodular method for computing absolute resolvents of polynomials with integer coefficients. We show that the same techniques can be extended to any resolvent. This method is naturally parallelisable. Moreover, we give a decomposition formula of resolvents which makes possible another level of parallelisation.

40|$|When {{analysing}} human {{long term}} memory for musical pitch, relational memory is commonly distinguished from absolute memory. The ability of most musicians and non-musicians to recognize tunes even when presented in a different key suggests the existence of relational music memory. However, findings by Levitin (1994) point towards the additional existence of absolute music memory. In his sample, the majority of <b>non</b> <b>absolute</b> pitch possessors could produce pitch at an absolute level when the task was to recall a very familiar pop song recording. Up to now, no replication of this study has been published. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present the results of a replication project across six different European labs. All labs used the same methodology, carefully replicating the experimental conditions of Levitin’s study. In each lab, between 40 and 60 participants (primarily university students with different majors, musicians and non-musicians) were tested. Participants recalled a pop song that they had listened to very often, and produced a phrase of this song. The produced songs were recorded, analysed regarding pitch, and compared with the published original version. Preliminary results suggest that participants show a tendency to sing in the original key, but a little flat. The distribution of the data is significantly not uniform, but more spread out than Levitin’s data. The distributions differ significantly between the three labs analysed so far. Our replication study supports basically the hypothesis that there is a strong absolute component for pitch memory of very well-known tunes.

The role of aerosol particles is considered crucial for air quality, meteorological and climatical purpose.

Moreover, it has also been shown that the physical and chemical description of the aerosol is necessary to give shape to water droplets. Finally, several reports from the World Health Organisation show that the fine aerosol particles can cause major diseases as cancer or pulmonary diseases, and should be now considered as a public health matter. This study takes place in this context, and aims at estimating the radiative feedbacks of urban aerosol on the boundary layer. The CAPITOUL field experiment, which took place in the city of Toulouse during one year from march 2004 to february 2005, is the framework of a modelling study during a 2 -day IOP. First, an emission inventory has been set up to reproduce the gaz and particles emissions. Then, a simulation exercise aims at reproduce the aerosol evolution at the fine scale of 500 m, and the very specific spatial distribution at different resolutions. In order to estimate the impact of aerosol particles on radiation, a radiative module has been developped to compute online the aerosol optical properties depending on the complex aerosol physical and chemical parameters. The radiative fluxes are then impacted by the aerosol scaterring and aborbing behaviour, leading to change in the urban dynamics. Those feedbacks on radiative fluxes lead to a change of the boundary layer's temperature. The impacts are also compared to the urban surface impact...|$|R

METHODS: : Using the 95 th sex, age, and relative-height BP US thresholds to define elevated BP in children (standard criteria), we derived a set of (non sex- and <b>non</b> age-specific) <b>absolute</b> height-specific BP thresholds for 11 height categories by 10  cm increments. Using data from large school-based surveys conducted in Switzerland (N =  5207; 2621 boys, 2586 girls; age range: 10. 1 - 14. 9 years) and in the Seychelles (N =  25   759; 13   048 boys, 12   711 girls; age range: 4. 4 - 18. 8 years), we evaluated the performance of these height-specific thresholds to identify children with elevated BP.

40|$|Background Over {{the last}} years, the {{reliability}} and validity of findings in (general) psychology have been seriously questioned (Schooler, 2011). Often used arguments are, among others, the (now) well-known publication bias, the ritual of statistical significance testing, the so-called 'decline effect', and, last but not least, the lack of replication studies (Ioannidis, 2005). Especially the last point is a serious issue in music psychology, because most studies never get replicated, probably due to the rather small size of the field. This raises the serious question, which findings in music psychology a really trustful and resilient - besides the merely trivial ones. Therefore, we conducted comparative replication studies of the ‘Levitin Effect’ in five laboratories as an initial contribution to a methodological discussion about future needs in empirical music research that hopefully will start to spread across our scientific community: When analysing human long term memory for musical pitch, relational memory (for musical intervals) is commonly distinguished from absolute memory (for the absolute pitches of tones). The ability of most musicians and non-musicians to recognise tunes even when presented in a different key suggests the existence of relational music memory. However, a series of studies points towards the additional existence of absolute music memory (most prominently: Levitin, 1994). According to Levitin's results, the majority of <b>non</b> <b>absolute</b> pitch possessors can produce pitch at an absolute level when the task is to recall a very familiar pop song recording. Aims Up to now, no replication of Levitin’s (1994) study has been published. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a replication project across five different labs in Germany and the UK. Method All five labs used the same methodology, carefully replicating the experimental conditions of Levitin’s study. In each lab, between 40 and 60 participants were tested. They were primarily university students with different majors and included musicians and non-musicians. Participants were asked to recall a pop song that they had listened to very often, and to sing, hum, or whistle a phrase of this song exactly as they had imagined it. The produced songs were recorded, analysed regarding pitch, and compared with the published original version. A questionnaire was used to describe the musical sophistication of participants and to gather relevant information on their general music listening habits as well as their familiarity with the produced songs. Results Preliminary results from three labs suggest that participants show a tendency to sing in the original key, but a little flat (mean difference of - 1 semitone). This is in general line with Levitin's results. The distribution of the data is significantly not uniform, but much more spread out than Levitin's data. The distributions differ significantly in the three labs analysed so far. Interestingly, the modus of differences is 6 semitones, which is a rather puzzling result. Conclusions Our replication study supports basically the hypothesis that that there is a strong absolute component for pitch memory of very well-known tunes. However, a decline effect of results could be observed as well as some surprising pecularities, which need further clarification. References: Ioannidis, J. P. A. (2005).

It was your brain, and a certain impatience with the political conduct of your country, which brought you over to our side. Why should not that become an alliance--an <b>absolute</b> alliance? Your <b>interests</b> are drawn into ours. You have now a real and great reason for throwing in your lot with us. Let me look at you. Let me think whether I may not venture upon a great gamble." ...|$|R
50|$|Daniel Lothrop was a diligent student; his {{aptitude}} for mathematics was remarkable, and he possessed a singularly retentive memory, {{so that at}} fourteen years of age he was fitted for college. But waiting a year, at the advice of friends, who thought him too young to enter, circumstances thrust him into the arena of business, and he assumed the charge of a brother's drug store. His love of books soon led him to introduce the sale of them as an adjunct. When seventeen years of age, he hired and stocked a drug store in Newmarket, New Hampshire. Having this in successful operation, he called a third brother {{to the charge of}} it, while he established a similar store at Meredith Bridge, New Hampshire (now Laconia), books being the principal stock. These three brothers for more than forty years remained in a copartnership with <b>absolute</b> unity of <b>interests,</b> though in different lines of business, and located in different cities. In 1850 Mr. Lothrop bought out a book store in Dover, New Hampshire, which he made one of the best and largest in New England, and it became a literary centre: a favorite meeting-place for the cultivated people of the town.|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{observed}} anisotropy in {{cosmic microwave background}} radiation (∆T/T ≤ 10 − 4) an upper limit on the electric charge asymmetry over a cosmological scale is found which is several orders more stringent than those found earlier. The same argument constrains the charge of massless, degenerate neutrinos. PACS numbers: 98. 80. -k, 98. 70. Vc, 95. 85. Ry One possibility which has excited particular interest over the years {{is the question of}} whether matter in particular and the Universe in general have <b>absolute</b> charge symmetry. <b>Interest</b> in the subject was aroused following the suggestion by Bondi and Littleton [1] that if the electron and proton charge differed by a part in 1018 it would account for the expansion of the Universe. This was followed by the experiment of Hillas and Cranshaw [2]. Afterwards the work gained general acceptance by the scientific community and there were several experiments (see for example Ref. [3]) to detect charge asymmetry in matter. All these experiments put definite upper limits on the charge asymmetry although they are much lower than that required by Bondi and Littleton. However, since the strength of the electromagnetic interaction is 1039 times stronger than the gravitational interaction any small asymmetry could have a profoun...|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} speak of Altruria, {{as if that were}} what our talk had been leading up to, and she showed herself more {{intelligently}} interested concerning us than any one I have yet seen in this country. We appeared, I found, neither incredible nor preposterous to her; our life, in her eyes, had that beauty of right living which the Americans so feebly imagine or imagine not at all. She asked what route I had come by to America, and she seemed disappointed and aggrieved that we placed the restrictions we have felt necessary upon visitors from the plutocratic world. Were we afraid, she asked, that they would corrupt our citizens or mar our content with our institutions? She seemed scarcely satisfied when I explained, as I have explained so often here, that the measures we had taken were rather {{in the interest of the}} plutocratic world than of the Altrurians; and alleged the fact that no visitor from the outside had ever been willing to go home again, as sufficient proof that we had nothing to fear from the spread of plutocratic ideals among us. I assured her, and this she easily imagined, that, the better known these became, the worse they appeared to us; and that the only concern our priors felt, in regard to them, was that our youth could not conceive of them in their enormity, but, in seeing how estimable plutocratic people often were, they would attribute to their conditions the inherent good of human nature. I said our own life was so directly reasoned from its economic premises that they could hardly believe the plutocratic life was often an <b>absolute</b> <b>non</b> sequitur of the plutocratic premises. I confessed that this error was at the bottom of my own wish to visit America and study those premises.|$|R
