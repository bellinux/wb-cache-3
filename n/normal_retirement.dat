40|$|This paper {{proves the}} renegotiation-proofness {{principle}} for a dynamic LEN (linear contracts, exponential utility, normal distributions) model and examines {{the impact of}} repeated renegotiation on incentives and managerial tenure when performance information is serially correlated. In addition to providing a general solution to a multiperiod agency problem with serially correlated performance measures, this paper characterizes optimal managerial tenure/turnover policies {{as a function of}} the time-series properties of performance measures. With negatively correlated performance measures, the principal prefers longer managerial tenure, and no turnover is optimal. With positively correlated performance measures, absent a switching cost, turnover every period is optimal. In the presence of a fixed switching cost, interior optimal turnover policies exist if the performance measures are positively correlated. Switching costs are necessary, but not sufficient for interior optimal tenure. The optimal turnover policies present an alternative to theories of performance-driven managerial turnover and are consistent with evidence that a majority of managerial turnovers are (age-related) <b>normal</b> <b>retirements.</b> dynamic agency, renegotiation, managerial tenure, LEN models, managerial turnover...|$|R

25|$|If {{a worker}} covered by Social Security dies, a {{surviving}} spouse can receive survivors' benefits. In some instances, survivors' benefits are available {{even to a}} divorced spouse. A father or mother with minor or disabled children {{in his or her}} care can receive benefits which are not actuarially reduced. The earliest age for a non-disabled widow(er)'s benefit is age 60. The benefit is equal to the worker's basic retirement benefit (PIA) (reduced if the deceased was receiving reduced benefits) for spouses who are at, or older than, <b>normal</b> <b>retirement</b> age. If the surviving spouse starts benefits before <b>normal</b> <b>retirement</b> age, there is an actuarial reduction.

25|$|Many factors affect people's {{retirement}} decisions. Retirement funding {{education is}} a big factor that affects the success of an individual’s retirement experience. Social Security clearly {{plays an important role}} because most individuals solely rely on Social Security as their only retirement option, when Social Security’s both trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2034. Knowledge affects an individual’s retirement decisions by simply finding more reliable retirement options such as, Individual Retirement Accounts or Employer-Sponsored Plans. In countries around the world, people {{are much more likely to}} retire at the early and <b>normal</b> <b>retirement</b> ages of the public pension system (e.g., ages 62 and 65 in the U.S.). This pattern cannot be explained by different financial incentives to retire at these ages since typically retirement benefits at these ages are approximately actuarially fair; that is, the present value of lifetime pension benefits (pension wealth) conditional on retiring at age a is approximately the same as pension wealth conditional on retiring one year later at age a+1. Nevertheless, a large literature has found that individuals respond significantly to financial incentives relating to retirement (e.g., to discontinuities stemming from the Social Security earnings test or the tax system).|$|E

25|$|The {{passage of}} the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, in 2000, allows the worker to earn {{unlimited}} outside income without offsets in the year after they reach full retirement. It also allows the spouse and children of a worker who has reached <b>normal</b> full <b>retirement</b> age to receive benefits under some circumstances while he/she does not. The full retirement age worker must have begun the receipt of benefits, to allow the spousal/children's benefits to begin, and then subsequently suspended their own benefits {{in order to continue}} the postponement of benefits in exchange for an increased benefit amount (5.5–8.0%/yr increase) up to the age of 70. Thus a worker can delay retirement up to age seventy without affecting spousal or children's benefits.|$|R
500|$|The 1990s saw {{gradually}} dropping {{circulation and}} advertisement revenue for The Inquirer. The decline {{was part of}} a nationwide trend, but the effects were exacerbated by, according to dissatisfied Inquirer employees, the paper's resisting changes that many other daily newspapers implemented to keep readers and pressure from Knight Ridder to cut costs. During most of Roberts's time as editor, Knight Ridder allowed him a great deal of freedom in running the newspaper. However, in the late 1980s, Knight Ridder had become concerned about The Inquirers profitability and took {{a more active role in}} its operations. Knight Ridder pressured The Inquirer to expand into the more profitable suburbs, while at the same time cutting staff and coverage of national and international stories. Staff cuts continued until Knight Ridder was bought in 2006, with some of The Inquirers best reporters accepting buyouts and leaving for other newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. By the late 1990s, all of the high-level editors who had worked with Eugene Roberts in the 1970s and 1980s had left, none at <b>normal</b> <b>retirement</b> age.

2500|$|In the United States, {{while the}} <b>normal</b> <b>retirement</b> age for Social Security, or Old Age Survivors Insurance (OASI), {{historically}} has been age 65 to receive unreduced benefits, it is gradually increasing to age 67.

Police officers in the United States are typically allowed to retire at half pay after only 20 years of service or three-quarter pay after 30 years, allowing people to retire in their early forties or fifties. Military members of the US Armed Forces may elect to retire after 20 years of active duty. Their retirement pay (not a pension since they can be involuntarily called back to active duty at any time) is calculated on total number of years on active duty, their final pay grade and the retirement system in place when they entered service.

40|$|This {{research}} {{combines the}} turnaround, industrial organization economics, and resource based theory, and decline literatures {{to create a}} framework for investigating the relationship between external and internal changes that cause declines in business organizations. The relationship between the actions that generate recovery {{and the cause of}} decline is investigated. The executive succession literature is used to investigate CEO change in turnaround situations. ^ Twelve propositions are proposed and investigated. The results suggest that most declines experienced by large companies are caused by unsuccessful diversification efforts and environmental changes for which firms are not prepared. These environmental changes, in most cases, reduce the value of the resources controlled by a firm. While decline stemming actions are found in most turnarounds, strategic changes are required to generate recovery, even when the cause was not the result of strategic changes. Firms alter their strategies to find new resource combinations to create a sustainable competitive advantage that is related to, but changed from, the competitive advantage that generated the firm 2 ̆ 7 s previous success. ^ The results also suggest that there are distinct differences in the actions taken based on the severity of the decline that is experienced before the firm recovers. Firms do not make significant changes to their strategies unless the decline is sufficiently severe to generate a consensus that such actions are necessary. Firms often do not recognize the true nature of a decline when it first begins. They often take actions that do not result in a turnaround. These findings suggest that a contingency theory approach to turnaround research based on small samples may enable us to increase our understanding of how firms recover. ^ While there may be a higher incidence of CEO change during the turnaround cycle, the prescription offered by many turnaround researchers that there must be a CEO change for a firm to recover appears questionable. Many CEO changes in turnaround situations are <b>normal</b> <b>retirements</b> and unrelated to the performance problems of the firm. ...|$|R

The association between age and firm profitability is conditional on firm size. In particular, we find a positive relation among younger CEOs in small firms and a negative relation among older CEOs in large firms. In this paper, we also examine the likelihood of CEO continuation beyond the regular retirement age of 65. Our empirical results show that stock ownership and firm growth {{increase the likelihood of}} delayed retirement past age 65, whereas firm-specific tenure and non-incentive compensation increase the likelihood of scheduled retirement at age 65.

During World War II, South Australia was the only state to permit members of the police to enlist in the armed forces, but this was withdrawn after Japan entered the war, due to the need to maintain police numbers.
