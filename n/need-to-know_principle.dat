[...] <b>Need-to-know</b> <b>principle</b> gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions. This principle is used in the government, when dealing with difference clearances. Even though two employees in different departments have a top-secret clearance, they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be exchanged. Within the <b>need-to-know</b> <b>principle,</b> network administrators grant the employee least amount privileges to prevent employees access and doing more than what they are supposed to. Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability (C‑I‑A) triad. Need-to-know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design principles for dynamic security modeling in risk-prone environments, where {{elements of the}} environment to be protected are classified in Contexts and are monitored and geo-referenced. Based on a motivating scenario, the security model elements are introduced building on the ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) paradigm. Dynamicity is integrated into the model to make it self-adaptable to dynamic changes in the environment conditions, including the occurrence of risks and emergencies. The model aims at dynamically authorizing subjects to access diverse data and physical objects (resources) based on adaptive activation/deactivation of security rules and changes in subject or object attributes, while still preserving the <b>need-to-know</b> <b>principle...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{adoption}} of electronically formatted medical records, so called Electronic Health Records (EHRs), has become extremely important in healthcare systems {{to enable the}} exchange of medical information among stakeholders. An EHR generally consists of data with different types and sensitivity degrees which must be selectively shared based on the <b>need-to-know</b> <b>principle.</b> Security mechanisms are required to guarantee that only authorized users have access to specific portions of such critical record for legitimate purposes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for modelling access control scheme for composite EHRs. Our model formulates the semantics and structural composition of an EHR document, from which we introduce a notion of authorized zones of the composite EHR at different granularity levels, taking into consideration of several important criteria such as data types, intended purposes and information sensitivities. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the challenge of}} identifying clinically-relevant patterns in medical datasets without endangering patient privacy. To this end, we treat medical datasets as black box for {{both internal and external}} users of the data enabling a remote query mechanism to construct and execute database queries. The novelty of the approach lies in avoiding the complex data de-identification process which is often used to preserve patient privacy. The implemented toolkit combines software engineering technologies such as Java EE and RESTful web services, to allow exchanging medical data in an unidentifiable XML format along with restricting users to the <b>need-to-know</b> privacy <b>principle.</b> Consequently, the technique inhibits retrospective processing of data, such as attacks by an adversary on a medical dataset using advanced computational methods to reveal Protected Health Information (PHI). The approach is validated on an endoscopic reporting application based on openEHR and MST standards. The proposed approach is largely motivated by the issues related to querying datasets by clinical researchers, governmental or non-governmental organizations in monitoring health care services to improve quality of care...|$|R
40|$|Part 5 : eID Cards and eID InteroperabilityInternational audienceThe new German {{electronic}} identity card will allow service providers to access personal data stored on the card. This imposes a new quality of data processing as these data have been governmentally verified. According to European privacy legislation any data processing must be justified {{in the sense that}} the personal data are necessary for the stipulated purpose. This <b>need-to-know</b> <b>principle</b> is a legal requirement for accessing the data stored on the eID card. This text suggests a model as basis for deriving general guidelines and aids further discussion on the question whether collecting personal data is necessary for certain business cases. Beyond the scope of the German eID card the extent and boundaries of what can be accepted as necessary data processing poses questions on a European level as well...|$|E
40|$|Forensic image {{recognition}} {{is an important}} tool {{in many areas of}} law enforcement where an agency wants to prosecute possessors of illegal images. The recognition of illegal images that might have undergone human imperceptible changes (e. g., a JPEG-recompression) is commonly done by computing a perceptual image hash function of a given image and then matching this hash with perceptual hash values in a database of previously collected illegal images. To prevent privacy violation, agencies should only learn about images that have been reliably detected as illegal and nothing else. In this work, we argue that the prevalent presence of separate departments in such agencies can be used to enforce the <b>need-to-know</b> <b>principle</b> by separating duties among them. This enables us to construct the first practically efficient architecture to perform forensic {{image recognition}} in a privacy-preserving manner. By deriving unique cryptographic keys directly from the images, we can encrypt all sensitive data and ensure that only illegal images can be recovered by the law enforcement agency while all other information remains protected...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{takes on}} the problem of {{automatically}} identifying clinically-relevant patterns in medical datasets without compromising patient privacy. To achieve this goal, we treat datasets as a black box for both internal and external users of data that lets us handle clinical data queries directly and far more efficiently. The novelty of the approach lies in avoiding the data de-identification process often used as a means of preserving patient privacy. The implemented toolkit combines software engineering technologies such as Java EE and RESTful web services, to allow exchanging medical data in an unidentifiable XML format as well as restricting users to the <b>need-to-know</b> <b>principle.</b> Our technique also inhibits retrospective processing of data, such as attacks by an adversary on a medical dataset using advanced computational methods to reveal Protected Health Information (PHI). The approach is validated on an endoscopic reporting application based on openEHR and MST standards.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a new framework for healthcare systems where patients {{are able to}} control the disclosure of their medical data. In our framework, the patient's consent has a pivotal role in granting or removing access rights to subjects accessing patient's medical data. Depending on {{the context in which the}} access is being executed, different consent policies can be applied. Context is expressed in terms of workflows. The execution of a task in a given workflow carries the necessary information to infer whether the consent can be implicitly retrieved or should be explicitly requested from a patient. However, patients are always able to enforce their own decisions and withdraw consent if necessary. Additionally, the use of workflows enables us to apply the <b>need-to-know</b> <b>principle.</b> Even when the patient's consent is obtained, a subject should access medical data only if it is required by the actual situation. For example, if the subject is assigned to the execution of a medical diagnosis workflow requiring access to the patient's medical record. We also provide a complex medical case study to highlight the design principles behind our framework. Finally, the implementation of the framework is outlined...|$|E
40|$|Service Oriented Architecture {{is now the}} {{de facto}} {{standard}} that allows companies to open their services to others. Nowadays customers can build their own architectures and provide services by selecting the required interfaces from different business partners. Services can be combined in a loosely-coupled fashion over the network. But this new way of providing services across geographically dislocated organizations have significantly changed the security models. This new paradigm has forced security models to evolve from point-to-point to end-to-end security. However, this evolution is not straightforward and naive usage of the new models, such as WS-Security, can lead to security flaws. Our work addresses several security properties at different layers of the Web Service stack. In this context, we have proposed three complementary contributions. First, we proposed an approach named business process security view {{that is similar to}} view materialization in relational databases. This concept enhances security in cross-organizational business processes by ensuring the <b>need-to-know</b> <b>principle</b> on workflows. To achieve this we formalized business processes by regular expressions called flow control rules. In combination with a security specification, that expresses conditional accessibility based on the actual data flowing across business process, we presented an algorithm for the automatic derivation of such views. Second, we tackled security at the message layer, namely SOAP messages. These messages are prone to attacks that can lead to code injection, unauthorized accesses, identity theft, and more. This type of attacks, classified in literature as XML rewriting attacks, are all based on unauthorized, yet possible, modifications of SOAP messages. We proposed a formal solution to XML rewriting attacks on SOAP messages using regular tree grammar. The formal solution proposed here is a context-sensitive XML signature. To address the additional requirements of end-to-end security, where a SOAP message can pass through several intermediaries before reaching the final receiver, an adaptive variant of context-sensitive signature is also proposed. The solution addresses all known forms of XML rewriting attacks. Finally, we assess security properties by the mean of passive testing. This methodology relies on the execution trace of a system to validate security properties. We made an initial demonstration of this methodology by applying it to an industrial case study, SAP R/ 3. Then we adapted this methodology for SOA environment. It involved the development of a non-intrusive trace collection module dedicated to SOA, integrated to our case study prototype. This flexible methodology allowed us to validate properties like SoD that we addressed at business process level. All this research work has been implemented around an e-business case study...|$|E
