5|$|The {{nature of}} the European Parliament is better {{compared}} with the United States House of Representatives than with the national parliaments of the European Union. This is notable {{in terms of the}} committees being of greater size and power, political parties being very decentralised and it being separated from the executive branch (most national governments operate under a parliamentary system). A difference from all other parliaments is the absence of a Parliamentary legislative initiative. However, given that in most national parliaments initiatives <b>not</b> <b>backed</b> by the executive rarely succeed the value of this difference is in question. Equally, its independence and power means that the European Parliament has an unusually high success rate for its amendments in comparison to national parliaments; 80% average and 30% for controversial proposals.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} applauded by the Senate at first, who {{were glad to}} be rid of the former emperor. But {{tradition}} held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus {{was a member of the}} equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action. Their opposition, however, was <b>not</b> <b>backed</b> by any actual power. The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey), so there was no force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus.|$|E
5|$|Claudette wobbled to the {{northwest}} over the Gulf of Mexico and gradually restrengthened. Upper-level winds steadily decreased, and Claudette again became a hurricane late on July 14. Just prior to landfall, it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction, striking Port O'Connor, Texas, on July 15 as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 90mph (150km/h) winds. Residents along and inland of the central Texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival. The hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of July 15, but instead came ashore before noon. Furthermore, some initial estimates suggested that Claudette had reached Category2 status, with sustained winds of up to 100mph (155km/h); these were based on unofficial observations which were <b>not</b> <b>backed</b> up by official data.|$|E

25|$|The Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty (Chinese: , 1271–1368) also {{attempted}} to use paper currency. Unlike the Song dynasty, {{they created a}} unified, national system that was <b>not</b> <b>backed</b> by silver or gold. The currency issued by the Yuan was the world's first fiat currency, known as Chao. The Yuan government {{attempted to}} prohibit all transactions in or possession of silver or gold, {{which had to be}} turned over to the government. Inflation in 1260 caused the government to replace the existing paper currency with a new one in 1287, but inflation that resulted from undisciplined printing remained a problem for the Yuan court until the end of the Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|IWC is a {{voluntary}} international organization and is <b>not</b> <b>backed</b> up by treaty, therefore, the IWC has substantial practical limitations on its authority. First, any member countries {{are free to}} simply leave the organization and declare themselves not bound by it if they so wish. Second, any member state may opt out of any specific IWC regulation by lodging a formal objection to it within 90 days of the regulation coming into force (such provisions are common in international agreements, on the logic that it is preferable to have parties remain within the agreements than opt out altogether). Third, the IWC has no ability to enforce any of its decisions through penalty imposition.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, {{engineer}} Vitaly Lagutenko {{was appointed}} to direct the experimental Industrial Construction Bureau, with an objective to study and design the low-cost technology suitable for fast mass construction. Lagutenko emphasized large prefabricated concrete panes. He joined architects Mikhail Posokhin (senior) and Ashot Mndoyants, and in 1948 this team built their first concrete frame-and-panel building near present-day Polezhaevskaya metro station. Four identical buildings followed nearby; similar buildings were built during 1949–1952 across the country. This was still an experiment, <b>not</b> <b>backed</b> by industrial capacity or fast-track project schedules. Posokhin also devised various pseudo-Stalinist configurations of the same building blocks, with decorative excesses; these were not implemented. Concrete frames became common for industrial construction, but too expensive for mass housing.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{currencies}} were circulating in the province, {{as was the}} custom in China, and the paper notes issued by the provincial government had experienced a steady depreciation in value. Wang decided {{to switch to a}} silver standard and set the initial value of the new silver yuan equal to the Japanese gold yen, which was accepted throughout Korea and Manchuria. Much to the surprise of the Chinese the new currency even gained in value against the gold yen, although Japanese businessmen claimed that it was <b>not</b> <b>backed</b> up by sufficient silver reserves. Wang then used the newly gained credibility to introduce another note, the Fengtian dollar, which was not convertible into silver anymore. However, it was accepted by the government for the payment of taxes, a sign of faith in its own currency.|$|E
25|$|Donnchad {{was the son}} of Brian (king of Munster) and {{his wife}} Gormlaith (daughter of Murchad, king of Leinster). His year of birth is unknown, but a date 980s is likely, as it would accord with the {{political}} policy of his father at the time and mean that Donnchad was old enough to be militarily active in the 1010s, when he first appears in historical records. Brian's son Murchad, Donnchad's half-brother, died with his father at Clontarf. Another brother or half-brother, Domnall, had died in 1011. Two other half-brothers, Conchobar and Flann, are mentioned in some sources but leave no trace in the Irish annals. So, of Brian's sons, only Donnchad and his half-brother Tadc are known to have survived their father. According to Geoffrey Keating's account in Foras Feasa ar Éirinn, an account which is <b>not</b> <b>backed</b> by any annalistic evidence, Donnchad, leading the survivors of the Dál gCais back from Clontarf faced armies from Osraige and Munster which were faced down.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{the success}} at Uman nor what {{followed}} at Kiev {{would have happened}} had Rundstedt <b>not</b> <b>backed</b> his subordinates and resisted Hitler's interference {{in the conduct of}} the campaign. As during the French campaign, Hitler was panicked by his own success. By early July he was full of anxiety that the German armour was advancing too quickly, without infantry support, and that it was exposed to Soviet counter-attacks. On 10 July Brauchitsch arrived at Rundstedt's headquarters at Brody, with instructions from Hitler that Kleist was turn south towards Vinnitsa and link up with Schobert's army there, rather than continue south-east to Kirovograd. This would still have trapped many Soviet divisions, but it would have allowed the mass of Soviet forces at Uman and Kiev to escape. Rundstedt defended Kleist's ability to execute the larger encirclement, and persuaded Brauchitsch that he was right. Brauchitsch then contacted Halder, who succeeded in persuading Hitler to support Rundstedt. This was a sign that Rundstedt still had Hitler's respect, as were Hitler's two visits to Rundstedt's armies during this period.|$|E
