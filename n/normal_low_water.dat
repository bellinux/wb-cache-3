5000|$|There was a flash lock {{recorded}} at Whitchurch in the 16th century. The sketch map shows the main dam, which was solid {{and rose to}} a height above normal high water level. Near the southern bank, there was a sluice (marked [...] "E" [...] on the sketch), which was 30 ft wide, and was fitted with flood gates and overfall boards, to accommodate a drop of 3 to 4 ft in the river level. The flash lock was in the centre, with a winch on the north bank to haul the barges through against the current. It was 23 ft wide, which was the standard size for all flash locks below Abingdon.

In a salt affected soil, potassium sulfate (SOP) and potassium chloride (MOP) were tested on rice production under two K 2 O rates (70 and 140 kg K 2 O/ha). The obtained results were as follows: 1 - In sandy soil: wheat, faba bean, sesame and groundnut responded to SOP application up to 240 kg K 2 O/ha under both irrigation water levels. Grain yield increases obtained were 18, 11, 24 and 9 % under normal water level and reached to 45, 23, 29 and 23 % under <b>low</b> irrigation <b>water</b> level compared to control (0 K 2 O) respectively. 2 - In calcareous soil, wheat, faba bean and corn responded to SOP application up to 360 kg K 2 O/ha, for wheat and corn under both water irrigation levels, while faba bean responded to SOP up to 240 kg K 2 O/ha. Grain yield increases obtained were 11 and 16 % for faba bean; 21 and 29 % for wheat and 8 - 22 % for corn under <b>normal</b> and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> level respectively. 3 - In the salt affected soil, significant grain and straw yield increases were obtained by addition of SOP and MOP fertilizers. Using SOP resulted in an increase over the control (0 K 2 O) in rice grain yield of 25 - 30 % in the first location and 10 - 11 % in the second location, while the grain yield increases obtained with MOP were lower than SOP and reached 23 - 12 % for the first location and ranged between 4 and 1 % for the second one, with higher Cl % in the rice grain yield compared to rice grain yield with SOP...|$|R
40|$|The {{invasive}} emerald ash borer (EAB) beetle is {{a significant}} threat {{to the survival of}} North American ash. In previous work, we identified putative biochemical and molecular markers of constitutive EAB resistance in Manchurian ash, an Asian species co-evolved with EAB. Here, we employed high-throughput high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection and mass spectrometry (HPLC-PDA-MS) to characterize the induced response of soluble phloem phenolics to EAB attack in resistant Manchurian and susceptible black ash under conditions of either <b>normal</b> or <b>low</b> <b>water</b> availability, and the effects of water availability on larval performance. Total larval mass per tree was lower in Manchurian than in black ash. <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> increased larval numbers and mean larval mass overall, but more so in Manchurian ash. <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> did not affect levels of phenolics in either host species, but six phenolics decreased in response to EAB. In both ashes, pinoresinol A was induced by EAB, especially in Manchurian ash. Pinoresinol A and pinoresinol B were negatively correlated with each other in both species. The higher accumulation of pinoresinol A in Manchurian ash after attack may help explain the resistance of this species to EAB, but none of the responses measured here could explain increased larval performance in trees subjected to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> availability...|$|R

40|$|The {{microbial}} communities {{associated with}} different corrosion deposit layers retrieved from a harbour steel structure affected by ALWC (Accelerated Low Water Corrosion) {{were determined by}} 16 S rDNA PCR-DGGE analysis. Comparative analysis of populations associated with ALWC layers and NLWC (<b>Normal</b> <b>Low</b> <b>Water</b> Corrosion) layers evidenced clear differences in the structure and composition of the communities. Dominant phylotypes related to sulphate-reducing bacteria pertaining to Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae were identified in both type of deposits (fraction of 52 % and 44 % of the total NLWC and ALWC communities, respectively). Phylotypes related to sulphur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to Alpha-, Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria were unique to ALWC deposits, while phylotypes related to oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms (cyanobacteria, diatoms) were only retrieved in NLWC deposits. This suggested that biologically-mediated sulphur cycle was the dominant process within ALWC deposits vs. chemically-mediated sulphur cycle within NLWC deposits. Since most of the members identified are heterotrophs, it is speculated that organic carbon may be available through water pollution and/or proliferation of photosynthetic biomass. Differences in oxygen concentration between ALWC and NLWC areas due to photosynthetic activities in NLWC {{may be an important}} factor contributing to the acceleration of corrosion by the mechanism of differential aeration...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} low pH with calcium and without calcium treatment on gill histology and ionoregulation of fish, Cyprinus carpio exposed to low pH 4. 0 with <b>low</b> (<b>normal</b> <b>water)</b> calcium 6 mg/L and low pH 4. 0 with added calcium 15 mg/L {{treatment for a}} period of 96 h. The light microscopic studies of the processed low pH with low calcium treatment, exposed gills showed marked histological alterations. The lesions of the gills included hypertrophy of the filament and lamellar cells; hyperplasia of the filament and lamellar cells, and deformities of gill arches, filaments and lamellae were seen. But in low pH with high calcium treatment the gill lesins were minimum such as, hypertrophy, hyperplasia and proliferation of chloride cells. In <b>low</b> pH with (<b>normal</b> <b>water)</b> <b>low</b> calcium treatment, plasma ionic levels (Na+, K+ Cl-) decreased as the exposure period extended. In all the three experiments sodium level showing steep decrease ranging from 0. 405, 21. 382 to 8. 411 at the end of 24 h to 32. 965, 57. 350 and 18. 915 at the end of 96 h, respectively. Low pH with high calcium treatment, the fish exhibited only a minor depression in the plasma ionic levels showing minimum decrease of 4. 952, 20. 128 and 7. 702 at the end of 96 h, respectively. Impact on gills and ionoregulation were minimum in low pH with added calcium level due to the ameliorative effects of calcium.

40|$|Introduction: Besides dental and {{skeletal}} fluorosis, excessive fluoride intake {{can also}} affect {{the central nervous}} system without first causing the physical deformities associated with skeletal fluorosis. With the existence of widespread endemic fluorosis in India, the possible adverse effect of elevated fluoride in drinking water on the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) level of children is a potentially serious public health problem. Aims and Objectives: This study assessed the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of school going children aged 10 - 12 years in villages of Mysore district with different fluoride levels. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 405 school children aged 10 - 12 years were selected from three villages in Mysore district with normal fluoride (1. 20 mg F/l), low fluoride (0. 40 mg F/l) and high fluoride (2. 20 mg F/l) in their water supplies. A pre designed questionnaire was used to collect the required data for the survey which included socio demographic details, oral hygiene practices, diet history, body mass index and dental fluorosis. Intelligence Quotient was assessed using Raven′s colored Progressive Matrices Test. Results: In bivariate analysis, significant relationships were found between water fluoride levels and Intelligence Quotient of school children (P < 0. 05). In the high fluoride village, the proportion of children with IQ below 90, i. e. below average IQ was larger compared to <b>normal</b> and <b>low</b> fluoride village. Age, gender, parent education level and family income had no significant association with IQ. Conclusion: School children residing in area with higher than normal water fluoride level demonstrated more impaired development of intelligence when compared to school children residing in areas with <b>normal</b> and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> fluoride levels. Thus, children′s intelligence can be affected by high water fluoride levels...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} a plant depends in part {{on its ability to}} locate water while {{securely}} anchoring in the soil. Cellular growth in roots is driven by water uptake and resulting increases in turgor pressure. <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> potentials slow the rate of primary root growth and induce a suite of changes in the growth zone. To better understand the effects of <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials on the growth and structure of primary roots, Zea mays seedlings were grown in different concentrations of polyethylene glycol solution. The effects of <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials on the water content, the spatial distribution of growth, and the mechanical properties of the root throughout the growth zone were quantified. <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> potentials decreased the total amount of water in roots and the percent water composition of roots. <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> potentials also decreased relative elemental growth rate and shifted the region of maximal growth rate towards the root tip. Because of water stress induced root thinning and cell wall stress relaxation at the cellular level, <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials were expected to alter the mechanical properties of roots. Engineering beam theory was adapted to test for water stress induced changes in the spatial distributions of flexural stiffness (EI), the product of the material term E (Young's modulus of elasticity) and the geometrical term I (second moment of area). <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> potentials decreased EI of roots, due mostly to root thinning (and thus reductions of I). Increasing water stress had no consistent effects on E, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms to maintain root material properties despite cellular changes in wall properties due to water stress. Root thinning in <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials results from the promotion of longitudinal over lateral growth to facilitate finding deeper water sources. Though water stress weakens roots by reducing EI, soil impedance has been shown previously to cause root thickening. Soil impedance could thus offset root thinning by <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials and increase EI of roots by increasing I. Further studies should test the hypothesis that water stress and impedance have counterbalancing effects on root mechanical properties, thus promoting deep penetration of soils for water while maintaining the mechanical properties necessary for penetrating hard soils...|$|R
