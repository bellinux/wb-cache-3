25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, when gussets were added for {{room for the}} bust, stays became known as corsets. They also {{lengthened}} to the hip and the lower tabs were replaced by gussets at the hip and had less boning. The shoulder straps disappeared in the 1840s for <b>normal</b> <b>wear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lint is {{the common}} name for visible accumulations of textile fibers and other {{materials}}, usually found on and around clothing. Certain materials used {{in the manufacture of}} clothing, such as cotton, linen, and wool, contain numerous, very short fibers bundled together. During the course of <b>normal</b> <b>wear,</b> these fibers may either detach or be jostled out of the weave of which they are part. This is the reason that heavily used articles like shirts and towels become thin over time, and why these particles collect in the lint screen of a clothes dryer.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{condition}} of the cricket ball is crucial to the amount of movement through the air a bowler can produce, the laws governing what players may and may not do to the ball are specific and rigorously enforced. The umpires will inspect the ball frequently during a match. If the ball is out of shape due to <b>normal</b> <b>wear</b> and tear due to batting and ball hitting the pitch, a ball of similar usage rate and condition will be replaced (ie a ball of about 30-overs old will be replaced by a ball about the same 'age').|$|E

They are shown as their usual descriptions, but are larger than <b>normal,</b> <b>wearing</b> a nightcap, and can breathe fire.|$|R
30|$|Self-placement every subject decides the {{positions}} of three sensors by themselves and the remaining sensors were situated by experts. The number of three is considered a reasonable estimate of the proportion of sensors that may be misplaced during the <b>normal</b> <b>wearing.</b> All the subjects recorded a session in these conditions (17 sessions).|$|R

25|$|Cracking {{is limited}} mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around edges of holes drilled {{near the edge}} of the disc due to the disc's uneven rate of {{expansion}} in severe duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as OEM typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the unsprung weight of the brake assembly, with the engineering assumption that enough brake disc mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A brake disc is a heat sink, but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area to radiate away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross drilled metal disc as a <b>normal</b> <b>wear</b> mechanism, but in the severe case the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Stone Store {{suffered}} the cumulative effects of adjacent traffic movements and {{the ravages of}} <b>normal</b> <b>wear</b> and tear. Costly remedial work was required and {{in the 21st century}} a bypass was constructed and opened on 23 June 2008, to divert traffic and protect the building for posterity. The old stone store bridge was completely removed {{in the second half of}} 2008. The reasons for removal of the original bridge are controversial, and there was a groundswell of protest from a number of local residents. The bridge was removed regardless and the debate over whether this was the correct course of action has yet to be resolved in the minds of many residents. The building has been restored to its original state, but does not include the tower on the roof containing the clock removed from the chapel further up the hill, which was removed as a safety measure a long time ago.|$|E

2500|$|The Mint states that, with <b>normal</b> <b>wear</b> and tear, {{the colour}} should remain {{for a number}} of years, {{although}} this claim was quickly disproved [...] The colouration compounds are attached to the metal on a specially prepared 'dimpled' section of the coin, and seem to come off easily if deliberately rubbed. The coin will retain its full value even if the red poppy has worn off or been removed; however it is now expected that fully coloured specimens will become collectible in the future.|$|E

40|$|The Ferrograph {{has been}} used to analyze wear debris {{generated}} in a sliding elastohydrodynamic contact.

50|$|Around 1870, {{machined}} tolerances {{had improved}} {{to the point}} that the cartridge case was no longer necessary to seal a firing chamber. Precision-faced bolts would seal as well, and could be economically manufactured. However, <b>normal</b> <b>wear</b> and tear proved this system to be generally infeasible.|$|E
50|$|Wear {{and tear}} is damage that {{naturally}} and inevitably occurs {{as a result}} of <b>normal</b> <b>wear</b> or aging. It is used in a legal context for such areas as warranty contracts from manufacturers, which usually stipulate that damage from wear and tear will not be covered.|$|E

30|$|Patient 7 {{presented}} a Trendelenburg gait pattern. However, {{even if this}} can be partially explained by the shorter operated limb of this patient, the presence of regular gluteus medius activity in stance {{can be related to}} a lever arm problem [10] due to eccentric displacement of the hip rotation center, making it more elevated than <b>normal</b> (causing <b>wear</b> to the iliac wing).|$|R
50|$|Even {{after passing}} through the oil pickup screen and the oil filter, debris can remain in the oil. It is very {{important}} to change the oil and oil filter to minimize the amount of debris flowing through your engine. This harmful debris along with <b>normal</b> engine <b>wear</b> in high mileage engines causes an increase in clearances between bearings and other moving parts.|$|R

40|$|Biomimetics of the {{branching}} {{structure in}} textiles which {{can improve the}} water transport was proved by previous research on weft knitted fabrics. The present work focuses {{on the development of}} a branching network in light-weight knitted fabrics for polo shirt. Vertical wicking test, water drop test, water vapor permeability as well as air resistance were employed in this study to measure the water transport behavior of fabrics. Besides, Kawabata evaluation system was applied to demonstrate the handle of produced fabric and control. Fabric appearance, skewness change and dimensional change after home laundering were applied to demonstrate the difference between plant structured fabric and control fabric. In conclusion, 100 % cotton and 100 % polyester fabrics developed with such a branching structure exhibited faster water absorption, water transport, improved handle and better <b>normal</b> <b>wearing</b> and washing application property compared with single pique fabric due to wide application for polo shirt.
