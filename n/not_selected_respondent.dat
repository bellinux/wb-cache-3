50|$|Quick Poll {{is a type}} {{of survey}} {{introduced}} by LSI in 2011. Quick Poll results are routinely broadcast by TV One every Mondays and Thursdays Quick Poll displays results on how public view recent, up-to-date cases and issues. Quick Poll is a quick survey of public opinion. The main point of difference is that the interview is not done face to face but rather by utilizing handsets connected to all <b>selected</b> <b>respondents.</b> In order to create a representative group of respondents (representing targeted populations in Indonesia), the Quick Poll is conducted in three steps. The first step is the respondent selection process. In this first step, respondents’ characteristic data will be recorded as comprehensively as possible—from job, income, household expenditure, religion, race, education, and any other relevant information. This data includes <b>not</b> only the <b>selected</b> <b>respondent</b> but also his/her members of family. The second step is to give the <b>selected</b> <b>respondent</b> a handset; for a certain kind of respondent however (for example, those who are illiterate or those living in secluded area with no signal), special treatment will be given. The third step is conducting interviews through the handset—all answers from the respondent will be automatically recorded into the server that has been equipped with automatic data processing function able to computerize all data fed into it.|$|R
40|$|This Web Appendix {{contains}} a roadmap for all additional models and tests supporting the robustness of our results. The following paragraphs provide some background about these analyses to facilitate navigation {{through the various}} tables and figures. Web Appendix A: Robustness of Brand Performance Measurement Model Since the raw brand rating and dispersion scores of the six brand indicators show {{a high degree of}} multicollinearity, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation for each country on a daily level. Results suggest a two-factor structure: first underlying factor represents the final measure of brand rating, while the second factor represents the brand dispersion variable. Web Appendix B: Analysis of Various Model Variants YouGov requests respondents not to rate every brand, but instead pick all brands from one industry sector that are rated positively on an attribute, and next pick from the same sector brands that are rated negatively. This may introduce brand awareness confounding bias because unfamiliar brands are less known and, thus, <b>not</b> <b>selected</b> by <b>respondents.</b> Our original VAR model does not contain a control for brand awareness.

One of important media that serve as the source of information on reproductive health in adolescents is website. The objective {{of this study was to}} find out the relationship between the use of web-based information and knowledge about reproductive health in adolescents. Method: A Cross Sectional was conducted from February 2013 to April 2014, involving the Tenth and Eleventh Grade students of SMA, SMK, MA in Ponorogo Regency. The study was conducted in schools with computer facilities and internet connection, involving 210 adolescents, who were selected using Simple Random Sampling technique. The data was collected by questionnaire. Data analysis was conducted in univariate, bivariate with using Spearman Rank test, and multivariate ways using logistic regression test. Results: The study showed that mean website access frequency and duration for information about reproductive health by adolescents were 1. 36 times a week and 1. 65 hours; knowledge about reproductive health was 58, 1 % in low category; and no relationship was found between the use of web-based information system and knowledge about reproductive health in adolescents, even though there was an increasing trend in the frequency and duration of website visits for information related to reproductive health in adolescents. Discussion: The use of web-based information system does not have a significant relationship with knowledge about reproductive health in adolescents. Further research is necessary to explore the same subject with a different method, which is <b>not</b> <b>selecting</b> the <b>respondents</b> in the first meeting and use a closed questionnaire to <b>select</b> the <b>respondents.</b> This way, the adolescents will feel free and open to the researcher.

40|$|Although {{researchers}} can easily select probability samples of addresses using the U. S.

This article tests two design elements—a calendar and explanatory wording of selection instructions in cover letters—to aid and motivate households to carry out selection procedures accurately. We empirically examine these elements in two mail surveys of Nebraskans—the 2012 Nebraska Annual Social Indicators Survey and 2013 Nebraska Trees and Forest Survey.

This was a qualitative study. <b>Respondents</b> were <b>selected</b> by local Rukun Tetangga (Households Leaders) or Rukun Warga (administrative unit at the next-to-lowest level in city) based on the income in each areas which categorized as <b>not</b> enough. <b>Selected</b> <b>respondents</b> were divided in 2 (two) groups, men workers and fertile aged women. The location {{of the study were}} at Rukun Warga 9 and 6 of Kelurahan Perak Utara (North Perak Kelurahan) and at Rukun Warga 2 of Kelurahan Perak Utara (North Perak Kelurahan) in Pabean Cantikan Sub-district, Tanjung Perak port areas. Data were collected by focus group discussion (FGD) in 3 (three) sub-groups of men workers and fertile aged women, respectively. There were 8 - 10 respondents in each sub-groups. The data were analyzed by content analysis methods. Results showed the perception on health-sick in men workers was wider in comparison to fertile aged women because if they were having influenza but still could work then they considered not sick, meanwhile for the fertile aged women if they were feeling differences in their bodies then they consider as sick. But both groups had the same perception on health­ sick for their children, there were "healthy children if they were not fusser, not weak, moving, actively play. The groups were also had the same perception on dental sick that was a severe sick. Furthermore, the majority mentioned that if getting sick, they did self medication firstly then if not getting better they visit health workers. But for their children if getting sick, they were directly sent to health workers. The responses for health center services varied in both groups. The selection to health center was merely because of cheap although mostly said that they were not free enough to express their concerns, medication was not good and examiners were not doctors. It concludes there was a wider perception on health among man worker groups and the pattern of health seeking behavior was by self medication at first, then if not better to health workers.
