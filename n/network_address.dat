Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line, {{as well as}} remote desktop access software. The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition and its first wireless product. The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004. An open interface {{for the development of}} third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.|$|E

In systems that can handle CIDR a count of two is therefore subtracted from the host availability, rather than the subnet availability, making all 2n subnets available and removing a need to subtract two subnets.|$|E
25|$|The {{end-to-end}} principle {{has evolved}} over time. Its original expression put the maintenance of state and overall intelligence at the edges, and assumed the Internet that connected the edges retained no state and concentrated on speed and simplicity. Real-world needs for firewalls, <b>network</b> <b>address</b> translators, web content caches and the like have forced changes in this principle.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} layer and lower-level layers are unconcerned with {{the specifics of}} application layer protocols. Routers and switches do not typically examine the encapsulated traffic, rather they just provide a conduit for it. However, some firewall and bandwidth throttling applications must interpret application data. An example is the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP). It is also sometimes necessary for <b>network</b> <b>address</b> translator (NAT) traversal to consider the application payload.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Microsoft {{released}} Windows 98Second Edition, {{an interim}} release. One {{of the more}} notable new features was the addition of Internet Connection Sharing, a form of <b>network</b> <b>address</b> translation, allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single Internet connection. Hardware support through device drivers was increased and this version shipped with Internet Explorer 5. Many minor problems {{that existed in the}} first edition were fixed making it, according to many, the most stable release of the Windows 9x family.|$|E
25|$|The <b>network</b> <b>address</b> {{was placed}} in an unused field in the Fido message database, which {{formerly}} always held a zero. Systems running existing versions of the software already ignored the fields containing the new addressing, so they would continue to work as before; when noticing a message addressed to another node they would look it up and call that system. Newer systems would recognize the network number and instead deliver that message to the network host. To ensure backward compatibility, existing systems retained their original node numbers through this period.|$|E
25|$|Also unlike modern P2P services, the {{identity}} of the downloaders is hidden from view. On P2P services a downloader is identifiable to all others by their <b>network</b> <b>address.</b> On Usenet, the downloader connects directly to a server, and only the server knows the address of who is connecting to it. Some Usenet providers do keep usage logs, but not all make this logged information casually available to outside parties such as the Recording Industry Association of America. The existence of anonymising gateways to USENET also complicates the tracing of a postings true origin.|$|E
50|$|One key {{differentiation}} for AppleTalk was {{it contained}} two protocols aimed at making the system completely self-configuring. The AppleTalk {{address resolution protocol}} (AARP) allowed AppleTalk hosts to automatically generate their own <b>network</b> <b>addresses,</b> and the Name Binding Protocol (NBP) was a dynamic system for mapping <b>network</b> <b>addresses</b> to user-readable names. Although systems similar to AARP existed in other systems, Banyan VINES for instance, nothing like NBP has existed until recently.|$|R

25|$|Tor {{can also}} provide {{anonymity}} to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called hidden services. Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), a hidden service is accessed through its onion address, usually via the Tor Browser. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding public keys and introduction points from a distributed hash table within the network. It can route data to and from hidden services, even those hosted behind firewalls or <b>network</b> <b>address</b> translators (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access hidden services.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Microsoft {{released}} Windows 98 Second Edition, {{an interim}} release whose notable features were {{the addition of}} Internet Connection Sharing and improved WDM audio and modem support. Internet Connection Sharing {{is a form of}} <b>network</b> <b>address</b> translation, allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single Internet connection. Windows 98 Second Edition has certain improvements over the original release. Hardware support through device drivers was increased. Many minor problems present in the original Windows 98 were found and fixed which make it, according to many, the most stable release of Windows 9x familyâ€”to the extent that commentators used to say that Windows 98's beta version was more stable than Windows 95's final (gamma) version.|$|E
25|$|Establishing the {{identity}} of the person posting illegal content is equally difficult due to the trust-based design of the network. Like SMTP email, servers generally assume the header and origin information in a post is true and accurate. However, as in SMTP email, Usenet post headers are easily falsified so as to obscure the true identity and location of the message source. In this manner, Usenet is significantly different from modern P2P services; most P2P users distributing content are typically immediately identifiable to all other users by their <b>network</b> <b>address,</b> but the origin information for a Usenet posting can be completely obscured and unobtainable once it has propagated past the original server.|$|E

A complete <b>network</b> <b>address</b> would now consist of the network and node number pair, which would be written with a slash between them. All mail travelling between networks would first be sent to their local network host, someone who volunteered to pay for any long distance charges. That single site would collect up all the netmail from all of the systems in their network, then re-package it into single packets destined to each network. They would then call any required network admin sites and deliver the packet to them. That site would then process the mail as normal, although all of the messages in the packet would be guaranteed to be local calls.|$|E
500|$|Though {{interesting}} {{on their}} own, the design concepts of Plan 9 {{were supposed to}} be most useful when combined together. For example, to implement a <b>network</b> <b>address</b> translation (NAT) server, a union directory can be created, overlaying the router's [...] directory tree with its own [...] Similarly, a virtual private network (VPN) can be implemented by overlaying in a union directory a [...] hierarchy from a remote gateway, using secured 9P over the public Internet. A union directory with the [...] hierarchy and filters can be used to sandbox an untrusted application or to implement a firewall. In the same manner, a distributed computing network can be composed with a union directory of [...] hierarchies from remote hosts, which allows interacting with them as if they are local.|$|E
2500|$|The {{benefits}} of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation {{architecture of the}} Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, {{it is necessary to}} allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization. [...] Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's <b>network</b> <b>address</b> space into a tree-like routing structure.|$|E

50|$|Routing, {{in a more}} narrow {{sense of}} the term, is often contrasted with {{bridging}} in its assumption that <b>network</b> <b>addresses</b> are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the <b>network.</b> Structured <b>addresses</b> allow a single routing table entry to represent the route {{to a group of}} devices. In large <b>networks,</b> structured <b>addressing</b> (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.|$|R
