Prior to the outbreak of war, Morotai had a population of 9,000 and had not been commercially developed.

5|$|A Dutch {{proposal}} {{to build new}} battleships was originally tendered in 1912, after years of concern over {{the expansion of the}} Imperial Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station. Only four coastal defense ships were planned, but naval experts and the Tweede Kamer (lower house of the parliament) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide a stronger defense for the Nederlands-Indië (<b>Netherlands</b> <b>East</b> <b>Indies,</b> abbr.

In 1890 a Colonial Reserve (Koloniale Reserve) was established in the Netherlands itself to recruit and train these volunteers and to re-integrate them into Dutch society upon the conclusion of their overseas service. On the eve of the Japanese invasion in December 1941, Dutch regular troops in the <b>East</b> <b>Indies</b> comprised about 1,000 officers and 34,000 men, of whom 28,000 were indigenous.

40|$|We measure {{technological}} progress in oceanic shipping directly {{by using a}} large database of daily log entries from ships of the British and Dutch East India Companies and Navies to estimate daily sailing speed in different wind conditions from 1750 to 1850. Against the consensus among economic (but not maritime) historians that the technology of sailing shipswas static during this time, we find that average sailing speeds of British ships in moderate to strong winds rose by nearly a third. Driving this steady progress seems to be continuous evolution of sails and rigging, and improved hulls that allowed a greater area of sail to be set safely in a given wind. By contrast, looking at every voyage between the <b>Netherlands</b> and <b>East</b> <b>Indies</b> undertaken by the Dutch East India Company from 1595 to 1795, we find that journey time fell only by 10 per cent, with no improvement in the heavy mortality, averaging six per cent per voyage, of those aboard...|$|R

These were originally displayed in the Great Hall of the Vrijburg Palace in Recife.

40|$|The devil taketh {{those people}} {{who grew up in}} wealth and sloth’: Indianised Europeans, a danger to the colonial system From {{contemporary}} fiction on sea voyage appears a striking image. The ships that sailed between The <b>Netherlands</b> and Dutch <b>East</b> <b>Indies,</b> amidst 1850 and 1890, formed a micro colony: a compressed version of a colonial society. Practically, all components of a colonial community are represented on board. That includes the so-called backsliders: the Indianised Europeans. Analysis of eight novels on the sea voyages round Cape of Good Hope shows that Europeans that went native were represented in colonial discourse as a fundamental threat to colonial society, as they proved that the alleged superior Western civilization could be affected by supposed inferior Eastern cultures. For that encroaches upon the legitimacy of the colonial hegemony...|$|R

[...] The improvements in seaworthiness have been credited to [...] "replacing the traditional stepped deck ship with stronger flushed decked ones derived from Indian designs, and {{the increasing use of}} iron reinforcement." [...] The design originated from Bengal rice ships, with Bengal being famous for its shipbuilding industry at the time.
