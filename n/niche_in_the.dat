On the ground level of this platform is a small pool that was used for Muslim ritual ablution.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the food}} eaten by station crews was frozen, {{refrigerated}} or canned. Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts, {{with the help of}} a dietitian, before their flight to the station. The diet was designed to provide around 100g of protein, 130g of fat and 330g of carbohydrates per day, in addition to appropriate mineral and vitamin supplements. Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. Canned food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a <b>niche</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core module's table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes. Usually, crews drank tea, coffee and fruit juices, but, unlike the ISS, the station also had a supply of cognac and vodka for special occasions.|$|E

5|$|Harley {{endured a}} {{difficult}} start {{to his first}} season as captain, as he ruptured a finger tendon during the club's round one loss to the Western Bulldogs. After undergoing surgery on his finger, Harley made his return through the club's reserves team in the VFL but failed to earn a recall to the senior team until round ten. After playing {{the majority of his}} career at Geelong as a centre half back, Harley struggled to find his <b>niche</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> defence following the emergence of the younger Matthew Egan in the key position. He soon adjusted himself as a floating defender capable of playing on small forwards, and retained his position in the side after achieving career-best averages of 14 disposals and 5 marks a game. Harley helped the team compile an 18-4 win-loss record {{at the conclusion of the}} home and away season, earning them their eighth McClelland Trophy and securing first position on the ladder leading into the finals series. Harley led the defence to the number one defensive record in the league during the season, by letting only 1664 points be scored against them. After wins against North Melbourne and Collingwood in the Qualifying and Preliminary finals respectively, Geelong earned a spot in the Grand Final against Harley's former team Port Adelaide. Collecting 13 disposals and 7 marks, Harley helped the club to an AFL-record 119 point win and secure its first premiership in 44 years. Harley became the first Geelong captain of a premiership-winning side since Fred Wooller in 1963, and achieved the rare distinction of becoming a premiership-winning captain in his first year at the helm.|$|E

40|$|The term niche {{refers to}} a {{specific}} segment of any particular market. This article investigates the importance of <b>niche</b> tourism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Cape province of South Africa. In addition to surveying <b>the</b> available <b>niche</b> sectors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Cape Province of South Africa, the article establishes that Medical tourism is a niche market that has huge prospects for future development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Cape Province. The significance of this article lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fact that a well articulated and enhanced medical tourism will contribute to South African national reserves of foreign currency thus increasing South Africa’s national income. The need to develop adequate <b>niche</b> tourism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Medical sector, the article argues, requires an investigation {{into some of the}} factors that aid/negate this niche sector. While recommendations on how to combat these impediments are proffered, the article argues that Medical tourism is a specialist interest tourism sector that has the potential to contribute and serve as a strong base {{for the development of a}} healthy tourism economy <b>in</b> South Africa. <b>The</b> article contributes to a growing body of knowledge on tourism and public history.

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{evaluate}} the inter- and intraobserver agreement for {{measurement of the}} size and volume of a niche and assessment of the shape, {{with the use of}} three-dimensional (3 D) ultrasound. Study design In this reproducibility study, 20 3 D ultrasound volumes of uteri with a niche were selected, based on complete visualisation of <b>the</b> uterus and <b>niche</b> <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> longitudinal and transversal plane. Niche measurements were performed off-line twice by one observer and once by another observer. Niche measurements and assessment of shape were performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal and transversal plane, and <b>niche</b> volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal plane. The mean difference, 95 % limits of agreement, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's kappa were calculated to assess the inter- and intraobserver agreement. Results The interobserver agreement was excellent for all niche measurements (ICC > 0. 86), including depth and residual myometrial thickness (RMT), except for width at <b>niche</b> base <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transversal plane (ICC 0. 74) and niche volume (ICC 0. 79), which were classified as good agreement. Wide limits of agreement and a high mean difference were found for maximal width <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transversal plane. The intraobserver agreement was excellent for all measurements (ICC > 0. 80), except for RMT <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal and transversal plane, which were classified as good agreement (ICC 0. 73 and 0. 62, respectively). Wide limits of agreement were found for maximal width and width at <b>niche</b> base <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transversal plane. <b>The</b> overall agreement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transversal plane was lower than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal plane, but still all <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of good agreement. The inter- and intraobserver agreement was good to poor for the assessment of niche shape. Conclusion Using 3 D ultrasound, various niche parameters, including depth (both perpendicular to niche base and maximal depth), maximal width, width at niche base, RMT and volume, can be measured {{with a high level of}} agreement, in particular if measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal plane...|$|R

40|$|The cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), is {{a serious}} {{invasive}} species that significantly damages plants of approximately 60 families around the world.

Our goals were to create a current and future potential global distribution map for this pest under climate change with MaxEnt software. We tested the hypothesis of niche conservatism for P. solenopsis by comparing its native <b>niche</b> <b>in</b> North America to its invasive niches on other continents using Principal components analyses (PCA) <b>in</b> R. <b>The</b> potentially suitable habitat for P. solenopsis in its native and non-native ranges is presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present paper.
