5|$|The {{following}} year, a <b>new</b> <b>report</b> {{was released}} {{stating that the}} Route 30 Connector project was feasible. The proposed Connector was to be one mile (1.3km) long, and would be constructed as an elevated highway above the wetlands. Construction cost was estimated at $80 million, half {{of which could be}} paid for by making the Connector a toll road. The <b>new</b> <b>report</b> also identified US 30 as an important roadway for reducing city traffic, as it carried the least amount of traffic and had the greatest capacity out of the city's three major entering highways, the other two being the Expressway and the Black Horse Pike (US 40/US 322).|$|E
5|$|Agatha is {{reconnected}} to the PreCrime system. While {{attempting to}} comfort Lara, Burgess accidentally reveals himself as Lively's murderer. Lara frees Anderton from stasis, and Anderton exposes Burgess at a PreCrime celebratory banquet by playing the full video of Agatha's vision of Burgess killing Lively. A <b>new</b> <b>report</b> is generated at PreCrime: Burgess will kill Anderton. Burgess corners Anderton, and explains {{that as he}} {{could not afford to}} let Lively take Agatha back without impacting PreCrime, he arranged to kill Lively following an actual attempt on her life, so that the murder would appear as an echo to the technician within PreCrime and be ignored. Anderton points out Burgess's dilemma: If Burgess kills Anderton, he will be imprisoned for life, but PreCrime will be validated; if he spares Anderton, PreCrime will be discredited and shut down. Anderton reveals the ultimate flaw of the system: once people are aware of their future, they are able to change it. Burgess shoots himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the Planning Office for Oslo Central Station, led by Fin Hvoslef, was {{established}} by the government. In 1950, they presented a <b>new</b> <b>report,</b> which recommended that a new route for the tunnel be considered, to ease construction and increase safety. This was in part based on an engineering report from 1949, which had made the first detailed plans for the line. Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, {{was established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station. However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line at a point between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel, Oslo Central Station and Nationaltheatret was passed unanimously.|$|E

5|$|On 31 January 2007, Autolink—Norways largest {{distributor}} of automobiles—bought 40% of Ofotbanen, and transferred their train haulage contract to them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer. In March, Autolink ordered an additional 70 new autoracks for NOK 175 million. In June 2007, a <b>new</b> <b>report</b> from the Rail Inspectorate showed that Ofotbanen had severe safety problems—the company was using engineers without necessary licenses, {{and was not}} performing safety analysis. Director of the inspectorate, Erik Ø. Johnsen, stated that the inspectorate {{did not believe that}} Ofotbanen was taking safety seriously. CEO of Ofotbanen, Terje Østensen, felt that the issues taken up by the inspectorate were mere formalities, and that it was difficult to make necessary documentation, stating that in his opinion, none of the procedures criticized actually influenced safety.|$|E
5|$|The Lubitz family held a {{press conference}} on 24 March 2017, two years after the crash. Lubitz's father said that they did not accept the {{official}} investigative findings that Andreas Lubitz deliberately caused the crash or that he had been depressed at the time. They presented aviation journalist Tim van Beveren, whom they had commissioned to publish a <b>new</b> <b>report,</b> which asserted that Lubitz could have fallen unconscious, that the cockpit door lock had malfunctioned on previous flights, and that potentially dangerous turbulence had been reported in the area {{on the day of the}} crash. The timing of the press conference by Lubitz's father, on the anniversary of the crash, was criticized by families of the victims, who were holding their own remembrances on that day.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{started an}} {{evaluation}} of the Ringerike Line, carried out by the National Rail Administration, in 2006. The first edition was completed in 2009, but was found to be insufficient, resulting in the process being restarted. A <b>new</b> <b>report</b> was published in June 2011. In September 2012, the ministry concluded that also the second report was insufficient {{and that it would be}} discarded. There were two main concerns with the report. Firstly, it was based on a single-track line which would not be built to the standards of high-speed rail. The ministry stated that all new railway plans in Norway were to have double track and be optimized for high-speed rail. Secondly, the report had a simplified economic analysis which was not sufficient to be used for political evaluation. The result of the discard was that the planning of E16 was no longer tied to the planning of the railway.|$|E

5|$|Looking for a {{near term}} solution, McNamara once again turned to ARPA, asking it to {{consider}} the Zeus system in depth. The agency returned a <b>new</b> <b>report</b> in April 1962 that contained four basic concepts. First was the Zeus system in its current form, outlining what sort of role it might play in various war fighting scenarios. Zeus could, for instance, be used to protect SAC bases, thereby requiring the Soviets to expend more of their ICBMs to attack the bases. This would presumably mean less damage to other targets. Another considered the addition of new passive electronically scanned array radars and computers to the Zeus, which would allow it to attack dozens of targets at once over a wider area. Finally, in its last concept, ARPA replaced Zeus with a new very high speed, short range missile designed to intercept the warhead at altitudes as low as , by which time any decoys or fireballs would be long gone. This last concept became Nike-X, an ad hoc name suggested by Jack Ruina while describing the ARPA report to PSAC.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The Sulu bleeding-heart has always been considered a rare bird, and only two specimens, both males, have ever been taken of the species. The specimens, collected in October 1891 on the small islet of Tataan, are the last time anyone has definitely seen the Sulu bleeding-heart alive. The bleeding-heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success. Most of Tawi-Tawi's forests were cleared by August 1994, and the Sulu bleeding-heart may well be extirpated on the mainland. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding-heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s. Despite this, an expedition in 2009 failed to find any signs of the species or discover a <b>new</b> <b>report</b> of the species' continued existence. The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a viable population. Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding-hearts is likely to be small, possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds, and would be threatened by continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting. As the Mindanao and Luzon bleeding-hearts are popular cagebirds, any bleeding-heart found on Tawi-Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding-heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding-heart. There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago, and other than two environmental education initiatives in the 1990s nothing has been done to protect any surviving population.|$|E
