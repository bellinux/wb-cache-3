40|$|The {{following}} report {{deals with}} {{a study of the}} urinary changes in ordinary scarlet fever as revealed by the Addis sediment count technique. No cases of clinical postscarlatinal nephritis have been included. Particu-lar interest centers in the period from 8 to 30 days after the onset of infection. LITERATURE As early as 1874 Mahomed (1) found that scarlet fever convalescents, at some period during the six weeks after defervescence, exhibited a pulse of high tension (sphygmograph) and hemoglobinuria (guaiac test) without albuminuria (<b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>test).</b> If the tension was high and persisted, albumin was liable to appear. Occasionally there was anorexia with slight fever (1000 F.) and sometimes a little edema was evident upon careful examination, but as a rule, there were no constitutional symptoms or signs. He called this picture the "prealbuminuric stage of nephritis. " Thompson (2), in 1886, examined the urine for blood and albumin three times a day for 56 days in 180 cases of scarlet fever. Eighty-four per cent of the patients were under 15 years. In 66 cases (37 per cent) there were no urinary changes. Two cases (1 per cent) showed anasarca without urinary changes, and in 112 (62 per cent) the urine showed albumin, blood, or both, with or without edema. Thompson calls all of these 112 cases " nephritis, " but "in some cases, the evidence of kidney mischief was so slight and evanescent that but for careful and frequent testing, the presence of these substances, would no doubt, have been overlooked. " Thompson also found, at times, a positive guaiac test with no albumin, but thought the "pre-albuminuric stage " of nephritis was infrequent. Dittmar (3) examined the urine in 91 consecutive cases twice daily for 56 days. Eighty-five per cent of the patients were under 15 years. The <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>test</b> for albumin and the guaiac test for blood were used. Forty-eight (52. 7 per cent) of the cases at some period showed positive 1 Two patients were studied through the courtesy of Dr. Charles Hendee Smith and 12 patients were studied on the wards of Willard Parker Hospita...|$|E
40|$|A new {{solvent system}} {{referred}} to as Next Generation Solvent or NGS, has been developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory {{for the removal of}} cesium from alkaline solutions in the Caustic Side Solvent Extraction process. NGS is proposed for deployment at MCU and at the Salt Waste Processing Facility. This work investigated the chemical compatibility between NGS and 16 M, 8 M, and 3 M nitric acid from contact that may occur in handling of analytical samples from MCU or, for 3 M acid, which may occur during contactor cleaning operations at MCU. This work shows that reactions occurred between NGS components and the high molarity nitric acid. In the case of 16 M and 8 M nitric acid, initially organo-nitrate groups are generated and attach to the modifier and that with time oxidation reactions convert the modifier into a tarry substance with gases (NO{sub x} and possibly CO) evolving. Calorimetric analysis of the organonitrate revealed the reaction products are not explosive nor will they deflagrate. NGS exposure to 3 M nitric acid resulted in much slower reaction kinetics and that the generated products were not energetic. We recommended conducting Accelerated Rate calorimetry on the materials generated in the 16 M and 8 M <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>test.</b> Also, we recommend continue monitoring of the samples contacting NGS with 3 M nitric acid...|$|E

In this connection a study of possible galvanic corrosion effect at the junction of sensitized HAZ and the adjacent base metal in 304 SS in sulphuric as well as nitric acid, was undertaken. The galvanic couples were prepared using sensitized 304 SS as the anodes, and the base metal as the cathodes, electrically connected in different anode to cathode ratios. Potentiodynamic anodic polarization studies were conducted in deaerated 0. 5 M sulphuric acid whereas electrochemical noise (ECN) experiments were performed in 3 M deaerated nitric acid at room temperature as well as 60 °C. The data analysis of current and potential signals was conducted using statistical methods; the data was analysed in the frequency domain using Maximum Entropy Method (MEM). The corrosion rates observed in nitric acid medium at room temperature did not show enhanced corrosion rate due to galvanic coupling. However, the corrosion rates were higher at 60 °C in the same medium. Based on these results, a drastic rise in corrosion rate and the subsequent failure of the waste vault tank was not expected...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the {{corrosion}} behaviour in the ASTM standard Nitric acid and Oxalic acid tests, of two commercial AISI type 304 L steels in the as received condition and after various heat treatments. Optical microscopy and SEM, TEM and STEM in conjunction with energy dispersive x-ray analysis, were used to correlate the corrosion behaviour of these steels with their microstructure. Some evidence of phosphorus segregation at grain boundaries was found. The corrosion behaviour at microstructural level was studied by examining on the TEM thin foils of steel that had been exposed to boiling nitric acid. Banding attack in the nitric acid and oxalic acid tests was studied using SEM and EPNA and found to be due to the micro-segregation of chromium and nickel. Using two experimental series of 304 L, one a 17 % Cr, 91 Ni, steel with phosphorus additions from 0. 006 % to 0. 028 %, the other a 20 % Cr, 121 Ni steel with boron additions from 0. 0011 to 0. 00 B 51.

40|$|Observations made {{on animals}} {{subjected}} to parenteral administration of penicillin, at relatively high levels, disclosed a pseudopositive albumin reaction. While {{it is not}} known if similar reactions have been noted after clinical treatment, there is at least a possibility that in cases where unusually high penicillin dosages are administered similar phenomena may occur. Most tests for albumin in urine are based upon the visual demonstration of the precipitation of the protein from the urine by use of a strong acid reagent. The question as to which is the best test to use {{has been the subject of}} much debate. The method of choice perhaps frequently depends upon the ease with which it may be performed and the sensitivity desired; however, for general laboratory studies we have preferred to use Robert's qualitative albumin test. 3 Exton's sulfosalicylic acid method, ' Purdy's acetic acid test, 4 and Heller's <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>test,</b> 4 one of the oldest methods commonly used, were also investigated.

40|$|Laboratory {{corrosion}} {{tests were conducted}} on eight candidates to select a durable and cost-effective alloy for use in mobile evaporators to process radioactive waste solutions. Based on an extensive literature survey of corrosion data, three stainless steel alloys (304 L, 316 L, AL- 6 XN), four nickel-based alloys (825, 625, 690, G- 30), and titanium were selected for testing. The {{corrosion tests}} included vapor phase, liquid junction (interface), liquid immersion, and crevice corrosion tests on plain and welded samples of candidate materials. Tests were conducted at 80 {degrees}C for 45 days in two different test solutions: a nitric acid solution. to simulate evaporator conditions during the processing of the cesium ion-exchange eluant and a highly alkaline sodium hydroxide solution to simulate the composition of Tank 241 -AW- 101 during evaporation. All of the alloys exhibited excellent corrosion resistance in the alkaline test solution. Corrosion rates were very low and localized corrosion was not observed. Results from the nitric acid tests showed that only 316 L stainless steel did not meet our performance criteria. The 316 L welded interface and crevice specimens had rates of 22. 2 mpy and 21. 8 mpy, respectively, which exceeds the maximum corrosion rate of 20 mpy. The other welded samples had about the same corrosion resistance as the plain samples. None of the welded samples showed preferential weld or heat-affected zone (HAZ) attack.

40|$|Hypergolic {{propellants}} {{are widely}} used by the propulsion community in various applications. A monomethylhydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide-based oxidizer rep- resent {{the state of the}} art for hypergolic propellants. The health hazards associated with these propellants has prompted research into gelled formulations due to the inherent safety advantages of gels. Gelling propellants alters many of the chemical and physical properties relevant to the processes encountered in rocket engines. The effect of these altered properties must be understood and quantified before a system utilizing gelled propellants can be fielded. This study explores the rheological properties of gelled monomethylhydrazine and red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> as well as the ignition of liquid and gelled monomethylhydrazine and red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid.</b> ^ Monomethylhydrazine has been gelled with various concentrations of hydroxypropylcellulose. A simple procedure for mixing the gel was developed and the viscosity-shear rate relationship measured with a rotational rheometer. Increasing the hydroxypropylcellulose concentration increased the viscosity of the monomethylhydrazine gels and increased the shear-thinning behavior of the gels. The viscosity- shear rate relationship was modeled using the power-law and Carreau-Yasuda models to quantify the repeatability of the rheological properties. The viscosity measurements for the monomethylhydrazine gels generally varied less than 25 % from the average for a single gel formulation. The monomethylhydrazine gels had negligible yield stresses and were not thixotropic. ^ Red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> was gelled with 3, 4, and 5 % by mass fumed silica using a mixing procedure developed for silica-hydrocarbon gels. The red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> gels exhibited shear-thinning, thixotropic behavior and had measurable yield stress values. Increasing the fumed silica concentration increased the viscosity, the shear-thinning behavior, and the yield stress of the gels. A power-law curve fit was applied to the viscosity-shear rate results and demonstrated large variations in the rheological measurements. The large deviations resulted from the thixotropic behavior the gels. A method that presheared the gel samples prior to performing the rheological measurements led to improved measurement repeatabililty. ^ The ignition of liquid monomethylhydrazine and red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> was examined through a series of drop tests and impinging jet tests with a unlike-doublet injection system. Drop tests resulted in minimum ignition delays of 1. 5 milliseconds characterized by a flame and a loud report. In the impinging jet tests an ignition event defined by a visible flame was observed only at injection velocities from 8 to 20 ft/s. The ignition events were characterized by poor mixing and the burning of large monomethylhydrazine drops with no flame spreading. A series of impinging jet tests with a hydrocarbon-based fuel mixture and 91. 2 % H 2 O 2 resulted in repeatable ignition delays from 6 to 8 ms at injection velocities from 48 to 138 ft/s, verifying the system functionality. Additional jet tests with a fuel mixture of 2 -dimethylaminoethylazide and tetramethylethylenediamine with red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> exhibited similar ignition behavior to the monomethylhydrazine and red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>tests.</b> An investigation into the red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> composition points to the presence of some impurity that may be altering the ignition processes. Impinging jet tests were also performed with monomethylhydrazine and red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> gels. Although an ignition event was generally not observed, the gels exhibited distinct flow patterns related to the rheological properties of the propellants. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{industrial}} {{manufacturing process}} often reacts glycerol with a nearly 1:1 mixture of concentrated sulfuric <b>acid</b> and concentrated <b>nitric</b> <b>acid.</b> This {{can be produced}} by mixing white fuming nitric acid—a quite expensive pure <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> in which the oxides of nitrogen have been removed, as opposed to red fuming <b>nitric</b> <b>acid,</b> which contains nitrogen oxides—and concentrated sulfuric acid. More often, this mixture is attained by the cheaper method of mixing fuming sulfuric acid, also known as oleum—sulfuric acid containing excess sulfur trioxide—and azeotropic <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> (consisting of about 70 percent <b>nitric</b> <b>acid,</b> with the rest being water).|$|R
5000|$|Oleum {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of many explosives with the notable exception of nitrocellulose. [...] (In modern manufacturing of nitrocellulose, the H2SO4 concentration is often adjusted using oleum) The chemical requirements for explosives manufacture often call for anhydrous mixtures containing <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> and sulfuric acid. Ordinary commercial grade <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> consists of the constant boiling azeotrope of <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> and water, and contains 68% <b>nitric</b> <b>acid.</b> Mixtures of ordinary <b>nitric</b> <b>acid</b> in sulfuric acid therefore contain substantial amounts of water and are unsuitable for processes such as those that occur in {{the manufacture}} of trinitrotoluene.|$|R
