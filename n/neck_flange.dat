50|$|A weld <b>neck</b> <b>flange</b> (also {{known as}} a high-hub flange and tapered hub flange) {{is a type of}} flange. There are two designs. The regular type is used with pipes. The long type is {{unsuitable}} for pipes and is used in process plant. A weld <b>neck</b> <b>flange</b> consists of a circular fitting with a protruding rim around the circumference. Generally machined from a forging, these flanges are typically butt welded to a pipe. The rim has a series of drilled holes that permit the flange to be affixed to another flange with bolts.|$|E
50|$|A weld <b>neck</b> <b>flange</b> {{is joined}} to a piping system by butt welding. Although its long neck (or hub) makes it expensive, it reduces {{mechanical}} stress on piping by distributing stress between {{the base of}} the flange and the wall at the weld. Turbulence and erosion are reduced due to the matching size of the pipe and flange.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{transmission}} {{steel tower}} {{has been increasing}} and welded <b>Neck</b> <b>Flange</b> joint has been applied steel tower for post joint. However, welding process has a somewhat undesirable effect of adversely affecting the toughness of the weld bond at welded joints. In order to secure the safety of steel tower, therefor, the study on fracture toughness welded <b>Neck</b> <b>Flange</b> joint is one of important problems. In this experiment, the authors carried out COD bend test with weld test specimens of SM 4 IB and STK 55 steels which were welded using CO 2 arc process. From {{the results of these}} tests, the characteristics of fracture toughness were evaluated on the welded <b>Neck</b> <b>Flange</b> joint...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of gasket load drop caused by internal pressure at flange joints. The method published here makes possible {{to take into consideration}} the stiffness effect of the integrated part of the flange ring. The equations published refer to large size welding <b>neck</b> <b>flanges</b> but the method itself can be applied at any other types of flange joint, too. During the determination of the flange rotational stiffness the model shaped up by MURRAY and STUART [4] for calculating stress-state of welding <b>neck</b> <b>flanges</b> should have been made more precise. The preciseness of this method, as well as the convergence of trial-and-error calculations used were proved by results of calculations carried out on flange joint...|$|R
40|$|The 1 st {{generation}} acoustic monitoring {{package was}} designed to detect and analyze weak acoustic signals inside natural gas transmission lines. Besides a microphone it housed a three-inch diameter aerodynamic acoustic signal amplifier to maximize sensitivity to leak induced {Delta}p type signals. The theory and test results of this aerodynamic signal amplifier was described in the master's degree thesis of our Research Assistant Deepak Mehra {{who is about to}} graduate. To house such a large three-inch diameter sensor required the use of a steel 300 -psi rated 4 inch weld <b>neck</b> <b>flange,</b> which itself weighed already 29 pounds. The completed 1 st generation Acoustic Monitoring Package weighed almost 100 pounds. This was too cumbersome to mount in the field, on an access port at a pipeline shut-off valve. Therefore a 2 nd generation and truly Portable Acoustic Monitor was built. It incorporated a fully self-contained {Delta}p type signal sensor, rated for line pressures up to 1000 psi with a base weight of only 6 pounds. This is the Rosemont Inc. Model 3051 CD-Range 0, software driven sensor, which is believed to have industries best total performance. Its most sensitive unit was purchased with a {Delta}p range from 0 to 3 inch water. This resulted in the herein described 2 nd generation: Portable Acoustic Monitoring Package (PAMP) for pipelines up to 1000 psi. Its 32 -pound total weight includes an 18 -volt battery. Together with a 3 pound laptop with its 4 -channel data acquisition card, completes the equipment needed for field acoustic monitoring of natural gas transmission pipelines...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 10 - 15 years, flange joints {{designed}} for metal-to-metal face contact with self seating and pressure activated seal rings {{have been used}} extensively in high-pressure applications in industrial piping, pressure vessels, pipelines, risers and associated equipment. These flange joints are generally much smaller and lighter, with smaller bolts, than equally rated standard gasketed flange joints, and are often called compact flange joints. This paper provides all necessary information to design compact flange joints for pressure and external loads and made from any suitable material. The paper includes design methods for design of the seal ring, flange and bolts in addition to assembly guidelines. Weld <b>neck</b> <b>flanges,</b> where the hub is of uniform thickness are discussed in detail. Similar method as presented {{has been applied to}} design compact flange joints with great success for many years...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} insure the {{accuracy}} of steam turbine thermal test in power plant, the flowrate measurement accuracy of condensate water should be insured. In this paper, the portable and integrated type flow measuring device for condensate water of 300 MW steam turbine flow is designed, {{which is based on}} the condensate water parameters and the specific pipeline conditions at the exit of the No. 5 low pressure heater for 300 MW unit. A integration of non standard differential pressure orifice flow meter is designed in this paper Through calibration in standard experimental system, the reason of the large error is that the flow field is disturbed by the origin plate type downward welding connecting flanges. Then the welding <b>neck</b> <b>flanges</b> is designed for the connecting flanges. The distribution of connecting flanges of flow field is weaken, and the measurement accuracy can meet the demand of steam turbine thermal test...|$|R
5000|$|Progressive {{stamping}} {{can also}} be produced on transfer presses. These are presses that transfer the components from one station to the next {{with the use of}} mechanical [...] "fingers". For mass production of stamped parts which do require complicated in-press operations, it is always advisable to use a progressive press. One of the advantages of this type of press is the production cycle time. Depending upon the part, productions can easily run well over 800 parts/minute. One of the disadvantages of this type of press {{is that it is not}} suitable for high precision deep drawing which is when the depth of the stamping exceeds the diameter of the part. When necessary, this process is performed upon a transfer press, which run at slower speeds, and rely on the mechanical fingers to hold the component in place during the entire forming cycle. In the case of the progressive press, only part of the forming cycle can be guided by spring-loaded sleeves or similar, which result in concentricity and ovality issues and non uniform material thickness. Other disadvantages of progressive presses compared to transfer presses are: increased raw material input required to transfer parts, tools are much more expensive because they are made in blocks with very little independent regulation per station; impossibility to perform processes in the press that require the part leave the strip (example beading, <b>necking,</b> <b>flange</b> curling, thread rolling, rotary stamping etc.).|$|R
40|$|AbstractJoining {{of steel}} pipes and pipe flanges use today the {{conventional}} method of fusion welding, where the flange is girth-welded onto the pipe. However, fusion welding of flanges to pipes {{is associated with}} many disadvantages such as the final quality of the weld, degradation of the mechanical properties of the base pipe near the heat affected zone, defects and cracks appearing in the weld, misalignments, to mention a few. The current study proposes a novel pipe-flange connection to replace the fusion welding process of steel pipes with a method based on cold working. The method is based on that the steel pipe is inserted into the <b>neck</b> of the <b>flange,</b> in which two circumferential grooves are manufactured. An expansion tool having two teeth is entered from the open side of the connection and is expanded hydraulically such that the teeth deform the pipe and cold work it plastically into the grooves. This will provide a strong joint between the flange and pipe. In this study {{the performance of the}} connection is maximized by optimizing the design of the flange and the expansion tool...|$|R
40|$|A thermal tip {{clearance}} control system provides a robust and flexible means of manipulating the closure between the casing and the rotating blade tips in a jet engine, reducing undesirable tip leakage flows. This may be achieved using an impingement cooling scheme on the external casing of the engine in conjunction with careful thermal management of internal over-tip seal segment cavity. For a reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption, the mass flow rate of air used for cooling must be minimised, be at as low a pressure as possible and delivered through a light weight structure surrounding the rotating components in the turbine. This thesis first characterises {{the effectiveness of a}} range of external impingement cooling arrangements in typical engine casing closure system. The effects of jet-to-jet pitch, number of jets, inline and staggered alignment of jets, arrays of jets on flange, on an engine representative casing geometry are assessed through comparison of the convective heat transfer coefficient distributions in a series of numerical studies. A baseline case is validated experimentally. The validation data allowed the suitability of different turbulence closure models to be assessed using a commercial RANS solver. Importantly for each configuration the thermal contraction of an idealised engine casing is predicted using thermo-mechanical finite element models, at a series of operating conditions representing engine idle to maximum take-off conditions. Cooling is provided by manifolds attached to the outside of the engine. The assembly tolerance of these components leads to variation in the standoff distance between the manifold and the casing. For cooling arrangements with promising performance, the study is extended to characterise the variation in closure with standoff distance. It is shown that where a sparse array of non-interacting jets is used the system can be made tolerant of large build misalignments. The casing geometry itself contributes to the thermal response of the system, and, in an additional study, the effect of casing thickness and circumferential thermal control flanges are investigated. Restriction of the passage of heat into the flanges was seen to be dramatically change their effectiveness and slight <b>necking</b> of the <b>flanges</b> at their root was shown to improve the performance disproportionally. High temperature secondary air flowing past the internal face of the engine casing tends to heat the casing, causing it to grow. Experimental and numerical characterisation of a heat transfer within a typical over-tip segment cavity heat transfer is presented in this thesis for the first time. A simplified modelling strategy is proposed for casing and a means to reduce the casing heat pickup by up to 25 % was identified. The overall validity of the modelling approach used is difficult to validate in the engine environment, however limited data from a test engine temperature survey became available {{during the course of the}} research. By modelling this engine {{tip clearance}} control system it was shown that good agreement to the temperature distribution in the engine casing could be achieved where full surface external heat transfer coefficient boundary conditions were available. </p...|$|R
