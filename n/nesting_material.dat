40|$|Parent {{birds are}} often assumed to {{regulate}} the amount of their <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> during incubation in response to various costs and benefits. This assumption, however, is rarely tested. We investigated this assumption in a ground-nesting shorebird, the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) by experimentally manipulating the amount of <b>nest</b> <b>material.</b> Materials were removed from some nests (reduced nests) and added to other nests (increased nests), whereas in control nests the amount of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> was not manipulated. In both reduced and increased nests the parents restored the original amount of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> within 24 hours. The parents tended {{to spend more time}} on arranging <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> in both reduced and increased nests than in control nests. However, neither incubation behaviour nor internal egg temperatures were different between reduced, increased and control nests. We conclude that Kentish plovers can quickly adjust the amount of materials around their eggs. This suggests that the parents carefully balance the various costs and benefits of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> use during incubation...|$|R

5|$|No <b>nesting</b> <b>material</b> {{is used in}} the {{breeding}} cavity. One white egg is laid each day until the typical clutch of about five eggs is complete. Incubation starts soon after the first egg is laid, with both parents sharing this duty in the day, but only the female at night. The eggs hatch in about 20 days, and the newly hatched young are blind, pink and naked. For most species, the eggs do not all hatch at the same time, so if food is in short supply only the older chicks survive. Adults and young defecate in the nest, and their pellets are trodden underfoot, making the nest cavity very malodorous. The chicks are in the nest for about 30 days.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are cavity nesters. They choose {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats {{rather than in the}} middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North America than in Europe because of possible predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor). No <b>nesting</b> <b>material</b> is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Before breeding, hole nesting birds {{face the}} problem of the {{presence}} of old <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> from previous seasons in their <b>nest</b> sites.

5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} on P. neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that the}} forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were too short (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry <b>nesting</b> <b>material</b> or food to a desired location.|$|E
25|$|The grey-capped social weaver is {{sometimes}} kept and bred in captivity by hobbyists. Due to its social structure, P. arnaudi only starts breeding when in larger established groups (at least about ten pairs). It needs large and high cages, and thin branches {{to attach the}} nest and lots of suitable <b>nesting</b> <b>material</b> (grass straws) needs to be available. A specialised website suggest a ground cover of sand beneath the nesting branches, and grass elsewhere, inter-planted with a few very resistant shrubs. Adults fare well on a diet of 95% seeds and 5% insects, but during the breeding season about 20% of the food should consist of living insects, such as mealworms and small crickets. Fine stone grit and calcium sources, such as shell grit and cuttlebone, need to be provided. Due to its large demand in <b>nesting</b> <b>material,</b> excessive theft may occur if other Plocepasserinae-species are kept in the same confinement. This website also suggests to compose a group at one instance and not to introduce other birds later, particularly during breeding.|$|E
25|$|More recently, nest {{insulation}} {{has been}} found to be related to the mass of the incubating parent. This is known as an allometric relationship. Nest walls are constructed with an adequate quantity of <b>nesting</b> <b>material</b> so that the nest will be capable of supporting the contents of the nest. Nest thickness, nest mass and nest dimensions therefore correlate with the mass of the adult bird. The flow-on consequence of this is that nest insulation is also related to parent mass.|$|E
50|$|Moist, shaded nests {{display a}} {{different}} daily temperature pattern than dry nests {{due to the}} different conditions. In the evenings, the nest temperature drops and then increases as the night progresses. Solar radiation does not contribute {{a lot of heat}} to the nest. Also, the <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> is not an effective insulator like the dry <b>nest</b> <b>material.</b> Moist <b>nests</b> have high external surface temperatures during the night. Instead, they rely on another curious mechanism to warm the nest: microbial activity within the moist <b>nest</b> <b>material.</b> As the workers inside the nest during the evening raise the temperature of the surroundings, microbial activity increases which heats the nest. Indeed, microbial activity is much higher in <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> than in the surrounding forest floor. Microbial activity is not seen in dry nests because the microbes require water. However, despite this adaptation, moist nests on average have lower internal temperatures than dry nests.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{associations}} between symbiotic bacterial communities of hosts {{and those of}} surrounding environments would help to understand how bacterial assemblages are acquired, {{and how they are}} transmitted from one to another location (i. e. symbiotic bacteria acquisition by hosts). Hoopoes (Upupa epops) smear their eggshells with uropygial secretion (oily secretion produced in their uropygial gland) that harbors antibiotic producing bacteria. Trying to elucidate a possible role of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> and cloaca microbiota in determining the bacterial community of the uropygial gland and the eggshells of hoopoes, we characterized bacterial communities of <b>nest</b> <b>material,</b> cloaca, uropygial gland and eggshells by the ARISA fingerprinting. Further, by adding material with scarce bacteria and antimicrobial properties, we manipulated the bacterial community of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> and thus tested experimentally its effects on the microbiomes of the uropygial secretion and of the eggshells. The experiment did not influence the microbiome of the uropygial secretion of females, but affected the community established on eggshells. This is the first experimental evidence indicating that <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> influences the bacterial community of the eggshells and, therefore, probability of embryo infection. Some of the bacterial strains detected in the secretion were also in the bacterial communities of the <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> and of cloaca, but their occurrence within nests was not associated, which suggests that bacterial environments of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> and cloaca are not sources of symbiotic bacteria for the gland. These results do not support a role of nest environments of hoopoes as reservoirs of symbiotic bacteria. We discuss possible scenarios explaining bacterial acquisition by hoopoes that should be further explored...|$|R

The nest is a cup-shaped structure lined with soft plant fibres and clad on the outside with lichen and mosses, held together with spider webs.

5000|$|Kentish plovers either nest solitarily or {{in a loose}} semicolonial manner. They are ground-nesting {{birds that}} lay their eggs in small shallow scrapes {{prepared}} by the male during courtship on the bare ground. Selection of the breeding ground {{is essential for the}} survival of nests and broods; nests are placed near the water on bare earth or in sparse vegetation; often on slightly elevated sites {{in order to have a}} good view of the surroundings to spot predators from a distance or near small bushes, plants or grass clusters, where the eggs are partly sheltered from predators. Nests are filled with <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> i.e. pebble stones, small parts of shells, fish bones, small twigs, grass and other debris. The modal clutch size comprises three eggs, although some nests are already completed with one or two eggs. In fresh or incomplete nests, the eggs tend to be fully exposed, but as the incubation period progresses, the amount of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> increases and the eggs become practically completely covered. During the incubation period, the Kentish plover recesses for variable periods of time mainly to forage or to perform other activities essential for self-maintenance. To compensate for the resulting lack of presence and increased predation risk, they use <b>nest</b> <b>materials</b> to cover and hence camouflage the eggs and keep them insulated. Kentish plovers regulate the amount of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> actively. This was shown experimentally in a study by increasing or decreasing the amount of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> artificially. Within 24hrs, the plovers had restored the amount of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> back to original. This is of advantage because <b>nest</b> <b>materials</b> help a good insulation of eggs, therefore preventing egg temperature fluctuations [...] ) (hence avoiding embryo hypothermia) and reducing the energetic costs of incubation for the parents. By regulating the amount of <b>nest</b> <b>material,</b> the Kentish plovers balances the advantages i.e. insulation and anti-predator defence and the disadvantages of <b>nest</b> <b>material</b> i.e. overheating. Incubation is the process by which the eggs are kept at optimal temperature i.e. between 37 Â°C and 38 Â°C for the embryonic development of birds with most of the heat deriving from the incubating bird. Kentish plover eggs are incubated for 20-25 days by both sexes; females mostly incubate during the day whilst males incubate during the night. Female Kentish plovers usually lose mass during the day, which is unexpected since they get relieved by the males for a variable amount of time. The loss would be much higher if the females were to incubate alone. This loss is a cost of incubation due to the depletion of fat stores and the evaporation of water.|$|R
