It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were well away from the building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E
5|$|The Winnebago War, {{also known}} as the Winnebago Uprising, was a brief {{conflict}} that took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States, primarily in what is now the state of Wisconsin. <b>Not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> war, the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago (or Ho-Chunk) Native American tribe. The Ho-Chunks were reacting to a wave of lead miners trespassing on their lands, and to false rumors that the United States had sent two Ho-Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution.|$|E

500|$|At one time, Cope and Marsh were amicable. They met in Berlin in 1864 {{and spent}} several days together. They even named species after each other. Over time their {{relations}} soured, {{due in part}} to their strong personalities. Cope was known to be pugnacious and possessed a quick temper; Marsh was slower, more methodical, and introverted. Both were quarrelsome and distrustful. Their differences also extended into the scientific realm, as Cope was a firm supporter of Neo-Lamarckism while Marsh supported Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Even at the best of times, both men were inclined to look down on each other subtly. As one observer put it, [...] "The patrician Edward may have considered Marsh <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> gentleman. The academic Othniel probably regarded Cope as <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> professional." ...|$|E
500|$|A fortified, planned {{settlement}} was built alongside the castle around this time. The small community was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> proper town and was effectively {{dependent on the}} castle; such settlements are sometimes called burgus settlements or [...] "castle-gate" [...] towns. The historians Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham suggest the settlement's earthwork defences and stone walls resemble an [...] "enormous outer bailey" [...] of the castle, rather a more conventional set of town walls. The walled settlement would have formed an important symbol of William's lordship.|$|E
500|$|He {{once said}} that [...] "in choreography, {{ordinary}} movements from real life are taken and extended, so they become dance movements, yet the relation to reality must always be there. It's {{important for me to}} know who the characters are and what their function is in the script. I must be able to illustrate either their activities, their emotions, or their changes in mood by the way they dance, all the while keeping the dance movements footed in reality and yet making the movements sort of odd and eccentric." [...] This philosophy was reflected in the early scene from The Band Wagon, when Fred Astaire walks down a railroad platform singing [...] "By Myself." [...] His walk was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> dance, and epitomized Kidd's style.|$|E

500|$|Cookery writer Laura Kelley {{notes that}} the 1774 edition {{was one of the}} first books in English to include a recipe for curry: [...] "To make a currey the Indian way." [...] The recipe calls for two small {{chickens}} to be fried in butter; for ground turmeric, ginger and pepper to be added and the dish to be stewed; and for cream and lemon juice to be added just before serving. Kelley comments that [...] "The dish is very good, but <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> modern curry. As you can see from the title of my interpreted recipe, the modern dish most like it is an eastern (Kolkata) butter chicken. However, the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish." ...|$|E
500|$|Teresa Cristina {{has been}} given a less than {{prominent}} place in Brazil's history. Historian Aniello Angelo Avella said that the Empress, nicknamed [...] "by her contemporaries as 'Mother of the Brazilians'," [...] is [...] "completely unknown in Italy and little studied in Brazil". According to his view, the few existing sources relegate her to having [...] "lived in the shadow of her husband, dedicating herself to her daughters' education, to home affairs, to charity." [...] The resulting image [...] "is of a woman of limited culture, blank, silent, who compensated with kindness and virtues of the heart the lack of physical attributes." [...] And this is the view that has come to be enshrined in history and the popular imagination, despite being <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> true representation of Teresa Cristina, since she was a well learned and willful woman.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Contrail" [...] is a dance song, as {{described}} by staff members from CD Journal. A reviewer from music website 13th Geek compared the track to her song [...] "Hands on Me", explaining in a further detailed review; [...] "The song evokes a summer feel similar to 'Hands On Me' but with a more relaxed and laid-back approach." [...] Patrick St. Michel, writing for The Japan Times, included the track {{as part of a}} discussion about the Westernized music influences throughout the entirety of Feel, stating [...] "nearly every track indulges in electronic trends, sometimes besting the American competition." [...] Michael McCarthy from Otakudx.com believed that the song's composition was [...] "progressive pop", saying [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> dance song and it doesn't fit your traditional pop mold either." [...] In a detail review, he further explained the song's melody and structure: ...|$|E

500|$|Raymond Mortimer, {{writing for}} The Sunday Times, said that [...] "James Bond is what every man {{would like to}} be, and what every woman would like between her sheets"; {{meanwhile}} the critic for The Times considered that after The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "On Her Majesty's Secret Service constitutes a substantial, if <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> complete, recovery." [...] In {{the view of the}} reviewer, it was enough of a recovery for them to point out that [...] "it is time, perhaps, to forget the much exaggerated things which have been said about sex, sadism and snobbery, and return to the simple, indisputable fact that Mr. Fleming is a most compelling story-teller." [...] Marghanita Laski, writing in The Times Literary Supplement thought that [...] "the new James Bond we've been meeting of late [...] somehow gentler, more sentimental, less dirty." [...] However, she considered that [...] "it really is time to stop treating Ian Fleming as a Significant Portent, and to accept him as a good, if rather vulgar thriller-writer, well suited to his times and to us his readers." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} the episode were {{generally}} positive. Hilary Rothing from UGO Networks enjoyed the perceived parallels to The Wire and praised the further development of Anna Torv's character Olivia; [...] "With tonight's premiere, the writing feels tighter, the pace is fast {{but not so much}} so that the story begins to trip over itself - and if that's any indication of how the rest of the season shapes up, then Fox will have my full attention every Thursday from 9-10pm". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, writing that he enjoyed how the writers made the show [...] "new-viewer-friendly without making existing fans too impatient". After receiving a DVD copy of the premiere in advance, IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.0/10, explaining [...] "Everything that made season one special is still here: Walter's still crazy and obsessed with food, Peter's still a smart-ass, and Olivia...well, there's a lot going on with Olivia, as usual". Isler thought newcomer Meghan Markle was [...] "cute, and spunky, but... <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> good fit here", and praised the cliffhanger as [...] "surprising in a special way". MTV's Josh Wigler praised all the main actors' performances, and thought the episode gave the second season a [...] "strong start".|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, MD-11 was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> success, ongoing {{tests of}} the MD-11 {{revealed}} a significant shortfall in the aircraft's performance. An important prospective carrier, Singapore Airlines, required a fully laden aircraft that could fly from Singapore to Paris, against strong headwinds during mid-winter; the MD-11 did not have sufficient range for this at the time. [...] Due to the less-than-expected performance figures, Singapore Airlines cancelled its 20-aircraft MD-11 order on August 2, 1991, and ordered 20 A340-300s instead.|$|E

[...] <b>Not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> cross-state route, it begins at US71 southeast of the Shreveport-Bossier City Metropolitan Area about [...] east of the Texas state line and does not reach I-49, Louisiana's major north–south interstate.

2500|$|A {{widely used}} {{model of a}} black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation. [...] Radiation {{incident}} on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.

[...] Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.|$|E

"As {{political}} {{diseases are}} naturally contagious, {{let it be}} supposed, for a moment, that Cornwall, seized with the Philadelphian phrensy, may resolve to separate itself from the general system of the English constitution, and judge of its own rights in its own parliament.

In serious text, it is considered a stylistic error, since it belongs properly to the stream of consciousness- or causerie-style writing. Typical examples are ending a section by telling what the next section is about, without bothering {{to explain why the}} topics are related, expanding a casual mention into a detailed treatment, or finding a contrived connection between the topics (e.g. [...] "We bought some red wine; speaking of red liquids, tomorrow is the World Blood Donor Day").|$|E
