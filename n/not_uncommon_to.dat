5|$|Registered daffodils {{are given}} a {{division}} number and colour code such as 5W-W ('Thalia'). In horticultural usage it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> also find another unofficial division of 'Miniatures', which, although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. These are sometimes referred to by nurseries as 'Division 14'. Over 140 narcissus cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{peninsula}} makes accurate weather prediction difficult for the town; when driving down Melody Line, it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find it sunny between one set of tunnels, rainy between another, and foggy between yet another. Ikata's position, stretching out into the ocean, also makes it a frequent target for typhoons.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the world, {{different}} seasoning {{and spices}} {{are used to}} augment the flavor of fried chicken. Because of the versatility of fried chicken, it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> flavor the chicken's crisp exterior {{with a variety of}} spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.|$|E

5|$|Quolls are {{carnivorous}} marsupials. They {{are primarily}} nocturnal, sleeping in hollowed-out logs or rocky dens and {{coming out to}} hunt during the night, though on rare occasions they can be seen looking for prey during the day. They are mostly ground-dwelling, but it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see a quoll climbing a tree. Quolls mark their territory several kilometres away from their dens. A male's territory often overlaps many females' territories, and male and female quolls only meet for mating. Quolls have communal toilet areas, usually on an outcropping used for marking territory and social functions. These communal latrines may have up to 100 droppings in them.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} skilled nature {{required}} for playing the agung, it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance, using tricks {{in an attempt to}} throw others off-beat. For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals has a hard time ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed, becoming the butt of jokes. Normally agung players switch off after each piece, but during instances like this where one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody, employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} strange place where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman for a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> invite a woman for a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E

50|$|These two beats {{are fairly}} {{even in the}} {{traditional}} txalaparta, with a slight stress on the first strike, but it's <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> listening <b>to</b> ttakunas being performed markedly tilted to the second beat (resulting in an emphasized second beat), driven by inertia.|$|R
5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy {{recalled}} the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{instruments}} that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances. While Orphaned Land are able to perform onstage with twenty musicians in their homeland of Israel, they {{have to rely on}} a computer to replicate the roles of the guest musicians for concerts elsewhere. Some folk metal acts confine themselves to studio recordings and are not known to perform any live concerts. This includes Folkearth, and Falkenbach. Other folk metal bands expand their regular roster to include more musicians and consequently, it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find bands in the genre featuring six or more members in their line-up. Some of the sextets in the genre are Schandmaul, Cruachan, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Midnattsol, while septets include Ithilien, Subway to Sally, In Extremo, and Lumsk. Both Silent Stream of Godless Elegy and Eluveitie boast eight members each while the line up of Mägo de Oz totals nine performers. Even when a band includes members dedicated to folk instruments, they might still rely on guest musicians to further enhance their sound. As an example, Lumsk added thirteen guest musicians to the band's seven members on their debut album Åsmund Frægdegjevar. At times, guest musicians are known to become full-fledged members of the band, {{as was the case in}} Skyforger and Turisas.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the large}} size of the contrabass's strings, it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see players using plectra made from a leather shoe or boot heel. The bass {{balalaika}} and contrabass balalaika rest on the ground, on a wooden or metal pin that is drilled into one of its corners.|$|E

25|$|Blaufränkisch is {{considered}} a high productive vine capable of producing high yields fairly easily. In some parts of Europe it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see it harvested at 100 hectoliters/hectare (approx 5.3 ton/acre). However over-cropping the vine {{has a tendency to}} produce thin wines with lots of green, weedy notes.|$|E
25|$|ODBC {{remains largely}} {{universal}} today, with drivers available for most platforms and most databases. It is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find ODBC drivers for database engines that {{are meant to}} be embedded, like SQLite, as a way to allow existing tools to act as front-ends to these engines for testing and debugging.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, NYS took {{possession}} of five leased CEFX locomotives, {{to ease the}} railroad's continually worsening power shortage. These five locomotives were used {{as a supplement to}} its current EMD 645 fleet in road train service, and occasionally local duty. It was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see road train line-ups consisting of entirely leased power.|$|E

50|$|The braconid wasp Rhaconotus fasciatus is {{the only}} {{recorded}} parasitoid of the rhubarb curculio. As stated, only a single larva develops to maturity in hosts other than rhubarb; it is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon,</b> however, <b>to</b> find several young larvae in the stalk of a host plant, indicating that the larvae may be cannibalistic.|$|R
50|$|Shaqlawa has a Mediterranean climate (Csa) {{with very}} hot summers and {{relatively}} cold, wet winters. Subfreezing highs are {{very common in}} the winter, which would present frost.
