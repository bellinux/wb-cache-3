50|$|The {{constricted}} {{nature of}} {{the interior of the}} molecular complex strongly favors compact molecular conformations of the substrate protein. Free in solution, long-range, non-polar interactions can only occur at a high cost in entropy. In the close quarters of the GroEL complex, the relative loss of entropy is much smaller. The method of capture also tends to concentrate the non-polar binding sites separately from the polar sites. When the GroEL non-polar surfaces are removed, the chance that any given <b>non-polar</b> <b>group</b> will encounter a non-polar intramolecular site are much greater than in bulk solution. The hydrophobic sites which were on the outside are gathered together {{at the top of the}} cis domain and bind each other. The geometry of GroEL requires that the polar structures lead, and they envelop the non-polar core as it emerges from the trans side.|$|E
40|$|Since Kauzmann's seminal 1959 paper, the {{hydrophobic}} interaction has dominated {{thinking on the}} forces that control protein folding and stability. Despite its wide importance in chemistry and biology, our understanding of this interaction {{at the molecular level}} remains poor, with little experimental evidence to support the idea of water ordering close to a <b>non-polar</b> <b>group</b> that is at the centre of the standard model for the source of the entropic driving force. Developments over recent years in neutron techniques now enable us to see directly how a <b>non-polar</b> <b>group</b> actually affects the molecular structure of the water in its immediate neighbourhood. On the basis of such work on aqueous solutions of small alcohols, the generally accepted standard model is found to be wanting, and alternative sources of the entropic driving force are suggested. Moreover, the fact that we can now follow changes in hydrogen bonding as the alcohol concentration is varied gives us the possibility of explaining the concentration dependence of the enthalpy of mixing. Complementary studies of solute association on the mesoscopic scale show a rich concentration and temperature behaviour, which reflects a complex balance of polar and non-polar interactions.

40|$|Unlike c-plane {{nitrides}}, ``non-polar" nitrides {{grown in}} e. g. the a-plane or m-plane orientation encounter anisotropic in-plane strain {{due to the}} anisotropy in the lattice and thermal mismatch with the substrate or buffer layer.

40|$|Supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} (scCO 2) is an {{environmental}} friendly solvent for various chemical processes. In many cases scCO 2 {{is unable to}} replace organic solvents due to the low solubility of most polar and ionic materials in dense CO 2. Highly CO 2 soluble fluorinated polymers have been successfully designed but they are expensive and environmentally persistent. This project aims developing a non-fluorous compound which dissolves in CO 2 and thickens CO 2, thereby improving the performance CO 2 flooding enhanced oil recovery. An {{attempt was made to}} generate CO 2 -thickeners containing a CO 2 -phile that promotes dissolution and a CO 2 -phobe that induces viscosity-enhancing intermolecular associations. The initial research was directed at identifying the most CO 2 -philic hydrocarbon-based polymer. Subsequently, associating groups would be incorporated. Small sugar acetates are known to be extremely CO 2 -soluble, but polymeric cellulose triacetate is CO 2 -insoluble due to its crystallinity. Therefore a high molecular weight, low melting point polymer with per-acetylated monosaccharide side chains, poly (1 -O-(vinyloxy) ethyl - 2, 3, 4, 6 - tetra -O - acetyl - β - D - glucopyranoside), P(AcGIcVE) was synthesized. This polymer is second most CO 2 -soluble hydrocarbon-based polymer and is slightly less CO 2 -soluble than PVAc. Amorphous poly(lactic acid) has also been shown to be highly CO 2 soluble over a broad range of molecular weight. The pressure required for dissolution greatly exceeds that associated with PVAc or P(AcGIcVE), therefore PLA is the third most soluble polymer in CO 2. Oligo(vinyl acetate) is a particularly effective CO 2 -phile. Poly(vinyl acetate), PVAc, remains the most CO 2 -soluble high molecular weight, non-fluorous polymer that has yet been identified. PVAc was selected as the base polymer for a copolymeric thickener. A pendant phenyl group was selected for viscosity-enhancing intermolecular associations because this mildly CO 2 -phobic <b>non-polar</b> <b>group</b> was so effectively used for this purpose in a fluorinated CO 2 thickener previously designed by our group. Promising results were obtained with poly(vinyl acetate-co-vinyl benzoate 5 %). The viscosity of CO 2 increased by roughly 40 % at a copolymer concentration of 1 wt% and by 80 % at 2 wt%, at shear rates of 6200 - 5080 s- 1 at 298 K. Therefore poly (vinyl acetate-co-vinyl benzoate 5 %) is the first documented non-fluorous CO 2 thickener capable of increasing the CO 2 viscosity substantially at dilute concentrations of ~ 1 wt%. Unfortunately, the pressure required to dissolve this copolymer in CO 2 at 298 K (~ 65 MPa) greatly exceeds the MMP (Minimum Miscibility Pressure) of CO 2 floods at the same temperature (~ 10 MPa). Because {{we were not able to}} identify a hydrocarbon-based polymer more CO 2 -philic than PVAc, it is doubtful that a non-fluorous, copolymeric thickener capable of dissolving in CO 2 at practical CO 2 flooding pressure conditions can be identified. The only other non-fluorous polymer known to be more CO 2 -soluble than PVAc is polydimethyl siloxane PDMS. Therefore, we evaluated three commercially available PDMS polymer with pendant phenyl groups. Two PDMS-based copolymers, poly(phenyl methyl siloxane) 10 %-co-(dimethylsiloxane) (Mw = 90, 000 and 17000) were commercially available from Gelest. Neither was soluble in CO 2 and copolymers with lesser degrees of phenyl methyl siloxane were not available. An attempt was also made to design small molecules as thickeners. The first CO 2 soluble non-fluorous, acetylated hydrogen-binding compound and the first CO 2 soluble non-fluorous dendrimer were synthesized. It was postulated that these compounds would dissolve in CO 2 and then form linear macromolecules due to the hydrogen bonding between adjacent molecules. Critical features of these small, self-assembling molecules are the presence of strong and directional hydrogen bonding interactions between carbonyl oxygen and hydrogen in a bis-urea moiety, and the presence of multiple (two or four) highly acetylated "arms" on the periphery of the molecule that promote dissolution in CO 2. Although the first non-fluorous, CO 2 -soluble hydrogen bonding compound (two arms) and hydrogen-bonding dendrimer (four arms) were designed, neither thickened CO 2. The hydrogen bonding compound with two arms did form brittle, microfibrillar, free-standing foams upon the removal of the CO 2...|$|E

30|$|The {{adsorption}} of dye usually occurs {{by three}} main mechanisms: electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding.

40|$|As alcohol {{molecules}} such as methanol and ethanol {{have both}} polar and <b>non-polar</b> <b>groups,</b> their adsorption behavior {{is governed by}} the contributions of dispersion interaction (alkyl group) and hydrogen bonding (OH group). In this paper, the adsorption behavior of alcohol molecules {{and its effect on}} transport processes are elucidated. From the total permeability (B-T) of alcohol molecules in activated carbon, an adsorption mechanism is proposed, describing well the experimental data, by taking combination effects of clustering, entering micropores, layering and pore filling processes. Unlike the case of non-polar compounds, it was found that at low pressures there are two rises in the BT of alcohol molecules in activated carbon. The first rise is due to the major contribution of surface diffusion to the transport (which is the case of non-polar molecules) and the second one may be associated with cluster formation at the edge of micropores and entering micropores when the clusters are sufficiently large enough to induce a dispersive energy. In addition the clusters formed may enhance surface diffusion at low pressures and hinder gas phase diffusion and flow in meso/macropores. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved...|$|R

The BF 4 - anion presented the greatest HLC values followed by NO 3 -, Br- PF 6 - and finally the [octylsulfate]- as lowest HLC values. The increases of DCCILs concentration always use to decrease the HLC values for all presented anions. The outcomes of this work were systematically pointed to the possibility of DCCILS solubility in water. In addition the study identified and classified the selected anions and the cation alkyl chain in terms of their contribution to improve the CO 2 solubility in DCCILs...|$|R

This state of self-cleaning {{is supported by}} the even, nano-rough gel-coated epidermal surface of the skin. In the present study we focussed on the topographic evolution of gel formation and the chemical composition of the gel smoothing the skin surface of the pilot whale, Globicephala melas. We employed photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in combination with cryo-scanning electron microscopy (CSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the superficial layer of the epidermis, stratum corneum, intercellular material was shown by electron optical methods to assemble from smaller into larger covalently cross-linked aggregates during the transit of the corneocytes towards the skin surface. Employing XPS measurements, the surface of the skin and the intercellular gel included in approximately the same amount polar groups (especially, free amines and amides) and <b>non-polar</b> <b>groups</b> corresponding to the presence of lipid droplets dispersed within the jelly material. It was concluded from the results obtained that the gel-coat of the skin surface is a chemically heterogeneous skin product. The advantages of chemically heterogeneous patches contributing to the ablation of traces of the biofouling process are discussed...|$|R
