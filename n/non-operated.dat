40|$|The US Senate Committee that {{investigated}} the Enron disaster assessed {{the role of}} analysts. At issue was whether analysts misled the public by ignoring warning signals that included {{a high proportion of}} <b>non-operating</b> income. <b>Non-operating</b> income derives from secondary activities like investments, but operating income is from the primary business activities like manufacturing. While the analysts admitted their limited ability to forecast Enron’s earnings, they denied any intentional deceit and claimed that they were misled by Enron. This study asks whether analysts’ ability to predict earnings is generally negatively associated with the proportion of <b>non-operating</b> income. The rationale is to determine whether the limited ability of analysts to predict earnings for Enron was an isolated incident or a pervasive one that applies to other firms. If pervasive, then another such disaster could occur without a warning from analysts. First, I examine the incentives for firms to resort more to <b>non-operating</b> income rather than focus on Operating income. Then I examine the association between analysts’ forecast attributes and the ratio of nonoperating to operating income. The results show that <b>non-operating</b> income and operating income are negatively associated, suggesting that firms use <b>non-operating</b> income to manage their operating results. Also, analysts’ forecast inaccuracy and dispersion are positively associated with the ratio of <b>non-operating</b> income to operating income. These results imply that analysts are generally inefficient in predicting earnings of firms with a high proportion of <b>non-operating</b> income. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) injuries {{are one of}} the most common traumatic injuries among physically active. ACL injuries are the largest isolated problem in orthopedic sports medicine. Many studies have found that a previous injury of the lower limb itself causes an increased risk of a new knee injury. To evaluate rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction and to assess whether the active is ready to return to sport a combination of strength tests, functional jump tests and any form of self-assessment score are generally used. The person must achieve 90 - 100 % of the <b>non-operated</b> leg function to be approved as ready to return to sport. To maintain good knee function, it seems to be important to continue specific training for the operated leg even after return to sport. Purpose: To investigate the difference in strength and in jump-performance that exists between the operated and <b>non-operated</b> leg, four to seven years after ACL-reconstruction. Method: Seventeen subjects who have undergone ACL reconstruction four to seven years ago were included in the study. Strength in quadriceps and hamstrings were measured by one repetition maximum, and jump performance were measured in one-legged long jump test. Comparisons were made for the operated and <b>non-operated</b> leg. Results: Operated leg performed with significantly lower than the <b>non-operated</b> leg. For the quadriceps, the operated leg performed on average 45 (SD 13) kg compared to 57 (SD 13) kg in <b>non-operated</b> leg. The difference was significant (p= 0, 047). Hamstrings in operated leg performed on average 28, 8 (SD 6) kg compared with 38, 6 (SD 7, 5) kg in <b>non-operated</b> leg, the difference was significant (p= 0, 030). In the one-legged long jump test, the operated leg performed in averaged 131 (SD 20) cm compared with 151 (SD 18) cm in <b>non-operated</b> leg, the difference was significant (p= 0, 021). Conclusion: ACL-reconstructed subjects who achieved satisfying results after rehabilitation seems to impair in knee function in the operated leg regarding strength and jump-function 4 - 7 years after ACL-reconstruction.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze a group of <b>non-operated</b> patients admitted to our surgical ward for incidence and type of documented complication. We classified and categorised these complications according to the definition of the Association of Surgeons of the Netherlands (ASN). Our main interest was to identify adverse events for <b>non-operated</b> patients that are caused by medical management and thus preventable. Methods Complications were prospectively collected in our registry, which is part of an electronic medical patient file, and in retrospective analysed. All <b>non-operated</b> patients admitted to our surgical ward between January 2003 and January 2006 have been analysed for type and incidence of complications. Results We recorded 437 complications in 364 (8 %) of 4602 <b>non-operated</b> patients and we categorised 196 (45 %) of these events in the Hospital - Provider group. In this last category 161 (82 %) events were related to medical management and appeared to be preventable. Numerous different types of complications were recorded (n = 69) among the 437 events. Of all the complications, 75 (17 %) were found to be a negative effect/failure of therapy. Conclusion The incidence of complications in <b>non-operated</b> patients at our surgical ward was 8 %, with a great variety in types of events documented. Almost half of all complications (45 %) were recorded in the Hospital-Provider category and appeared to be preventable, which needs further investigation. </p...|$|E

Thirty patients with advanced megaesophagus underwent the Serra Doria operation (operated group) and 15 patients were not submitted to surgery (<b>non-operated</b> group). the esophageal mucosa was evaluated by macroscopy and histologic examinations. in the operated group, 21, five and four patients with mild, moderate and severe esophagitis, respectively, were identified by endoscopy. in the <b>non-operated</b> group, 4 and 11 patients had moderate and severe esophagitis, respectively. the histologic examinations identified 19, six and five specimens with mild, moderate and severe esophagitis, respectively, in the operated group as opposed to one, three and 11 specimens with mild, moderate and severe esophagitis, respectively, in the <b>non-operated</b> group. the prevalence of severe esophagitis was high in the <b>non-operated</b> group while, after the Serra Doria operation, mild esophagitis was prevalent.
