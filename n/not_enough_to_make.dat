25|$|In 1642 the English Civil War began. King Charles {{realised}} {{the value}} of the Tyne coal trade and therefore garrisoned Newcastle. A Royalist was appointed as governor. At that time, Newcastle and King's Lynn were the only important seaports to support the crown. In 1644 Parliament blockaded the Tyne to prevent the king from receiving revenue from the Tyne coal trade. Coal exports fell from 450,000 to 3,000 tons and London suffered a hard winter without fuel. Parliament encouraged the coal trade from the Wear to try to replace that lost from Newcastle but that was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for the lost Tyneside tonnage.|$|E
25|$|Game Revolution {{argued that}} if the {{multiplayer}} was taken away, even the new campaign was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Battlefront II worth the buy. IGN claimed that the game suffers from problems remaining from the original Battlefront, such {{as a lack of}} challenging AI characters in single player mode. Computer-controlled opponents and allies tend to run headlong into gunfire, wander off ledges, and walk into walls. IGN felt that these, along with redundant use of planets featured in previous Star Wars settings, were problems carried over from the original. X-Play hosts Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb gave the game a 4 out of 5, but criticized the online multiplayer.|$|E

25|$|She {{suffered}} a foot injury in 2008, which affected her performances {{early in the}} season. She recovered somewhat {{in time for the}} 2008 Ibero-American Championships and was the silver medallist behind Rosa Rodríguez. She had a best mark of 66.35m at the 2008 Summer Olympics, leaving her as the best South American performer but in 29th place overall. She had a below par performance at the 2009 South American Championships in Athletics, throwing 63.81m for the bronze medal. Despite this, she was also the best South American performer in the hammer at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, where her throw of 68.90m was good enough for 17th, but <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the final round.|$|E
25|$|After {{the initial}} {{conflicts}} {{between the state and}} the new emerging religion, Gallienus (ruled 253 to 260) was the first emperor to issue an edict of toleration for all religious creeds including Christianity. According to Christian polemicists writing after his death, Constantine I was baptized on his deathbed, which would make him the first emperor to become a baptized Christian. Eusebius, a contemporary Christian historian, also praises him for having some pagan temples torn down. Nevertheless, whatever the imperial edicts said, the effects of policy under the Christian emperors down to Valentinian I and Valens were enough to cause a widespread trend to Christian conversion, but <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> paganism extinct. Actual persecution was sporadic and generally the result of local initiative, for example Martin of Tours' destructions of holy sites in Gaul in the later fourth century. Official orders may have established an understanding that actual persecution would be tolerated, but in the first century of official Christianity did not generally organize it.|$|E
25|$|She was the runner-up at the 2002 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships behind Mary Sauer and {{improved}} her outdoor best to 4.50m.

The 2004 season proved to be her breakthrough year as she was runner-up to Stacy Dragila at the USA Indoor Championships and then placed fourth at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships, vaulting a personal best mark of 4.60m. She achieved the same mark outdoors to take second at the Prefontaine Classic and was runner-up to Dragila at the 2004 Olympic Trials, securing her first Olympic berth. She cleared 4.30m in the qualifying rounds of the 2004 Athens Olympics, but this was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the final.|$|E
