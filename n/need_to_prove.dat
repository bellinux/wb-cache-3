5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
25|$|Finally, he {{discusses}} how both religious experience {{and belief in}} God is, and has always been, normative among humans: people do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the existence of God. If there is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove,</b> Hinman argues, and the Trace of God (for instance, the impact of mystical experiences on them), belief in God is rationally warranted.|$|E

25|$|Stock issues: In {{order for}} the affirmative team to win, their plan must retain all of the stock issues, which are Harms, Inherency, Solvency, Topicality, and Significance. For the {{negative}} to win, they only <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that the affirmative fails to meet one of the stock issues. These judges {{are more likely to}} dislike newer arguments such as kritiks and some theoretical points.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Benjamin Fondane {{eventually}} left Romania for France, {{spurred on by}} the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself {{within a}} different cultural context. He {{was at the time}} interested in the success of Dada, an avant-garde movement launched abroad by the Romanian-born author Tristan Tzara, in collaboration with several others. Not dissuaded by the fact that his sister and brother-in-law (the Pascals) had returned impoverished from an extended stay in Paris, Fondane crossed Europe by train and partly by foot.|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 2013, US Federal Judge Clark Waddoups {{ruled in}} Brown v.

Unlawful cohabitation, where prosecutors did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), had been the primary tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 Edmunds Act.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the losses}} of the Latvian {{government}} in the cases Podkolzina v. Latvia (ECHR) and Ignatāne v. Latvia (UN HRC), {{a certain level of}} command in Latvian was asked for eligibility to Parliament and local councils. In practice, this had led to re-examinations of various candidates, at least sometimes unexpected, which prevented Ignatāne and Podkolzina (representatives of the Equal Rights party in the 1997 local and 1998 parliamentary elections) from participation. As of 2011, candidates do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> language proficiency, but elected members of Saeima and local councilors can be deprived of mandate for insufficient command of Latvian.|$|E
25|$|Some of Ron's qualities {{serve as}} foils to Harry. While Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron {{comes from a}} loving but poor family; many of his {{possessions}} are hand-me-downs. Harry is famous but would prefer to avoid the spotlight; Ron, in comparison, is often perceived as a mere lackey and sometimes becomes jealous of the recognition Harry receives. Finally, Ron is the most mediocre of his siblings, being (as of the first book) neither an excellent Quidditch player, a noteworthy student, nor the daughter his mother always wanted. All of these factors combined cause Ron to feel insecure; Ron's inferiority complex and his <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself, is {{the main thrust of}} his character arc.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, in Germany, the {{relation}} between individual employees and employers {{is considered to be}} asymmetrical. In consequence, many working conditions are not negotiable due to a strong legal protection of individuals. However, the German flavor or works legislation has as its main objective to create a balance of power between employees organized in unions and employers organized in employers associations. This allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining, compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations. As a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade union, employee associations <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a counterforce in negotiations with employers. If such an employees association is competing against another union, its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial. In Germany, only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and working conditions for their members, notably the medical doctors association Marburger Bund and the pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit. The engineers association Verein Deutscher Ingenieure does not strive to act as a union, as it also represents the interests of engineering businesses.|$|E

25|$|Early English {{common law}} had, in many instances, imposed {{liability}} {{on those who}} had caused harm regardless of wrongful intent or negligence. Trespass was considered a remedy for all tortious wrongs, and sometimes used as a synonym for torts generally. Over the centuries, however, judges focused more on the intent and negligence behind the actions than {{the nature of the}} actions themselves, leading to the development of negligence and nuisance and the further development of trespass. At the time of Rylands, the previous case relied upon was Vaughan v Menlove, decided in the Court of Common Pleas in 1837. The case had almost identical facts to Rylands, but strict liability was never even considered. The case is instead thought of {{as one of the best}} attempts of early 19th Century English judges to build up the law of negligence. The outcome of Rylands meant that judges would again impose strict liability on defendants who accumulated dangerous things on their land without any <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> negligence or wrongful intent. The decision won support for bringing the law relating to private reservoirs up to standard with the law relating to public reservoirs, which contained similar statutory provisions thanks to a pair of private Acts of Parliament passed in 1853 and 1864.|$|E

500|$|Respondents {{argued that}} finding {{employers}} liable for factual mistakes would place substantial costs upon employers. The Court rejected this argument, saying that an employee would still <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the employer acted {{out of an}} improper motive. Referring to Heffernan's case and those like it, the Court said that [...] "the employee will, if anything, find {{it more difficult to}} prove that motive, for the employee will have to point to more than his own conduct to show an employer's intent".|$|E
500|$|Thio Li-ann has {{expressed}} {{the view that}} Phang J.A.'s approach in Eng Foong Ho leaves room for judicial clarification. An important {{question is whether the}} [...] "intentional and arbitrary discrimination" [...] test, which implies the lack of any rationality, is the sole test for proving that an executive act violates Article 12, or only one possible test. If it is the only test, then the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the absence of rationality is excessively onerous for the plaintiff to satisfy, compared to the [...] "reasonable classification" [...] test. She posits that it is preferable for both the [...] "intentional and arbitrary discrimination" [...] test and the [...] "reasonable classification" [...] test to apply to executive acts.|$|E
500|$|Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork panned the release, {{saying that}} [...] " [...] life as portrayed in this {{documentary}} is cloistered and withdrawn, marked by hours of quiet Kabbalah study but very little self-reflection. Whether intentionally or not, Åkerlund reveals Madonna's supreme lack of self-awareness, from her embarrassing attempts at poetry to the condescending tone she takes with her dancers to her incredibly irresponsible visit to Rachel's Tomb despite the warnings of her host country and her security team." [...] He ended the review noting that Madonna did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> anything further, since her songs [...] "have become a shared language {{among people who}} have very little common ground. Her music has been changing the world {{for more than two}} decades now, but sadly she seems unaware of this, her one true 'secret' to pop cultural unity." ...|$|E

500|$|More {{mixed reviews}} were {{critical}} of Diamandis' vocal delivery. Lou Thomas from BBC Music commented that [...] "he consistently diverting changes in style across the album are fine—the wonky 80s shoulder-pad pop of 'The Outsider' {{is nothing like}} anything else here, for example. But over 13 songs of Sparks-voice and many similar staccato piano riffs listeners may feel bludgeoned by Marina and her slightly overbearing presence", concluding that her eccentric vocals would polarise opinions. Sean O'Neal wrote on The A.V. Club that after [...] "dozens of squeaky Regina Spektor-ish enunciations" [...] and [...] "Kate Bush trills", the [...] "overbearing <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> herself just ends up being exhausting". Joe Rivers of No Ripcord praised [...] "Are You Satisfied?", [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "Oh No!" [...] but was put off by sudden [...] "howling" [...] in [...] "Hermit the Frog" [...] and a [...] "throaty growl" [...] in [...] "The Outsider".|$|E
500|$|Shakur {{was convicted}} on all eight counts: two murder charges, and six assault charges. The {{prosecution}} did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Trooper Foerster or Zayd Shakur: being an accomplice to murder carries an equivalent life sentence under New Jersey law. Upon hearing the verdict, Shakur said—in a [...] "barely audible voice"—that she was [...] "ashamed that I have even {{taken part in}} this trial" [...] and that the jury was [...] "racist" [...] and had [...] "convicted a woman with her hands up". Judge Appleby told the court attendants to [...] "remove the prisoner" [...] and Shakur replied: [...] "the prisoner will walk away on her own feet". After Joseph W. Lewis, the jury foreman, read the verdict, Kunstler asked that the jury be removed before alleging that one juror had violated the sequestration order (see above).|$|E
500|$|Statewide laws {{or school}} board {{decisions}} regarding team names and mascots have passed {{in states with}} significant Native American populations; including California (2015), Colorado (2014), Oregon (2012), and Michigan (2012). However, opposing the trend for change, {{in response to the}} Tennessee Commission of Indian Affairs seeking a ban though the Tennessee Human Rights Commission, the Tennessee Senate passed a law allowing only elected officials to take any action banning school teams using American Indian names and symbols. The Wisconsin law passed in 2010 meant to eliminate [...] "race-based nicknames, logos and mascots" [...] was revised in 2013 making change much more difficult. In the original law, a single individual could file a complaint with the burden of proof on the school to defend their mascot, in the new law a petition signed by 10% of the school district residents is needed, and the petitioners <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> discrimination.|$|E
