Non-response bias {{can be a}} problem if responders differ from non-responders for the measured variables. For example, nonresponders may not have been contacted because they work multiple minimum-wage jobs. [...] Various techniques are used to reduce the <b>non-response</b> <b>rate,</b> such as multiple call attempts, monetary incentives, advance letters, and leaving messages on answering machines, because reducing the <b>non-response</b> <b>rate</b> may directly reduce non-response bias.

Demographers David Graham and Stanley Waterman give several reasons: the underenumeration for censuses in general; the question did not record secular Jews; the voluntary nature of the question; suspicion by Jews of such questions; and the high <b>non-response</b> <b>rate</b> for large numbers of Haredi Jews.

50|$|In {{terms of}} the 2011 National Household Survey, there was Global <b>Non-Response</b> <b>rate</b> of 21.7% which means that only 25.8% of the {{population}} completed the survey. This number is actually higher than the 20% response rate of the 2006 Long Form census, however due to the voluntary nature of the census, the data is not as reliable compared to the mandatory long form census of 2006. This is because when it is a voluntary census rather one required by law, {{there is a high}} chance of non-response bias especially as the GNR grows larger which means that there is a higher chance that those who are responding to the voluntary survey is not completely randomized. In comparison to Canada, which has a GNR of 26.1%, and Ontario, which has a GNR of 27.1%, CT5350065.0 has a lower GNR rate which that there may be less of a non-response bias.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} was to solve two problems of an already validated scale measuring inpatient opinion on care: 1) a high <b>non-response</b> <b>rate</b> for some items due to the "not applicable" response option and 2) a skewed score distribution with high ceiling effect. Methods The EQS-H scale ("échelle de qualité des soins en hospitalisation") comprised 26 items and 2 sub-scales of 13 items each, 'quality of medical information' (MI) and 'relationships with staff and daily routine' (RS). Three studies were conducted: a first mono-centre study (n = 552, response rate = 83. 4 %, self-completion of the scale the day before discharge) to construct a shorter version of the scale without the items with high <b>non-response</b> <b>rate</b> and maintaining those useful to ensure good internal validity (construct, convergent and divergent) and reliability; a second mono-centre study (n = 1246, response rate = 77. 9 %, self-completion of the scale before discharge) to confirm {{psychometric properties of the}} new version; a third multi-centre national study (n = 886, response rate 41. 7 %, self-completion at home 15 days after discharge) to test a new response pattern in order to reduce ceiling effect. Results Six items having a <b>non-response</b> <b>rate</b> > 20 % were deleted, increasing rates of exhaustive response to all items from 15 % to 48 %. Factorial analysis supported the evidence for removing 4 more items to ensure good internal validity and reliability of the new version. These good results (initial variance explained: 43 %; Cronbach's α: 0. 80 (MI) and 0. 81 (RS)) were confirmed by the second study. The new response format produced a normalisation of the 2 scores with a large decrease in ceiling effect (25 % to 4 % for MI subscale and 61 % to 8 % for RS). Psychometric properties of the final version were excellent: the 2 subscales (8 items each) explained 66 % of the variance in principal component analysis, Cronbach's α were respectively 0. 92 (MI) and 0. 93 (RS). Conclusion The new version of the EQS-H has better psychometric properties than the previous one. Rates of missing values are lower, and score distribution is normalized. An English version of this scale focused on quality of medical information delivered and on relationship with staff already exists, and this could be useful to conduct cross-cultural studies of health care service quality. </p...|$|E
