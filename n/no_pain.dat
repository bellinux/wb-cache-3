5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they will usually be asked to estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> and 10 being the worst pain they have ever felt). Some patients, however, may be unable to give verbal feedback about their pain. In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as moaning.|$|E
5|$|When tumors compress, invade or inflame {{parts of}} the nervous system (such as the brain, spinal cord, nerves, ganglia or plexa), they can cause pain and other symptoms. Though brain tissue {{contains}} <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> sensors, brain tumors can cause pain by pressing on blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the meninges), or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid (edema) that may compress pain-sensitive tissue.|$|E
5|$|Apical abscesses {{can spread}} to involve {{periodontal}} pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E

5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms can vary. Some {{patients}} have lower often recurring abdominal pain or pelvic pain, while {{others may be}} asymptomatic. As tubal function is impeded, infertility is a common symptom. Patients who {{are not trying to}} get pregnant and have <b>no</b> <b>pain,</b> may go undetected.|$|E
60|$|Tavernake was not sociably {{inclined}} {{and took}} <b>no</b> <b>pains</b> {{to conceal the}} fact. Mr. Pritchard, however, was not easily to be shaken off.|$|R

25|$|Shoeing, when {{performed}} correctly, causes <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> to the animal. Farriers {{trim the}} insensitive {{part of the}} hoof, {{which is the same}} area into which they drive the nails. This is analogous to a manicure on a human fingernail, only on a much larger scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} anesthetic, ether, {{may have been}} {{synthesized}} {{as early as the}} 8th century, but it took many centuries for its anesthetic importance to be appreciated, even though the 16th century physician and polymath Paracelsus noted that chickens made to breathe it not only fell asleep but also felt <b>no</b> <b>pain.</b> By the early 19th century, ether was being used by humans, but only as a recreational drug.|$|E
25|$|Albert {{explains}} that the place they occupy is called Summerland. Being {{a state of mind}} rather than a physical location, Summerland is practically endless and takes the form of the inhabitants' wishes and desires. There is <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> or death, but people maintain occupations of sorts and perform leisure activities. The book depicts Summerland at length, through Chris's eyes. Chris feels somehow uneasy, haunted by nightmares ending in Ann's death. Soon he learns that Ann has killed herself.|$|E

25|$|Another {{claim was}} {{put forth by}} a young boy who stated {{that he had been}} hit by a small (~3-gram) stone of the Mbale {{meteorite}} fall from Uganda, and who stood to gain nothing from this assertion. The stone reportedly fell through banana leaves before striking the boy on the head, causing little to <b>no</b> <b>pain,</b> as it was small enough to have been slowed by both friction with the atmosphere as well as that with banana leaves, before striking the boy.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 erythromelalgia {{became the}} first human {{disorder}} {{in which it has}} been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic pain; when its pathophysiology was initially published in the Journal of Medical Genetics. Conversely, in December 2006 a University of Cambridge team reported an SCN9A mutation that resulted in a complete lack of pain sensation in a Pakistani street performer and some of his family members. He felt <b>no</b> <b>pain,</b> walked on hot coals and stabbed himself to entertain crowds.|$|E
25|$|Studies and {{experiments}} cited on the Jewish {{internet site}} Chabad.org include one conducted in 1994 by Dr. Temple Grandin - an Associate Professor of Animal Science at Colorado and a study completed in 1992 by Dr. Flemming Bager, Head of the Danish Veterinary Laboratory, {{which showed that}} when the animals were slaughtered in a comfortable position they appeared to give no resistance {{and none of the}} animals attempted to pull away their head. The studies concluded that the animals had <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> and were not even aware that their throats were cut.|$|E

25|$|Glaucoma is a {{group of}} eye {{diseases}} which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is open-angle glaucoma with less common types including closed-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is <b>no</b> <b>pain.</b> Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent.|$|E
25|$|Vibrational therapy {{by way of}} {{sinusoidal}} (high-frequency oscillating) {{electric current}} was discovered by Kellogg in 1884 to have medical use for increasing blood circulation and passive exercise. In particular, Kellogg invented a vibrating chair used to stimulate vital organs in the lower abdomen. Even today one can visit the Kellogg Discovery Center in Battle Creek, Michigan, and sit on Kellogg's vibrating chair, which is equipped to mechanically oscillate 20 times per second. Furthermore, Kellogg devised an electrotherapy exercise bed in which a sinusoidal current that produced muscular contraction but <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> could be delivered for twenty minutes and reportedly achieve the stimulation of a brisk four-mile walk.|$|E
25|$|The skin {{of naked}} mole-rats lacks a key {{neurotransmitter}} called substance P {{that is responsible}} in mammals for sending pain signals to the central nervous system. As a result, the naked mole-rats feel <b>no</b> <b>pain,</b> {{even when they are}} exposed to acid or capsaicin. When they are injected with substance P, however, the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals, but only with capsaicin and not with acids. This is proposed to be an adaptation to the animal living in high levels of carbon dioxide due to poorly ventilated living spaces, which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues.|$|E

25|$|The {{two would}} meet again {{three months later}} in England for RQW's 2007 <b>No</b> <b>Pain,</b> No Gain event {{challenging}} Eden Black for the RQW Women's Championship but both came up short. The match served to build up interest for the aforementioned ChickFight VII: The UK vs The USA where Melissa would secure a victory against Black. She also beat MsChif in the semi-final. At RQW's Taking On The World the three met again with MsChif and Black teaming up in a losing effort against Anderson and Black's nemesis Jetta. In May 2008 MsChif put her NWA World Women's Championship on the line during Pro Wrestling Revolution's debut show but Anderson did not win the belt.|$|E
25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to comfort him and get information. Because the medics had <b>no</b> <b>pain</b> relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E
25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt <b>no</b> <b>pain,</b> and {{the indignity of}} their situations was directly related to easing {{the pain of the}} living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E
