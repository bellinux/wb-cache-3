500|$|Fincher said Fight Club was {{a coming}} of age film, like the 1967 film The Graduate but for people in their 30s. Fincher {{described}} the Narrator as an [...] "everyman"; the character is identified in the script as [...] "Jack", but left unnamed in the film. Fincher outlined the Narrator's background: [...] "He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried {{to fit into the}} world by becoming the thing he isn't." [...] The Narrator cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must [...] "kill" [...] his parents, his god, and his teacher. At the start of the film, he has [...] "killed off" [...] his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to [...] "kill off" [...] his teacher, Tyler Durden.|$|E
500|$|At the party, Peter dresses up as [...] "Pee Pants the Inebriated Hobo Clown", [...] "an adorable tramp {{who wears}} found {{clothing}} and eats {{out of your}} garbage can". Peter then tells Meg that he got her a scarf for her birthday. Meg declines, while Peter then says he got her [...] "a dozen scarves" [...] which Peter then proceeds to regurgitate as one long scarf, as he has actually tied and swallowed them (which Lois says he was <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do).</b> This causes him to cough and vomit. Peter hands Meg the long scarf from his tongue, but Meg refuses to hold it. Peter then urges Meg to hold them, and then asks if his long johns {{are tied to the}} end of them. When Meg says they are not, Peter then says [...] "Oh, god" [...] and regurgitates them as well, and then crouches in pain following the ordeal. Meg asks Lois if she can open her gifts, and Meg notices Stewie opening most of them. Peter gets drunk, and attempts to ride a unicycle down the steps, but falls off and crushes his father, Francis, who later dies in the hospital from the accident. Just before Francis dies, he calls Peter [...] "a fat stinking drunk".|$|E

5000|$|The {{duties of}} ladies-in-waiting at the Tudor court were {{to act as}} companions in public and in private; to {{accompany}} her wherever she went; to entertain her with music, dance or singing; and to dress her, bathe her and help her use the lavatory, as a royal person, {{by the standards of}} the day, was <b>not</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything by themselves, but was always to be waited upon in all daily tasks as a sign of their status. [...] Ladies-in-waiting were appointed by recommendation of their social status as members of the nobility, court officials, knights and military officers; and because they were expected to be supporters of the dynasty or the royal woman because of their relatives. When the queen was not a foreigner, her relatives were often appointed as they were presumed to be trustworthy and loyal; Lady Margaret Lee was a Lady of the Privy Chamber to Queen Anne Boleyn, just as Lady Elizabeth Seymour-Cromwell was to Queen Jane Seymour. [...] The organization of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting was set in the period of the Tudor court. The ladies-in-waiting were headed by the Mistress of the Robes, followed in rank by the First Lady of the Bedchamber, who supervised the group of Lady of the Bedchamber (typically wives or widows of peers above the rank of earl), in turn followed by the group of Woman of the Bedchamber (usually a daughter of a peer) and finally the group of Maid of honour, whose service entitled them to the style of The Honourable for life. The system has formally remained roughly the same since the Tudor period. However, in practice, many offices have since then been left vacant. For example, in recent times, Maids of Honour have only been appointed for coronations.|$|R

60|$|So, in the night, {{when the}} men in the fort were asleep, White Fang applied his teeth to the stick that held him. The wood was {{seasoned}} and dry, and it was tied so closely to his neck that he could scarcely get his teeth to it. It was only by the severest muscular exertion and neck- arching that he succeeded in getting the wood between his teeth, and barely between his teeth at that; and it was only by the exercise of an immense patience, extending through many hours, that he succeeded in gnawing through the stick. This was something that dogs were <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It was unprecedented. But White Fang did it, trotting away from the fort in the early morning, {{with the end of the}} stick hanging to his neck.|$|E

6000|$|When he {{was just}} {{on the point of}} driving off Whittle arrived with a note badly addressed, and bearing the word [...] "immediate" [...] upon the outside. On opening it he was {{surprised}} to see that it was unsigned. It contained a brief request that he would go to Weatherbury that evening about some business which he was conducting there. Farfrae knew nothing that could make it pressing; but as he was bent upon going out he yielded to the anonymous request, particularly as he had a call to make at Mellstock which could be included in the same tour. Thereupon he told Whittle of his change of direction, in words which Henchard had overheard, and set out on his way. Farfrae had not directed his man to take the message indoors, and Whittle had <b>not</b> been <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so on his own responsibility.|$|R
40|$|Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew is the {{portrayal}} of women's behaviour which is <b>not</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b> Shakespeare tried <b>to</b> disclose women's bad temper through the character of Katherina, a shrew. In this thesis, the writer would like {{to find out whether}} or not Katherina's language reflects her character. Katherina's language before her character change is reflected in her use of coarse language which includes taboo words, sarcasms, and impolite terms of address. In changing Katherina's character, Shakespeare used the character Petruchio who finally succeeded in taming her bad habit. Through sociolinguistic approach the writer of this thesis tries to analyze the social factors of her conversations. The writer would like to prove that Katherina's character change is refelcted in the change of her language. Katherina's language after her character change is reflected in the use of refined language - euphony, and formal terms of address. Her use of refined language shows that she has totally changed, from shrewish to unshrewish...|$|R
60|$|That we can {{comprehend}} such cause, noumenally considered, is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be <b>supposed.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> {{this would}} be to solve that ultimate mystery which must ever transcend human intelligence. But it still may be {{possible for us to}} reduce the law of all progress, above set forth, from the condition of an empirical generalization, to the condition of a rational generalization. Just as it was possible to interpret Kepler's laws as necessary consequences of the law of gravitation; so {{it may be possible to}} interpret this law of progress, in its multiform manifestations, as the necessary consequence of some similarly universal principle. As gravitation was assignable as the cause of each of the groups of phenomena which Kepler generalized; so may some equally simple attribute of things be assignable as the cause of each of the groups of phenomena generalized in the foregoing pages. We may be able to affiliate all these varied evolutions of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous, upon certain facts of immediate experience, which, in virtue of endless repetition, we regard as necessary.|$|R

30|$|We can {{add also}} as general remark {{that in our}} opinion, the {{coherent}} oscillations during the revivals of Rabi oscillations play the role {{which would have been}} played by coherent oscillations between two parallel quantum wires considered in the Refs. [10, 11]. As we already mentioned, the last ones were not definitely observed in the experiments, while the revivals were [26]. In our opinion, it is because in spite of ballistic transport in DQW structures, environmental decoherence, caused, for example, by the scattering of electrons by the edges of the structure and which cannot be eliminated, leads to the destruction of electron wavefunctions’ phase relations and hence to the loss of coherence. In order to avoid misunderstanding, we would like to emphasize that despite the fact that we started our discussion (see “Background” section) with mentioning Refs [10, 11], in which the electrons are assumed to move ballistically in the considered structures, we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>suppose</b> them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in our case, because in our structure, they interact with the environment and strictly speaking their transport is not ballistic. However, sensu stricto ballistic transport is not necessary in our case, because as it is already mentioned, the symmetric and antisymmetric states are not mixed by the electron-electron and electron-phonon interaction. What is equally important, is that the quantum entanglement occurs due to electron interaction with external quantized EM field. This interaction is stronger than interaction with the environment and that is why the coherent oscillations survive and were observed in the experiments with microcavities.|$|R
