500|$|Against the Washington Senators on August 12, 1896, Lajoie {{made his}} major league debut. He played first base and {{recorded}} a single. Ed Delahanty was being considered {{to play the}} first base position after Dan Brouthers retired. Delahanty, however, wanted Lajoie to play first so he could return to his natural position of left field. Delahanty said to Lajoie, [...] "Look, sonny, you tell the boss you’re a first baseman and you and me are gonna get along." [...] Lajoie became the team's first baseman {{and by the end}} of the season, he and Delahanty were roommates. Later in 1898, new manager George Stallings moved Lajoie to second base, commenting that [...] " [...] have made good <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> positioned him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{fragrance}} {{is described}} by Steal Their Style as a [...] "feminine and flowery fragrance". Along with Glow by JLo, the perfume achieved success in the fragrance market {{and became one of}} America's highest-selling bottles. Collectively with Glow by JLo, it brought in over $USD300 million within a year, making Lopez the nineteenth richest person under forty, according to business magazine Forbes. The Fragrance Foundation's FiFi Awards named it the [...] "Celebrity Fragrance of the Year" [...] in June 2003. Several writers compared the theme of Still Jennifer Lopez's promotional campaign to her hit-song [...] "Jenny from the Block" [...] (2002), in which she declared [...] "I'm Still, I'm Still Jenny from the Block / Used to have a little now I have a lot / <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> go, I know where I came from." [...] Speaking about the fragrance's slogan, The New York Times wrote that it is [...] "a line that refers partly to her composure under the media glare but also serves as a pitch to potential consumers [...] It also evokes a song from her latest album, Jenny from the Block, in which she declares that despite fame, she is essentially her old self from South Bronx." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Gaga explained {{that she wanted to}} put together an expensive looking, beautiful show which would be affordable for her fans. She asserted that the tour was a [...] "pop-electro opera" [...] because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an opera. According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was [...] "essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage." [...] The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured {{in such a way that}} the box fit any stage. [...] "So <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> go, my fans get the same experience. So often you go into theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths, so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show", she added.|$|E
40|$|There is now {{abundant}} {{evidence that}} tumors of cold blooded vertebrates are essentially similar in morphology and behavior to the corresponding types of tumors in birds and mammals, including man (1, 2). Little, however, {{is known about}} their chemical activities. A promising approach to investigations in this field {{is the study of}} enzymatic properties of tumors. For these purposes the kidney carcinoma of the leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is excellent material; it occurs as a "spontaneous " tumor in frogs living under natural conditions (3); it is readily available and attains a size adequate for analysis; the frogs can be maintained over a wide range of environmental temperature, the effects of which upon enzymatic processes can thus be determined. The present study deals with the enzyme catalase, whose properties have been thoroughly investigated in cancer of warm blooded animals, chiefly mice and rats (4). In mammals two main changes in catalase activity with respect to cancer have been found. First, the catalase activity of any kind of neoplastic tissue is uniformly low. Second, any kind of cancer <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> located, <b>i...</b>|$|R

For a long time I vowed I wouldn’t fall into writing ethnic stories, immigrant stories, etc. Then I realized {{that not only was}} I working against these expectations (market, self, literary, cultural), I was working against my kneejerk resistance to such expectations. How I see it now is <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> what or <b>where</b> <b>I</b> write about, I feel a responsibility to the subject matter. Not so much to get it right as to do it justice.

This book {{is a testament to the}} fact that I’m becoming more and more okay with that.|$|R

60|$|Of {{all these}} {{woodland}} songsters the wood-wren impressed me the most. He could always be heard, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> entered the wood, since all {{this world of}} tall beeches was a favoured haunt of the wood-wren, each pair keeping to its own territory of half-an-acre of trees or so, and somewhere among those trees the male was always singing, far up, invisible to eyes beneath, in the topmost sunlit foliage of the tall trees. On entering the wood I would, stand still {{for a few minutes}} to listen to the various sounds until that one fascinating sound would come to my ears from some distance away, and to that spot I would go to find a bed of last year's leaves to sit upon and listen. It was an enchanting experience to be there in that woodland twilight with the green cloud of leaves so far above me; to listen to the silence, to the faint whisper of the wind-touched leaves, then to little prelusive drops of musical sound, growing louder and falling faster until they ran into one prolonged trill. And there I would sit listening for half-an-hour or a whole hour; but the end would not come; the bird is indefatigable and with his mysterious talk in the leaves would tire the sun himself and send him down the sky: for not until the sun has set and the wood has grown dark does the singing cease.|$|E
