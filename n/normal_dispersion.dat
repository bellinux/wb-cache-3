25|$|If D is {{less than}} zero, the medium {{is said to have}} {{positive}} dispersion or <b>normal</b> <b>dispersion.</b> If D is greater than zero, the medium has negative dispersion. If a light pulse is propagated through a normally dispersive medium, the result is the higher frequency components slow down more than the lower frequency components. The pulse therefore becomes positively chirped, or up-chirped, increasing in frequency with time. This causes the spectrum coming out of a prism to appear with red light the least refracted and blue/violet light the most refracted. Conversely, if a pulse travels through an anomalously (negatively) dispersive medium, high frequency components travel faster than the lower ones, and the pulse becomes negatively chirped, or down-chirped, decreasing in frequency with time.|$|E

50|$|The two regimes {{outlined}} above {{assume that the}} pump is in the anomalous dispersion region. It is possible to create supercontinua in the normal region and in fact many of the early results discussed in the historical overview were pumped in the <b>normal</b> <b>dispersion</b> regime. If the input pulses are short enough then self-phase modulation can lead to significant broadening which is temporally coherent. However, if the pulses are not ultra-short then stimulated-Raman scattering tends to dominate and typically a series of cascaded discrete Stokes lines will appear until the zero dispersion wavelength is reached. At this point a soliton Raman continuum may form. As pumping in the anomalous is much more efficient for continuum generation, the majority of modern sources avoiding pumping in the <b>normal</b> <b>dispersion</b> regime.|$|E

50|$|Dark pulses are {{characterized}} by being formed from a localized reduction of intensity compared to a more intense continuous wave background. Scalar dark solitons (linearly polarized dark solitons) can be formed in all <b>normal</b> <b>dispersion</b> fiber lasers mode-locked by the nonlinear polarization rotation method and can be rather stable.

5000|$|It {{is clear}} that the extra {{frequencies}} generated through SPM broaden the frequency spectrum of the pulse symmetrically. In the time domain, the envelope of the pulse is not changed, however in any real medium the effects of dispersion will simultaneously act on the pulse. In regions of <b>normal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> the [...] "redder" [...] portions of the pulse have a higher velocity than the [...] "blue" [...] portions, and thus the front of the pulse moves faster than the back, broadening the pulse in time. In regions of anomalous dispersion, the opposite is true, and the pulse is compressed temporally and becomes shorter. This effect can be exploited to some degree (until it digs holes into the spectrum) to produce ultrashort pulse compression.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, one can {{determine}} the approximate period of a precursor waveform at a particular distance and time by calculating {{the period of the}} frequency component that would arrive at that distance and time based on its group velocity. In a region of <b>normal</b> <b>dispersion,</b> high-frequency components have a faster group velocity than low-frequency ones, so the front of the precursor should have a period corresponding to that of the highest-frequency component of the original impulse; with increasing time, components with lower and lower frequencies arrive, so the period of the precursor becomes longer and longer until the lowest-frequency component arrives. As more and more components arrive, the amplitude of the precursor also increases. The particular type of precursor characterized by increasing period and amplitude is known as the high-frequency Sommerfeld precursor.|$|E

5000|$|The {{refractive}} index of materials {{varies with the}} wavelength (and frequency) of light. This is called dispersion and causes prisms and rainbows to divide white light into its constituent spectral colors. As the {{refractive index}} varies with wavelength, so will the refraction angle as light goes from one material to another. Dispersion also causes the focal length of lenses to be wavelength dependent. This {{is a type of}} chromatic aberration, which often needs to be corrected for in imaging systems. In regions of the spectrum where the material does not absorb light, the refractive index tends to decrease with increasing wavelength, and thus increase with frequency. This is called [...] "normal dispersion", in contrast to [...] "anomalous dispersion", where the refractive index increases with wavelength. For visible light <b>normal</b> <b>dispersion</b> means that the refractive index is higher for blue light than for red.|$|E
50|$|Precursors {{were first}} {{theoretically}} predicted in 1914 by Arnold Sommerfeld {{for the case}} of electromagnetic radiation propagating through a neutral dielectric in a region of <b>normal</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Sommerfeld's work was expanded in the following years by Léon Brillouin, who applied the saddle point approximation to compute the integrals involved. However, {{it was not until}} 1969 that precursors were first experimentally confirmed for the case of microwaves propagating in a waveguide, and much of the experimental work observing precursors in other types of waves has only been done since the year 2000. This experimental lag is mainly {{due to the fact that}} in many situations, precursors have a much smaller amplitude than the signals that give rise to them (a baseline figure given by Brillouin is six orders of magnitude smaller). As a result, experimental confirmations could only be done after technology became available to detect precursors.|$|E
50|$|In {{this section}} we will briefly discuss the {{dynamics}} of the two main regimes in which supercontinua are generated in fibre. As previously stated a supercontinuum occurs through the interaction of many nonlinear processes to cause extensive spectral broadening. Many of these processes such as: self-phase modulation, four-wave mixing and soliton based dynamics have been well understood, individually, for some time. The breakthroughs in recent years have involved understanding and modelling how all these processes interact together to generate supercontinua and how parameters can be engineered to enhance and control continuum formation. The two main regimes are the soliton fission regime and modulation instability regime. The physical processes can be considered to be quite similar and the descriptions really enable us to distinguish between the processes that drive the continuum formation for varying pump conditions. A third regime, pumping in the <b>normal</b> <b>dispersion</b> region, is also covered. This is a perfectly viable way to generate a supercontinuum. However, {{it is not possible to}} generate the same bandwidths by this method.|$|E
