40|$|A lot of {{research}} works have been made concerning <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> area or solar technology and acquired great achievements. However, unfortunately, few works have been made combining the two topics together of <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> areas and solar energy saving to make a systemic research on solar technology application for <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> area. In this paper, taking West Lushan <b>highway</b> low-carbon <b>service</b> area in Jiangxi Province of China as the case study, the advantages, technical principles, and application methods of solar energy technology for <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> area including solar photoelectric technology and solar water heating technology were discussed based on the analysis of characteristics of <b>highway</b> low-carbon <b>service</b> area; the system types, operation mode, and installing tilt angle of the two kinds of solar systems suitable for <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> areas were confirmed. It was proved that {{the reduction of the}} cost by electricity savings of solar system was huge. Taking the investment of the solar systems into account, the payback period of solar photoelectric systems and solar water heating systems was calculated. The economic effect of the solar systems in West Lushan <b>highway</b> <b>service</b> area during the effective operation periods was also calculated and proved very considerable...|$|R
