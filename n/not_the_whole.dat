25|$|Despite {{the shift}} of policy, the policy of {{evacuating}} Greek settlements and relocating the inhabitants was continued, albeit in a limited scale.

This resulted in the survival of about 25,000 Jews from Belgium. Unlike other states, which were immediately annexed, Belgium was initially placed under German military administration, which the Belgian authorities exploited by refusing to carry out some of the Nazi directives against the Jews. Roughly 60 percent of Belgium's Jews, who were there at the start of the war, survived the Final Solution.|$|E

25|$|Kulottunga {{also lost}} much of his territories in Vengi. The {{northern}} half of the Vengi kingdom if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of {{it seems to have}} slipped from his hands and gone to the Western Chalukyan empire under Vikramaditya VI. Encouraged by the successes of Hoysala, Vikaramaditya invaded Vengi in 1118 CE. The aging Kulotunga summoned the Viceroy of Vengi Vikrama Chola and installed him as heir apparent to the Chola throne. Lacking any meaningful leadership in Vengi, it soon fell to Vikramaditya and remained in his hands until his death in 1126 CE. However, overall for the Cholas the loss of Vengi was a purely temporary one for they would regain Vengi under Vikrama Chola with him routing the Chalukyas in 1124–25 and Vengi would remain in the Chola-fold till rule of Kulottunga-III (1176–1218).|$|E

Ælfgifu was determined that her second son Harold should be the next English king. She had returned to England (at least) by 1036, while Emma's son Harthacnut was away in Denmark, at war with the Norwegian king Magnus I, and the Swedes under their king Anund Jacob. Emma's other sons, Ælfred and Edward, stayed in Normandy. With help from her supporters, Ælfgifu was able to secure the throne for her son. In the view of Frank Stenton, she was probably the real ruler of England for part, if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> of his reign.|$|E
25|$|The moral {{influence}} view {{is often}} misconstrued as teaching merely that Jesus willingly {{died on the}} cross to demonstrate his love and thus inspire people to follow him. The scope of the full moral influence view is much larger, however. The moral influence view does not focus primarily {{on the death of}} Jesus {{in the same way that}} penal substitution does. Instead, it focuses on the wider story of Christ's teachings, example, and the church movement he founded. His death is seen as inspirational within that context, but his death was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> goal in the way that penal substitution depicts it. The moral influence view depicts Jesus' death as a martyrdom, in which he was killed because of his teaching and leadership of a controversial movement. Jesus' death is thus understood as a consequence of his activity, and it gains its significance as part of the larger story of his life, death, and resurrection.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} the second question. Divergent or not, finite or infinite, is the zero-point energy of any {{physical}} significance? The ignoring of the whole zero-point energy is often encouraged for all practical calculations. The {{reason for this is}} that energies are not typically defined by an arbitrary data point, but rather changes in data points, so adding or subtracting a constant (even if infinite) should to be allowed. However this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story, in reality energy is not so arbitrarily defined: in general relativity the seat of the curvature of spacetime is the energy content and there the absolute amount of energy has real physical meaning. There is no such thing as an arbitrary additive constant with density of field energy. Energy density curves space, and an increase in energy density produces an increase of curvature. Furthermore, the zero-point energy density has other physical consequences e.g. the Casimir effect, contribution to the Lamb shift, or anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, it is clear it is not just a mathematical constant or artifact that can be cancelled out.|$|E

25|$|Josip Lučić and Franjo Šanjek's 1993 Hrvatski povijesni zemljovid (Croatian {{historical}} map) {{provided an}} extended depiction of Tomislav's kingdom. Lučić was a known historical geographer from the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb who authored numerous maps in Croatian history books. Ivo Goldstein in turn argued in his 1995 book Hrvatski rani srednji vijek that Tomislav made no crucial expansion deeper into inner Bosnia {{and that he}} incorporated only parts of Pannonia to the Kingdom of Croatia, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> area between Drava and Sava, which was according to him Terra nullius. Neven Budak is in full agreement with Goldstein regarding {{the status of the}} Drava-Sava area, arguing that the northern Croatian border most likely passed through the wider Sisak area. Dominant modern university history textbooks in Croatia such as Tomislav Raukar's Hrvatsko srednjovjekovlje (1997) consider that during Tomislav's rule his kingdom covered between 60% to 80% of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina. Franjo Šanjek also edited a major work by sixteen authors on the medieval Croatian state, which is also used as a university textbook also includes such a view.|$|E
25|$|Thus, by {{the early}} twentieth century the chemical, but not the {{structural}} nature of the cell membrane was known. Two experiments in 1924 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick. Although the results of this experiment were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Because the polar lipid headgroups are fully hydrated, they do not show up in a capacitance measurement meaning that this experiment actually measured the thickness of the hydrocarbon core, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> bilayer. Gorter and Grendel approached the problem from a different perspective, performing a solvent extraction of erythrocyte lipids and spreading the resulting material as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses of this experiment showed several problems including an incorrect monolayer pressure, incomplete lipid extraction and a miscalculation of cell surface area. In spite of these issues the fundamental conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer- was correct.|$|E
25|$|In Africa {{the chief}} centre of serpent worship was Dahomey, but {{the cult of}} the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to {{the first quarter of the}} 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshipers, and ended by {{adopting}} from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the danh-gbi kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. Danh-gbi has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils. The rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa, but only certain individuals, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> species, were sacred. In many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the Amazulu, as among the Betsileo of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The Maasai, on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe.|$|E
