50|$|The {{inefficiency}} of {{the public}} passenger transport system has resulted in increasing numbers of private vehicles on the roads. Transporting less <b>no.</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> per vehicle leads to heavy traffic congestion that resulted in increased fuel consumption to households and to the economy. It also affects to the labor productivity which waste on the road due to the heavy traffic. In addition to that due to heavy consumption of fuel it leads to negative externalities which caused to air pollution by releasing Carbon Dioxide to the environment.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss Intelligent Bus Stops in a special Demand Responsive Transit (DRT), the Flexible Bus System. These Intelligent Bus Stops are more {{efficient}} and information rich than Traditional Bus Stops. The real time synchronization of the Flexible Bus System makes it unique as compared to Traditional Bus Systems. The Main concern is to make Bus Stops intelligent and information rich. Buses are informed about the <b>no.</b> <b>of</b> <b>passengers</b> waiting at the upcoming Bus Stops. If there are no passengers to ride or get off on upcoming Bus Stop, the Bus can skip that Bus Stop and head towards the next Bus Stop where passenger is waiting, which will decrease the ride time of the passengers on the Bus and also the wait time of the passengers waiting on the upcoming Bus Stops. Providing more information at Bus Stops about the Destination (Time to Destination, Distance to Destination etc.) and Buses (Bus Location, Arrival Time of Bus etc.) makes it easier for the passengers to decide whether to ride a particular Bus or not...|$|E

The petroleum crisis of 1942-43 made coal-fired steam more attractive, especially near the east coast.

It landed after nearly 25 hours, covering over 2,100 km at 15:10 on November 1. The airship and the crew were welcomed by Gauleiter Sprenger at the new home port. After this trip LZ 130 on 14 November 1938 received the Luftschiff-Zulassungsschein (airship registration document).

5000|$|A second {{rail line}} connects Istanbul in Turkey with China via Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.

There is <b>no</b> through service <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> trains on the entire line. A uniform gauge {{connection}} was proposed in 2006, commencing with new construction in Kazakhstan.

25|$|Ridership {{increased}} {{during the}} first decade of the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the NEC and rises in automobile fuel costs. The inauguration of the high-speed Acela Express in late 2000 generated considerable publicity and led to major ridership gains. However, through the late 1990s and very early 21st century, Amtrak could not add sufficient express freight revenue or cut sufficient other expenditures to break even. By 2002, it was clear that Amtrak could not achieve self-sufficiency, but Congress continued to authorize funding and released Amtrak from the requirement. In early 2002 David L. Gunn replaced Warrington as president. In a departure from his predecessors' promises to make Amtrak self-sufficient in the short term, Gunn argued that <b>no</b> form <b>of</b> <b>passenger</b> transportation in the United States is self-sufficient as the economy is currently structured. Highways, airports, and air traffic control all require large government expenditures to build and operate, coming from the Highway Trust Fund and Aviation Trust Fund paid for by user fees, highway fuel and road taxes, and, in the case of the General Fund, from general taxation. Gunn dropped most freight express business and worked to eliminate deferred maintenance.|$|R

They drew nearer, and Agatha set her lips tight as she recognized them, for the light from a vestibule shone into Hawtrey's face as he half lifted Sally on to one of the platforms and sprang up after her. Then the bell tolled again, and the train slid slowly out of the station with its lights flashing upon the snow.|$|R

After years <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>passenger</b> operations, it resumed flight service on January 20, 2016 with a flight to Berlin, Germany. The airport has a newly extended and resurfaced runway that is 2500 meters long and 60 meters wide, a new ILS system, and is located in Szymany in Mazury region. Its toponymic Szczytno-Szymany reflects largely obscure localities. The airport management has rebranded the airport to as [...] "Olsztyn-Mazury”, that would better encapsulate the whole region of Mazury and its lakes, which is more well known.|$|R

Towering white in the {{sunshine}} high above the translucent brine, she looked with her huge wheel-casings, lines of winking windows, and triple tier of decks more like a hotel set afloat than a steamer, and the resemblance was completed by the long tables set out for breakfast in the white and gold saloon. <b>No</b> swarm <b>of</b> voracious <b>passengers</b> had, however, descended upon them as yet, for though winter touches the southern coast but lightly, it is occasionally almost Arctic amidst the ranges of the mountain province, and the Pacific express was held up somewhere by the snow.|$|R

During the Second World War there was an increase in freight traffic due to an Avro aircraft factory being established at nearby Leeds-Bradford airport but in spite of this demand the line was closed as a wartime economy measure in 1944. After the war the line reopened but the amount of traffic was never great and a decision was made to close both the station and the branch line. The last train ran on 7 August 1964.|$|R
