25|$|The Senior Project is {{a program}} that began at Uni in the Spring of 2014. The project was {{developed}} by Assistant Director of Student Life Karl Radnitzer, who got the idea from a similar program at <b>New</b> <b>Trier</b> High School in Winnetka, IL. The project's goal is to allow second semester seniors to explore interests in a more career-oriented way than they would in a typical classroom setting. The project connects students with mentors in the Champaign-Urbana community who can help them explore their academic interests outside of the school building. Students come up with ideas for projects and submit them for approval to a Senior Project committee. If a project is approved, students then spend their second semester doing work for their project around three times a week. Students have worked in various labs at the University of Illinois, at the Crisis Nursery, at Carle Hospital, and at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.|$|E

40|$|The {{freedom to}} <b>try</b> <b>new</b> things plays {{a vital role}} for {{employees}} engaging in creative endeavors.

However, we argue that what allows someone to <b>try</b> <b>new</b> things earlier in their career and when they are more established might be different.
