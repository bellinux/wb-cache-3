5|$|Driberg made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> homosexuality, {{which he}} practised {{throughout}} his life despite its being a criminal offence in Britain until 1967; his ability to avoid any consequences for his risky and often brazen behaviour baffled his friends and colleagues. Always in search of bizarre experiences, Driberg befriended at various times the occultist Aleister Crowley and the Kray twins, along with honoured and respected figures in the worlds of literature and politics. He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to Anglo-Catholicism. After his death, allegations were published about his role over many years as an MI5 informant, a KGB agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.|$|E

What Conant feared most was disruption to Harvard's tercentennial celebrations in 1936, but there was no trouble, despite the presence of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and a Harvard graduate of the class of 1904, whom many Harvard graduates regarded as a socialist and a class traitor. It was only with difficulty that Lowell was persuaded to be presiding officer at an event at which Roosevelt spoke.|$|E

When Mrs. Chitterlow, who for a little while seemed socially self-conscious, reproved him for taking a potato with a jab <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fork, he answered, [...] "Well, you shouldn't have married a man of Genius," [...] and from a subsequent remark it was perfectly clear that Chitterlow's standing in this respect was made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> in <b>his</b> household.|$|R

He was especially close to his mother, Lița Baranga, who survived his death. His father, an army officer, wanted Ion to follow in his footsteps and thus sent him to attend the Infantry and Cavalry School in Craiova. During his childhood, his father divorced his mother to marry a woman who was a Jewish convert to Orthodoxy. The breakup of his parents' marriage was a traumatic event for the young Antonescu, and he made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dislike of his stepmother, whom he always depicted as a femme fatale who destroyed what he saw as his parents' happy marriage.|$|E
25|$|During World War II and {{for many}} years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to {{hospitals}} to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them {{that the loss of}} a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life.

In 1946 Capp created a special full-color comic book, Al Capp by Li'l Abner, to be distributed by the Red Cross to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp was also involved with the Sister Kenny Foundation, which pioneered new treatments for polio in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fund-raising appeals, and entertained crippled and paraplegic children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories and sketches.|$|E
25|$|Tublat (Keith David) – A rogue ape and {{a former}} member of Tarzan's gorilla family. He {{challenged}} Kerchak for leadership but he was defeated and cast out. He is considered dangerous by all the gorillas due to his aggressive and sociopathic behavior. He is based on Kala's husband (and Tarzan's foster father) in the original Tarzan novel. His personality is also very much like the original Kerchak or Terkoz from the novel. Conversely, Kerchak's personality in the 1999 film is just like Tublat's in the original novel. He once took over another gorilla family that Gobu belonged to, but inspired by Tarzan the family overthrew him and Gobu replaced him. He often calls Tarzan a hairless runt. He has four toes on his right foot (it is possible he lost one in a fight), and this is one way to tell he is in the area. In the series, he plots to dispose of Tarzan so that he can take over the gorilla pack for himself and makes <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hatred against Tarzan, believing him to be unworthy of leading the gorilla family (despite Tarzan's actual success as a leader of the gorillas).|$|E

Unfortunately for Calasanz as administrator of the Order, Cherubini was the son and the brother of powerful papal lawyers and {{no one wanted to}} offend the Cherubini family. Cherubini pointed out that if allegations <b>of</b> <b>his</b> abuse <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boys became public, actions would be taken to destroy the Order. Calasanz therefore promoted him, to get him away from the scene of the crime, citing only his luxurious diet and failure to attend prayers.

50|$|Dolly later went to {{work for}} the BBC as a secretary, and had an affair with Clark's colleague, the {{engineer}} Peter Eckersley.

Eckersley was married, but although he and Dolly made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> their liaison, <b>his</b> wife Stella was unaware. It was Muriel Reith, the wife of the BBC Director-General John Reith, who broke the news to her.

60|$|The curtain rang up again, {{the play}} proceeded. But {{not the same}} play--at least, so it seemed to Matravers--not the same play, surely not the same woman! A {{situation}} improbable enough, but dramatic, had occurred {{at the very beginning}} of the second act. She had risen to the opportunity, triumphed over it, electrified her audience, delighted Ellison, moved Matravers to silent wonder. Her personality seemed to have dilated with the flash of genius which Matravers himself had been amongst the first to recognize. The strange pallor of her face seemed no longer the legacy of ill-health; her eyes, wonderfully soft and dark, were lit now with all manner of strange fires. She carried herself with supreme grace; there was not the faintest suspicion of staginess in any one of her movements. And more wonderful than anything to Matravers, himself a delighted worshipper of the beautiful in all human sounds, was that marvellously sweet voice, so low and yet so clear, expressing with perfect art the highest and most hallowed emotions, with the least amount of actual sound. She seemed to pour out the vial of her wrath, her outraged womanhood in tones raised little above a whisper, and the man who fronted her seemed turned into the actual semblance of an ashamed and unclean thing. Matravers made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> now <b>of</b> <b>his</b> interest. He had drawn his chair to the front of the box, and the footlights fell full upon his pale, studious face turned with grave and absolute attention upon the little drama working itself out upon the stage. Ellison in the midst <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jubilation found time to notice what to him seemed a somewhat singular incident. In crossing the stage her eyes had for a moment met Matravers' earnest gaze, and Ellison could almost have declared that a faint, welcoming light flashed for a moment from the woman to the man. Yet he was sure that the two were strangers. They had never met--her very name had been unknown to him. It must have been his fancy.|$|R
60|$|When {{at length}} Hyder Ali {{found that he}} had to do with men who either would sign no convention, or whom no treaty and no {{signature}} could bind, and who were the determined enemies of human intercourse itself, he decreed to make the country possessed by these incorrigible and predestinated criminals a memorable example to mankind. He resolved, in the gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such things, to leave the whole Carnatic an everlasting monument of vengeance, and to put perpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no protection. He became at length so confident <b>of</b> <b>his</b> force, so collected in his might, that he made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> whatsoever <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dreadful resolution. Having terminated his disputes with every enemy and every rival, who buried their mutual animosities in their common detestation against the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every quarter whatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of destruction; and compounding all the materials of fury, havoc, and desolation into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities of the mountains. Whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened all their horizon, it suddenly burst, and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic. Then ensued a scene of woe, the like of which no eye had seen, no heart conceived, and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the horrors of war before known or heard of were mercy to that new havoc. A storm of universal fire blasted every field, consumed every house, destroyed every temple. The miserable inhabitants, flying from their flaming villages, in part were slaughtered; others, without regard to sex, to age, to the respect of rank or sacredness of function, fathers torn from children, husbands from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and amidst the goading spears of drivers, and the trampling of pursuing horses, were swept into captivity in an unknown and hostile land. Those who were able to evade this tempest fled to the walled cities; but escaping from fire, sword, and exile, they fell into the jaws of famine.|$|R

500|$|Thorpe was a diligent MP, {{active in}} {{promoting}} local issues—a new general hospital, and a link {{road to the}} Exeter-Taunton motorway—and campaigned successfully to save the Barnstaple-to-Exeter railway line from the Beeching axe.

[...] He was also noted for his verve and wit; when in 1962, after a series of by-election disasters, Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet, Thorpe's reported comment, an inversion of the biblical verse John 15:13, was [...] "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his friends for his life".|$|E
500|$|Third in {{seniority}} in the RAAF after Air Marshal Richard Williams and Air Vice Marshal Stanley Goble, and considered, in {{the words}} of historian Chris Coulthard-Clark, to be [...] "among the Air Force's best brains" [...] at the time, Bostock was a prime candidate for the position of CAS in May 1942. He was also first choice of the incumbent CAS, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, whose two-year term was coming to an end. However, Bostock's closeness to Burnett, who had made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contempt for John Curtin's Federal Labor government, damaged his chances for selection and his friend, George Jones, then only a substantive wing commander and acting air commodore, took the position. Although he had expected to be made CAS, Bostock warmly congratulated Jones, possibly expecting that his (Bostock's) new role as chief of staff to the Commander of Allied Air Forces, Lieutenant General George Brett, with responsibility for air operations in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), would prove the more important appointment in a time of war.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the time}} when Jeremiah the prophet spoke those words to the Jews, nothing seemed more {{unlikely}} than that they would ever come true. The whole Jewish nation was falling to pieces from its own sins. Brutish and filthy idolatry in high and low--oppression, violence, and luxury among the court and the nobility--shame, and poverty, and ignorance among the lower classes--idleness and quackery among the priesthood--and as kings over all, one fool and profligate after another, set on the throne by a foreign conqueror, and pulled down again by him at his pleasure. Ten out of the twelve tribes of Israel had been carried off captive, young and old, into a distant land. The small portion of country which still remained inhabited round Jerusalem, had been overrun again and again by cruel armies of heathens. Without Jerusalem was waste and ruins, bloodshed and wretchedness; within every kind of iniquity and lies, division and confusion. If {{ever there was a}} miserable and contemptible people upon the face of the earth, it was the Jewish nation in Jeremiah's time. Jeremiah makes <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>His</b> prophecies are full of it--full of lamentation and shame: [...] "Oh that my head were a fountain of tears, to weep for the sins of my people!" [...] He feels that God has sent him to rebuke those sins, to warn and prophesy to his fellow- countrymen the certain ruin into which they are rushing headlong; and he speaks God's message boldly. From the poor idol-ridden labourer, offering cakes to the Queen of Heaven to coax her into sending him a good harvest, to the tyrant king who had built <b>his</b> palace <b>of</b> cedar and painted it with vermilion, he had a bitter word for every man. The lying priest tried to silence him; and Jeremiah answered him, that his wife should be a harlot in the city, and his children sold for slaves. The king tried to flatter him into being quiet; and he told him in return, that he should be buried with the burial of an ass, dragged out and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem. The luxurious queen, who made her nest in the cedars, would be ashamed and confounded, he said, for her wickedness. The crown prince was a despised broken idol--a vessel in which was no pleasure; he should be cast out, he and his children, into slavery in a land which he knew not. The whole royal family, he said, would perish; none of them should ever again prosper or sit upon the throne of David. This was his message; shame and confusion, woe and ruin, to high and low; every human being he passed in the street was a doomed man. For the day of the Lord was at hand, and who should be able to escape it? ...|$|R
60|$|It {{would have}} been the whole, that is, had there not been a sharper one still in the {{circumstance}} that he was to start at once. His mission, as they called it at the office, would probably be over by the end of June, which was desirable; but to bring that about he must now not lose a week; his inquiries, he understood, were to cover the whole ground, and there were reasons of State--reasons operating at the seat of empire in Fleet Street--why the nail should be struck on the head. Densher made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> to Kate <b>of</b> <b>his</b> having asked for a day to decide; and <b>his</b> account <b>of</b> that matter was that he felt he owed it to her to speak to her first. She assured him on this that nothing so much as that scruple had yet shown her how they were bound together; she was clearly proud <b>of</b> <b>his</b> letting a thing of such importance depend on her; but she was clearer still as to his instant duty. She rejoiced in his prospect and urged him to his task; she should miss him intensely--of course she should miss him; but she made so little of it that she spoke with jubilation of what he would see and would do. She made so much of this last quantity that he laughed at her innocence, though also with scarce the heart to give her the real size <b>of</b> <b>his</b> drop in the daily bucket. He was struck at the same time with her happy grasp of what had really occurred in Fleet Street--all the more that it was his own final reading. He was to pull the subject up--that was just what they wanted; and it would take more than all the United States together, visit them each as he might, to let him down. It was just because he didn't nose about and wasn't the usual gossipmonger that they had picked him out; it was a branch of their correspondence with which they evidently wished a new tone associated, such a tone as, from now on, it would have always to take from his example.|$|R

After Reid publicly declared that he would love Frank to have a last fling with Pat before he left, EastEnders bosses granted his wish and an affair was scripted. The pair enjoyed a liaison on a Spanish beach during a week-long August special set on the Costa Blanca, which saw Frank and Peggy go away with Pat and Roy and Terry and Irene Raymond (Gavin Richards and Roberta Taylor). A BBC spokesperson said: [...] "Pat is obviously incredibly torn between her love for her husband, Roy, and her old feelings for Frank.
