50|$|Modern alarm {{controls}} are solid-state devices, {{and do not}} use the relays that the older alarm panels used to go into alarm. They make use of relays to modulate the alarm <b>notification</b> <b>device</b> as needed. And they use a relay to seize the telephone line to communicate to the monitoring station. Most switching devices are N.C. (normally closed) circuits, so when the device is not in an alarm condition, the circuit is closed. Most alarm circuits (zones) are also set up to open or close on reading a certain resistance, usually between 1K and 5K ohms when inactive and double the value when active. This wiring system is called dual loop and allows for both alarm and anti-tamper detections to be incorporated into one circuit (anti-tamper occurs when the resistance level moves outside normal open/close values). This is the standard circuit in most modern systems.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{fire and}} life safety {{analysis was performed}} on the Orfalea College of Business. The report covers the prescriptive analysis of the building and the performance-based design analysis. The prescriptive analysis includes assessment of the relevant codes for egress system, water-based suppression system, alarm and detection system, and structural fire protection. The egress analysis under the Life Safety Code 2015 found the building meets the requirements of occupant load to exceed exit capacity, number of exits and its location, travel distances. Four rooms on the second floor that have not met the common path of travel distances limits were discussed in detail in this report. In addition, two locations where exits signs should have been located were investigated in this report. The water-based suppression system was analyzed, and an automatic fire sprinkler system was designed according to NFPA 13. The fire alarm and detection system throughout the building was reviewed. The <b>notification</b> <b>device</b> in Room 300 does not meet required candela rating. The smoke management system analysis indicates door magnetic holder for the exit enclosure on the third floor does not work properly. The analysis of the structural fire protection demonstrates that the building is in accordance to the requirements of the IBC 2015 for Type I-B construction. A performance based analysis of the Orfalea College of Business was performed to evaluate a design fire scenario. The fire scenario was modeled using Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS), Pyrosim and Pathfinder. The tenability results of the simulation are compared to the established tenability criteria to determine the available safe egress time (ASET) for the scenario. Then, (ASET) is compared to the required safe egress time (RSET). The fire scenario evaluated an upholstered three seat sofa in a break room on the fourth floor. The required safe egress time (RSET) was calculated as 249 seconds and the available safe egress time (ASET) was determined to be 42 seconds when the visibility tenability criterion was exceeded. As part of the evaluation process, there are additional recommendations in the report including exit sings locations on the third floor, obstructions in the corridor on the fourth floor, smoke detection system and notification appliances coverage, and several other recommendations are discussed in more detail in the report...|$|E
40|$|The ACME Semiconductor Foundry – Fab Expansion {{is a new}} four story {{addition}} to an existing four story foundry facility. The Fab Expansion is approximately 154, 500 square feet in footprint area that is connected to an existing four-story Fab Building. This report has been prepared to identify the building’s fire protection and life safety features that must be provided {{in accordance with the}} applicable codes and standards. The ACME Semiconductor Fab Expansion will contain multiple separated uses and will be required to be constructed with Type I-B construction. Building Construction Documents are provided in Appendix A showing compliance with the requirements found herein. There are multiple occupancy classifications within the building. The predominant use of the building is semiconductor fabrication (H- 5), with some storage of hazardous materials (H- 2, H- 3, and H- 4). The structural fire protection requirements are presented. The structure, being Type I-B, would normally require 1 -hour fire resistance rated roof supports. Other prescriptive structural requirements are shown to be compliant. A performance based analysis is presented showing that the roof support does not reach critical temperatures for duration of one hour when exposed to a worst case credible fire scenario. The sprinkler system design requirements for the ACME Semiconductor Fab Expansion are presented showing various sprinkler system design densities. The most demanding case occurs in the Solvent Storage Room with 0. 30 gallons per minute per square foot over a design area of 3, 000 square feet. A summary of the inspection, testing, and maintenance requirements related to the fire sprinkler systems has been provided. This report presents the relevant fire detection, alarm and communication system design requirements for the ACME Semiconductor Fab Expansion. An excerpt of fire alarm design drawings has been provided in Appendix G showing the general code requirements, typical <b>notification</b> <b>device</b> layout and spacing, and a unique detection situation utilizing radiant-energy sensing detectors. Detection response analysis has been performed using DETACT, FDS, and manufacturer’s data for the unique flame detector situation. A brief summary of the inspection, testing, and maintenance requirements related to the fire alarm systems has been provided. This report presents the relevant egress requirements for the ACME Semiconductor Fab Expansion. Life Safety Plans are provided in Appendix K showing areas of non-compliance with the prescriptive requirements of the LSC. Use of the IBC would yield compliance acceptable to many authorities having jurisdiction. The egress calculations shown and simulated provide the basis for a performance based design of the egress systems in this building. This report can be used to establish the RSET value to be compared to an ASET value determined {{through the use of a}} CFD fire model. Recommendations include conducting a fire study to evaluate the egress systems in accordance with the LSC for high hazard industrial occupancies.

40|$|The Robert E. Kennedy Library {{is located}} on Cal Poly Campus. The Library is a five-story {{building}} with different occupancies which consists of library areas, offices, mechanical equipment and storage areas. The building has a total area of 178 702 ft². The original code of construction for the Library was the 1976 Uniform Building code (UBC). However, the fire and life safety analysis of the building in this report is performed using: Egress: NFPA 101 LSC 2015, Water based suppression: NFPA 13, Structural fire protection: 2015 IBC, Fire detection, alarm and communication systems: NFPA 72, Performance based design: NFPA 101 LSC 2015 and the SFPE handbook 5 th edition. The prescriptive-based analysis in this report focuses on the egress features, fire alarm and detection systems, fire suppression systems and structural fire protection of the Robert E. Kennedy Library. The egress features built into the Library were found to mostly comply with the prescriptive requirements of the LSC. There is an automatic fire alarm and detection system {{as well as an}} emergency notification system installed in the Library, mostly in accordance with the LSC and NFPA 72. However, the <b>notification</b> <b>devices</b> do not cover all common use areas in the Library, which is not up to code. The Library does not have a water based suppression system, but it is designed in this report. The proposed suppression system is in accordance with IBC requirements, and was designed following the requirements of NFPA 13. The analysis demonstrates that the Library is in accordance with all of the requirements of the IBC for Type I- B construction. The performance-based analysis in this report investigated the ability of the fire protection systems in the Library to perform satisfactorily in different fire scenarios. This analysis was completed using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) program, in conjunction with the Pyrosim graphical user interface and the Pathfinder evacuation simulator. The chosen design fire scenario was a fire with 8 bookshelves in the south west corner of the second floor. Two simulations were done, with and without functional sprinkler system. The data needed for the fire and combustion properties was taken from the SFPE handbook. The tenability criteria’s was evaluated east of the fire, where the occupants first will be affected by the fire. The simulations without functional sprinkler system indicated that RSET 3 ̆eASET. The visibility was violated in less than half the required safety egress time (RSET). The simulations with a functional sprinkler system indicated that ASET 3 ̆eRSET. The tenability criteria’s was not violated and it was determined that the building is safe in respect to life safety with sprinklers. It has been shown in the performance-based analysis portion of this report how a sprinklers system can reduce the effects of combustion byproducts in an area with a high fuel load and increase the life safety potential within a building. Sprinkler installation for the control of fires is the most common method of providing fire suppression. I would therefore recommend installing a sprinkler system in the Library for life safety. I would also recommend providing <b>notification</b> <b>devices</b> in all common use areas throughout the Library as required by IBC 2015 edition...|$|R

40|$|A fire {{protection}} and life safety {{analysis of the}} Henderson Engineers, Inc. (HEI) building in Lenexa, KS (Kansas City) is performed. Both prescriptive and performance-based methods {{have been used to}} evaluate the building against the codes and standards of the 2012 International Building Code (IBC). The following prescriptive {{fire protection}} and life safety systems were analyzed: Occupancy Classification, Building Construction Type, Fire Protection Features, Structural Fire Protection, Fire Barriers, Automatic Fire Sprinkler System, Fire Alarm System, and Means of Egress During the prescriptive approach, the following deficiencies were identified: 1) As-builts indicate a horizontal assembly fire-resistance rating of only 1 -hour, while shafts in the building are 2 -hour fire-resistance rated, 2) Fire alarm <b>notification</b> <b>devices</b> are missing/over-spaced throughout the building, and 3) Occupant load exceeds egress capacity on the 3 rd Floor, and total building occupant load exceeds total building egress capacity. A performance-based analysis of the HEI building is performed. The evaluation involves the evaluation of a design fire scenario that accounts for an increased occupant load and the elimination of an exit. This scenario is modeled using Pathfinder, Pyrosim, and Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). The tenability results of the simulation are compared to the established tenability thresholds to determine the available safe egress time (ASET) for each scenario. This time is compared to the required safe egress time (RSET) defined by a pathfinder simulation for the increased occupant load to egress from the floor in the design fire scenario. The fire scenario evaluated an upholstered couch fire in a small room. RSET was calculated as 500 seconds and ASET was determined to be 160 when the visibility tenability criteria is exceeded. However, this result does not necessarily confirm that ASE...|$|R
