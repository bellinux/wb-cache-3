Finding anomalies in data has important applications in domains such as fraud detection and homeland security. While there are several existing methods to identify anomalies in numerical datasets, {{there has been little}} work aimed at <b>discovering</b> <b>abnormal</b> instances in large and complex relational networks whose nodes are richly connected with many different types of links. To address this problem we designed a novel, unsupervised, domain independent framework that utilizes the information provided by different types of links to identify abnormal nodes. Our approach measures the dependencies between nodes and paths in the network to capture what we call “semantic profiles ” of nodes, and then applies a distance-based outlier detection method to find abnormal nodes that are significantly different from their closest neighbors.

Although there are methods from data mining and social network analysis focusing on finding patterns or central nodes from networks or numerical data sets, there has been little work aimed at <b>discovering</b> <b>abnormal</b> instances in large complex semantic graphs, whose nodes are richly connected with many different types of links. In this paper, we describe a novel unsupervised framework to identify such instances. Besides <b>discovering</b> <b>abnormal</b> instances, we believe that to complete the process, a system has to also provide users with understandable explanations for its findings. Therefore, {{in the second part of}} the paper, we describe an explanation mechanism to automatically generate human-understandable explanations for the discovered results. To evaluate our discovery and explanation systems, we perform experiments on several different semantic graphs. The results show that our discovery system outperforms stateof-the-art unsupervised network algorithms used to analyze the 9 / 11 terrorist network and other graph-based outlier detection algorithms by a significant margin. Additionally, the human study we conducted demonstrates that our explanation system, which provides natural language explanations for the system’s findings, allowed human subjects to perform complex data analysis in a much more efficient and accurate manner.

Therefore, we may accept the negative data on the Omachi network as reasonable, or at least, not contradictory to the other sorts of information. Strain accumulation in the Minobu and Ojiya areas might be more interesting from a tectonic point of view, though the observed changes in base-line lengths are not so large as to permit a definite conclusion.

We employ trajectory-based analysis of mobiles in the video to discover the points of entry and exit of mobiles appearing in the scene and ultimately deduce the different areas of activity.

Methods Electrophoretic {{analysis of the}} cord blood lysate evidenced for an abnormal tetramer due to a mutated fetal globin chain. Electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry and gene sequencing were used to identify the mutation. Oxygen binding ability of the variant Hb was determined. Results Sequencing of the γ globin genes revealed the T GT → C GT transition at codon 93 {{in one of the}} two G γ genes, which leads to the Arg for Cys amino acid replacement at position 9 of the F α-helix. The amino acid substitution was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the globin chains. Since modifications or substitutions at position β 93 are known to affect the arrangement of a salt bridge at the α 1 β 2 sliding contacts that are crucial for subunit cooperativity, the functional properties of the variant were studied to evaluate the effect of the replacement at the same position in the γ globin chain. With respect to normal HbF, the variant showed a significant increase in oxygen affinity and a slight decrease of both Bohr effect and cooperativity. General significance Result indicates a key role of the Cys γ 93 residue for subunit cooperativity in the T → R transition of the HbF tetramer. Substitutions at the F 9 position of the G γ globin may result in stabilization of the high affinity R-state of the Hb tetramer. Because of the loss of Cys γ 93 residue, this variant is considered to be potentially compromised in nitric oxide transport...|$|R
40|$|Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that {{constantly}} undergo fusion and fission {{to maintain their}} normal functionality. Impairment of mitochondrial dynamics is implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neuromuscular degenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron death and muscle atrophy. ALS onset and progression clearly involve motor neuron degeneration but accumulating evidence suggests primary muscle pathology may also be involved. Here, we examined mitochondrial dynamics in live skeletal muscle of an ALS mouse model (G 93 A) harboring a superoxide dismutase mutation (SOD 1 (G 93 A)). Using confocal microscopy combined with overexpression of mitochondria-targeted photoactivatable fluorescent proteins, we <b>discovered</b> <b>abnormal</b> mitochondrial dynamics in skeletal muscle of young G 93 A mice before disease onset. We further demonstrated that similar abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics were induced by overexpression of mutant SOD 1 (G 93 A) in skeletal muscle of normal mice, indicating the SOD 1 mutation drives ALS-like muscle pathology {{in the absence of}} motor neuron degeneration. Mutant SOD 1 (G 93 A) forms aggregates inside muscle mitochondria and leads to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network as well as mitochondrial depolarization. Partial depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential in normal muscle by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) caused abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics similar to that in the SOD 1 (G 93 A) model muscle. A specific mitochondrial fission inhibitor (Mdivi- 1) reversed the SOD 1 (G 93 A) action on mitochondrial dynamics, indicating SOD 1 (G 93 A) likely promotes mitochondrial fission process. Our results suggest that accumulation of mutant SOD 1 (G 93 A) inside mitochondria, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and abnormal mitochondrial dynamics are causally linked and cause intrinsic muscle pathology, which occurs early in the course of ALS and may actively promote ALS progression...|$|R
40|$|Background: HbF-Monserrato-Sassari is a newly <b>discovered</b> <b>abnormal</b> fetal {{hemoglobin}} observed in an apparently normal newborn baby during a hemoglobinopathies survey at birth in North Sardinian population. Methods: Electrophoretic {{analysis of the}} cord blood lysate evidenced for an abnormal tetramer due to a mutated fetal globin chain. Electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry and gene sequencing were used to identify the mutation. Oxygen binding ability of the variant Hb was determined. Results: Sequencing of the gamma globin genes revealed the TGT -> CGT transition at codon 93 {{in one of the}} two (G) gamma genes, which leads to the Arg for Cys amino acid replacement at position 9 of the F alpha-helix. The amino acid substitution was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis of the globin chains. Since modifications or substitutions at position beta 93 are known to affect the arrangement of a salt bridge at the alpha 1 beta 2 sliding contacts that are crucial for subunit cooperativity, the functional properties of the variant were studied to evaluate the effect of the replacement at the same position in the gamma globin chain. With respect to normal HbF, the variant showed a significant increase in oxygen affinity and a slight decrease of both Bohr effect and cooperativity. General significance: Result indicates a key role of the Cys gamma 93 residue for subunit cooperativity in the T -> R transition of the HbF tetramer. Substitutions at the F 9 position of the (G) gamma globin may result in stabilization of the high affinity R-state of the Hb tetramer. Because of the loss of Cys gamma 93 residue, this variant is considered to be potentially compromised in nitric oxide transport. 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Eighteen {{heterozygous}} {{carriers of}} <b>abnormal</b> hemoglobin were <b>discovered</b> {{in a survey}} of 23, 000 individuals in Takamatsu area by means of isoelectric focusing. Accordingly, the incidence of abnormal hemoglobin in this area is 1 / 1, 280 or 0. 08 % with a 90 % confidence interval of 1 / 900 - 1 / 2, 100. This figure is approximately 2. 7 times that in other parts of Japan (1 / 3, 620 or 0. 03 %). In eleven of the eighteen, the abnormal hemoglobin was identified as Hb Takamatsu. Five different abnormal hemoglobins were identified in the remaining seven and were reported elsewhere. Structural analysis of Hb Takamatsu by the traditional methods demonstrated a new amino acid substitution, β 12 OLys→Gln, in the initial three examples. These procedures demanded, however, a relatively large amount of sample because the filter-paper fingerprinting did not separate the abnormal βT 12 b・ 13 from βT 8 ・ 9. The author invented two new techniques of peptide mapping. One was phosphocellulose column chromatography, which proved quite efficient in the purification of the abnormal β T 12 b- 13. The other was silica gel thin-layer fingerprinting, which was superior to the conventional filter-paper method with better resolution of all tryptic peptides. The new techniques enabled rapid identification of Hb Takamatsu from only 2 ml of blood in the eight subsequent examples. A homozygote of Hb Takamatsu, the first instance of homozygosity for an abnormal hemoglobin in Japan, was discovered by family study. The homozygote was a twelve-year-old girl who appeared to have been quite healthy, and no abnormality was found in routine physical and laboratory examinations. This was to be expected from the normal oxygen affinity and stability of Hb Takamatsu. It is conjectured that Hb Takamatsu gene had occurred in a distant past, and was not subjected to natural selection, and has accumulated in the small, rather isolated area...|$|R
