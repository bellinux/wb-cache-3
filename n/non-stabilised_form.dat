40|$|An {{account is}} {{presented}} of work undertaken relating to a cyanobacterial bloom which occurs {{during the late}} Spring and Summer months in the Albert Dock at Preston in Lancashire. The causal organism {{has been identified as}} P 1 anktothrix (Oscillatoria) agardhii. Attempts at the purification of the causal organism from dock samples were only partially successful {{due to the lack of}} time available. However, the maintenance of crude cultures and axenic cultures acquired from culture collections was successfully achieved using Jaworski's Medium. MALDI TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption I tonisation Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry) was used to obtain characteristic mass spectral fingerprints of the strains analysed, which were fed into databases. The results show that it is possible to discriminate between strains of the same species and to show the relationship between the causal organism and the other available axenic cultures of Planktothrix species. A dendrogram, produced by comparing of mass spectral fingerprints of the strains is presented, which shows that two groups could be discriminated using MALDI TOF MS with the Preston Dock isolate being the most distantly related strain. Strains PCC 7805 and PCC 7811 are shown to be more closely related to the CEll Windermere strain CCAP 1459 / 23. A growth measuring technique is described in which a computer programme is used to measure the total filament length of this microorganism in a known volume of sample (rn/cm). The technique, which uses photographic images of filaments taken in a Neubauer haemocytometer, provides a method for measuring straight and curved filaments. The results show that the technique is a suitable and reliable assay method. A method for estimation chlorophyll a is described. It is used to quantify the presence of cyanobacteria in samples. The results of this technique when compared to those for measuring of filament length show that there was no direct relationship between filament length and chlorophyll a content The results of visualisation studies using fluorochromes, demonstrate the use of acridine orange (AO) and 4 ' 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) to visualise cells, and the use of propidium iodide (P 1) to identify viable cells. It is suggested that AO may be used to provide information on the physiological state of filaments at the time of sampling. These techniques were applied to assess the efficacy of a biocide preparation. A consensus of re-growth and viability experiments of biocide treated samples show that the concentration at which the stabilised biocide inhibited the growth of Planktothrix (Osdilatoria) agardhi 4 was in the range of 50 - 100 ppm, whilst the <b>non-stabilised</b> <b>form</b> was effective only in the 150 - 200 ppm range...|$|E
40|$|An aqueous {{dispersion}} of poly (acrylic acid) -stabilised cerium oxide (CeO 2) nanoparticles (PAA-CeO 2) was evaluated for its stability {{in a range}} of freshwater ecotoxicity media (MHRW, TG 201 and M 7), with and without natural organic matter (NOM). In a 15 day dispersion stability study, PAA-CeO 2 did not undergo significant aggregation in any media type. Zeta potential varied between media types and was influenced by PAA-CeO 2 concentration, but remained constant over 15 days. NOM had no influence on PAA-CeO 2 aggregation or zeta potential. The ecotoxicity of the PAA-CeO 2 dispersion was investigated in 72 h algal growth inhibition tests using the freshwater microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. PAA-CeO 2 EC 50 values for growth inhibition (GI; 0. 024 mg/L) were 2 – 3 orders of magnitude lower than pristine CeO 2 EC 50 values reported in the literature. The concentration of dissolved cerium (Ce 3 +/Ce 4 +) in PAA-CeO 2 exposure suspensions was very low, ranging between 0. 5 and 5. 6 μg/L. Free PAA concentration in the exposure solutions (0. 0096 – 0. 0384 mg/L) was significantly lower than the EC 10 growth inhibition (47. 7 mg/L) value of pure PAA, indicating that free PAA did not contribute to the observed toxicity. Elemental analysis indicated that up to 38 % of the total Cerium becomes directly associated with the algal cells during the 72 h exposure. TOF-SIMS analysis of algal cell wall compounds indicated three different modes of action, including a significant oxidative stress response to PAA-CeO 2 exposure. In contrast to pristine CeO 2 nanoparticles, which rapidly aggregate in standard ecotoxicity media, PAA-stabilised CeO 2 nanoparticles remain dispersed and available to water column species. Interaction of PAA with cell wall components, which could be responsible for the observed biomarker alterations, could not be excluded. This study indicates that the increased dispersion stability of PAA-CeO 2 leads to an increase in toxicity compared to pristine <b>non-stabilised</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} synthetic approaches towards indolizidine and pyrrolidine alkaloids. The total {{synthesis of}} indolizidine 167 B, and its epi-analogue was achieved from D-norvaline, which was converted to an a-pyrrolic ester through a refined Clauson-Kaas pyrrole synthesis. The method {{was developed by}} investigating the reaction requirements for pyrrole synthesis, and {{it was found that}} a two-step, one pot procedure is far superior to current methods. Chain homologation gave the y-pyrrolic analogue, which underwent cyclisation to form the 5 -propy 1 - 6, 7 -dihydro indolizin- 8 (5 H) -one core, which represented a formal synthesis of (-) -indolizidine 167 B. An alternate reduction strategy of this derivative was developed using a dissolving metal reduction, which allowed access to epi-indolizidine 167 B, allowing synthesis of both diastereomers from a common intermediate. This research was extended to the synthesis of higher homologues of the 5 -alkyl indolizidines by using homoserine as the starting material. Pyrrole formation, chain homologation and mesylation gave an intermediate which was elaborated to give a formal synthesis of indolizidine 209 D through cuprate chemistry. The synthesis of pyrrolidine alkaloids was also investigated using a [3 + 2] azomethine ylide cycloaddition as the ring-forming step. Investigation into diastereoselective pyrrolidine synthesis through lithium bromide mediated generation of stabilised azomethine ylides from imines and subsequent cycloaddition showed a lack of reactivity. Therefore pyrrolidine formation was achieved by in situ generation of a non-stabilised ylide through decarboxylation and subsequent cycloaddition with a dipolarophile. The <b>non-stabilised</b> ylide <b>formed</b> from N-methyl alanine and anisaldehyde underwent cycloaddition with 1, 2 - trans-bisphenylsulfonyl ethylene to give a pyrrolidine in a three component coupling reaction. Reductive desulfonation, epoxidation and ring-opening then yielded a C 3 -C 4 cis diol isomer of the alkaloid codonopsinine. A formal synthesis of (±) -codonopsinine was also achieved from N-benzyl ala nine. The azomethine ylide chemistry was further elaborated {{with the use of the}} chiral dipolarophile (-) - 8 -phenylmenthyl acrylate allowing the formal synthesis of β-proline...|$|R
