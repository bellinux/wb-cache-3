25|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and {{manufacturing}} base, although a smaller proportion of total employment is today derived from the port. Nonetheless the city {{remains one of the}} most important ports in the United Kingdom, handling over 32.2m tonnes of cargo in 2008. A new multimillion-pound expansion to the Port of Liverpool, Liverpool2, is scheduled to be operational from the end of 2015, and is projected to greatly increase the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle. Liverpool is also home to the UK headquarters of many shipping lines including Japanese firm NYK and Danish firm Maersk Line, whilst shipping firm Atlantic Container Line has recently invested significant amounts in expanding its Liverpool operations, with a new headquarters currently under construction. Future plans to redevelop the city's <b>northern</b> <b>dock</b> system, in a project known as Liverpool Waters, could see Â£5.5bn invested in the city over the next 50 years, creating 17,000 new jobs.|$|E

25|$|The three docks were {{initially}} separate, {{with the two}} <b>northern</b> <b>docks</b> interconnected only via the basin at each end, and South Dock connected via {{a series of three}} basins at the eastern end. Railway access was very difficult. Under PLA control, cuts were made to connect the three docks into a single system, and the connections to the Thames at the western end were filled, along with the Limehouse basin and with it the western connection between the two <b>northern</b> <b>docks.</b> This allowed improved road and rail access from the north and west. South Dock was also connected to the north end of Millwall Dock, its enlarged eastern lock becoming the only entrance from the Thames to the whole West India and Millwall system.|$|R

50|$|The {{best known}} {{community}} in the township is South Baymouth, the <b>northern</b> <b>docking</b> point of the MS Chi-Cheemaun passenger-car ferry which traverses the Main Channel of Georgian Bay from the community of Tobermory on the Bruce Peninsula. At the dock, the provincial Highway 6, whose southern segment ends at Tobermory, resumes and continues northward to its terminus at Highway 17 north of Espanola.|$|R
50|$|Maintaining this {{higher level}} {{requires}} {{a supply of}} water. In some cases this is available from a river flowing into the harbour. This {{was the case for}} Bristol, at least initially, with the River Frome. Where there was no such river source, a mechanical pumping station or 'impounding station' was constructed. Liverpool's <b>northern</b> <b>docks</b> were served by one at Huskisson Dock and one {{on the opposite side of}} the Mersey for Wallasey Dock.|$|R

50|$|During the 1911-1916 {{construction}} of the Lake Washington Ship Canal along Salmon Bay, about 150 acre of Smith Cove tidelands were filled with material from the dredging. The then (1911) new Port of Seattle built Fishermen's Terminal on Salmon Bay {{at the north end}} of Interbay and bought the Great <b>Northern</b> <b>docks</b> and approximately 20 acre at Smith's Cove, where they developed two new coal and lumber piers, today's Piers 90 and 91. These developments at either end of Interbay led to the increasing industrialization of the area.|$|R
50|$|Other recent {{buildings}} in the dock areas include the Echo Arena Liverpool and BT Convention Centre which officially opened on 12 January 2008 in King's Dock immediately south of Albert Dock, and West Tower (2005-07), north-east of Pier Head, which at 40 storeys is currently Liverpool's tallest building, but soon to be dwarfed by the planned skyscrapers of Liverpool Waters. Situated in the <b>northern</b> <b>docks,</b> the Liverpool Waters redeveloment led to Liverpool's recently acquired status of World Heritage Site coming under scrutiny. Consequently, in 2012, Liverpool - Maritime Mercantile City was put on UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger.|$|R

500|$|Following {{a complex}} salvage operation, {{the ship was}} {{eventually}} refloated on 18 May 1918 and moved into Sevastopol's <b>Northern</b> Dry <b>Dock</b> on 31 May, still upside down. The chaos of the Russian Revolution and Civil War, prevented further repair work, although her 130mm guns were removed. By 1923, the wooden blocks supporting her in place were rotting. [...] She was floated out and grounded in shallow water in 1923. She was approved for scrapping in June 1925 and officially stricken on 21 November 1925, although the work did not begin until 1926 when she was refloated and moved back into the dry dock. Her gun turrets, which {{had fallen out of}} the ship when she capsized, were later salvaged. Two of them were used as the 30th Coast Defense Battery defending the city during the Siege of Sevastopol in World War II.|$|R
