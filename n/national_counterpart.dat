25|$|The College Tribune {{was founded}} in 1989, with the {{assistance}} of noted political commentator Vincent Browne. Then an evening student at the university, Browne noted the lack of an independent media outlet for students and staff and set about rectifying this with the establishment of a student newspaper. The paper was initially established with links to The Sunday Tribune, though over time these links faded and ultimately, the Tribune would long outlast its <b>national</b> <b>counterpart.</b> The paper has since its inception supported itself financially through commercial advertising in its print edition. Operating under such a model allows the paper and its staff to maintain genuine editorial independence from both university authorities and the Students' Union. The Tribune has been recognised {{on a number of occasions}} at the national student media awards, particularly in sports writing, of which the paper maintains a strong tradition. In addition to winning Student Newspaper of the Year at the 1996 USI & Irish Independent Media Awards, then editor Conor Lally was also awarded Student Journalist of the Year. 2003 saw Tribune stalwart Peter Lahiff win Diversity Writer of the Year at the Guardian Student Media Awards, to-date the only Irish based recipient of a Guardian award.|$|E

40|$|During {{the early}} 1990 s, both New England and Southern California {{experienced}} regional recessions that {{were much more}} severe than the national recession of 1990 - 1991. At first glance, these regional recessions appear to be similar phenomena. However, shift-share analysis conducted at the 3 -digit Standard Industry Classification (SIC) level indicates that {{the underlying causes of}} the recessions were different. During the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, New England's manufacturing industries did not perform nearly so well as their <b>national</b> <b>counterparts</b> in creating new jobs and preventing job losses. The loss of regional competitiveness was the main factor explaining that region's recession. On the other hand, most of Southern California's industries performed about as well as their <b>national</b> <b>counterparts</b> during the recession. For Southern California, the industry structure of the region-in particular, its heavy reliance on defense-related production-contributed to the recession more than did a loss of regional competitiveness.

50|$|The Democratic Party of Hawaii {{was formed}} on April 30, 1900 by {{supporters}} of the queen {{in the wake of}} a plague quarantine in Honolulu. The meeting brought together five men: John H. Wilson, son of Marshal of the Kingdom Charles B. Wilson; John S. McGrew, a doctor and supporter of Kalākaua; Charles J. McCarthy, a saloon owner and former Honolulu Rifle; David Kawānanakoa, prince of the House of Kawānanakoa; and Delbert Evener Metzger, an engineer from Kaua'i. The group believed that it was necessary for a party in Hawaii, now a region of the US, to have a <b>national</b> <b>counterpart</b> to survive and established the Democratic Party of Hawaii. The intention of the party was to promote Jeffersonian philosophy and home rule. Following the Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, the Reform Party of Hawaii seized control of government and intended to annex Hawaii to the United States. The reformers became affiliated with the Republican Party for this support of Hawaii's annexation in contrast to the Democrats' opposition. The American Union Party became the regional Republican party in Hawaii, leaving the Democratic Party for any opposition group. The first convention of the Democratic Party of Hawaii was held on May 16 that year and was attended by 500 people. Later that year, Kawānanakoa attended the 1900 Democratic National Convention in Kansas City, becoming the first royal attendee. At the convention, Kawānanakoa formed an affiliation between the Democratic Party of Hawaii and the Democratic Party of the United States.|$|E

40|$|State {{wildlife}} conservation programs provide a strong foundation for biodiversity conservation in the United States, building on state wildlife action plans. However, states may miss {{the species that}} are at the most risk at rangewide scales, and threats such as novel diseases and climate change increasingly act at regional and national levels. Regional collaborations among states and their partners have had impressive successes, and several federal programs now incorporate state priorities. However, regional collaborations are uneven across the country, and no <b>national</b> <b>counterpart</b> exists to support efforts at that scale. A national conservation-support program could fill this gap and could work across the conservation community to identify large-scale conservation needs and support efforts to meet them. By providing important information-sharing and capacity-building services, such a program would advance collaborative conservation among the states and their partners, thus increasing both the effectiveness and the efficiency of conservation in the United States. © 2012 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

40|$|Post-disaster {{recovery}} {{is a complicated}} and dynamic socio-economic-political process, with time compression as the key feature that differentiates it from normal development procedures. The devastating Wenchuan Earthquake in China occurred on May 12, 2008, and its recovery process provides a unique case for post-disaster recovery research with its rapid reconstruction under a government-led top-down process, in particular a <b>national</b> <b>counterpart</b> assistance program. How did they recover so quickly? What were the accomplishments and risks under the tight time constraints? What decisions were made locally and by whom? And what were the key factors influencing speed and deliberation during the whole process? This thesis conducts {{a case study of}} Shuimo in Wenchuan County to address these questions. Based on a multi-disciplinary approach, this research has identified achievements in physical recovery, economic recovery, environmental improvement, and landscape enhancement. However, the top-down political system entitled the assistance groups as outsiders more power than local residents and officials in the decision making process, creating some potential costs to the disaster affected area, including a lack of consideration to the details of physical recovery...|$|E
