50|$|Nicked DNA can be {{the result}} of DNA damage or {{purposeful}} and carefully regulated biomolecular reactions carried out in the cell. DNA can be nicked by physical shearing, over-drying or enzymes. Excessive rough handling happening in pipetting or vortexing creates the physical stress that can lead to breaks and nicks in DNA. Overdrying of DNA can also break the phosphodiester bond in DNA and result in <b>nicks.</b> <b>Enzyme</b> <b>Nicking</b> endonucleases can assist with this process A single-stranded break (nick) in DNA can be formed by the hydrolysis and subsequent removal of a phosphate group within the helical backbone.

5000|$|RPA is one {{of several}} {{isothermal}} nucleic acid amplification techniques to be developed as a molecular diagnostic technique, frequently with the objective of simplifying the laboratory instrumentation required relative to PCR. A partial list of other isothermal amplification techniques include LAMP, NASBA, Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), and <b>Nicking</b> <b>Enzyme</b> Amplification Reaction (NEAR). The techniques differ in the specifics of primer design and reaction mechanism, and in some cases (like RPA) make use of cocktails of two or more enzymes. Like RPA, many of these techniques offer rapid amplification times with the potential for simplified instrumentation, and reported resistance to substances in unpurified samples that are known to inhibit PCR. With respect to amplification time, {{it should be noted that}} modern thermocyclers with rapid temperature ramps can reduce PCR amplification times to less than 30 minutes, particularly for short amplicons using dual-temperature cycling rather than the conventional three-temperature protocols. [...] In addition, the demands of sample prep (including lysis and extraction of DNA or RNA, if necessary) should be considered as part of the overall time and complexity inherent to the technique. These requirements vary according to the technique as well as to the specific target and sample type.|$|E

40|$|Changing enzymatic {{function}} through {{genetic engineering}} still presents {{a challenge to}} molecular biologists. Here we present an example in which changing the oligomerization state of an enzyme changes its function. Type IIs restriction endonucleases such as AlwI usually fold into two separate domains: a DNA-binding domain and a catalytic/dimerization domain. We have swapped the putative dimerization domain of AlwI with a nonfunctional dimerization domain from a <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme,</b> N. BstNBI. The resulting chimeric enzyme, N. AlwI, no longer forms a dimer. Interestingly, the monomeric N. AlwI still recognizes the same sequence as AlwI but only cleaves the DNA strand containing the sequence 5 ′-GGATC- 3 ′ (top strand). In contrast, the wild-type AlwI exists as a dimer in solution and cleaves two DNA strands; the top strand is cleaved by an enzyme binding to that sequence, and its complementary bottom strand is cleaved by the second enzyme dimerized with the first enzyme. N. AlwI is unable to form a dimer and therefore nicks DNA as a monomer. In addition, the engineered <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{is at least as}} active as the wild-type AlwI and is thus a useful enzyme. To our knowledge, this is the first report of creating a <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme</b> by domain swapping...|$|E

40|$|Molecular beacons {{represent}} {{a new family}} of fluorescent probes for nucleic acids, and have found broad applications in recent years due to their unique advantages over traditional probes. Detection of nucleic acids using molecular beacons {{has been based on}} hybridization between target molecules and molecular beacons in a 1 : 1 stoichiometric ratio. The stoichiometric hybridization, however, puts an intrinsic limitation on detection sensitivity, because one target molecule converts only one beacon molecule to its fluorescent form. To increase the detection sensitivity, a conventional strategy has been target amplification through polymerase chain reaction. Instead of target amplification, here we introduce a scheme of signal amplification, <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme</b> signal amplification, to increase the detection sensitivity of molecular beacons. The mechanism of the signal amplification lies in target-dependent cleavage of molecular beacons by a DNA <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme,</b> through which one target DNA can open many beacon molecules, giving rise to amplification of fluorescent signal. Our results indicate that one target DNA leads to cleavage of hundreds of beacon molecules, increasing detection sensitivity by nearly three orders of magnitude. We designed two versions of signal amplification. The basic version, though simple, requires that <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme</b> recognition sequence be present in the target DNA. The extended version allows detection of target of any sequence by incorporating rolling circle amplification. Moreover, the extended version provides one additional level of signal amplification, bringing the detection limit down to tens of femtomolar, nearly five orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional hybridization assay...|$|E

These enzymes are potentially valuable tools for targeted gene correction and genome engineering. We have engineered {{a variant of}} the I-AniI homing endonuclease that nicks its cognate target site. This variant contains a mutation of a basic residue essential for proton transfer and solvent activation in one active site. The cleavage mechanism, DNA-binding affinity, and substrate specificity profile of the nickase are similar to the wild-type enzyme. I-AniI nickase stimulates targeted gene correction in human cells, in cis and in trans, at ≈ 1 / 4 the efficiency of the wild-type enzyme.

40|$|A simple {{isothermal}} nucleic-acid amplification reaction, primer generation–rolling circle amplification (PG–RCA), {{was developed}} to detect specific nucleic-acid sequences of sample DNA. This amplification method is achievable at a constant temperature (e. g. 60 °C) simply by mixing circular single-stranded DNA probe, DNA polymerase and <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme.</b> Unlike conventional nucleic-acid amplification reactions such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), this reaction does not require exogenous primers, which often cause primer dimerization or non-specific amplification. Instead, ‘primers’ are generated and accumulated during the reaction. The circular probe carries only two sequences: (i) a hybridization sequence to the sample DNA and (ii) a recognition sequence of the <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme.</b> In PG–RCA, the circular probe first hybridizes with the sample DNA, and then a cascade reaction of linear rolling circle amplification and nicking reactions takes place. In contrast with conventional linear rolling circle amplification, the signal amplification is in an exponential mode since many copies of ‘primers’ are successively produced by multiple nicking reactions. Under the optimized condition, we obtained a remarkable sensitivity of 84. 5 ymol (50. 7 molecules) of synthetic sample DNA and 0. 163 pg (∼ 60 molecules) of genomic DNA from Listeria monocytogenes, indicating strong applicability of PG–RCA to various molecular diagnostic assays...|$|E

For this purpose, DNA labelled in the AP sites was first cleaved by rat-liver AP endonuclease, then with the 3 ' nicking catalyst in the presence of thioglycolate and the reaction products were analyzed on DEAE-Sephadex: deoxyribose- 5 -phosphate (indicating a 3 ' cleavage by hydrolysis) and the thioglycolate:unsaturated sugar- 5 -phosphate adduct (indicating a cleavage by beta-elimination) are well separated allowing to eventually easily discard the hypothesis of a hydrolytic process and the appellation of 3 ' AP endonuclease. We have shown that addition of thioglycolate to the unsaturated sugar resulting from nicking the C(3 ') -O-P bond 3 ' to AP sites by beta-elimination is an irreversible reaction.

The remarkable observation that rabbit muscle triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) can be multiply nicked by subtilisin and efficiently religated in the presence of an organic solvent formed the stimulus for our study on a homologous system, Plasmodium falciparum triosephosphate isomerase (PfTIM). ResultsThe subtilisin nicked form of PfTIM was prepared by limited proteolysis using subtilisin and the major fragments identified using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The order of susceptibility of the peptide bonds in the protein was also determined. The structure of the nicked form of TIM was investigated using circular dichroism, fluorescence and gel filtration. The <b>nicked</b> <b>enzyme</b> exhibited remarkable stability to denaturants, although significant differences were observed with the wild-type enzyme. Efficient religation could be achieved by addition of an organic cosolvent, such as acetonitrile, in the presence of subtilisin.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{quality of}} {{chemically}} synthesized oligonucleotides falls with {{the length of}} the oligonucleotide, not least due to depurinations and premature termination during production. This limits the use of long oligonucleotides in assays where long high-quality oligonucleotides are needed (e. g. padlock probes). Another problem with chemically synthesized oligonucleotides is that secondary structures contained within an oligonucleotide reduce the efficiency of HPLC and/or PAGE purification. Additionally, ligation of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides is less efficient than the ligation of enzymatically produced DNA molecules. Results Chemically synthesized oligonucleotides with hairpin structures were acquired from our standard supplier. The stem of the hairpin contained recognition sequences for the Nt. Alw I <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme</b> and the Mly I restriction enzyme. These double stranded regions were positioned in a way to allow self-templated circularization of the oligonucleotide. Following ligation, tandem repeats of the complementary sequence of the circular oligonucleotide could be produced through rolling circle DNA synthesis. By running successive rounds of ligation, rolling circle DNA synthesis, and nicking, the original oligonucleotide could be amplified as either the (+) -strand or the (-) -strand. Alternatively, the hairpin structure could be removed by cleavage with the Mly I restriction enzyme, thereby releasing the oligonucleotide sequence contained within the hairpin structure from the hairpin. Conclusion We present here a method for the enzymatic production through DNA amplification of oligonucleotides with freely designable 5 '-ends and 3 '-ends, using hairpin-containing self-templating oligonucleotides. The hairpin comprises recognition sequences for a <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme</b> and a restriction enzyme. The oligonucleotides are amplified by successive rounds of ligation, rolling circle DNA synthesis and nicking. Furthermore, the hairpin can be removed by cleavage with the Mly I restriction enzyme.

This derivative, called thermolysin S, was isolated by gel filtration in approximately 80 % yield and then separated from some residual intact thermolysin by an affinity chromatographic step on Sepharose-Gly-D-Phe. It was found that thermolysin S results from a tight association of two polypeptide fragments of apparent Mr of 24000 and 10000. Dissociation of the complex was achieved under strong denaturing conditions, such as gel filtration on a column equilibrated and eluted with 5 M guanidine hydrochloride. The positions of the clip sites were defined by amino acid analysis, end-group determination, and amino acid sequencing of the isolated fragments and shown to lie between Thr- 4 and Ser- 5, between Thr- 224 and Gln- 225, and also between Gln- 225 and Asp- 226. Thermolysin S, which is therefore a stable complex of fragments 5 - 224 (225) and 225 (226) - 316, shows a shift in optimum pH of about 1 unit toward the acid range with respect to intact thermolysin and a Km essentially unchanged, with furylacryloyl-Gly-Leu-NH 2 as substrate.

40|$|The {{technologies}} {{associated with}} DNA sequencing are rapidly evolving. Indeed, single-molecule DNA sequencing strategies are cheaper {{and faster than}} ever before. Despite this progress, every sequencing platform to date relies on reading the genome in small, abstract fragments, typically of less than 1000 bases in length. The overarching aim of the optical map is to complement the information derived from DNA sequencing by providing long-range context on which these short sequence reads can be built. This is typically done using an enzyme to target and modify at short DNA sequences of, say, six bases in length throughout the genome. By accurately placing these short pieces of sequence on long genomic DNA fragments, up to several millions of bases in length, a scaffold for sequence assembly can be obtained. This review focuses on three enzymatic approaches to optical mapping. Optical mapping was first developed using restriction enzymes to sequence-specifically cleave DNA that is immobilized on a surface. More recently, <b>nicking</b> <b>enzymes</b> have found application in the sequence-specific fluorescent labeling of DNA for optical mapping. Such covalent modification allows the DNA to be imaged in solution, and this, in combination with developing nanofluidic technologies, is enabling new high-throughput approaches to mapping.

We have purified and partially characterized these two enzymes, and analyzed {{the genes that}} encode them. BsrDI and BtsI are unusual in two respects: each cleaves DNA as a heterodimer of one large subunit (B subunit) and one small subunit (A subunit); and, {{in the absence of}} their small subunits, the large subunits behave as sequence-specific DNA <b>nicking</b> <b>enzymes</b> and only <b>nick</b> the bottom strand of the sequences at these respective positions: GCAATG (−/ 0) and GCAGTG (−/ 0). We refer to the single subunit, the bottom-strand nicking forms as ‘hemidimers’. Amino acid sequence comparisons reveal that BsrDI and BtsI belong to a family of restriction enzymes that possess two catalytic sites: a canonical PD-Xn-EXK and a second non-canonical PD-Xn-E-X 12 -QR. Interestingly, the other family members, which include BsrI (ACTGG 1 /− 1) and BsmI/Mva 1269 I (GAATGC 1 /− 1) are single polypeptide chains, i. e. monomers, rather than heterodimers. In BsrDI and BtsI, the two catalytic sites are found in two separate subunits. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the canonical catalytic site located at the N-terminus of the large subunit is responsible for the bottom-strand cleavage, whereas the non-canonical catalytic site located in the small subunit is responsible for hydrolysis of the top strand.

40|$|Abstract — The current {{most popular}} and {{established}} approach to DNA logic circuits is the implementation by DNA strands reaction networks where toehold-mediated strand displacement invokes and performs the evaluation of each DNA logic gate. Strand displacement approach requires, however, {{a large amount of}} time, for instance, approximately 30 minutes, to execute a logic operation ([18]). Furthermore, the concentration of an output molecule released from a gate can not exceed that of the gate molecule. Therefore, it is often the case that large quantities of input and gate molecules are required when the gate is of large out-degree. In order to overcome these problems, it is indispensable to devise a DNA logic gate which runs quickly and can amplify the quantity of the output molecule. We will propose a DNA implementation of logic gates with such good properties using DNA polymerase and <b>nicking</b> <b>enzyme...</b>|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{modification}} of a chromosomal locus to replace an existing dysfunctional allele with a corrected sequence {{can be accomplished}} through targeted gene correction using the cell’s homologous recombination (HR) machinery. Gene targeting is stimulated by generation of a DNA double-strand break (DSB) {{at or near the}} site of correction, but repair of the break via non-homologous end-joining without using the homologous template can lead to deleterious genomic changes such as in/del mutations, or chromosomal rearrangements. By contrast, generation of a DNA single-strand break (SSB), or nick, can stimulate gene correction without the problems of DSB repair because the uncut DNA strand acts as a template to permit healing without alteration of genetic material. Here, we examine the ability of a nicking variant of the I-SceI endonuclease (K 223 I I-SceI) to stimulate gene targeting in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in human embryonic kidney (HEK- 293) cells. K 223 I I-SceI is proficient in both yeast and human cells and promotes gene correction up to 12 -fold. We show that K 223 I I-SceI-driven recombination follows a different mechanism than wild-type I-SceI-driven recombination, thus indicating that the initial DNA break that stimulates recombination is not a low-level DSB but a nick. We also demonstrate that K 223 I I-SceI efficiently elevates gene targeting at loci distant from the break site in yeast cells. These findings establish the capability of the I-SceI nickase to enhance recombination in yeast and human cells, strengthening the notion that <b>nicking</b> <b>enzymes</b> could be effective tools in gene correction strategies for applications in molecular biology, biotechnology...|$|R
40|$|The enzyme CoA {{transferase}} (succinyl-CoA: 3 -ketoacid coenzyme A transferase [3 -oxoacid CoA transferase], EC 2. 8. 3. 5) {{is essential}} for the metabolism of ketone bodies in the mammalian mitochondrion. It is known that its catalytic mechanism involves the transient thioesterification of an active-site glutamate residue by CoA. As a means of identifying this glutamate within the sequence, we have made use of a fortuitous autolytic fragmentation that occurs at the active site when the enzyme-CoA covalent intermediate is heated. The presence of protease inhibitors has no effect on the extent of cleavage detectable by SDS-PAGE, supporting the view that this fragmentation is indeed autolytic. This fragmentation can be carried out on intact CoA transferase, as well as on a proteolytically nicked but active form of the enzyme. Because the resulting C-terminal fragment is blocked at its N-terminus by a pyroglutamate moiety, it is not amenable to direct sequencing by the Edman degradation method. As an alternative, we have studied a peptide (peptide D) generated specifically by autolysis of the <b>nicked</b> <b>enzyme</b> and predicted to have an N-terminus corresponding to the site of proteolysis and a C-terminus determined by the site of autolysis. This peptide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and subsequently characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry.

Since radioresistance was transferred to murine cells (NIH- 3 T 3) when the aberrant c-raf- 1 gene from this family was transfected, we also examined transformants containing this and other oncogenes. V-raf/c-myc and EJ-ras transformants were examined, the former because the family's skin fibroblasts also have 3 - 8 -fold elevated myc expression (not apparently relevant to radioresistance) and the latter because ras, like raf, conveys radioresistance. The family members' fibroblasts and the three transfected murine lines, showed a similar perturbation of a spermidine and ATP-dependent DNA catenation activity (typical of DNA topoisomerase II). There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0. 93; P = 0. 0026) between the degree of activation of topoisomerase II and one measure of radioresistance (the Dq value). Relaxation of DNA supercoiling (topoisomerase I activity and other DNA <b>nicking</b> <b>enzymes)</b> was not abnormal. Cytotoxicity assays and evaluation of the influence of topoisomerase II inhibitors on DNA/protein complex formation, corroborated the existence of a qualitative topoisomerase II defect in the family's cells and transfectants. Although the contention that the qualitative topoisomerase II abnormalities observed here may be associated with malfunction is highly speculative, these findings may be relevant to the mechanism of oncogenesis, not only in this family, but with raf and ras type oncogenes...|$|R
