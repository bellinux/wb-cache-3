5|$|In a {{collaboration}} with Kliment Voroshilov, Molotov contributed both musically and lyrically to the 1944 {{version of the}} Soviet national anthem. Molotov asked the writers to include a line or two about peace. Molotov's and Voroshilov's role {{in the making of}} the <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> anthem was, in the words of historian Simon Sebag-Montefiore, acting as music judges for Stalin.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution of 1917, {{many of the}} Bolsheviks who {{had been}} {{involved}} in the robbery gained political power in the <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Lenin went on to become its first premier until his death in 1924, followed by Stalin until his death in 1953. Maxim Litvinov became a Soviet diplomat, serving as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs (1930–1939). Leonid Krasin initially quit politics after the split from Lenin in 1909, but rejoined the Bolsheviks after the 1917 Revolution and served as the Soviet trade representative in London and as People's Commissar for Foreign Trade until his death in 1926.|$|E

50|$|After {{the first}} German {{experiences}} with the <b>newer</b> <b>Soviet</b> tanks like the T-34 or the Kliment Voroshilov tank during Operation Barbarossa, {{the need for a}} Panzerjäger capable of destroying these more heavily armoured tanks became clear.|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s, over 1.5 million {{troops from}} both sides were {{stationed}} along the Sino-Soviet border. At the time the best Chinese tanks were hopelessly out-matched by <b>newer</b> <b>Soviet</b> designs like the T-62, T-64, and T-72.|$|R
5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing to}} cooperate. Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Due to his partial {{defense of}} Khrushchev during his ouster, Mikoyan lost his high {{standing}} with the <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> leadership. The Politburo forced Mikoyan to retire from his seat in the Politburo due to old age. Mikoyan quickly also lost his post as head of state and was succeeded in this post by Nikolai Podgorny on 9 December 1965. Brezhnev officialised Mikoyan's retirement by awarding him an Order of Lenin.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E
50|$|The Israel Defense Forces used TOW {{missiles}} {{during the}} 1982 Lebanon War. On 11 July Israeli anti-tank teams {{armed with the}} TOW ambushed Syrian armored forces and claiming destroyed 11 Syrian Soviet-made T-72 tanks. This was probably the first encounter of the American anti-tank missile with the <b>newer</b> <b>Soviet</b> tank.|$|R
50|$|This encounter, {{along with}} {{previous}} actions between the Meteors and MiGs, highlighted the inferiority of the Meteor in aerial combat against the <b>newer</b> <b>Soviet</b> aircraft and No. 77 Squadron was subsequently reassigned to ground attack. It {{was also the}} only engagement {{during the course of}} the war in which Australia and the Soviet Union directly clashed in battle.|$|R

5|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> tanks {{such as the}} T-80B during the late 1970s and early 1980s demanded {{the development of new}} technologies and weapons to counter the threat posed to Western armor. The T-80B had increased firepower and a new composite ceramic armor. The T-72 also went through a modernization program in an attempt to bring it up to the standards of the T-80B. In 1985 the new T-72B version entered production, with a new laminate armor protection system; its turret armor, designed primarily to defeat anti-tank missiles, surpassed the T-80B's in protection.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> leader {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E
5|$|However, Red Army {{resistance}} {{had slowed}} the Wehrmacht. When, on 10 October the Germans arrived {{within sight of}} the Mozhaisk line west of Moscow, they encountered another defensive barrier manned by <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> forces. That same day, Georgy Zhukov, who had been recalled from the Leningrad Front on 6 October, took charge of Moscow's defense and the combined Western and Reserve Fronts, with Colonel General Ivan Konev as his deputy. On 12 October, he ordered the concentration of all available forces on a strengthened Mozhaisk line, a move supported by Vasilevsky. The Luftwaffe still controlled the sky wherever it appeared, and Stuka and bomber groups flew 537 sorties, destroying some 440 vehicles and 150 artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolsheviks, and Russia became part of the <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. As the promotion of state atheism was a part of Marxist–Leninist ideology, the Soviet government ordered many churches closed. The Peter and Paul parish was formally dissolved by the communist government in 1929, and celebrating Mass was forbidden. The church lost much of its surrounding gardens in 1935—a school was built there the following year—and the church was finally closed on 30 July 1938 (the St. Peter and Paul church had met the same fate nine days earlier). The church was plundered after its closure, and many items, including the main altar and the organ, were irretrievably lost. The church was used for several months as a vegetable store, and was then reconstructed as a hostel and its interior divided into four floors.|$|E
5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July the Soviet Southwestern and Southern Fronts {{launched}} a major offensive across the Mius and Donets Rivers against the southern wing of Army Group South, pressing upon the 6th Army and 1st Panzer Army. In {{the early afternoon}} of 17 July, Operation Roland was terminated with an order for the II SS-Panzer Corps to begin withdrawing from the Prokhorovka sector back to Belgorod. The 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf anticipated the order and began executing it {{as early as the}} evening of 16 July. Leibstandartes tanks were distributed between Das Reich and Totenkopf, and the division was hastily redeployed to Italy, while Das Reich and Totenkopf were dispatched south to meet the <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> offensives.|$|E
50|$|Organization and {{training}} for all services closely adhered to the Soviet model, and Soviet advisers were present at all levels down to battalion. Although much of the equipment {{and most of the}} weapons were initially of German World War II vintage, there was an increasingly rapid introduction of <b>newer</b> <b>Soviet</b> matériel. In a move to assert a separate identity, the East German leadership introduced unique uniforms, similar to the Soviet field uniforms, to differentiate the armed forces from the police forces.|$|R

5|$|The {{rift between}} Khrushchev's Soviet {{government}} and North Vietnam was clearly obvious in August 1964, when the Soviet Union responded {{in a relatively}} muted fashion after the U.S. conducted air strikes against North Vietnamese Navy bases {{in retaliation for the}} Tonkin Gulf incident. Despite the Soviets’ lack of response, the North Vietnamese leadership restrained itself from criticizing the Soviet government, as they were still hoping that Khrushchev would supply North Vietnam with the anti-aircraft weapons required to defend against further U.S. air attacks. However, the event which occurred in Moscow in October 1964 worked in North Vietnam's favor, as Khrushchev was removed from power. Keen to counteract Chinese influence in the region, a <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> government led by Alexei Kosygin sought to end a defense pact with North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} set in a world with an {{alternate}} history, where magic exists and has been polished through modern technology. However, the ability to use magic is determined by genetics, limiting the amount of magicians in existence. Following the Third World War, the world's superpowers shifted to these four nations: The United States of North America (USNA), <b>New</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan. In Japan, the magic community is informally governed by the ten master clans in lieu of the government. Due to the limited amount of magicians, they are treated as commodity and are forced to enter magic related schools and professions. Nine magic high schools exist in Japan; they each specialize in different aspects of magic and are simply referred to by their numbers.|$|E
5|$|Things {{changed in}} the early 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 Minuteman {{missiles}} and 54 Titan IIs. This meant that the Air Force could not respond to <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> missiles simply by building more of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions {{about the need for}} any ground-based ICBM. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not do. If the force was going to carry out this mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet attack for a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the weapon}} {{was not able}} to {{penetrate}} <b>newer</b> <b>Soviet</b> tanks like the T-34 and KV-1, it still proved to be quite effective against bunker loopholes/embrasures, long range targets, and even aircraft. A fully automatic version of the L39 was made in small numbers that served as an anti-aircraft gun. Other good targets were snipers, and several weak spots on tanks, such as open top hatches, especially with phosphorus ammunition. It was even able to damage tank turrets and pin them to stop traversal of the cannon.|$|R

5|$|During his convalescence, he {{was visited}} by the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Generalleutnant Adolf Galland, who offered Graf command {{of his old}} unit, JG52. Graf {{accepted}} {{with the proviso that}} his Roten Jäger football team went with him. Once criticized for its low scoring rate early in the war, it was now the pre-eminent Geschwader, with over 10,000 victories. His return was celebrated with a welcome dinner at its headquarters in Kraków, southern Poland, on 20 September 1944. He was officially appointed on 1 October. Ongoing weakness in his left arm kept Graf on the ground. In the two years since he had left the Eastern Front, {{the quantity and quality of}} the Soviet pilots had greatly improved, as had their equipment. For the remainder of the war he oversaw his three separated fighter groups shuttled up and down the front, in emergency responses to each <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> offensive. Several times the crews had to evacuate as Soviet tanks and artillery were shelling their airfield. The German fuel crisis severely curtailed the amount of flight-time. Consequently, the November total for the wing of only 369 Soviet aircraft shot down was the lowest monthly total of the eastern campaign. As the winter weather got worse, the lull allowed Graf to organise a football match between his Roten Jäger and a local Kraków team, watched by 20,000 German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The CIA {{began to}} {{investigate}} the disappearances of its agents, initially suspecting that bad tradecraft, a Soviet breach of Moscow Station or the CIA's communications, or a mole {{was responsible for the}} disaster. Suspicions fell on spy dust (METKA), a KGB compromise of CIA cables, or <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> surveillance tactics, but these probes proved unsuccessful. Ames' conspicuous spending drew the attention of the molehunters in late 1989, but he passed a polygraph test. However, the molehunt regained momentum in 1991 as it received more officers to work on the case. Attention focused on Ames and other suspects, and his finances were investigated once more in 1992; in August, the investigators linked Ames' bank deposits with his meetings with the Soviets. In March 1993, the molehunter unit concluded that there was a KGB mole within the CIA who had followed Howard, and the FBI began close surveillance of Ames, monitoring his office and home, and tracking his car. A June 25 search of his office found about 144 classified documents unrelated to his work; an analysis of his finances found an unexplained $1,326,310; and subsequent searches of Ames' trash and residence found further documents on CIA operations and agents, as well as Ames' own espionage for the KGB. On February 21, 1994, Ames and his wife, Rosario, were arrested by FBI agents: The duo pled guilty to espionage, and the Senate Intelligence Committee requested that the CIA's Inspector General review the case.|$|E
5|$|The final major {{campaign}} {{in which the}} PanzerI formed {{a large portion of}} the armoured strength was Operation Barbarossa, 22June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 PanzerI's. By the end of the month, {{a large portion of the}} Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket, and by 21September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany's armour in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers were shocked to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the T-34 and KV series. Army Group North quickly realized that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could penetrate the thick armour of the KV-1. The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of <b>new</b> <b>Soviet</b> tanks made it obvious the PanzerI was not suitable for this front. Some less battle-worthy PanzerIs were tasked with towing lorries through mud to alleviate logistics problems at the front.|$|E
