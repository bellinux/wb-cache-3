This is consistent with results of Waldock and Jones (1986) and can be related with the increased HF reflection height during the nighttime in comparison with daytime. Velocity of GW propagating upward {{is expected to increase}} with altitude to compensate for the decreasing atmospheric density (Hines 1960). On the other hand, GWs with longer wavelength/period are less attenuated and can propagate for longer times and reach greater heights before their dissipation (Vadas 2007). As one can see in Fig.  4 (left column), there is the same local time tendency for Hok-E, but the parameters increase from the daytime minima to the evening/morning hours. The obtained velocities and wavelengths of Hok-E are less than those of Hok-F approximately by a factor of 2.|$|R

40|$|The primary {{measure of}} the quality of sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) fields obtained from satellite-borne infrared sensors has been the bias and variance of matchups with co-located in-situ values. Because such matchups tend to be widely separated, these bias and variance estimates are not necessarily a good measure of small scale (several pixels) gradients in these fields because one of the primary contributors to the uncertainty in satellite retrievals is atmospheric contamination, which tends to have large spatial scales compared with the pixel separation of infrared sensors. Hence, there is not a good measure to use in selecting SST fields appropriate for the study of submesoscale processes and, in particular, of processes associated with near-surface fronts, both of which have recently seen a rapid increase in interest. In this study, two methods are examined to address this problem, one based on spectra of the SST data and the other on their variograms. To evaluate the methods, instrument noise was estimated in Level- 2 VIIRS and AVHRR SST fields of the Sargasso Sea. The two methods provided very nearly identical results for AVHRR: along-scan <b>values</b> <b>of</b> approximately 0. 18 K for both day and night and along-track <b>values</b> <b>of</b> 0. 21 K also for day and night. By contrast, the instrument noise estimated for VIIRS varied by method, scan geometry and day-night. Specifically, daytime, along-scan (along-track), spectral estimates were found to be approximately 0. 05 K (0. 08 K) and the corresponding <b>nighttime</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> 0. 02 K (0. 03 K). Daytime estimates based on the variogram were found to be 0. 08 K (0. 10 K) with the corresponding <b>nighttime</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> 0. 04 K (0. 06 K). Taken together: AVHRR instrument noise is significantly larger than VIIRS instrument noise, along-track noise is larger than along-scan noise and daytime levels are higher than nighttime levels. Given the similarity of results and the less stringent preprocessing requirements, the variogram is the preferred method although there is a suggestion that this approach overestimates the noise for high quality data in dynamically quiet regions. Finally, simulations of the impact of noise on the determination of SST gradients show that on average the gradient magnitude for typical ocean gradients will be accurately estimated with VIIRS but substantially overestimated with AVHRR...|$|R

A Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter is applied to remove the short-term component from the raw time series <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and meteorological variables. Regression models are developed in order to produce meteorologically adjusted ozone time series, involving the noise-free temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed as independent variables. The analysis verifies that the meteorological adjustment provides better results on estimating ozone's trend, which is found to be increasing (alpha = 0. 001) with an annual rate of 1. 34 +/- 0. 07 mu g/m(3). This trend could mainly be attributed to policy and changes in the emissions <b>of</b> <b>ozone's</b> precursors. Additionally, the short-term component <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> concentration is also meteorologically adjusted {{and its impact on the}} trend is examined. The analysis shows that its contribution is of minor importance when the ozone trend is adjusted by temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. Moreover, the sea breeze circulation system that is frequently developed in the area influences the short-term and seasonal ozone variation, and therefore, it should be taken into account when producing meteorologically adjusted time series. The study's conclusions could be exploited by environmental and agricultural authorities in order to develop their long-term strategies towards the air quality management...|$|R

Because of the increased ambient oxygen density, the glow is more intense in the daytime. The daytime production efficiency, meausured in Rayleighs per oxygen atom, {{is similar to the}} <b>nighttime</b> <b>value.</b> No dependence <b>of</b> the glow intensity on the ambient plasma density was found.

40|$|International audienceWe present {{observations}} <b>of</b> {{unusually high}} <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and N 2 O {{in the middle}} stratosphere that were observed by the airborne submillimeter radiometer ASUR in the Arctic. The observations {{took place in the}} meteorological situation of a major stratospheric warming that occurred in mid-January 2003 and was dominated by a wave 2 event. On 23 January 2003 the observed N 2 O and O 3 mixing ratios around 69 ° N in the middle stratosphere reached maximum <b>values</b> <b>of</b> ~ 190 ppb and ~ 10 ppm, respectively. The similarities of these N 2 O profiles in a potential temperature range between 800 and 1200 K with N 2 O observations around 20 ° N on 1 March 2003 by the same instrument suggest that the observed Arctic airmasses were transported from the tropics by isentropic transport. Using a linearized ozone chemistry model along idealized trajectories at different altitudes transport times between about 3 and 7 days are estimated from the difference between the Arctic and tropical O 3 mixing ratios observed in this potential temperature range. PV distributions suggest that these airmasses did not stay confined in the Arctic region which makes it unlikely that this dynamical situation lead to the formation of dynamically caused pockets <b>of</b> low <b>ozone...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring the MINOS {{campaign}} (28 July- 18 August 2001) the nitrate (NO 3) radical {{was measured}} at Finokalia station, {{on the north}} coast of Crete in South-East Europe using a long path (10. 4 km) Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy instrument (DOAS). Hydroxyl (OH) radical was also measured by a Chemical Ionization Mass-Spectrometer (Berresheim et al., 2003). These datasets represent the first simultaneous measurements of OH and NO 3 radicals in the area. NO 3 radical concentrations ranged from less than 3 x 10 7 up to 9 x 10 8 radicals· cm - 3 with an average <b>nighttime</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> 1. 1 x 10 8 radicals· cm - 3. The observed NO 3 mixing ratios are analyzed {{on the basis of}} the corresponding meteorological data and the volatile organic compound (VOC) observations which were measured simultaneously at Finokalia station. The importance of the NO 3 radical chemistry relatively to that of OH in the dimethylsulfide (DMS) and nitrate cycles is also investigated. The observed NO 3 levels regulate the nighttime variation of DMS. The loss of DMS by NO 3 during night is about 75 % of that by OH radical during day. NO 3 and nitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5) reactions account for about 21 % of the total nitrate (HNO 3 (g) +NO - 3 (g)) production...|$|R
40|$|HVAC filters have a {{significant}} influence on indoor air quality. In addition to removing particulate contaminants, filters accumulate a particle layer that can react with ozone. Ozone-particle cake reactions serve as a sink for ozone {{and a source of}} secondary carbonyls. The location of filters in air distribution systems can lead to byproducts being distributed throughout a building. Two experiments were performed to determine the ozone removal efficiency on two residential filters that were loaded with particles for one month (# 1) and three months (# 2). On both filters, the ozone removal efficiency dropped rapidly during the first 30 minutes and then stayed approximately constant for 4 hours. The steady state <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> removal efficiency were 10 % for Filter # 1 and 14 % for Filter # 2 at a face velocity of 0. 81 cm/s. The potential for HVAC filters to affect ozone concentrations in residential buildings was evaluated using a well-mixed reactor model. The tested filters reduced indoor ozone levels slightly when compared to indoor surfaces and an entire HVAC system, although the impact was much smaller than that of the air exchange rate. The influence of continuous particle deposition was not considered here, but would likely increase the impact <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> interactions on HVAC filters...|$|R
