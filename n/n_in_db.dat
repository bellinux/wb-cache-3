40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel region-based video coding {{technique}} using a multiscale image segmentation method thus obtaining better quality {{at the same}} bit rate. In most of the previous region-based video coding techniques, occlusion caused degradation {{in terms of both}} PSNR and perceptual video quality. We propose a new motion estimation and compensation algorithm which solves occlusion related problems effectively. The proposed motion estimation and compensation is a two stage procedure: the first stage uses U coarse motion model while the second stage uses a dense motion model. The coarse motion model generates region level motion vectors which are then fine tuned by the dense motion model which produces pixel level motion vectors. A fusion of these concepts leads to a gain of 2 <b>N</b> 3 <b>dB</b> <b>in</b> PSNR over the block-bused algorithm for a variety of test sequences using a fully functional video coder. ...|$|R

40|$|The mutant sigA allele of Bacillus subtilis DB 1005 was {{confirmed}} to be temperature sensitive (ts) and transferable among strains of B. subtilis by chromosomal transformation and gene conversion. This ts sigA allele had a pleiotropic effect on gene expression of DB 1005. The induction of certain heat shock proteins <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 1005 was markedly less significant than that {{observed in the}} wild-type strain (DB 2) under heat stress. In contrast, some proteins required for coping with oxidative stress and glucose starvation were induced abruptly <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 1005 but not <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 2. Heat induction of the groEL gene in vivo at both transcription and translation levels was much lower <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 1005 than <b>in</b> <b>DB</b> 2. Besides, the putative sigma A-type promoter from the groESL operon of B. subtilis {{was able to be}} transcribed by the reconstituted sigma A RNA polymerase in vitro at both 37 and 49 degrees C. These results strongly suggest that the expression of the groEL gene of B. subtilis under heat stress is regulated at least in part by sigma A at the level of transcription. Our results also showed that DB 1005 did not respond too differently from the wild type to ethanol stress, except after a relatively long exposure...|$|R
